FAQ
How does this work?

This service lives on Cloud Run and uses google/go-containerregistry for registry interactions.

Isn't this expensive to run?
Not really! Ingress is cheap, Cloud Run is cheap, and GCS is cheap.
To avoid paying for egress, I limit the amount of data that I'll serve directly and instead give you a command you can run on your own machine.
The most expensive part of this is actually the domain name.
Isn't this expensive for the registry?
Not really! The first time a layer is accessed, I download and index it. Browsing the filesystem just uses that index, and opening a file uses Range requests to load small chunks of the layer as needed.
Since I only have to download the whole layer once, this actually reduces traffic to the registry in a lot of cases, e.g. if you share a link with someone rather than having them pull the whole image on their machine.
In fact, Docker has graciously sponsored this service by providing me an account with unlimited public Docker Hub access. Thanks, Docker!
That can't be true, gzip doesn't support random access!

That's not a question.

Okay then, how does random access work if the layers are gzipped tarballs?
Great question! See here.
Tl;dr, you can seek to an arbitrary position in a gzip stream if you know the 32KiB of uncompressed data that comes just before it, so by storing ~1% of the uncompressed layer size, I can jump ahead to predetermined locations and start reading from there rather than reading the entire layer.
Thanks @aidansteele!
Is this open source?
Yes! See here.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
I have great news to share: After three months of fighting, our Chatbox app is finally back on the U.S. App Store! 🎉
What happened?
In April 2025, another company with an app of the same name filed a dispute with Apple, claiming they held a trademark for the word “Chatbox.”
I believe this claim was baseless, because:
"Chatbox" is a widely used, generic word across the internet, and their trademark application had already been initially rejected by the USPTO.
We were the first to use “Chatbox” as the name for AI software, starting in March 2023 right here on GitHub.
However, Apple’s legal team accepted their claim and removed our app from the store on June 17.
Taking legal action
We decided to take the matter to federal court. The court ruled in our favor and issued an order to Apple on August 29 to restore our app within 7 days. After about two weeks, Apple finally notified us that the app was back online.
Why this matters
This is a victory against trademark bullying and an important win for our community. We stood our ground, defended our rights, and made sure our app—and its name—stayed ours.
Thank you all for your ongoing support throughout this challenging journey!
— Chatbox Dev Team]]></content:encoded>

Just got word that the court dismissed several of WP Engine and Silver Lake’s most serious claims — antitrust, monopolization, and extortion have been knocked out! These were by far the most significant and far-reaching allegations in the case and with today’s decision the case is narrowed significantly. This is a win not just for us but for all open source maintainers and contributors. Huge thanks to the folks at Gibson and Automattic who have been working on this.



With respect to any remaining claims, we’re confident the facts will demonstrate that our actions were lawful and in the best interests of the WordPress community.



This ruling is a significant milestone, but our focus remains the same: building a free, open, and thriving WordPress ecosystem and supporting the millions of people who rely on it every day.

            <description><![CDATA[After months of debate, California lawmakers on Friday passed SB 79, a housing bill that overrides local zoning laws to bring high-density housing up to nine stories tall to transit hubs.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ California lawmakers just paved the way for a whole lot more housing in the Golden State.In the waning hours of the 2025 legislative session, the state Senate voted 21 to 8 to approve Senate Bill 79, a landmark housing bill that overrides local zoning laws to expand high-density housing near transit hubs. The controversial bill received a final concurrence vote from the Senate on Friday, a day after passing in the California Assembly with a vote of 41 to 17.The bill had already squeaked through the state Senate by a narrow margin earlier this year, but since it was amended in the following months, it required a second approval. It will head to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk in October.One of the more ambitious state-imposed efforts to increase housing density in recent years, the bill was introduced in March by Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), who stresses that the state needs to take immediate action to address California’s housing shortage. It opens the door for taller, denser housing near transit corridors such as bus stops and train stations: up to nine stories for buildings adjacent to certain transit stops, seven stories for buildings within a quarter-mile and six stories for buildings within a half-mile.Single-family neighborhoods within a half-mile of transit stops would be subject to the new zoning rules.Height limits are based on tiers. Tier 1 zoning, which includes heavy rail lines such as the L.A. Metro B and D lines, allows for six- to nine-story buildings, depending on proximity to the transit hub. Tier 2 zoning — which includes light rail lines such as the A, C, E and K lines, as well as bus routes with dedicated lanes — allows for five- to eight-story buildings.An amateur map released by a cartographer and fact-checked by YIMBY Action, a housing nonprofit that helped push the bill through, gives an idea of the areas around L.A. that would be eligible for development under SB 79. Tier 1 zones include hubs along Wilshire Boulevard, Vermont Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard, as well as a handful of spots in downtown L.A. and the San Fernando Valley.Tier 2 zones are more spread out, dotting Exposition Boulevard along the E line, stretching toward Inglewood along the K line, and running from Long Beach into the San Gabriel Valley along the A line.Assembly members debated the bill for around 40 minutes on Thursday evening and cheered after it was passed.“Over the last five years, housing affordability and homelessness have consistently been among the top priorities in California. The smartest place to build new housing is within existing communities, near the state’s major transit investments that connect people to jobs, schools and essential services,” said Assemblymember Sharon Quirk-Silva (D-Orange County) in support of the bill.Other Assembly members, including Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland), Juan Carrillo (D-Palmdale) and Josh Hoover (R-Folsom) voiced their support.Proponents say drastic measures are necessary given the state’s affordability crisis. “SB 79 is what we’ve been working towards for a decade — new housing next to our most frequently used train stations. This bill has the potential to unlock hundreds of thousands of new multifamily homes,” said YIMBY Action California director Leora Tanjuatco Ross.Critics claim the blanket mandate is an overreach, stripping local authorities of their ability to promote responsible growth.Assemblymember Rick Zbur (D-West Hollywood) argued against the bill, claiming it will affect lower-priced neighborhoods more than wealthy ones since land prices are cheaper for housing developers.The vote came a few weeks after the Los Angeles City Council came out against the bill, voting 8 to 5 on a resolution opposing it.Councilmember Traci Park, who co-authored the resolution with Councilmember John Lee, called SB 79 a “one-size-fits-all mandate from Sacramento.” Lee called it “chaos.”The resolution called for L.A. to be exempt from the upzoning since it already has a state-approved housing plan.The bill has spurred multiple protests in Southern California communities, including Pacific Palisades and San Diego. Residents fear the zoning changes would alter single-family communities and force residents into competition with developers, who would be incentivized under the new rules to purchase properties near transit corridors.However, support for SB 79 surged in recent days after the State Building and Construction Trades Council, a powerful labor group that represents union construction workers, agreed to reverse its opposition in exchange for amendments that add union hiring to certain projects.In a statement after the deal was struck, the trades council President Chris Hannan said the amendments would provide good jobs and training to California’s skilled construction workforce.Wiener, who has unsuccessfully tried to pass similar legislation twice before, said the deal boosted the bill’s chances.

This is the third piece of the fourth part of our series (I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IVa, IVb) looking at the lives of pre-modern peasant farmers – a majority of all of the humans who have ever lived.  Last time, we started looking at the subsistence of peasant agriculture by considering the productivity of our model farming families under basically ideal conditions: relatively good yields and effectively infinite land.



This week we’re going to start peeling back those assumptions in light of the very small farm-sizes and capital availability our pre-modern peasants had.  Last week we found that, assuming effectively infinite land and reasonably high yields, our farmers produced enough to maintain their households fairly securely in relative comfort, with enough surplus over even their respectability needs to potentially support a small population of non-farmers.  But of course land isn’t infinite and also isn’t free and on top of that, the societies in which our peasant farmers live are often built to extract as much surplus from the peasantry as possible.



But first, if you like what you are reading, please share it and if you really like it, you can support this project on Patreon! While I do teach as the academic equivalent of a tenant farmer, tilling the Big Man’s classes, this project is my little plot of freeheld land which enables me to keep working as a writers and scholar. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on Twitter and Bluesky and (less frequently) Mastodon (@bretdevereaux@historians.social) for updates when posts go live and my general musings; I have largely shifted over to Bluesky (I maintain some de minimis presence on Twitter), given that it has become a much better place for historical discussion than Twitter.






From the British Museum (2010,7081.4256), “The Rapacious Steward or Unfortunate Tenant,” a print by Haveill Gillbank (1803), showing a tenant farmer, with his family, being taken award by the estate’s steward (on horseback).  A little late for our chronology, but so on point for today’s topic it was hard to let it pass.It is also a useful reminder that tenancy wasn’t just an economic system, but a social one: it gave the Big Man and his agents tremendous power over the lives and livelihoods of the people who lives near the Big Man’s estates.  For very Big Men, they might have several such estates and so be absentee landlords, in which case not only the Big Man, but his steward, might be figures of substantial power locally.



Land Holdings



Returning to where we left off last week, we found that our model families could comfortably exceed their subsistence and ‘respectability’ needs with the labor they had assuming they had enough land (and other capital) to employ all of their available farming labor.  However, attentive readers will have noticed that the labor of these families could work a lot of land: 30.5 acres for The Smalls, 33.6 acres for The Middles and 56 acres for The Biggs.  That may not seem large by the standards of modern commercial farms, but few peasants had anything like such large landholdings; even rich peasants rarely owned so much.



We might compare, for instance, the land allotments of Macedonian and Greek military settlers in the Hellenistic kingdoms (particularly Egypt, where our evidence is good). These settlers were remarkably well compensated, because part of what the Hellenistic kings are trying to do is create a new class of Greco-Macedonian rentier-elites1 as a new ethnically defined military ruling-class which would support their new monarchies. In Egypt, where we can see most clearly, infantrymen generally received 25 or 30 arourai (17 or 20.4 acres), while cavalrymen, socially higher up still, generally received 100 arourai (68 acres).2 That infantry allotment is still anywhere from two thirds to less than half of what our model families can farm and yet was still large enough, as far as we can tell, to enable Ptolemaic Greco-Macedonian soldiers to live as rentier-elites, subsisting primarily if not entirely off of rents and the labor of others.3



Alternately, considering late medieval Europe through the study of Saint-Thibery,4 out of 189 households in 1460 in the village just fifteen households are in the same neighborhood of landholdings as the Smalls’ 33.6 acres above (so roughly 55 setérée and up)5 only six as much as The Biggs (about 90 setérée and up). In short our assessment so far has assumed our families are extremely rich peasants. But of course they almost certainly are not!



Instead, as we noted in our first part, the average size of peasant landholdings was extremely small. Typical Roman landholdings were around 5-10 iugera (3.12-6.23 acres), in wheat-farming pre-Han northern China roughly 100 mu (4.764 acres), in Ptolemaic Egypt (for the indigenous, non-elite population) probably 5-10 aroura (3.4-6.8 acres) and so on.6 In Saint-Thibery in Languedoc, the average (mean) farm size was about 24 setérée (~14.5 acres) but the more useful median farm size was just five setérée (~3 acres); the average is obviously quite distorted by the handful of households with hundreds of setérée of land.



So we might test three different farm sizes; once again, I am going to use Roman units because that’s how I am doing my background math.  We might posit a relatively a poor household farm of roughly three iugera (1.85 acres).  In Saint-Thibery, 68 of the 189 households (36%) had land holdings this small or smaller, so this is not an unreasonable ‘poor household’ – indeed, we could posit much poorer, but then we’re really just talking about tenant farmers, rather than freeholding peasants.  Next, we can posit a moderate household farm of roughly six iugera (3.8 acres); reasonably close to the median holding in Saint-Thibery and roughly what we think of as the lower-bound for ancient citizen-soldier-peasants.  Finally, we can posit a large household farm of nine iugera (5.6 acres), reflective of what seems to be the upper-end of typical for those same citizen-soldier-peasants; at Saint-Thibery in 1460 there were a couple dozen families seemingly in this range.7



For the sake of a relatively easier calculation, we can assume the same balance of wheat, barley and beans as last time, which lets us just specify an average yield after seed per iugerum of 81.2-189.5 kg of wheat equivalent (achieved by averaging the per-acre wheat equivalent production across all three crops, with seed removed),8 with each iugerum demanding between 11 and 15 working days (averaging the labor requirements across all three crops). Finally, we need to remember the fallow: in this case we’re assuming about a third of each farm is not in production in any given year, meaning it is both not consuming any labor nor producing any crops. That lets us then quickly chart out our peasant families based on the land they might actually have (keeping in mind the household size and household land holdings aren’t going to match; the larger household in people won’t always be the one with more land). First, a reminder of the basic labor availability and grain requirements of our households.

Then for the smallest, 3 iugera farm, the numbers work like this:

And then for the medium-sized farm:

And the larger (but not rich peasant) farm:

And we immediately see the problem: only the Smalls manage to get close to subsistence on very favorable (8:1) fertility assumptions on the small farm they own. Now it is possible for the peasants to push a little bit on these numbers. The most obvious way would be focusing as much as possible on wheat cultivation, which has higher labor demands but also the highest yield-per-acre (or iugerum), producing around 50% more calories than beans and 35% more calories than barley per-acre (see last week’s post for specifics). But there’s a limit to going ‘all in’ on wheat to meet food shortfalls: the land might not be suitable for it and wheat exhausts the soil, so our farmers would need some sort of rotation.  That said, peasant diets were overwhelmingly grains (wheat and barley) for this reason: they provide the most calories for a favorable balance of land and labor. Our farmers might also try to supplement production with high-labor, high-density horticulture; a kitchen garden can take a lot of work but produce a lot of nutrition in a small space. But hitting household nutrition demands entirely with a kitchen garden isn’t going to work both because of the labor demands but also because the products of a kitchen garden tend not to keep well.



Instead the core problem is that our peasant households are much too large as units of labor for the farmland they own.  When we say that, what we mean is that given these households are both units of consumption (they have to provide for their members) and units of production (they are essentially agricultural small businesses), an efficient allocation of them would basically have each household on something like 30 acres of farmland, farming all of it (and thus using most of their labor) and selling the excess.  But the lack of economically sustainable social niches – that is, jobs that provide a reliable steady income to enable someone to obtain subsistence – means that these families are very reluctant to leave members without any land at all, so the holdings ‘fractionalize’ down to these tiny units, essentially the smallest units that could conceivably support one family (and sometimes not even that).



I’ve already seen folks in the comments realizing almost immediately why these conditions might make conquest or resettlement into areas of land easily brought under cultivation so attraction: if you could give each household 30-40 acres instead of 3-6, you could realize substantial improvements in quality of life (and the social standing of the farmers in question). And of course that kind of ‘land scarcity’ problem seems to have motivated both ancient and early modern settler-colonialism: if you put farmers next to flat, open ground owned by another community, it won’t be too long before they try to make it farmland (violently expelling the previous owners in the process). This is also, I might add, part of the continual friction in areas where nomads and farmers meet: to a farmer, those grazing fields look like more land and more land is really valuable (though the response to getting new land is often not to create a bunch of freeholding large-farm homesteaders, but rather to replicate the patterns of tenancy and non-free agricultural labor these societies already have to the point of – as in the Americas – forcibly trafficking enormous numbers of enslaved laborers at great cost, suffering and horror, to create a non-free dependent class whose exploitation can enable those patterns.  Most conquering armies dream of becoming landlords, not peasants).9



Alternately as farms these holdings could be a lot more efficient if they had fewer people on them and indeed when we read, for instance, ancient agricultural writers, they recommend estates with significantly fewer laborers per-unit-land-area than what we’d see in the peasant countryside. But that’s because the Big Man is farming for profit with a large estate that lets him tailor his labor force fairly precisely to his labor needs; the peasants are farming to survive and few people are going to let their brother, mother, or children starve and die in a ditch because it makes their farm modestly more productive per unit labor. Instead, they’re going try to do anything in their power to get enough income to have enough food for their entire family to survive.



There is no real way around it: our peasants need access to more land.  And that land is going to come with conditions.



From the British Museum (1850,0713.91), “La Conversation,” an etching by David Teniers and Andrew Lawrence (1742) showing three peasants having a conversation outside of a farmhouse, with a peasant woman in the doorway.



The Big Man’s Land



Now before we march into talking about farming someone else’s land, it is worth exploring why our farmers don’t get more land by just bringing more land under cultivation.  And the answer here is pretty simple: in most of the world, preparing truly ‘wild’ land for cultivation takes a lot of labor.  In dry areas, that labor often comes in the form of irrigation demands: canals have to be dug out from water sources (mainly rivers) to provide enough moisture for the fields as the most productive crops (like wheat) demand a lot of moisture to grow well.  In climates suitable for rainfall agriculture, the problem is instead generally forests: if there’s enough rain to grow grain, there’s enough rain to grow trees and those trees have had quite the head start on you.  Clearing large sections of forest by land is a slow, labor-intensive thing and remember, you don’t just need the trees cut down, you need the stumps pulled or burned.  Fields also need to be relatively flat – which might demand terracing on hilly terrain – and for the sake of the plow they need to be free of large stones to the depth of the plow (at least a foot or so).



In short, clearing farmland was both slow and expensive and all of this assumes the land can be made suitable and that no one has title to it.  Of course if the forest is the hunting preserve of the local elite, they’re going to object quite loudly to your efforts to cut it down.  And a lot of land is simply going to be too dry or too hilly or too marshy to be made usable for farming ona practical time-scale for our peasants.  Such land simply cannot be brought usefully into cultivation; you can’t farm wheat in a swamp.10  So it is quite hard and often impractical to bring new land into cultivation.



That doesn’t mean new land wasn’t brought into cultivation, it absolutely was.  We can sometimes track population pressures archaeologically by watching this process: forests retreat, new villages pop up, swamps are drained and so on as previously marginal or unfarmable land is brought into cultivation.  Note, of course, if you bring a bunch of marginal fields into cultivation – say, a drier hillside not worth farming before – your average yield is going to go down because that land simply isn’t as productive (but demands the same amount of labor!).  But that process is generally slow, taking place over generations in response to population pressures.  It isn’t a solution available on the time-scale that most of our households are operating.  In the moment, the supply of land is mostly fixed for our peasants.



Which means our peasants need access to more land (or another way of generating income).  There are a range of places that land could come from:




Peasant Households without enough labor to farm their own land.  In order to make our households relevant at every part of the process, I haven’t modeled the substantial number of very small households we talked about in the first section, households with just 1 or 2 members.  If none of those householders were working-age males (e.g. a household with an elderly widow, or a young widow and minor children, etc.) they might seek to have other villagers help farm their land and split the production.  For very small households, that might be enough to provide them subsistence (or at least help).  Consequently those small, often ‘dying’ households provide a (fairly small) source of land for other households.



Rich peasants likewise might have more land than their household could farm or cared to farm.  Consider the position The Smalls would be if they were a rich peasant household with, say, 25 acres of land (in Saint-Thibery, 26 households (of 189) had this much or more land).  That’s enough land that, under good harvest conditions it would be easy enough to shoot past the household’s respectability requirements.  At which point why work so hard?  Why not sharecrop out a large chunk of your land to small farmers and split the production, so you still make your respectability basket in decent years, but don’t have to work so darn hard?



The Big Man.  Another part of this ecosystem is invariably large landowners, who might have estates of hundreds of acres.  Columella , for instance, thinks of farm planning (he is thinking about large estates) in units of 100 iugera (62.3 acres) and 200 iugera (124.6 acres; Col. Rust. 12.7-9).  An estate of several hundred acres would hardly be unusual.  Likewise in the Middle Ages, the Big Man might be a local noble whose manor estate might likewise control a lot of land.  The Big Man might also be a religious establishment: temples (in antiquity) and monasteries and churches (in the Middle Ages) often controlled large amounts of productive farmland worked by serfs or tenants to provide their income.  Naturally, the Big Man isn’t doing his own farming; he may have some ‘built in’ labor force (workers in his household, enslaved workers, permanent wage laborers, etc.) but often the Big Man is going to rely substantially on the local peasantry for tenant labor.




In practice, the Big Man is likely to represent the bulk of opportunities here, but by no means all of them.  As I noted before, while local conditions vary a lot, you won’t be too far wrong in thinking about landholdings as a basic ‘rule of thirds’ with one third of the land controlled by small peasants, one third by rich peasants and one third by the Big Man (who, again, might be a lord or a big landowner or a church, monastery or temple (in the latter case, the land is owned by the god in most polytheistic faiths) or even the king).  But of course only a little bit of the small peasant land is going to be in search of workers, since most peasant households have too many hands for too little land; some of the rich peasant land will be looking for workers (either tenants or hired hands), but rich peasants are still peasants – they do some of their farming on their own.  By contrast, the Big Man is marked out by the fact that he doesn’t do his own farming: he needs some kind of labor supply – wage laborers, enslaved/non-free laborers or tenants – for all of it.



But that also means that something like half (or more!) of the land around our peasant village might be owned by a household that needs outside labor to farm it.  So we have peasant households with surplus labor that need more land to farm and richer households with surplus land that needs labor.  The solution here generally was some form of tenancy which in the pre-modern world generally came in the form, effectively of sharecropping: the landowner agreed to let the poorer household farm some of his land in exchange for a percentage of the crop that resulted.  That ‘rent-in-kind’ structure is useful for the peasants who after all are not generally keeping money with which to pay rent.  At the same time, it limits their liability: if the harvest on tenant land fails, they may suffer a shortfall, but they aren’t in debt some monetary quantity of rent (though they may end up in debt in some other way).



Now the question is: on what terms?



Tenancy



And the answer here won’t surprise: bad terms.  The terms are bad.



There’s a useful discussion of this in L. Foxhall, “The Dependent Tenant” JRS 980 (1990), which in turn leans on K. Finkler, “Agrarian Reform and Economic Development” in Agricultural Decision Making, ed. P.F. Barlett (1980) to get a sense of what the terms for tenant farmers might normally look like.  Foxhall notes in this and a few other studies of modern but largely non-industrial farming arrangements that almost no households in these studies were entirely uninvolved in sharecropping or tenancy arrangements, but that the terms of tenancy arrangements varied a lot based on the inputs supplied.



The key inputs were labor, traction (for our pre-industrial peasants, this is “who supplies the plow-team animals”), water and seed.  The most common arrangement, representing almost a third of all arrangements, was where the tenant supplied labor only, while traction, water and seed were supplied by the landlord; the tenants share in these arrangements was a measly 18.75%.  A number of arrangements had the tenant supplying not only labor but also some mix of traction, water or seed (but not all) and often the tenant’s share of the production hovered between 40 and 60%, with exact 50/50 splits occurring in about a quarter of the sample.  In just one case did the tenant supply everything but the land itself; in that case the tenant’s share was 81.25%.



One thing that is obvious from just this example is that arrangements varied a lot and are going to depend on need and bargaining power. A ‘landlord’ who has land they want under cultivation but can supply basically nothing else may be relatively easy to negotiate into a fairly generous deal; a peasant who is absolutely destitute save for the labor of their hands is easy to exploit. An even 50/50 landholder, tenant split seems to have been the norm in much of Europe though, reflected in terms for sharecropper (métayer in French, mezzadro in Italian, mitateri in Sicilian, mediero in Spanish) which all mean ‘halver,’ though again the terms (and the share split) varied, typically based on demand but also on what exactly the landlord was providing (seed, plow teams, tools, physical infrastructure (like a farmhouse), etc).



For the sake of simplicity in our model, we can assume something like a 50/50 split, with our tenants supplying half of the seed, so that our net yield is exactly half of what it would have been.  We can then take those assumptions back to our model.  To establish a baseline, let’s run the numbers assuming first a ‘medium’ sized (6 iugera, 3.8 acres, with 4 iugera cropped and 2 fallowed) farm, with our fertility estimate set modestly to 6:1, a ‘good but not great’ yield.  We’re going to ’round up’ to the nearest even iugerum and assume an average of 13 days per iugerum of labor, just to make our calculations a bit simpler.  How hard is it for our peasants to meet their needs if they have to sharecrop the added land they need?

As we can see, tenancy dramatically changes the picture for our peasants. Under these relatively typical assumptions, of our three families all can make subsistence in a normal year but only the Smalls have the right combination of a lot of labor and a relatively small family to have a shot at getting all of their respectability needs (in practice, they’d probably fall short once you consider necessary farm labor not in the fields – fence repair, tool maintenance, home repair and the like). It also isn’t hard to see how we might alter this picture to change our assumptions. Changing the size of the owned farmland has a significant impact (even though it is already so small) because our peasants realize twice the production per unit-land-area for land they own over land they rent (again, terms might vary). Put another way, under these assumptions, somewhat marginal owned farmland that gives an OK-but-not-great yield of 4:1 is of the same use to our peasants as really good tenant-farmed farmland giving a 7:1 yield (both offer 81.2kg of wheat equivalent per iugerum after rent is paid).



That said, the fact that our peasants end up with enough labor to comfortable exceed their subsistence requirements, but not their comfort requirements is favorable for extraction, which we’ll discuss below.  These are households with spare labor who can’t fulfill all of their wants entirely on their own, giving the state or local Big Men both a lot of levers to squeeze more labor out of them and also giving the households the available above-subsistence labor to squeeze.  By contrast if these peasants had enough land to meet all of their needs themselves, there would be fewer opportunities to compel them to do additional labor beyond that.



But even before we get to extraction, tenancy is also changing our peasants’ incentives. Economics has the concept of diminishing marginal returns, the frequent phenomenon where adding one more unit of a given input produces less and less output per additional input-unit. You will find more errors in the first hour of proofreading than the fiftieth hour, for instance. There’s also the concept of diminishing marginal utility: beyond a certain point, getting more of something is less valuable per unit added. Getting one bar of chocolate when you have none? Fantastic. Getting one bar of chocolate when you have ten thousand? Solidly meh.



Both are working on our farmers to press their natural production inclination not to maximum labor or even hitting that respectability basket but just subsistence and a little bit more.  On the diminishing marginal returns front, naturally when it comes to both owned land and rented land, our peasants are going to farm the most productive land first.  This is why when we talk about expanding population and expanding agriculture, we often talk about marginal land (less productive land) coming under cultivation; because all of the really great land was already being farmed.  But poor farmland doesn’t demand less labor time (indeed, it may demand more), it just produces less.  So while we’ve been working here with averages, you should imagine that the first few acres of farmland will be more productive and the latter few less productive.



Tenancy puts this into even more sharp contrast because it creates a really significant discontinuity in the value of farming additional land: the rents are so high that sharecropped or tenant land is much less useful (per unit labor) to the peasant than their own land.  So you have a slow downward slope of ‘land quality’ and somewhere in that slope there is the point at which the peasants have farmed all of their own land and so suddenly the effective yield-per-labor-after-rent drops by half (or more!).  So the first few hundred kilograms of wheat equivalent are probably fairly easy to get: you have a few good fields you own and your net out of them might be 130-190kg of wheat equivalent per iugerum.  Put in a couple dozen days on those two good iugera and The Smalls have just over a quarter of their subsistence needs.  But then they have their more marginal fields, which might only yield 80-100kg.  Still not terrible but the next couple of dozen days of labor don’t get them as far: not to half but just 44% or so.  But now you are out of your own land, so you go to your rich neighbor or the Big Man to get access to some more and suddenly even on their best fields your yield-per-iugerum is 80-95kg so another couple of dozen working days gets you just from 44% to just 57% of what you need.  So you need to line up a lot more land, but now you might be starting to look at the worse fields the Big Man has.  He still wants them farmed, after all, his choice is between doing nothing and earning money or doing nothing and not earning money; he’d rather earn money.  But suddenly you’re looking at maybe as little as 50-60kg of wheat equivalent per iugerum and the labor demands have not gone down.



Meanwhile, the comfort you get from each kilogram of wheat equivalent is also going down.  The first 80% or so of your subsistence needs is necessary simply to not starve to death; a bit more makes the household sustainable in the long term.  But then – and remember, these choices are coming as you are facing diminishing marginal returns on each day of labor you put in – is it really worth your time to cultivate a couple more fields in order to just get a bit more meat in your diet and have slightly nicer household goods?  Wouldn’t you rather rest?



And so what you see is most peasant households aiming not for the full respectability basket, but that “subsistence – and a little bit more” because as each day of labor produces less product and each product produces less joy, at some point you’d rather not work.



And as we’ve seen in theory, our households might hit that crossover point – subsistence and a little bit more – fairly quickly in their labor supply. We haven’t yet, but should now, account for labor spent on things like maintaining tools, fixing fences and other capital investments. If we allocate, say, 45 days, for that and assume that our farmers also want to have some cushion on subsistence (say, another 10%), we might expect The Smalls to be more or less satisfied (on that medium landholding, average 6:1 yields) with something like 245 working days (56% of total), the Middles with 331 working days (65%) and the Biggs with 560 (70%). Working like that, they won’t be rich and won’t ever become rich (but they were never going to become rich regardless), but they’ll mostly survive – some years will be hard – and they’ll have a little bit more time to rest.  Some families, a bit more industrious, might push towards achieving most or all of the respectability basket, at least in good years; others might be willing to stick closer to subsistence (or unable to do otherwise).



Of course in areas where the farmland is meaningfully more marginal – average yields around 4:1 rather than 6:1 – our peasants are going to need to work quite a lot more, about 60% more.  That pushes the Smalls to about 84% of their available labor, the Middles to 99% and the Biggs actually slightly into deficit, demanding roughly 110% of their available labor.  We should keep in mind that each peasant household is going to exist somewhere along the spectrum: some with larger amounts of property or access to better land, some with less.  We’ll come back to this in a moment, but this is part of why the poorest of the peasantry were often exempt from things like military service: positioned on marginal land in poor communities, they had little excess labor available.  Most peasant households would have been somewhere in between these two, so a labor utilization rate ranging from 50 to 100%, with a lot of households in that 60-80% labor utilization range.



And now you might think, “doesn’t this take us back to peasants actually not working all that much compared to modern workers?” and first I would want to point out that these peasants are also experiencing a quality of living way below workers in modern industrial countries but also no because we haven’t talked about extraction.







Because of course the problem here, from the perspective of everyone who isn’t our peasants is that if the peasantry only does the amount of agricultural labor necessary to subsist themselves and just a little more, the society doesn’t have economic room for much else in the way of productive (or unproductive) economic activity.  Remember: our peasants are the only significant population actually doing farming.  Sure the Big Men and the gentry and temples and monasteries may own land, but they are mostly renting that land out to peasants (or hiring peasants to work it, or enslaving peasants and forcing them to work it).



And those landholding elites, in turn, want to do things.  They want to build temples, wage wars, throw fancy parties, employ literate scribes to write works of literature and of course they also want to live in leisure (not farming) while doing this.  And the activities they want to do – the temples, wars, fancy parties, scribes and so on – that requires a lot of food and other agricultural goods to sustain the people doing those things.  It also requires a bunch of surplus labor – some of that surplus labor are specialists, but a lot of it is effectively ‘unspecialized’ labor.



To do those things, those elites need to draw both agricultural surplus and surplus labor out of the countryside.  And we should that of course, obviously, this is an exploitative relationship, but it is also worth noting that for pre-modern agrarian economies, the societies where elites can centralize and control the largest pile of labor and surplus tend to use it to conquer the societies that don’t so ‘demilitarized peasant utopia’ is not a society that is going to last very long (but ‘highly militarized landowner republic’ might).



It is thus necessary to note that when we see the emergence of complex agrarian societies – cities, writing, architectural wonders, artistic achievements and so on – these achievements are mostly elite projects, ‘funded’ (in food and labor, if not in money) out of extraction from the peasantry.



Exactly how this extraction worked varied a lot society to society and even within regions and ethnic and social classes within society.  As noted above, in areas where agriculture was not very productive, extraction was limited.  By contrast, highly productive regions didn’t so much producer richer peasants as they tended to produce far higher rates of extraction.  In some society, where the freeholding farming peasantry (or part of that peasantry) formed an important political constituency (like some Greek poleis or the Roman Republic), the small farmers might manage to preserve relatively more of their surplus for themselves, but often in exchange for significant demands in terms of military and civic participation.



To take perhaps the simplest direct example of removing labor from the countryside, from 218 to 168, the Romans averaged around 10-12 legions deployed in a given year, 45,000-54,000 citizen soldiers.11  Against an adult-male citizen population of perhaps ~250,000 implies that the Roman army was consuming something like a quarter of all of the available citizen manpower in the countryside, though enslaved laborers and males under 17 wouldn’t be captured by this figure.  Accounting for those groups we might imagine the Roman dilectus is siphoning off something like 15% of the labor capacity of the countryside on average (sometimes spiking far higher, as much as half of it).  On top of that, the demand of these soldiers that they supply their own arms and armor would have pushed farmers to farm a little bit more than subsistence-and-a-little-more to afford the cost of the arms (traded for or purchased with that surplus; at least initially these transactions are not happening in coined money).



We see similar systems in the Carolingian levy system or the Anglo-Saxon fyrd, where households might be brigaded together – in the Carolingian system, households were grouped into mansi – based on agricultural production (you can see how that works above as a proxy for ‘available surplus labor!’) with a certain number – three or four mansi in the Carolingian system – required to furnish one armed man for either a regional levy or the main field army.  The goal of such systems is to take the surplus labor above and make it available for military service.



Alternately, the elites might not want their peasants as soldiers but as workers.  Thus the very frequent appearance of corvée labor: a requirement of a certain amount of intermittent, unpaid forced labor.  This might be labor on the local lord’s estate (a sort of unpaid tenancy arrangement) or labor on public works (walls, castles, roads) or a rotating labor force working in state-owned (or elite-owned) productive enterprises (mines, for instance).  As with military service, this sort of labor demand could be shaped to what the local populace would bear and enforced by a military aristocracy against a largely disarmed peasantry.  Once again looking at the statistics above, even a few weeks a year per man (rather than per household) would drain most of the surplus labor out of our households.  Adding, for instance, a month of corvée labor of per work-capable male (an age often pegged around seven for these societies) under our favorable (6:1) assumptions above bring our work totals to 305 days (70% of total) for the Smalls, 373 (77%) for the Middles and 650 (81.5%) for the Biggs.  Corvée labor demands could be less than this, but also often quite a bit more (expectations varied a lot by local laws and customs.



Alternately, elites might just crank up the taxes.  In the Hellenistic states (the Ptolemaic and Seleucid kingdoms especially), the army wasn’t a peasant levy, but rather a core of Greco-Macedonian rentier elites (your ‘rich peasants’ or ‘gentlemen farmers’), regional levies and mercenaries.  To pay for that (and fund the lavish courts and public works that royal legitimacy required), the indigenous Levantine, Egyptian, Syrian, Mesopotamian (etc. etc.) underclasses were both made to be the tenants on the estates of those rentier elites (land seized from those same peasants in the initial Macedonian conquest or shortly thereafter) but also to pay very high taxes on their own land.12  So while tax rates on military-settler (that is, Greco-Macedonian rentier elites) land might have been around 10% – 1/12th (8.3%) seems to have been at least somewhat common – taxes on the land of the indigenous laoi could run as high as 50%, even before one got to taxes on markets, customs duties, sales taxes, a head tax and state monopolies on certain natural resources including timber and importantly salt.13  So the poor laoi might be paying extortionate taxes on their own lands, lighter taxes on settler (or temple) lands, but then also paying extortionate rents of those tenant-farmed lands.



Another micro-scale option was debt.  We’ve been assuming our farmers are operating at steady-state subsistence, but as we keep noting, yields in any given year were highly variable.  What peasants were forced to do in bad years, almost invariably as go into debt to the Big Man.  But as noted, they’re simply not generating a lot in the way of surplus to ever pay off that debt.  That in turn makes the debt itself a tool of control, what we often call debt peonage.  Since the Big Man sets the terms of the debt (at a time when the peasant is absolutely desperate) it was trivially easy to construct a debt structure that the peasant could never pay off, giving the Big Man leverage to demand services – labor, tenancy on poor terms, broad social deference, etc. – in perpetuity.  And of course, if the Big Man ever wants to expand his land holdings, all he would need to do would be to call in the un-payable debt and – depending on the laws around debt in the society – either seize the peasant’s land in payment or reduce the peasant into debt-slavery.14



In short, elites had a lot of mechanisms to sop up the excess labor in the countryside and they generally used them.



Consequently, while peasants, unencumbered by taxes, rents, elites, debt, conscription and so on might have been able to survive working only a relatively small fraction of their time (probably around 100 days per year per-working-age male (again, age 7 or so and up) would suffice), they did not live in that world.



Instead, they lived in a world where their own landholdings were extremely small – too small to fully support their households, although their small holdings might still provide a foundation of income for survival.  Instead, they had to work on land owned or at least controlled by Big Men: local rentier-elites, the king, temples, monasteries, and so on.  Those big institutions which could wield both legal and military force in turn extracted high rents and often demanded additional labor from our peasants, which soaked up much of their available labor, leading to that range of 250-300 working days a year, with 10-12 hour days each, for something on the order of 2,500-3,600 working hours for a farm-laboring peasant annually.



Which is quite a lot less than the c. 250 typical work days (261 weekdays minus holidays/vacation) in the United States – just by way of example of a modern industrial economy – at typically eight hours a day or roughly 2,000 working hours a year.  Of course it is also the case that those roughly 2,000 modern hours buy a much better standard of living than what our medieval peasants had access to – consider that a single unimpressive car represents more value just in worked metal (steel) than even many ancient or medieval elites could muster.  No, you do not work more than a medieval or ancient peasant: you work somewhat less, in order to obtain far more material comfort.  Isn’t industrialization grand?



That said, our picture of labor in peasant households is not complete! Indeed, we have only seen to half of our subsistence basket – you will recall we broke out textiles separately – because we haven’t yet even really introduced the workload of probably the most fully employed people in these households: the women. And what’s where we’ll go in the next post in this series.
That is, landholders with enough land to subsist off of the rents without needing to do much or any actual agricultural labor themselves.For scale with the cavalrymen we are talking about just a few thousand households lording over a country of perhaps five million; these fellows are honestly closer to something like a medieval knightly elite than the peasantry.On these allotments, see P. Johstono, The Army of Ptolemaic Egypt, 323-204 BC (2020), 158-160 and C. Fischer-Bovet, Army and Society in Ptolemaic Egypt (2014), 212-217. On the rentier-self-sufficiency of these parcels, at a 5:1 yield, 30 aroura should yield something like 3,500kg wheat equivalent (almost 12 million calories), more than enough to support the settler’s household at a 50% rent (see below) using labor from the much smaller adjacent farms of indigenous Egyptians. Indeed, to me it seems very likely the land allotments were calculated precisely on this basis, with infantrymen receiving the smallest allotment that could reliably support a household in leisure.Le Roy Ladurie, Les Paysans de Languedoc (1966)A reminder that the setérée is an exact unit, about 1/5th to 1/4th of a hectare, so about 0.49-0.62 acres.Rosenstein (2004), 75, n.68; Erdkamp, (2005), 47-8; Cho-yun Hsu, Han Agriculture: The Formation of Early Chinese Agrarian Economy (1980); Johstono, The Army of Ptolemaic Egypt (2020), 101; Fischer-Bovet, Army and Society in Ptolemaic Egypt (2014), 121It’s hard to tell precisely from what I have because Le Roy Ladurie groups households in brackets.The average yield-per-iugerum at each fertility level in wheat equivalent are: 4:1, 81.2kg; 5:1, 108.2kg; 6:1, 135.3kg; 7:1, 162.4kg; 8:1, 189.5kg.I would argue that the Roman approach to Italy from 509 to 218 BC appears to be an exception to this rule: the Romans do tend to use conquered land to set up large numbers of small landholding farms.  Not rich peasants, but the Roman military class – the assidui farmer-citizen-soldiers – were also clearly not utterly impoverished either.  It’s striking that the Romans could have set up a system of rents and tribute extraction in Italy but didn’t, instead effectively terraforming the Italian countryside into a machine for the production of heavy infantry.  That heavy infantry in turn bought the Romans stunning military superiority, which they then used in the second and first centuries BC to create an enormous system of tribute and extraction (rather than extending the approach they had used in Italy).Of course you can drain a swamp, but such drainage efforts are the kinds of things large, well-administered states do, not the sort of thing your local peasants can summon the labor for.On Roman deployments, see Taylor, Soldiers and Silver (2020).The way this was structurally, legally, was that the king, directly or indirectly owned all the land (‘spear-won’) and so many taxes were instead technically ‘rents’ paid to the king.On the Seleucid taxation system, see Aperghis, The Seleucid Royal Economy (2004).  For an overview of the relatively similar Ptolemaic system, see von Reden, Money in Ptolemaic Egypt (2007), Préaux, . L’économie royale des Lagides (1979).The abolition of this specific form of slavery (but not others) is a key political moment in the development of both Rome and Athens (and we may assume, many other Greek poleis) that signals the political importance of the smallholding farmer-citizens and their ability to compel major reforms.  But the Big Man can still seize your farm!	]]></content:encoded>

Introduction

  Less is more

Meow is yet another modal editing mode for Emacs.
Meow aims to blend modal editing into Emacs with minimal interference
  with its original key-bindings, avoiding most of the hassle introduced
  by key-binding conflicts. This leads to lower necessary configuration and
  better integration. More is achieved with fewer commands to remember.
Key features compared to existing solutions:

  Minimal configuration – build your own modal editing system
  No third-party dependencies (try it without touching your configuration)
  Doesn’t occupy too many keys
    
      Much easier to remember for people trying modal editing
      More keys available for your own key-bindings
      Most of the time, you don’t even need to hold shift!
    
  
  Lightning fast (unlike Evil)
  Minimizes modifier usage (e.g. SPC x f for C-x C-f) inspired by god-mode
  Better workflow for kmacro application at multiple locations
  Interactive selection manipulation and expansion inspired by avy
  Selection as top-tier object, and keybindings built around selection
  Compatible with the vanilla Emacs keymap (or any other keymap from any package)
  Effortless uniform keymaps across modes
  Key-binding conflict handling made easy

Windows 98 runs surprisingly well in QEMU via UTM SE, but it requires some care in setting it up. It’s a great way to run old 90s Windows and DOS software on your iPad (and Mac too, though you have other options available to you, or an iPhone if you don’t mind the HID difficulties).



This post provides some suggestions and tips for installing Windows and selecting the best emulated devices. The guidance is intended for UTM users on Apple platforms, but should apply to anything QEMU based (or QEMU itself). The advice might also be useful for other operating systems in UTM/QEMU as well.







Plug and play BIOS issues (or: how to install with ACPI)



When you install Windows 9x, PCI devices might be broken, and you’ll see a Plug and Play BIOS device with problems in the device manager:







This seems to be a bug in SeaBIOS or QEMU; I haven’t yet seen an issue tracking this. Many guides (i.e. this one or this one) suggest changing the device and hoping devices re-enumerate correctly. However, there’s a simpler method available when using Windows 98 SE. (If you’re using Windows 95, you won’t be able to do this.)



Windows 98 can use ACPI to enumerate devices instead of the legacy PnP BIOS. Unfortunately, it doesn’t use ACPI by default. (There seems to be an allowlist of known good ACPI BIOSes, as it was early days for ACPI.) To make it use ACPI anyways, boot with CD-ROM support from the Windows 98 CD instead of running the installer, then run Windows setup with the /p j flag, like so:



C:\> D:
D:\> cd WIN98
D:\WIN98> setup /p j



It’s possible to convert an existing system to ACPI, but it’s much easier to do this from the start. When Windows is installed this way, it should correctly enumerate all devices.



Device selection



System



QEMU can emulate devices Windows 98 supports out of the box, which is good as there are no VirtIO drivers. Make sure you’re using the i440-based “pc” rather than the Q35 based system, as it’ll be better supported for legacy systems. You don’t need to worry about selecting i386 vs. x86_64, as Windows 98 will obviously never touch 64-bit mode, so they’ll be the same.



(As a tip, if you’re running NT 4, you’ll need to select a different CPU to make sure it’s happy with the CPU flags as the default one is too new. A Pentium II should be sufficiently old.)



Input



You may need to disable USB (or at least, USB input devices) to avoid hanging on startup, at least with UTM (It’s possible the ‘Force PS/2 Controller’ option might work, but I haven’t had much luck with it. Unfortunately, this means you won’t have absolute mouse input (through the USB tablet) and must capture your cursor. With UTM SE on an iPad, this doesn’t hurt as much, as it can automatically capture the trackpad or external mouse, while leaving the touchscreen for interacting with iOS.



Video



The most sensible video option for Windows 98 is the Cirrus VGA (-vga cirrus). There are unfortunately some bugs (flashing in 16 bit colour modes, blitting issues in 8 bit colour modes), but it’s the only option with accelerated drivers out of the box. (Of course, there is no 3D acceleration with such a card.)



Apparently, Rage 128 emulation is being worked on (ati-vga), but currently only works for Power Mac emulation, and is in rough shape so far.



Networking and getting files in



For getting files into the VM easily, you’ll want a network. SLiRP NAT works fine for using a browser or SMB shares, for example. (Note this works better on Windows 98 than 95; 95 has issues with mounting SMB shares by IP and doesn’t come with a browser.) QEMU can emulate a variety of network cards. The tulip (DC2114x), NE2000 (PCI and ISA), and PCNet should all work out of the box with older Windows. I’d recommend using a PCI card if possible, since it saves you the ISA setup headache unless you need it for something old. If you do need to set up an ISA NE2000, it’s at address 300h, IRQ 9, which might require manual configuration in some cases.



Sound



For sound hardware, there are a few options available, with different tradeoffs.




If you want to run DOS software, the SoundBlaster 16 (sb16) emulation works out of the box, but there is no OPL3 or MPU-401, so MIDI won’t work correctly, just PCM. Games will have a hard time with this unless they’re entirely PCM. For setting up your SB16 for DOS games, use SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 H5 P330 T5 (that’s address 220h, interrupt 5, 8-bit DMA 1, our non-existent MPU-401 at 330h, 16-bit DMA 5).

Note that QEMU supports adding an AdLib (OPL2 based) separately, which might help with some software.





The CS4321A I haven’t tested, but might work with WSS or Crystal-specific drivers. As with the SoundBlaster 16, there is no OPL3. QEMU sets this up at 534h, IRQ 9, DMA 3.



The Gravis UltraSound (gus) emulation works surprisingly well, but the Windows 95 drivers are crusty for the version of the card it emulates (GF1/GUS Classic), so use it only if you want to run old trackers or demoscene stuff. Note you may need to turn off the LPT port (-parallel none) to free up an interrupt used for the UltraSound.



Because of this, the ES1370 might be the best card to emulate for plain Windows usage, as it has relatively few quirks and I believe has drivers on the Windows 98 CD. However, it’s not ideal for DOS software as it requires TSRs to make it work right.



The AC97 emulation will require Realtek drivers. I haven’t tested this.




Potpourri



In UTM, you may want to turn off the entropy device, to reduce unknown device clutter in Device Manager, though it’s harmless. The VirtIO console device will still be present in Device Manager with UTM’s default flags.



Other quirks



In UTM SE, sometimes rebooting might hang when switching video modes. If this happens, it seems safe to shut down the machine and start it again. Avoiding reboots in favour of shutting down seems wise.



Performance characteristics



While TCG in QEMU doesn’t have the best reputation for performance, it might be good enough for your needs. On my MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro, benchmarks show performance somewhat around about a 750 MHz Pentium III, albeit with worse floating point performance. This is pretty usable, although most 3D games won’t be usable as even software rendering will be a bit sketchy.



If you’re using UTM SE on iOS, the interpreter is slower, but not unusable for 90s software. On my M1 iPad Pro, I get Pentium 100 performance, with similar penalties for FP. This is good for games up to about 1995 or 1996; titles like MechWarrior 2, Widget Workshop, many edutainment titles, and SimCity 2000 are playable this way, though MIDI or CD music will be missing. Non-game software like Office 97 or Visual C++ will run fine, of course. For OSes, this also puts things like Windows 2000 and beyond just out of reach performance wise – stick with Windows 98 for the best compatibility.

            <description><![CDATA[The journalists were reporting on suspected North Korean hackers. Proton only reinstated their accounts after a public outcry.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
    
    The company behind the Proton Mail email service, Proton, describes itself as a “neutral and safe haven for your personal data, committed to defending your freedom.”
But last month, Proton disabled email accounts belonging to journalists reporting on security breaches of various South Korean government computer systems following a complaint by an unspecified cybersecurity agency. After a public outcry, and multiple weeks, the journalists’ accounts were eventually reinstated — but the reporters and editors involved still want answers on how and why Proton decided to shut down the accounts in the first place.
Martin Shelton, deputy director of digital security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, highlighted that numerous newsrooms use Proton’s services as alternatives to something like Gmail “specifically to avoid situations like this,” pointing out that “While it’s good to see that Proton is reconsidering account suspensions, journalists are among the users who need these and similar tools most.” Newsrooms like The Intercept, the Boston Globe, and the Tampa Bay Times all rely on Proton Mail for emailed tip submissions.
Shelton noted that perhaps Proton should “prioritize responding to journalists about account suspensions privately, rather than when they go viral.”
On Reddit, Proton’s official account stated that “Proton did not knowingly block journalists’ email accounts” and that the “situation has unfortunately been blown out of proportion.” Proton did not respond to The Intercept’s request for comment.




The two journalists whose accounts were disabled were working on an article published in the August issue of the long-running hacker zine Phrack. The story described how a sophisticated hacking operation — what’s known in cybersecurity parlance as an APT, or advanced persistent threat — had wormed its way into a number of South Korean computer networks, including those of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the military Defense Counterintelligence Command, or DCC.
The journalists, who published their story under the names Saber and cyb0rg, describe the hack as being consistent with the work of Kimsuky, a notorious North Korean state-backed APT sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2023.
As they pieced the story together, emails viewed by The Intercept show that the authors followed cybersecurity best practices and conducted what’s known as responsible disclosure: notifying affected parties that a vulnerability has been discovered in their systems prior to publicizing the incident.
Saber and cyb0rg created a dedicated Proton Mail account to coordinate the responsible disclosures, then proceeded to notify the impacted parties, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the DCC, and also notified South Korean cybersecurity organizations like the Korea Internet and Security Agency, and KrCERT/CC, the state-sponsored Computer Emergency Response Team. According to emails viewed by The Intercept, KrCERT wrote back to the authors, thanking them for their disclosure.
A note on cybersecurity jargon: CERTs are agencies consisting of cybersecurity experts specializing in dealing with and responding to security incidents. CERTs exist in over 70 countries — with some countries having multiple CERTs each specializing in a particular field such as the financial sector — and may be government-sponsored or private organizations. They adhere to a set of formal technical standards, such as being expected to react to reported cybersecurity threats and security incidents. A high-profile example of a CERT agency in the U.S. is the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, which has recently been gutted by the Trump administration.



A week after the print issue of Phrack came out, and a few days before the digital version was released, Saber and cyb0rg found that the Proton account they had set up for the responsible disclosure notifications had been suspended. A day later, Saber discovered that his personal Proton Mail account had also been suspended. Phrack posted a timeline of the account suspensions at the top of the published article, and later highlighted the timeline in a viral social media post. Both accounts were suspended owing to an unspecified “potential policy violation,” according to screenshots of account login attempts reviewed by The Intercept.
The suspension notice instructed the authors to fill out Proton’s abuse appeals form if they believed the suspension was in error. Saber did so, and received a reply from a member of Proton Mail’s Abuse Team who went by the name Dante.
In an email viewed by The Intercept, Dante told Saber that their account “has been disabled as a result of a direct connection to an account that was taken down due to violations of our terms and conditions while being used in a malicious manner.” Dante also provided a link to Proton’s terms of service, going on to state, “We have clearly indicated that any account used for unauthorized activities, will be sanctioned accordingly.” The response concluded by stating, “We consider that allowing access to your account will cause further damage to our service, therefore we will keep the account suspended.”
On August 22, a Phrack editors reached out to Proton, writing that no hacked data was passed through the suspended email accounts, and asked if the account suspension incident could be deescalated. After receiving no response from Proton, the editor sent a follow-up email on September 6. Proton once again did not reply to the email.
On September 9, the official Phrack X account made a post asking Proton’s official account asking why Proton was “cancelling journalists and ghosting us,” adding: “need help calibrating your moral compass?” The post quickly went viral, garnering over 150,000 views.
Proton’s official account replied the following day, stating that Proton had been “alerted by a CERT that certain accounts were being misused by hackers in violation of Proton’s Terms of Service. This led to a cluster of accounts being disabled. Our team is now reviewing these cases individually to determine if any can be restored.” Proton then stated that they “stand with journalists” but “cannot see the content of accounts and therefore cannot always know when anti-abuse measures may inadvertently affect legitimate activism.”
Proton did not publicly specify which CERT had alerted them, and didn’t answer The Intercept’s request for the name of the specific CERT which had sent the alert. KrCERT also did not reply to The Intercept’s question about whether they were the CERT that had sent the alert to Proton.

Later in the day, Proton’s founder and CEO Andy Yen posted on X that the two accounts had been reinstated. Neither Yen nor Proton explained why the accounts had been reinstated, whether they had been found to not violate the terms of service after all, why had they been suspended in the first place, or why a member of the Proton Abuse Team reiterated that the accounts had violated the terms of service during Saber’s appeals process.
Phrack noted that the account suspensions created a “real impact to the author. The author was unable to answer media requests about the article.” The co-authors, Phrack pointed out, were also in the midst of the responsible disclosure process and working together with the various affected South Korean organizations to help fix their systems. “All this was denied and ruined by Proton,” Phrack stated. 
Phrack editors said that the incident leaves them “concerned what this means to other whistleblowers or journalists. The community needs assurance that Proton does not disable accounts unless Proton has a court order or the crime (or ToS violation) is apparent.”

    Recently I read this beginners guide to extend Emacs.
The guide is perfect for starting out with elisp and it shows a lot of care in teaching how to interact with Emacs.

To me, the most important bit though is this one, from the section aptly named Emacs Wants You to Extend It.


  I haven’t written plugins for other editors extensively, but I can tell you this: emacs doesn’t just make deep customization available, but it actively encourages you to make an absolute customization messes masterpieces. Core editor functions aren’t just documented, but often include tidbits about “you probably want to see this other variable” or “here’s how you should use this”.

  Not only that, but emacs happily hands you functions shaped like nuclear warheads like advice-add (that let you override any function) that can absolutely obliterate your editor if you hold it the wrong way. Of course, this also grants you unlimited power.

  Remember that emacs is designed to be torn apart and rearranged.


This is the core bit of the argument. Emacs, as a system, wants you to
extend it and it gives you all the means to do so. This is in contrast
with systems that can be extended through scripting and instead don’t give
you all the means to do so!

I think the tutorial is a fantastic example of doing things
right. There is a well-thought example, a constructive approach where
the solution grows to a full package.

This is problematic. You may get the impression that extending Emacs
is only possible if you do things right and that is definitely not true.

To make my point I want to walk you through an example. I will show
you how I used standard Emacs extension-points to extend org-mode to sort my
reading lists automatically.

What do I want?

The behavior I want is that when I save an org file the entries are
ordered automatically. I keep a timeline of the papers I am reading
and it is annoying to keep them kind of ordered.

This is the content of an example buffer.

#+TITLE: My tematic reading list

* Paper which is old but not too old
:PROPERTY:
:year: 2002
:END:

* Definitely older paper but unfortunately it's later in the list
:PROPERTY:
:year: 1998
:END:

When I add a paper to my reading list I run org-sort-entries and
interactively select to order the entries by the value in the property
year. Initally this was nice to have but now it’s just annoying that
I have to keep doing it. Let’s extend org-mode so that this is done automatically.

A simple solution

The first step is to automate the interactive part. Lucky for me this is easy
as org-sort-entries is both a function and a command. I can call it in a
script just as I can run it as a command.

(defvar org-sort-option "year")

(defun org-sort-run ()
  (when (and (derived-mode-p 'org-mode) org-sort-option)
    (let ((case-sensitive nil)
	  (sorting-type ?r)
	  (getkey-func nil)
	  (compare-func nil)
	  (property org-sort-option)
	  (interactive? nil))
      (org-sort-entries case-sensitive sorting-type getkey-func compare-func property interactive?))))

This solves one part of the problem. Let’s solve the other one, automatically calling
org-sort-run whenever an org-mode buffer is saved.

Emacs already has support for this use-case through the use of hooks. We can run
org-sort-run all the times we want to save a buffer.

(add-hook 'before-save-hook #'org-sort-run)

These two together solve the problem but the solution presented is “just more code”.
We tapped into the hook extension point but this would be possible in any
scriptable system that exposes well-defined extension points such as hooks and commands.

Leveraging Emacs’ extensibility to extend org-mode

I want to show that even if something is not thought with
extensibility in mind Emacs allow us to extend it. Most importantly, while we
want to extend org-mode’s behavior we would like this not to be an
extension to org-mode’s code.

Here’s the updated problem statement. Have the buffer be automatically
sorted and have the sorting criteria be in the buffer itself. We will
specify the sorting as a in-buffer setting and use Emacs to
support this never thought before org-mode behavior.

Our example buffer changes to the following.

 #+TITLE: My tematic reading list
+#+SORT: year
 
 * Paper which is old but not too old
 :PROPERTY:
 :year: 2002
 :END:
 
 * Definitely older paper but unfortunately it's later in the list
 :PROPERTY:
 :year: 1998
 :END:



The hard part of this is to find how org-mode reads in-buffer
settings
from the header. A M-x find-library later we are in org’s
sources.

Searching for +STARTUP (Ctrl+s +STARTUP), one of the
supported settings, leads us to org-startup-folded and that in turn
(Ctrl+s org-startup-folded) leads us to org-startup-options.

org-startup-options is the used by (again Ctrl+s org-startup-option)
org-set-regexps-and-options.



While the documentation for this function is not very convincing, its code
does make sense for what we are after. I copied it here for reference.

  (when (derived-mode-p 'org-mode)
    (let ((alist (org-collect-keyword
		  (append '("FILETAGS" "TAGS")
			  (and (not tags-only)
			       '("ARCHIVE" "CATEGORY" "COLUMNS" "CONSTANTS"
				 "LINK" "OPTIONS" "PRIORITIES" "PROPERTY"
				 "SEQ_TODO" "STARTUP" "TODO" "TYP_TODO")))
		  '("ARCHIVE" "CATEGORY" "COLUMNS" "PRIORITIES"))))
      ;; Startup options.  Get this early since it does change
      ;; behavior for other options (e.g., tags).
      (let ((startup (cl-mapcan (lambda (value) (split-string value))
				(cdr (assoc "STARTUP" alist)))))
	     ...)

Unfortunately this function calls org-collect-keyword with a list that we cannot
touch. There is no custom variable to set to pass our own keyword.

If this was a “normal programming environment” we would make our changes
to this function body and forever maintain a fork of org-mode. As this
is elisp instead we have choices.

I think the best choice is to use advice-add and have Emacs call our
advice code every time org-set-regexps-and-options is called. We will copy
what we need from the function body but that will be all.

This is what I ended up with.

(defvar org-sort-option nil)

(defun org-sort-set-option (&rest r)
  "Read the +SORT: spec value into variable `org-sort-option'."
  (when (derived-mode-p 'org-mode)
    (let ((alist (org-collect-keywords '("SORT"))))
      (let ((sort (cdr (assoc "SORT" alist))))
	(let ((sort-spec (car (read-from-string (car sort)))))
	  (setq-local org-sort-option sort-spec))))))

(advice-add 'org-set-regexps-and-options :after #'org-sort-set-option)

(defun org-sort-run ()
  (when (and (derived-mode-p 'org-mode) org-sort-option)
    (let ((case-sensitive nil)
	  (sorting-type ?r)
	  (getkey-func nil)
	  (compare-func nil)
	  (property org-sort-option)
	  (interactive? nil))
      (org-sort-entries case-sensitive sorting-type getkey-func compare-func property interactive?))))

(add-hook 'before-save-hook #'org-sort-run)

We keep a buffer-local variable org-sort-option around to store the
property name read from #+SORT: property-name. This variable is initially
nil and will be set from the property name in #+SORT: property-name. To do so
we have a function org-sort-set-option.

But when to call org-sort-set-option? The easy way out is to have Emacs call it whenever
org-set-regexps-and-options is called on a file visit. To achieve this we
tap into advice-add and ask Emacs to run org-sort-set-option after
org-sort-regexps-and-options.

We have now succesfully interposed ourselves in the control flow of the org-mode library.

Org-mode did not provide any interposition point for us, there
is no thought ahead etension-point or configuration variable we can
use to achieve our goal an yet here we are with a sorted buffer.

We succeeded in our effort because Emacs wants you to extend it
and it gives you all the means to do so.

Conclusions

I have made a horrible hack and it works. I have learnt nothing about
how org-mode works or Emacs’ file-visiting extension-points.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
    UTF-8 is a Brilliant Design
    2025-09-12
    


The first time I learned about UTF-8 encoding, I was fascinated by how well-thought and brilliantly it was designed to represent millions of characters from different languages and scripts, and still be backward compatible with ASCII.
Basically UTF-8 uses 32 bits and the old ASCII uses 7 bits, but UTF-8 is designed in such a way that:

Every ASCII encoded file is a valid UTF-8 file.
Every UTF-8 encoded file that has only ASCII characters is a valid ASCII file.

Designing a system that scales to millions of characters and still be compatible with the old systems that use just 128 characters is a brilliant design.

Note: If you are already aware of the UTF-8 encoding, you can explore the UTF-8 Playground utility that I built to visualize UTF-8 encoding.

How Does UTF-8 Do It?
UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding designed to represent every character in the Unicode character set, encompassing characters from most of the world's writing systems.
It encodes characters using one to four bytes. 
The first 128 characters (U+0000 to U+007F) are encoded with a single byte, ensuring backward compatibility with ASCII, and this is the reason why a file with only ASCII characters is a valid UTF-8 file.
Other characters require two, three, or four bytes. The leading bits of the first byte determine the total number of bytes that represents the current character. These bits follow one of four specific patterns, which indicate how many continuation bytes follow.



1st byte Pattern
# of bytes used
Full byte sequence pattern



0xxxxxxx
1
0xxxxxxx(This is basically a regular ASCII encoded byte)


110xxxxx
2
110xxxxx 10xxxxxx


1110xxxx
3
1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx


11110xxx
4
11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx


Notice that the second, third, and fourth bytes in a multi-byte sequence always start with 10. This indicates that these bytes are continuation bytes, following the main byte.
The remaining bits in the main byte, along with the bits in the continuation bytes, are combined to form the character's code point. A code point serves as a unique identifier for a character in the Unicode character set. A code point is typically represented in hexadecimal format, prefixed with "U+". For example, the code point for the character "A" is U+0041.
So here is how a software determines the character from the UTF-8 encoded bytes:

Read a byte. If it starts with 0, it's a single-byte character (ASCII). Show the character represented by the remaiing 7 bits on the screen. Continue with the next byte.
If the byte didn't start with a 0, then:
If it starts with 110, it's a two-byte character, so read the next byte as well.
If it starts with 1110, it's a three-byte character, so read the next two bytes.
If it starts with 11110, it's a four-byte character, so read the next three bytes.


Once the number of bytes are determined, read all the remaining bits except the leading bits, and find the binary value (aka. code point) of the character.
Look up the code point in the Unicode character set to find the corresponding character and display it on the screen.
Read the next byte and repeat the process.

Example: Hindi Letter "अ" (open in UTF-8 Playground)
The Hindi letter "अ" (officially "Devanagari Letter A") is represented in UTF-8 as:
11100000 10100100 10000101
Here:
The first byte 11100000 indicates that the character is encoded using 3 bytes.
The remaining bits of the three bytes:
xxxx0000 xx100100 xx000101 
are combined to form the binary sequence 00001001 00000101 (0x0905 in hexadecimal). This is the code point of the character, represented as U+0905.
The code point U+0905 (see official chart) represents the Hindi letter "अ" in the Unicode character set.
Example Text Files
Now that we understood the design of UTF-8, let's look at a file that contains the following text:
1. Text file contains: Hey👋 Buddy
The text Hey👋 Buddy has both English characters and an emoji character on it. The text file with this text saved on the disk will have the following 13 bytes in it:
01001000 01100101 01111001 11110000 10011111 10010001 10001011 00100000 01000010 01110101 01100100 01100100 01111001
Let's evaluate this file byte-by-byte following the UTF-8 decoding rules:



Byte
Explanation



01001000
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1001000 represent the letter 'H'. (open in playground)


01100101
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1100101 represent the letter 'e'. (open in playground)


01111001
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1111001 represent the letter 'y'. (open in playground)


11110000
Starts with 11110, indicating it's the first byte of a four-byte character.


10011111
Starts with 10, indicating it's a continuation byte.


10010001
Starts with 10, indicating it's a continuation byte.


10001011
Starts with 10, indicating it's a continuation byte.The bits from these four bytes (excluding the leading bits) combine to form the binary sequence 00001 11110100 01001011, which is 1F44B in hexadecimal, corresponds to the code point U+1F44B. This code point represents the waving hand emoji "👋" in the Unicode character set (open in playground).


00100000
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 0100000 represent a whitespace character. (open in playground)


01000010
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1000010 represent the letter 'B'. (open in playground)


01110101
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1110101 represent the letter 'u'. (open in playground)


01100100
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1100100 represent the letter 'd'. (open in playground)


01100100
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1100100 represent the letter 'd'. (open in playground)


01111001
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1111001 represent the letter 'y'. (open in playground)


Now this is a valid UTF-8 file, but it doesn't have to be "backward compatible" with ASCII because it contains a non-ASCII character (the emoji). Next let's create a file that contains only ASCII characters.
2. Text file contains: Hey Buddy
The text file doesn't have any non-ASCII characters. The file saved on the disk has the following 9 bytes in it:
01001000 01100101 01111001 00100000 01000010 01110101 01100100 01100100 01111001
Let's evaluate this file byte-by-byte following the UTF-8 decoding rules:



Byte
Explanation



01001000
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1001000 represent the letter 'H'. (open in playground)


01100101
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1100101 represent the letter 'e'. (open in playground)


01111001
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1111001 represent the letter 'y'. (open in playground)


00100000
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 0100000 represent a whitespace character. (open in playground)


01000010
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1000010 represent the letter 'B'. (open in playground)


01110101
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1110101 represent the letter 'u'. (open in playground)


01100100
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1100100 represent the letter 'd'. (open in playground)


01100100
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1100100 represent the letter 'd'. (open in playground)


01111001
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1111001 represent the letter 'y'. (open in playground)


So this is a valid UTF-8 file, and it is also a valid ASCII file. The bytes in this file follows both the UTF-8 and ASCII encoding rules. This is how UTF-8 is designed to be backward compatible with ASCII.
Other Encodings
I did a quick research on any other encoding that are backward compatible with ASCII, and there are a few, but they are not as popular as UTF-8, for example GB 18030 (a Chinese government standard). Another one is the ISO/IEC 8859 encodings are single-byte encodings that extend ASCII to include additional characters, but they are limited to 256 characters.
The siblings of UTF-8, like UTF-16 and UTF-32, are not backward compatible with ASCII. For example, the letter 'A' in UTF-16 is represented as: 00 41 (two bytes), while in UTF-32 it is represented as: 00 00 00 41 (four bytes).
Bonus: UTF-8 Playground
When I was exploring the UTF-8 encoding, I couldn't find any good tool to interactively visualize how UTF-8 encoding works. So I built UTF-8 Playground to visualize and play around with UTF-8 encoding. Give it a try!.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Launching Dear Greenpeace back in 2023When I launched Dear Greenpeace with my fellow youth climate activists alongside WePlanet two years ago, I had no idea just how quickly the anti-nuclear dominoes would fall across Europe. In 2023, and what seems like a lifetime ago, Austria launched their legal action against the European Commission for the inclusion of nuclear energy in the EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy. At the time they were supported by a bulwark of EU countries and environmental NGOs that opposed nuclear energy. Honestly, it looked like they might win.But today, that whole landscape has changed.Germany, long a symbol of anti-nuclear politics, is beginning to shift. The nuclear phase-outs or bans in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, and Italy are now history. Even Fridays for Future has quietened its opposition, and in some places, embraced nuclear power.This moment matters.It shows what’s possible when we stick to the science. The evidence only gets clearer by the day that nuclear energy has an extremely low environmental impact across its lifecycle, and strong regulations and safety culture ensure that it remains one of the safest forms of energy available to humanity. The European Court of Justice has now fully dismissed Austria’s lawsuit. That ruling doesn’t just uphold nuclear energy’s place in EU green finance rules. It also signals a near-certain defeat for the ongoing Greenpeace case – the very lawsuit that inspired me to launch Dear Greenpeace in the first place.But instead of learning from this, Greenpeace is doubling down. Martin Kaiser, Executive Director of Greenpeace Germany, called the court decision “a dark day for the climate”.Let that sink in. The highest court in the EU just reaffirmed that nuclear energy meets the scientific and environmental standards to be included in sustainable finance, and Greenpeace still refuses to budge.Meanwhile, the climate crisis gets worse. Global emissions are not falling fast enough. Billions of people still lack access to clean, reliable electricity. And we are forced to spend time defending proven solutions instead of scaling them.Announcing our inclusion in the case between Greenpeace and the EU CommissionIt’s now up to the court whether we will get our time in court to outline the evidence in support of nuclear energy and the important role it can play in the global clean energy transition. Whether in court, on the streets, or in the halls of parliaments across the globe, we will be there to defend the science and ensure that nuclear power can spread the advantages of the modern world across the planet in a sustainable, reliable and dignified way.Austria stands increasingly isolated among a handful of countries that still cling to their opposition to nuclear energy. Their defeat in this vital high stakes topic is a success not just for the nuclear movement, but for the global transition as a whole. We have made real progress. Together, we’ve helped defend nuclear power in the EU, overturned outdated policies at the World Bank, and secured more technology-neutral language at the UN. These wins are not abstract. They open the door to real investment, real projects, and real emissions cuts.But the work is not done.We still need to overturn national nuclear bans, unlock more funding, and push democratic countries to support clean energy development abroad: especially where it is most needed to compete with Russia’s growing influence.The fight will not be done until every single country in the world can boast a clean, reliable energy grid, ready to maintain a modern dignified standard of living, for everyone, everywhere.This is a great success for the movement and it would not have been possible without the financial support, time and energy given by people like you.In Solidarity,

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
          

  

  
    When a legal takedown request arrives, whether it’s about copyright,
censorship, privacy, or something more vague, how a Free and Open Source
Software (FOSS) project responds can make all the difference.

Handled well, a takedown request can be a manageable administrative step. Handled poorly, it can cause panic, disrupt infrastructure, or even put contributors at legal risk.

As part of our legal resilience research, we spoke with a range of legal experts, software freedom advocates, and maintainers of mature FOSS infrastructure to understand how others manage these moments. In this article, we share what we learned, and how F-Droid is incorporating these lessons into its own approach.

A Pattern Emerges

Despite differences in jurisdiction, size, and mission, a few common themes
from our research emerged when we asked how other projects handle takedown
requests:

1. Don’t Be a Soft Target

Legal threats often follow the path of least resistance. FOSS projects that
publish a formal takedown policy, require legal submissions through specific
channels, and insist on a valid legal basis are much less likely to receive,
or comply with, vague or harassing demands.

One FOSS organization, for example, requires all legal correspondence to be submitted by postal mail in the national language and citing local law. Most complaints evaporate once asked to comply.

2. Creating a transparent and documented process

Several digital rights organizations advised setting up structured response
steps:


  Require submissions to a dedicated legal@ or abuse@ email.
  Insist on full documentation: legal basis, jurisdiction, evidence of the
infringement and identity of the complainant.
  Review for sufficiency, proportionality, and standing before acting.


This creates proper documentation to process valid claims, while protecting projects from illegitimate or unfounded requests.

3. Use Jurisdiction Strategically

Projects based in civil law jurisdictions, particularly in Europe, are often
better positioned to deflect legal demands from foreign entities. Several
organizations emphasized that complying with vague or extrajudicial
requests, especially those originating outside your jurisdiction, can
increase risk unnecessarily. Instead, they recommended requiring a valid
legal basis grounded in the project’s home country. Formal legal processes,
such as court orders or official government channels, were seen as the
appropriate threshold, not informal emails or unverifiable demands.

Notification and Appeals: Fairness and Transparency

All of the projects we consulted emphasized the importance of notifying
developers whose apps are being targeted, informing them (if possible) of
the seriousness of the claim, and the proposed strategy F-Droid is taking to
handle the claim. 

If a threat is deemed to be valid and a developer’s content is flagged for
takedown:


  The developer or maintainer is informed, unless prohibited by law (gag
orders).
  A window for response (commonly 14 days) is offered, unless unfeasible due
to seriousness and time restraints of the request itself
  If the developer disputes the claim and provides supporting information
(e.g. license, public domain status, fair use justification), the claim is
reviewed.
  If the claim is upheld, the content is removed, but always with an
internal record and opportunity to appeal.


This mirrors principles embedded in international norms (like the Manila Principles and GitHub’s DMCA takedown policy) and avoids overcompliance with weak or abusive claims.

Transparency, Censorship, and What You Can (Legally) Publish

Takedown requests occupy a complex space between legal enforcement and
censorship. While some are legitimate claims, like copyright violations or
privacy breaches, others are vague, politically motivated, or intended to
silence dissent. For FOSS projects that have a global user base, it’s not
always obvious how to respond. Complying too quickly can reinforce
censorship practices; resisting without process can lead to full website
shut downs, domain names being taken
away
(as in the US) or large and costly legal
battles.

One strategy that helps balance this tension is radical
transparency. Several projects we spoke with emphasized the importance of
documenting what actions were taken and why, not just for accountability,
but as a form of resistance. A well-known example is GitHub’s DMCA takedown
policy (as of July 2025), which mandates compliance with valid takedown
requests, but also posts each one publicly in their github/dmca
repository. The result: potential abusers
know their requests will face public scrutiny, which acts as a deterrent.

However, not all jurisdictions allow this kind of transparency. In India,
for example, we were informed that it is often illegal to disclose that you
have received a government request, even to the developer of the affected
app. In contrast, in Russia, takedown requests can often be legally
posted, though by doing so you may be
putting yourself at risk for retaliation, additional takedown requests and
legal troubles.

With that in mind, some best practices for FOSS projects include:


  Publishing biannual transparency reports, even if redacted or aggregated.
  Maintaining an internal log of all takedown activity, with public
disclosure where legally possible.
  Explaining the general reasons for content removals, who made the request,
under what law, and what action was taken, unless legally prohibited.
  Being explicit about what cannot be shared, and why.


Transparency won’t prevent all forms of censorship, but it can slow them
down, raise awareness, and provide a record that strengthens the broader
FOSS ecosystem.

What We’re Doing at F-Droid

F-Droid is revising its own takedown policy, informed by:


  Dutch law and EU regulations
  The structural support provided by The Commons Conservancy
  Practical lessons from long-standing FOSS organizations


Our draft process includes:


  Written takedown submission request to legal@f-droid.org including the
   required information.:



  Identify the specific material in question (e.g. app name)
  Include valid legal basis under applicable jurisdiction (e.g. copyright
  law, court order statutory basis)
  Indicate jurisdiction in which the legal basis is claimed to apply
  Include sufficient evidence of the alleged infringement (e.g. copyright
  certificate, ownership declaration)
  Clearly state that the complaintant is authorized to act on behalf of the
  rights holder
  Include full contact details and a verifiable identity (subject to
  exceptions, such as gag orders or whistleblower protection)



  Verification of jurisdiction and legal basis, including evidence
  Developer notification and appeal procedures
  Rejection of requests lacking documentation or legal authority may be
   rejected or ignored
  Biannual transparency reports and public tracking of takedown requests


We’re also working to improve contributor education about potential exposure
when contributing to F-Droid, document internal escalation paths, and ensure
consistent handling of international claims.

Final Thoughts

Takedown requests are not going away in fact, they’re becoming more frequent
and more complex. But FOSS projects don’t have to face them unprepared.

By building processes, establishing clear jurisdiction, and protecting individuals through structure and policy, we can handle these challenges with the seriousness they deserve without letting them derail our mission.

                Use the right tool for the job.
            
            

            

            
            
            In my first interview out of college I was asked the change counter problem:

Given a set of coin denominations, find the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given number. IE for USA coinage and 37 cents, the minimum number is four (quarter, dime, 2 pennies).

I implemented the simple greedy algorithm and immediately fell into the trap of the question: the greedy algorithm only works for "well-behaved" denominations. If the coin values were [10, 9, 1], then making 37 cents would take 10 coins in the greedy algorithm but only 4 coins optimally (10+9+9+9). The "smart" answer is to use a dynamic programming algorithm, which I didn't know how to do. So I failed the interview.
But you only need dynamic programming if you're writing your own algorithm. It's really easy if you throw it into a constraint solver like MiniZinc and call it a day. 
int: total;
array[int] of int: values = [10, 9, 1];
array[index_set(values)] of var 0..: coins;

constraint sum (c in index_set(coins)) (coins[c] * values[c]) == total;
solve minimize sum(coins);

You can try this online here. It'll give you a prompt to put in total and then give you successively-better solutions:
coins = [0, 0, 37];
----------
coins = [0, 1, 28];
----------
coins = [0, 2, 19];
----------
coins = [0, 3, 10];
----------
coins = [0, 4, 1];
----------
coins = [1, 3, 0];
----------


Lots of similar interview questions are this kind of mathematical optimization problem, where we have to find the maximum or minimum of a function corresponding to constraints. They're hard in programming languages because programming languages are too low-level. They are also exactly the problems that constraint solvers were designed to solve. Hard leetcode problems are easy constraint problems.1 Here I'm using MiniZinc, but you could just as easily use Z3 or OR-Tools or whatever your favorite generalized solver is.
More examples
This was a question in a different interview (which I thankfully passed):

Given a list of stock prices through the day, find maximum profit you can get by buying one stock and selling one stock later.

It's easy to do in O(n^2) time, or if you are clever, you can do it in O(n). Or you could be not clever at all and just write it as a constraint problem:
array[int] of int: prices = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8];
var int: buy;
var int: sell;
var int: profit = prices[sell] - prices[buy];

constraint sell > buy;
constraint profit > 0;
solve maximize profit;

Reminder, link to trying it online here. While working at that job, one interview question we tested out was:

Given a list, determine if three numbers in that list can be added or subtracted to give 0? 

This is a satisfaction problem, not a constraint problem: we don't need the "best answer", any answer will do. We eventually decided against it for being too tricky for the engineers we were targeting. But it's not tricky in a solver; 
include "globals.mzn";
array[int] of int: numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8];
array[index_set(numbers)] of var {0, -1, 1}: choices;

constraint sum(n in index_set(numbers)) (numbers[n] * choices[n]) = 0;
constraint count(choices, -1) + count(choices, 1) = 3;
solve satisfy;

Okay, one last one, a problem I saw last year at Chipy AlgoSIG. Basically they pick some leetcode problems and we all do them. I failed to solve this one:

Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.


The "proper" solution is a tricky thing involving tracking lots of bookkeeping states, which you can completely bypass by expressing it as constraints:
array[int] of int: numbers = [2,1,5,6,2,3];

var 1..length(numbers): x; 
var 1..length(numbers): dx;
var 1..: y;

constraint x + dx <= length(numbers);
constraint forall (i in x..(x+dx)) (y <= numbers[i]);

var int: area = (dx+1)*y;
solve maximize area;

output ["(\(x)->\(x+dx))*\(y) = \(area)"]

There's even a way to automatically visualize the solution (using vis_geost_2d), but I didn't feel like figuring it out in time for the newsletter.
Is this better?
Now if I actually brought these questions to an interview the interviewee could ruin my day by asking "what's the runtime complexity?" Constraint solvers runtimes are unpredictable and almost always slower than an ideal bespoke algorithm because they are more expressive, in what I refer to as the capability/tractability tradeoff. But even so, they'll do way better than a bad bespoke algorithm, and I'm not experienced enough in handwriting algorithms to consistently beat a solver.
The real advantage of solvers, though, is how well they handle new constraints. Take the stock picking problem above. I can write an O(n²) algorithm in a few minutes and the O(n) algorithm if you give me some time to think. Now change the problem to

Maximize the profit by buying and selling up to max_sales stocks, but you can only buy or sell one stock at a given time and you can only hold up to max_hold stocks at a time?

That's a way harder problem to write even an inefficient algorithm for! While the constraint problem is only a tiny bit more complicated:
include "globals.mzn";
int: max_sales = 3;
int: max_hold = 2;
array[int] of int: prices = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8];
array [1..max_sales] of var int: buy;
array [1..max_sales] of var int: sell;
array [index_set(prices)] of var 0..max_hold: stocks_held;
var int: profit = sum(s in 1..max_sales) (prices[sell[s]] - prices[buy[s]]);

constraint forall (s in 1..max_sales) (sell[s] > buy[s]);
constraint profit > 0;

constraint forall(i in index_set(prices)) (stocks_held[i] = (count(s in 1..max_sales) (buy[s] <= i) - count(s in 1..max_sales) (sell[s] <= i)));
constraint alldifferent(buy ++ sell);
solve maximize profit;

output ["buy at \(buy)\n", "sell at \(sell)\n", "for \(profit)"];


Most constraint solving examples online are puzzles, like Sudoku or "SEND + MORE = MONEY". Solving leetcode problems would be a more interesting demonstration. And you get more interesting opportunities to teach optimizations, like symmetry breaking.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[August 31, 2025

Over the past several years, I've enjoyed the hobby of paper
modeling (or papercraft), the art
of creating 3D models from cut and glued parts from paper sheets. This hobby is
a superset of origami, in that it allows for cutting and gluing, as well as for
multiple sheets of paper for a single model. The alleviation of these
constraints means that papercraft allows for more complex models that are easier
to assemble.
Over many years, I've built models designed by others as well as designed my
own. In this post, I want to share everything I've learned along the way,
covering the entire process from design to assembly.
I love this hobby for three reasons:

It is extremely accessible. There is no fancy hardware or software
involved. As we'll see, the core tools are paper, scissors, and glue;
everything else is an addon to make the experience better. All software tools
can be free. Accidentally messed up during assembly and need a replacement
part? Just print out another page. The entire creation of a model can be done
in the ballpark of a few cents.
It is equally technical and creative. As we'll see, many of the problems
faced in papercraft require an engineering-like approach and a willingness to
experiment and iterate on designs. While it may appear outwardly like a craft
project, the end-to-end process involves constraints and optimizing within
them.
There's no limits on what you can make. What you decide to build is
limited by your patience and imagination. Theoretically, nearly any object can
be represented as a paper model.

Let's dive in. My most recent model is a papercraft plane inspired by the SR-71
Blackbird, a
reconnaissance plane that to this day holds many records for being one of the
fastest aircrafts ever. It's now one of most iconic planes ever designed and an
engineering masterpiece. The program was ultimately retired in 1999.
The model we'll be desiging and assembling in this post
An actual SR-71 Blackbird, By USAF / Judson Brohmer - Armstrong Photo Gallery, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=30816
We're going to walk through the full model design and assembly process, while
referencing specific examples I encountered during creating this SR-71.
Constraints#
Let's set some constraints for how we're allowed to model our creation. These
are self-imposed limitations that fit my preferred-style for model design:

All parts in the assembled model must be made of paper.
Each part must be a single, solid color. The parts must not use any printed
textures or designs.
The model must be represented as a simple
polyhedron. There may be
no curvatures, holes, two-dimensional surfaces, or surface-to-surface contact.
If the figure we're trying to capture has any of these features, we must find
a way to approximate it using only flat faces. The object must be manifold (an
edge is only shared by 2 faces).

Why constraints?#
It may feel weird to impose constraints on an art. However, I find that these
constraints encourage a better designed model that can be assembled easily and
predictably, including by others.
Using features like curvatures, printing with textures, etc. are shortcuts. For
example, printing textures helps fill in details that aren't captured inherently
by the model; curvatures and 2d surfaces are flimsy and introduce variances in
how a model can be assembled. Simply polyhedral designs with single color parts
ensure that the 3D form itself captures the object being depicted, and can be
assembled in a structurally sound, predictable way.
Goals#
In addition to constraints, we also have some goals that we're optimzing for.
These goals will be considered in each step of our design process.

Ease of assembly: By far the most important goal, our model should be
easy to put together. Given the nature of paper and glue, a model that is
difficult to assemble will almost certainly look bad. A model can have a
well-designed topology, but still be difficult to assemble based on the parts
design we put together.
Aesthetic appeal: This is an art, after all. The model we design should
be aesthetically pleasing and resemble the object of interest.
Minimal consumption of resources: We should aim to minimize waste and use
our materials efficiently.

As in engineering, we have to consider trade-offs between these goals, and
optimize for these goals within our constraints.
Steps#
The process of designing a paper model is iterative. Each iteration consists of
the following steps:

Mesh modeling - using software to create a 3D polyhedron mesh of our desired form
Mesh unfolding - unfolding the mesh into a 2D layout of parts
Assembly - putting the parts together to create the final model

The remainder of this article will be walking through each step in detail. The
discussion of each step will be centered around the goals and constraints
declared from above.
Mesh Modeling#
Related goals: Ease of assembly, aesthetic appeal
In this phase, we design the mesh for our model. We aim to capture the essence
of an object in a way that can feasibly be built with paper. Depending on how
you approach this, this can easily be the most complicated step.
What do I mean by "feasibly built with paper"? Our mesh is a collection of
polygons that represent a 3D object. The closeness of that representation is
largely determined by how many polygons we use. We could use many really small
polygons to closely match the subtle curves of our plane, but this would be hard
to assemble in reality. Alternatively, we could simplifiy our representation
down to a triangular pyramid. This would be trivially easy to assemble, but it
wouldn't look a lot like our plane.
We can now see that our goals of ease of assembly and aesthetic appeal are at
odds. Imagine that we have a continuum, where on the left we have a triangular
pyramid (the simplest possible polyhedron) and on the right we have a mesh of
the SR-71 with an arbitrarily high number (millions) of polygons.
Our mesh can exist anywhere between the simplest polyhedron and a mesh with near perfect resolution. The example on the right is by USSIowa on Thingiverse (Creative Commons - Attribution): https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5508640
Generally, an "easy" to assemble model will have somewhere around a few hundred
polygons. Thus, our ideal model exists somewhere on the far left of this
spectrum.
The challenge here is what I call "allocation of resolution" - we have a finite
number of polygons to distribute across the features of our object. Certain
features will naturally require more polygons to be accurately captured than
others. For example, curved features require more polygons than flat features -
in this model, the cylindrical engines will require more detail, than say, the
flat wings.
In addition to the number of polygons and their concentrations, the arrangement
of the polygons themselves matters - this is the topology of the mesh. Most
discourse on 3D mesh topology is related to shading and animation. For our
purposes, we're considered with ease of assembly. Certain topologies are easier
to assemble and more structurally sound. Generally, here's some positive
topological qualities for papercraft:

Symmetries: a good mesh design is symetrical when possible. Symmetrical shapes
are intuitive and easier to reason about when assembling.
No narrow shapes: really narrow shapes are hard to cut out, hard to fold, and
hard to glue. Avoid them at all costs.
Use quads: quad faces have an aesthetic appeal to them.

If all of this is sounding hard, we've got some options, in increasing order of
difficulty:
Easy: Use an existing mesh#
The easiest way past this step is to find an existing mesh. There's a whole
genre of 3D modeling called "low-poly" that you can find with a quick search on
Thingiverse or
Printables. These are
usually designed for video games or 3D printing, but can be taken up for
papercraft.
Medium: Converting an existing mesh#
Sometimes, you can find a high-resolution mesh of your desired object, but not a
low-poly one. In this case, there are tools available to reduce the polygon
count while preserving the overall shape. This is called "mesh simplification"
or "mesh decimation."
This Instructable
goes over the process of doing this with Meshlab,
but there's many other software alternatives out there.
The pitfall of this approach is that automatic mesh decimation typically results
in some nasty topologies, and there's not a lot you can do to control the
output. To get around this, we could add an additional refinement step where
we take the raw decimated mesh output and "clean it up" using a mesh editor
software.
As an example, let's try this with a SR-71 mesh on
Thingiverse. The original mesh has
more than 1.2 million faces, and we're going to try decimating down to ~1,000.
Here's what we get from Meshlab:
Result of mesh decimation in Meshlab
In this case, the output is not usable - it's wildly asymetric and is full of
self-intersections. Refining this topology would take just as long (if not
longer) as creating a model from scratch.
Hard: Creating your own mesh#
The most difficult option is to create your own mesh from scratch. This option
gives you full control over the design, and is what I chose for the SR-71 model.
My software of choice for this is Blender. Blender
has a steep learning curve, but the type of mesh design we're doing for this
project doesn't begin to scratch the surface of its full capabilities. I highly
recommend this low-poly tutorial
if you've never used Blender before and need somewhere to start. Two things I
found very handy were the mirror
modifier
to enforce symmetry, and the 3D Print
Toolbox
to auto-cleanup the mesh and check for manifoldness.
This process is very tedious. My advice here is: simplify your mesh to the point
where you feel uncomfortable. Recall that we're largely optimizing for ease of
assembly. When modeling, it's very tempting to capture finer details, but fine
details have costs (small parts, hard to glue regions, etc.) that are not worth
it during the assembly phase. Scrutinize every feature, and zoom out once in a
while. When you zoom out, your omissions won't feel as weird.
After many days, here's the initial mesh I created. It contains 732 triangles.
Note the symmetry along the y-axis.
Initial mesh created with Blender
Mesh Unfolding#
Related goals: Ease of assembly, minimal consumption of resources
Once we have a mesh, we have to convert it into a 2D template of parts that can
be printed and assembled. This process is called unfolding. Each of the
faces of our mesh are grouped into parts, and the arrangement of our parts
is a layout, or template.
To do this, we're going to turn to software again. The most popular unfolding
tool (and my favorite) is Pepakura
Designer. Pepakura is not free (at the
time of this writing, it's a one time $70 purchase) and it only runs on
Windows. There's also Unfolder for Mac, which is
$30. If you can't use either of these, Blender can save the day again with its
free Paper Model
plugin.
I believe that the unfolding step is one that does not get as much attention as
it deserves. There is a noticable difference between a good template and a bad
one. A good template has parts that make intuitive sense, with logical groupings
and clear flow. The faces themselves are grouped into parts that are easy to cut
out and handle. All of this equates to a better building experience, which means
a better looking model.
Part of unfolding is also deciding the scale of your model. You can make your
model as big or small as you want, but again, ease of assembly should be top of
mind when deciding. A model that's too small will end up with parts that are
hard to cut out and fold. Bigger models are easier to assemble, but you're
limited to the point where the faces of your model must fit on a page.
I ended up making this model 25 inches long. With the original SR-71 being about
107 feet long, this puts our model at around a 1:50 ratio.
Creating many parts#
Let's start off with the creation of parts. In most unfolding software, the
software will auto-unfold for you, and from there you can regroup faces into
whatever parts you want. Here's Pepakura's auto unfold:
Pepakura default unfolding produces complex parts
The parts it generated are pretty complicated, so we have some work to do.
If you have a mesh with nn faces, you can have anywhere from 1 (all the faces
in a single part) to nn total parts (each part is a single face). We want our
model to be easy to assemble, and neither of these extremes are easy.
Rather than trying to fix the number of parts and going from there, I recommend
creating parts that are logical. Identify features that can be captured in a
single part, and go from there. For example, in the SR-71, each engine intake
spike makes sense as a single part. So does the nose cone.
If your mesh has an axis of symmetry, then your parts have symmetrical pairings
as well. The same feature on either side of the axis should be represented with
a mirrored part. In the SR-71, the entire plane is symmetrical on the vertical
axis, so all parts across this axis are mirrored. This is good because once
someone builds one side, they can more easily reason about the other side.
I ended up dividing this model into 42 parts. These parts were carefully divided
in such a way that I felt would make them easier to assemble. If you look at any
part in particular, chances are it'll have a symmetric counterpart.
Finalized parts for the layout
They're arranged pretty haphazardly right now, but we'll cleanup this up in the
next step.
Arranging the parts#
Again, most software will automatically arrange the parts for you as part of
unfolding. Here's the 14 page arrangement Pepakura decided for the parts I created:
Auto arrangement of parts by Pepakura
I highlighted all the parts on the first two pages so you can see where the are
on the finished model. Notice that they're scattered throughout different
sections. That's why I typically don't like auto-arrangement - they're designed
to minimize paper usage, but they often result in a less intuitive assembly
process. You can't look at any particular page and loosely know where its parts
will go.
A good part layout reads like a story. Parts are arranged in a logical
order, with related parts grouped together. I like to arrange mine left to
right, top to bottom on a page. Here's my layout, with the first two pages
highlighted.
Manual arrangement of parts, which now has logical groupings
All the parts that are near each other in the layout are also near each other in
the final assembly. In this case, I even was able to reduce the page count down
to 12 from the starting 14.
Flap structure#
Flaps, or tabs, are the appendages on each part that allow for gluing
parts together. Each flap has a singular counterpart edge that it's glued to -
this is known as an edge/flap pair. Most software will auto-assign a shared
number between an edge and its flap to make identify pairs easy during the
assembly process.
Two edge/flap pairs, with arrows pointing to their matching number IDs
For an edge/flap pair, most unfolding software will allow us to swap the flap
across parts. Doing this strategically is critical for creating an easy to
assemble model, and also has implications for the structural integrity of the
final build.
For example, consider the two example parts shown above. These two parts that
meet at two shared edges, so these parts have two edge/flap pairs between them.
We could arrange the flaps so that one part has both of them:
Arranging both flaps on the same side
We could also interlace the flaps, so each part has one flap on each side.
Arranging flaps as interlaced, with one flap on each part
Interlacing flaps between parts can create a more stable structure, since
there's only one way for the parts to meet. If two flaps are on the same side,
they can over-extend when glued to the edge. That being said, same-side flaps
can be easier to work with, especially when reaching the closing stages of a
model.
In general, I like to using interlaced flaps wherever possible to create an
overall stronger model, and use same-side flaps selectively.
Once we have an arrangement we like, we can export our layout as a PDF.
Assembly#
With our layout PDF ready, we can now print it and move on to assembly. We'll
finally get to see our design come to life.
Materials and Tools#
For our materials, we'll need:

65lb (176 g/m2g/m^2) cardstock: This is the ideal paper weight for creating
sturdy models, while still being thin/flexible enough to pass through a normal
printer and be easy to fold.
Adhesive. My recommended adhesive is tacky glue: it's strong, dries clear, but
is forgiving enough to allow for repositioning during assembly. Specifically,
I use Aleene's Original Tacky
Glue.
I've also had past success with a glue stick.

We'll also need some tools, which I've listed these in order of importance. The
ones with asterisks are essential. Everything else is a nice-to-have.

Printer*: You'll need access to a printer to print the template on the
cardstock. Laser jet printers are great because the prints don't smudge.
Cutting tools*: You'll need a pair of scissors or a craft knife to cut
out the parts. Use sharp tools for clean cuts - it makes a difference.
Ruler*: Cutting/scoring perfectly straight lines is a must. Steel rulers
are great for their consistent edge, and they don't catch against your tools.
That being said, I used a clear plastic ruler for this model. Being able to
see through the ruler helps with alignment.
Scoring tool*: This will help you prepare a part for folding. You can use
a bone folder or scoring wheel. I use an embossing tool I found at a dollar
store, but before that, I used a ballpoint pen than ran out of ink. Anything
with a precise (but not too sharp) tip will do.
Toothpicks: I use toothpicks to spread blobs of glue into thin layers and
get into tight spaces.
Assembly surface: A cutting mat or piece of cardboard will protect your
work surface and give you a stable surface to cut/score your parts.
Tweezers: Tweezers are helpful for handling small parts and getting into
tight spaces, especially while holding parts together as glue dries.

If you want to get fancy, you can also purchase an automatic cutting machine,
like a Cricut or
Silhouette. These machines can precisely
cut/score your parts from cardstock. Getting the template into their software
takes some extra effort, but it results in the best quality parts. I did not use
a machine for this project.
To match the real SR-71, I printed my template on black cardstock. Darker
cardstocks are harder to work with because of the low contrast between the ink
and the paper itself. If you're new to the hobby, I would recommend starting
with a lighter color.
Assembly phases#
The assembly of a model has 4 steps:

Cutting: Cutting the parts out from the paper with your cutting tool of
choice. Scissors are quicker, but the combination of ruler and craft knife
results in cleaner cuts.
Scoring: Running a scoring tool over fold lines to get cleaner folds. This
may be tempting to skip, but I cannot emphasize the importance of this step
enough. Scoring is especially important when dealing with thicker paper.
Folding: Folding the parts in prep for gluing. There's only two types of
folds: mountain folds and valley folds.
Gluing: Gluing the parts together.

How you decide to batch these steps is up to you. For example, you could cut all
the parts out at once, then score all of them, etc. This approach is effective
because you can develop a rhythm by doing each phase only once, so you're not
constantly switching between tools; the downside is that you only get to start
assembly after a pretty lengthy process. Alternatively, you can do it per part:
cut one part out, score it, fold it, and secure it to the assembly. Here, the
pros and cons are flipped: you get to see the model come together quicker, but
there's a lot of context switching between phases. I've tried both of these
approaches, and find that the latter results in a non-negligible increase in the
assembly time of the model.
To strike a balance, the approach I took for this model was performing the
phases at the granularity of sections (engines, wings, fuselage, etc.) of the
model. This approach has the added final step of assembling all the standalone
sections together into the final model.
Here's some pictures I took during the assembly process. In total, assembly took
6-8 hours.

Tips#
Use little glue: When gluing parts together, apply as little glue as
possible. Using too much glue will result in spillover when the flaps/edges are
put together, and this spillover is hard to wipe away from a porous surface like
paper. Too much glue can even result in subtle paper warping. In the recommended
tools, I suggested a toothpick. I apply a small bead of glue to a flap and use
the toothpick to spread it into a thin film. This prevents any spillage and
keeps the model clean.
Start in complex areas: As you progress further in gluing parts together,
the degrees of freedom of your model will reduce. This is why I recommend
starting with more complicated areas of your model where you'll need those
degrees of freedom. In this model, this meant starting with precise features,
like the engine inlet spikes or the vertical stabilizers.
Finish in hidden areas: This goes hand in hand with the tip above. As you
reach to the end of your model, gluing the final parts together can be very
hard, which means the final edges may come out a bit sloppy. Why does this
happen? Any minor imperfections we made throughout the assembly process result
in stresses in our model that will be felt at the end. Gluing the last part may
be challenging because it'll feel misaligned, and it has the added challenge of
attempting to close a 3D object from the outside. That's why I always recommend
choosing an assembly order that results in the last parts being glued in an area
that is out of sight. For the SR-71, that happens to be the underside of the
fuselage.
Final Model#
Here's the final model, displayed on a stand (also made from paper):

Iteration#
No matter how much you scrutinize the modeling and layout phases, you will
inevitably find areas for improvement as you assemble. In the case of the SR-71,
I spotted a few minor assymetries in part tabs, and more importantly, an
opportunity to reduce face count by simplifying the topology of the bottom of
the plane and the nose cone.
I took my mesh back into Blender, and was able to get the triangle count down to
636, which is almost a full 100 faces fewer than the original mesh.
Second mesh iteration in Blender.
Below, you can see the old mesh (left) next to the new mesh (right). It's hard
to tell the difference, yet the new one has almost 15% fewer faces.
First mesh iteration (left) vs. latest mesh iteration (right).
A faster way to iterate is to render the model rather than physically building
it. This allows you to quickly identify and fix visual issues without going
through the hours of assembly. Here's some renders (in Blender) of the final
iteration:
Blender isometric-view rendering of final mesh.
Blender front-view rendering of final mesh.
Conclusion#
In total, the full cycle of designing the mesh, creating the parts layout,
assembly, and subsequent refinement iterations occurred over the course of a few
months. The process is long, but the results are well worth it.
If you're interested in making this model yourself, you can download the PDFs for
the first iteration of the model below. I've included a template for the stand as well.
