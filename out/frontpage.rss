Computers are for Girls

A deep dive into early home computer ads.
Late 2022

Quick link: Skip my boring ramblings and go straight
to the gallery of 1980:s home computer ads!





Toys for Boys

In the early 1980:s, roughly coinciding (give or take a few years)
with the launch of popular home computers like the Apple II, Commodore 64,
Atari 400 and TRS-80, the ratio of female applicants to enroll in computer
science dropped drastically, at least in the US. One reason given for this
is that home computers were specifically marketed as being for boys. I'm not
sure where this idea originates - possibly from British computer scientist

Wendy Hall
("... the marketing of computers to fathers and their sons turned women off computing ...",
Hall says)
- but I've seen it repeated enough times in both
journalistic
writing
and online forum posts that it seems to have become a self-evident
truth. It's on
Wikipedia,
too, but Wikipedia cites the aforementioned
NPR article
based on a Podcast episode,
which is in turn based on a
hunch or gut feeling one of the reporters had after watching some home computer commercials on Youtube.



In short, this explanation bothers me, because I simply don't think it holds up.
Let's examine!


The Swedish Situation

I dare say it's true that home computers were mostly used by boys -
at least in Sweden, when I was a geeky kid in the late eighties and early
nineties.



This is interesting, because I think Sweden at this point in time is a
useful control group.
Compared to the current state of affairs, US cultural influence here
was much weaker in the early
eighties, when many home computers were initially launched. When the C64
arrived in Sweden in 1983, there were two TV channels, both controlled by
the government and with no advertising whatsoever. Advertising aimed at
children (below 12) and youths (below 16) was (and still is, to
some extent) heavily
regulated. In fact, some of the most popular comic books and youth magazines
at this time, such as Bamse
and Kamratposten,
made a point of not running
ads at all. Those that did typically limited it to two or three pages per
issue and it was mostly ads for traditional toys or candy.
Yet, home computing was still mostly a nerdy boys' club.


The Contemporary Situation

To the best of my knowledge, computers and computing devices have now, for well over a decade and a half, been thrust into the hands of both girls and boys from a very early age. Contemporary tech advertising targets pretty much anyone who can breathe, and various campaigns have been launched specifically for increasing womens' interest in computer science. Looking at data presented in 
this article from Berkeley School of Information, we can see that while the proportional drop of female CS graduates did coincide with the advent of personal computers, it hasn't bounced back, either. Eighties computer ads must really have been some strong stuff if they're still affecting kids who grew up with iPhones glued to their hands.



Girls Welcome


When home computers were launched, it seems even the manufacturers didn't
quite know what to make of them. Of course everybody knew they were for
games, but what else were they good for? Plenty of use cases, some more
contrived than others, were made up: Keep track of your recipes, give yourself
an edge in school work, do your home accounts and write nice letters to
grandma.



Some products have been and are still marketed exclusively at either boys
or girls, but I'm of the firm conviction that home computers aren't one
of them. It's true that there were ads for home computers clearly directed
at boys - but there were also plenty directed at girls, families and of course
at nobody in particular - that is to say, at everyone.


Ad Gallery


But what do I have to show for it? Maybe I'm also in the pocket of
Big Home Computing, trying to cover up a scandal they'd rather forget?
Let's take a stroll down print ad lane and look at a few examples.




Smiling Faces




I haven't played Facemaker, but I'm sure this young girl was paid
handsomely to look this happy about it. Remember kids, if your parents
want you to play a computer game, it's probably educational.
(The good news is that your parents probably don't know squat about
computers; just slip a copy of Space Invaders into the disk cover,
nobody will know!)




Your Match in Smugness




I'm afraid there's no ambiguity here; this software is clearly educational
and should be avoided at all costs. Aren't computers supposed
to be fun?




Beep bEeEp beEEp BOOP




Yeah, this family is smiling now, but after a few more hours of the kids
"composing" on a cheap sawtooth generator I'm sure the feelings will be
more mixed.




Run Away Already!




Look at how happy they are, having been conned into thinking they're playing
games when they're actually studying. The fools!




Triangulation




I mean, I know it's educational in some way but that's some pretty damn cool
graphics programming, worthy of the demo scene. For once, the astounded faces
don't seem out of place.




Solo Lire 1,290,000




Yes, for the small sum of 1.3 million lire, you can be as successful as
this Italian businesswoman. But then again we all know that Atari delivers
power - without the price.




Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh




I'm not going to write anything silly here, because this is an interesting ad.
It's practically begging girls to attend Atari's computer camps: surely
not something you'd do if you wanted to market your product solely at boys.




Space Dog




This ad really hits hard in the nostalgia department. It captures the essence
of getting lost in the magical world of your home
computer: Exploring, discovering, forgetting about the dull minutiae
of real life for just a little while. Ah, to be young again, and so on.




Laser Explosion




Even a cheap Apple II knock-off will make your family at least 36% happier!




Swedish Youth




- Where have you been?
- Outside!
- What did you do?
- Nothing!

Yes, it's true. Home computers will keep your kids off drugs and
away from shoplifting and other petty crime. Except software piracy.
There's going to be a lot of that.




Model Citizens




They look sort of... boring, don't they? I bet it's more of that
educational software. Run away kids, run away!




Games for Girls




This girl's game looks suspiciously like a boy's game. Perhaps because
they were the same.




Merry Christmas




The first thing you do on Christmas morning is of course to hook up your
awesome new home computer and start writing BASIC. Look at how the father
is desperately proffering some other gift, but his daughter isn't having
any of it. She knows it's probably educational software. Stay strong, kiddo,
you'll be coding triangles too if you keep this up!




It's not RAM!




Admit it, with a setup like this, you'd have a smile like that on your face, too.
A ten megabyte hard drive? A 12" monitor? A 28-Amp power supply? The future
is already here!




Computer Viruses or Cooties?




This Swedish ad from the early 1990:s is poking fun at stereotypes:
Forget make-up, fashion, horses and pink bows. The Amiga
is a machine powerful enough for even the geekiest of girls.
It's so simple to use, even silly boys can do it.




Then Again...



The vast majority of computer ads I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot!)
looks something like this. A photo of the computer in question, perhaps
some peripherals, and a text describing how great it is and how much
software you can run on it. Not a boy, girl, woman, man or dog in sight.


Moving Pictures

What about television commercials, then? Just as with print ads, there were
those aimed just at boys - and just as with print ads, there were plenty
aimed at girls, women and families. A few examples:



  The Commodore 64 was truly a machine for everyone.


  
  





  Atari 8-bit for the youngest, 16-bit for the teens.


  
  





  The TRS-80 catered to the whole family. Of course.


  
  





  Hey, this girl is ALREADY PUBLISHING A NEWSPAPER (on her Apple II) (Yes, it's that Andrea Barber.)


  





  This average American homemaker uses her Apple II for keeping track of... gold futures? (It helps her managing her steel mill.)


  





  A precocious kid manages her gardening enterprise with an Atari.


  





  Microsoft's legendary commercial for Windows/386 from the late 1980:s, featuring a rapping business woman schooling the stuffy old mainframe geezer on concepts like memory management, virtualization and multi-tasking.


  




Final Thoughts


Why, then, did computer science see a downturn in the
proportion of female applicants during
the home computer boom? Why was home computing such a boys' club?
I don't know, really. But, even though I have a strong aversion against
advertising in general, I'm (clearly) not convinced it is to be blamed in this
particular instance. In fact, many of the examples given above hint at
a kind of quiet desperation from vendors missing out on a market
segment comprising half of the population.



Is my research method any different than that of the
NPR journalist mentioned above? Probably not, but that's part of the
point. It's not hard to find home computer ads like these -
unless you're willingly doing shoddy journalism, for whatever reason. Just type "home computer advertisement" into your search engine of choice
and see for yourself. Consider this an attempt to balance the narrative.



This page contains a curated
selection of ads, but they're certainly not outliers.
There are plenty more
advertisements and commercials targeting families, women and girls,
from all the major computer brands of the time. At least according to the
manufacturers, home computers were clearly for girls.

		As a bit of background, one of my hobbies is helping people recover data from old tape cartridges, such as QIC-80 tapes, which were a rather popular backup medium in the 1990s among individuals, small businesses, BBS operators, and the like. I have a soft spot for tape media; there’s something about the tactile sensation of holding these tapes in my hands that makes the whole process very joyful, even though QIC tapes are notorious for their many design flaws. With some careful inspection and reconditioning, the data on these tapes is still totally recoverable, even after all these years.



Whenever I receive a QIC-80 tape for recovery, I power up one of my older PC workstations which has the appropriate tape drive attached to it, and boot into a very old version of Linux (namely CentOS 3.5), because this is the only way to use the ftape driver, which is the kernel driver necessary for communicating with this tape drive, allowing the user to dump the binary contents of the tape.
You see, the drive that reads these tapes connects to the floppy controller on the motherboard. This clever hack was done as a cost-saving measure: instead of having to purchase a separate SCSI adapter (the standard interface for higher-tier tape media), you can just connect this tape drive to your floppy controller, which was already available on most PCs. It can even work alongside your existing floppy drive, on the same ribbon cable! The tradeoff, of course, is that the data rate is limited by the speed of the floppy controller, which was something like 500 Kbps (that’s kilobits, not bytes).
The other downside is that the protocol for communicating with these tape drives through the floppy controller was very messy, nonstandard, and not very well-supported. It was a “hack” in every sense: your motherboard’s BIOS had no knowledge of the tape drive being connected, and it was entirely up to the end-user software to know exactly how to manipulate the hardware I/O ports, timings, interrupts, etc. to trick the floppy controller into sending the appropriate commands to the tape drive.

There were a small number of proprietary tools for MS-DOS and Windows 3.x/9x for dealing with these drives, and only one open-source implementation for Linux, namely ftape. Of course it is possible to use those original DOS/Windows tools to read the tapes, but it’s actually only ftape that allows us to read the “raw” binary contents of the tape, regardless of which proprietary software originally wrote it, which is why I prefer it for dumping the contents and worrying afterwards about decoding the proprietary logical formatting, and then extracting the files from it.
The trouble is, the ftape driver hasn’t been supported since roughly the year 2000, and was soon removed from the Linux kernel for this reason. This is why I’ve needed to run a painfully old version of Linux anytime I have to work with one of these drives. It would be great if ftape worked on a modern distro, with all the benefits and affordances that would provide.
***
So a couple of weeks ago, it occurred to me to make a simple request to Claude Code:
> This repository is a Linux kernel driver that communicates with legacy tape drives connected to the floppy
  controller (FDC) on the motherboard. Unfortunately, this driver hasn't been maintained for a long time, and
  can only compile under kernel version 2.4. I'd like to modernize this driver, allowing it to be built with
  the latest versions of the kernel.

● I'll help you modernize this Linux kernel driver for legacy tape drives. This is a significant task that
  will require updating the code to work with modern kernel APIs and conventions.

And after several iterations of “combobulating” and whatever else Claude claims to do, I suddenly had a kernel driver that was compiling without errors. This is because Claude is able to take the compiler output and feed it back into itself, until the compilation works correctly. There was a laundry list of kernel functions and structures that were understandably deprecated or replaced, in the eternity that elapsed between kernel version 2.4 and version 6.8. Amazingly, Claude found all the outdated bits and replaced them with the correct modern equivalents, requiring just a few manual touch-ups of the code (a bit more on this later).
At this point, however, the kernel driver was still expected to be compiled as part of a full kernel tree, whereas I just wanted it to become a standalone loadable kernel module. OK, no problem:
> Is there a way to compile just this module in-place, instead of copying it into a kernel source tree?

● Yes! You can compile kernel modules out-of-tree without copying them into the kernel source. Let me create
  a proper standalone build system for the ftape driver.

…And it did. Without any further prompting. At the end of this stage, I had a loadable kernel module (.ko) that I could start trying to use with actual live hardware. Unsurprisingly, the module did not yet “work” — it was loading, but something was preventing it from communicating with the tape drive correctly. But I pressed on.
From this point forward, since loading/unloading kernel modules requires sudo, I could no longer let Claude “iterate” on such sensitive operations by itself. Luckily, the ftape driver was already generously sprinkled with logging messages (printk() calls that are printed to dmesg), so I loaded the module myself, and iteratively pasted the output of dmesg into Claude manually, and let Claude compare it to a “known-good” dmesg log that I’d previously saved from a successful tape read. After a few iterations of this, Claude identified the remaining issues preventing the module from communicating with the hardware.
● Perfect! The module has parameters that can be set. The issue is that without configuration, all the base
  addresses default to -1, which gets converted to 0xffff in the config function, causing the detection to fail.
● The "No such device or address" (ENXIO) error occurs because the ftape-internal module is not configured
  with the correct I/O port base address for your floppy controller.
  The issue is in fdc-internal.c:735-737: if fdc->sra == 0xffff, it returns -ENXIO. Since no configuration was
  provided, all values default to -1, which becomes 0xffff....

And at last, I had a kernel module that was able to a) load, b) detect the tape drive, and c) dump the contents of a test tape!

***
Using the ftape driver on a modern kernel, a feat that I thought was hopelessly out of reach, was suddenly completed over the course of two evenings.
As a giant caveat, I should note that I have a small bit of prior experience working with kernel modules, and a good amount of experience with C in general, so I don’t want to overstate Claude’s success in this scenario. As in, it wasn’t literally three prompts to get Claude to poop out a working kernel module, but rather several back-and-forth conversations and, yes, several manual fixups of the code. It would absolutely not be possible to perform this modernization without a baseline knowledge of the internals of a kernel module.
This led me to crystallize some thoughts on working with such coding agents in our current moment:
Open yourself up to a genuine collaboration with these tools.
Interacting with Claude Code felt like an actual collaboration with a fellow engineer. People like to compare it to working with a “junior” engineer, and I think that’s broadly accurate: it will do whatever you tell it to do, it’s eager to please, it’s overconfident, it’s quick to apologize and praise you for being “absolutely right” when you point out a mistake it made, and so on. Because of this, you (the human) are still the one who must provide the guardrails, make product decisions, enforce architectural guidelines, and spot potential problems as early as possible.
Be as specific as possible, making sure to use the domain-specific keywords for the task.
I’m not claiming to suddenly be an expert in prompt engineering, but the prompts that I’ve found to be most successful are ones that clearly lay out the verbal scaffolding for a feature, and then describe the gaps in the scaffolding that the LLM should fill in. (For some reason the image that comes to mind is one of those biological stem-cell scaffolds where an artificial human ear will grow.)
Develop an intuition for the kinds of tasks that are “well-suited” for an agent to complete.
These agents are not magical, and can’t do literally everything you ask. If you ask it to do something for which it’s not well-suited, you will become frustrated and prematurely reject these tools before you allow them to shine. On this point, it’s useful to learn how LLMs actually work, so that you develop a sense of their strengths and weaknesses.
Use these tools as a massive force multiplier of your own skills.
I’m sure that if I really wanted to, I could have done this modernization effort on my own. But that would have required me to learn kernel development as it was done 25 years ago. This would have probably taken me several weeks of nonstop poring over documentation that would be completely useless knowledge today. Instead of all that, I spent a couple of days chatting with an agent and having it explain to me all the things it did.
Naturally, I verified and tested the changes it made, and in the process I did end up learning a huge amount of things that will be actually useful to me in the future, such as modern kernel conventions, some interesting details of x86 architecture, as well as several command line incantations that I’ll be keeping in my arsenal.
Use these tools for rapid onboarding onto new frameworks.
I am not a kernel developer by any stretch, but this particular experience ignited a spark that might lead to more kernel-level work, and it turns out that kernel development isn’t nearly as difficult as it might sound. In another unrelated “vibe-coding” session, I built a Flutter app without having used Flutter before. If you’re like me, and your learning style is to learn by doing, these tools can radically accelerate your pace of learning new frameworks, freeing you up to do more high-level architectural thinking.
***
In any case, circling all the way back, I am now happy to say that ftape lives on! Twenty-five years after its last official release, it is once again buildable and usable on modern Linux. I’m still in the process of making some further tweaks and new feature additions, but I have already verified that it works with the floppy-based tape drives in my collection, as well as parallel-port-based drives which it also supports.

The physical setup looks very similar, but the OS is now Xubuntu 24.04, instead of CentOS 3.5! 🎉
Until next time!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[




Autumn 2025



The demo scene was recently proclaimed a UNESCO Living Cultural Heritage in Sweden, following several other European nations. As a scener, I'm not quite sure how I feel about that. It's amusing on some level, there's maybe even a bit of pride involved, but also fear that it might bring unwanted attention to a Good Thing, because Good Things are always at risk of spoiling when receiving too much attention. Then again, such worries are probably unfounded. Despite being a living cultural heritage, the demo scene is - all things considered - slowly approaching its demise.



The Scene Isn't Dead



The scene - incorporating the cracking scene of the 1980s and early 1990s - has been declared dead several times over since the late 1980s. Some claimed the Amiga would kill it, others that the PC would destroy its soul or that the Internet would rob it of its essence. This is to be expected: In a subculture - which is what the scene is - there's typically going to be elders lamenting the changing of the old ways, and newcomers eager to bring their own ideas into the mix.



Except... That last part might no longer apply to the scene. Examine photos from a late 1980s rave party and they'll show a bunch of young people partying hard. Fast forward in time and look at photos from a 2025 rave party, and the concept remains basically the same, but there's now a different bunch of young people partying hard. When performing the same experiment on the scene, there's close to zero teenagers among 2025 demo party attendants. Look closer and it becomes evident that many of the 2025 attendants are in fact the very same persons as the teenagers and twenty-somethings appearing in party photos from 1989.



Some subcultures are regularly replenished or revived, whereas others are not. The scene seems to fall distinctly into the latter category: With few exceptions, most active sceners - even those who create demos for modern gaming PCs - belong to the home computer generation, meaning people who remember the heydays of Commodore, Atari, Amiga and MS-DOS.



High Effort, Low Reward



Like most subcultures, the scene grew out of a mix of unique circumstances at a very particular point in time; specifically, the advent of affordable but primitive home computers, lack of accessible digital mass communication, and limited cultural precedent.



I believe that all subcultures need a bit of gatekeeping in order to retain their original soul - the more accessible they are, the easier it is to turn them into exploitable markets. Punks, hippies and mods have all been removed from their original context, ground through a mainstream cultural filter, and repurposed for consumerism: A convenient way of selling brand apparel to identity-seeking middle class youth hungry for something, anything, ostensibly genuine.



The scene, on the other hand, is a perfect example of a subculture that's hard to repackage for sale: It lacks apparent external traits, such as a particular fashion, a specific style of music and - especially considering how common computers are today - any uniquely defining equipment.



Combined with its shadier activities - cracking games, software piracy, postage fraud and phreaking - the scene was always on the introverted side. Decidedly anti-commercial and without tangible and marketable artifacts, corporate interest was and is usually limited to a few sponsors at really large demo parties, and using the scene as a recruitment pool for game developers. Apart from the time and effort required to build scene skills, computers and other traditionally geeky hobbies were decidedly low status in the schoolyard pecking order during the formative years of scene culture. Hence, there was very little potential reward in pretending to be someone who hunkered down in front of a CRT all weekend, trying to move a sprite across the screen. And, let's be frank, it never did attract very many girls.



Thus, unlike other skill-based subcultures with a bigger mainstream appeal and a more pronounced aesthetic - such as skateboarding - the effort required to be accepted by the in-group and the low potential of reward from the out-group, means the scene has never interested posers in any significant numbers. It simply never became cool, and, consequently, still remains well out of view from establishment actors. I happen to like it that way.



Still Not Mainstream



There are regular discussions on the scene about how to attract new talent, because newcomers are nowadays few and far between. I believe the effort to get listed as a living cultural heritage is, in some way, part of a desire to rejuvenate the scene and keep the culture alive. Time will tell if it's successful - I have serious doubts.



It's not that it's hard to get accepted on the scene, especially not these days. Talk of lamers and elites is now just self-referential irony, and the cracking scene is much farther removed from demo making than ever before. The mystery of what a demo actually is has been well documented, not least on Wikipedia, and examples are prevalent on easy access platforms like Youtube. To partake, all that's required is (preferably) going to a demo party, talking to people, and bringing something to the table. Congratulations - you are now a scener!



If measured in number of active participants, the scene peaked somewhere during the early 1990s, when parties like Assembly, The Party and The Gathering attracted visitors in the thousands. Since then, attendance has dwindled, and has proven hard to increase again despite various outreach initiatives.



Kill All Audio and Lights



During the latter half of the 1990s, big demo parties started attracting people almost exclusively interested in playing networked games at scale, effectively visiting parties to use the digital infrastructure they provided. In theory, this could have been an opportunity for the scene to grow, gaining a natural venue for showcasing itself to a new audience apparently interested in computers. In reality, few gamers made the leap, and subcultural differences instead created friction. Sceners were annoyed by gamers disturbing the demo competitions with loud music and other disruptive behavior, and ticket prices went up due to increased demand. Some events were completely taken over by gamers: Dreamhack started as a small demo party and is now a global LAN party franchise. Eventually, sceners simply retreated to other venues, in a natural and uneventful split.



There are still hybrid events, but the biggest, most popular and influential parties are once again exclusive to the scene - not by actively banning a certain category of visitors, but by simply organizing and marketing scene events in a way that makes them inherently uninteresting for the average LAN party visitor.



Arguably successful hybrids, such as what Assembly has transformed into, has more or less compartmentalized the scene in order to protect it from the otherwise completely dominating and highly commercialized mix of e-sports, cosplay and live music acts. During the 1990s, many big parties offered cash prizes, and Assembly is as far as I know the last one that still does. In an outreach effort, they've also introduced a compo segment specifically for beginner sceners and this does seem to attract a number of first releases each year. A positive sign, though I personally feel a bit squeamish about keeping money in the mix: the vast majority of productions released, even during the peak party years, were never created for winning money, but because it was fun.



Why Grow?



For most sceners, the scene was a part of their formative teenage years. Lasting friendships, life-long skills and creative exploration is the stuff of fond memories, and our pursuits are still a source of much joy. It's only natural to want to share this positive experience with others. Some seem to think the scene could still be a potential talent pool, lamenting the lack of new scene recruits for low level programming jobs and game development. And, of course, it might be comforting to see a cultural legacy carried on: a validation of your own life choices. However, as heartwarming as it is to see new, younger talents appear on the scene, the slow trickle appears to be well below meaningful replacement levels: we're very far from the hundreds or even thousands of youngsters that once hiked across Europe to fill giant convention centers.



What makes rejuvenation hard is that many of the things that once gave the scene its special allure are simply gone. There are no longer home computers offering a fixed hardware platform for exploring, sharing and creating on equal footing. Spreading digital creations is cheap and easy on an Internet taken for granted. Affordable yet immensely powerful computers have opened up entirely new creative avenues, unhindered by the technical limitations that once upon a time forced the essence of demos to become what it is. And, of course, the scene is no longer new and exciting, but filled with middle-aged grown-ups.



Degrowth



The scene grew organically through devoted and creative people, hell-bent on doing their own thing without the involvement of clueless adults, corporate incentives or detailed career prospects. It was and remains, first and foremost, about challenging yourself and sharing a passion. It's not the scene's responsibility to supply the software industry with capable developers, and it's certainly not the responsibility of today's teenagers to fill the ranks of a peculiar hacker niche - one based on unwritten rules thought up four decades ago by a bunch of old fogeys who are, to a large extent, still farting around with MS-DOS, 6510 CPUs and blitter chips.



There are other venues today where kids can experiment, learn and build a social context around their activities - probably ones where clueless adults can be kept at arm's length. If they want to join the scene, let them - but above all, let them find their own thing, invent their own creative ways, and let them enjoy doing so.



As for me, I'm fine with the seemingly unavoidable, generational death of the scene. I crave no subcultural legacy, no future audience for my present creative pursuits. I'm just happy to be left alone in my narrow little niche, enjoying it with like-minded individuals, far from the scrutiny of commercial interests and other potential threats to our Good Thing.



And if a significant number of kids do, in fact, eventually pick up the scene torch? Well, I just hope they'll have fun, too.

                        Intel has officially expanded its professional GPU portfolio with the launch of the Arc Pro B50, designed specifically for small-form-factor workstations. The card is based on the Battlemage BMG-G21 GPU, configured with 16 Xe2 cores. It comes paired with 16 GB of GDDR6 VRAM clocked at 14 Gbps on a 128-bit memory bus, producing 224 GB/s of effective bandwidth. This configuration ensures that the GPU cores are properly fed while maintaining a low overall power draw. Intel has kept the total board power at 70 W, enabling the card to run entirely from the PCIe slot without external connectors. With a PCIe Gen 5 x8 interface, the Pro B50 balances efficiency and bandwidth for professional workloads.

One of the key features of the Arc Pro B50 is its suitability for AI workloads and specialized professional applications. Intel claims performance of up to 170 TOPS in INT8 compute, which is significant for local AI inference tasks, machine learning workloads, and data preprocessing. Beyond AI, the GPU is optimized for CAD, engineering, architectural visualization, and design software, where stability is just as important as raw throughput. To meet these needs, Intel supplies a certified workstation driver stack, ensuring predictable performance across industry-standard applications. The physical design reflects its target environment: the card uses a low-profile dual-slot form factor, making it ideal for dense workstation cases that prioritize both space savings and airflow efficiency.
                                    Display connectivity is handled via four mini DisplayPort outputs, which support multi-monitor setups critical for professional users who often work with complex datasets or design layouts. By providing flexibility in display configuration while maintaining a small footprint, Intel positions the Arc Pro B50 as a versatile tool for both AI and visual workflows. The emphasis is not on competing with high-end workstation GPUs in sheer raw power, but on striking a balance between price, efficiency, and reliability in scenarios where compact workstations are used.

With an MSRP of $349, Intel has aimed for the Arc Pro B50 to be an accessible entry into the workstation GPU segment. The card will be distributed both as a standalone retail product and through OEM workstation systems. At launch, early reviews from outlets such as HardwareLuxx, Phoronix, and Igor’s LAB indicate that the card delivers consistent results within its targeted workloads, rather than focusing on gaming performance. As Intel continues to invest in both consumer and professional graphics solutions, the Arc Pro B50 demonstrates a focus on specialized, compact, and power-efficient GPU offerings that broaden its reach in the professional computing market.

            <description><![CDATA[How an Australian developer turned his frustration with CI tools into a 13-year journey that redefined developer tooling.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[👋 Welcome to Valley of Doubt, a free weekly newsletter that goes deep into founder stories from the early days of startups. 🚀Keith Pitt is the co-founder and former CEO of Buildkite, a devtools company that started in Melbourne and grew to have some of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies as clients. In this interview we dig into:Starting Buildkite as a side projectRunning out of money and having to go back to investorsThe challenges of growing into a venture capital valuationFinding your product voiceScott Handsaker (SH): Tell me who Keith Pitt is in 30 seconds or less.Keith Pitt (KP): I'm a dad with three kids. I'm someone who loves to explore with his hands and code, and I love exploring ideas. It's no surprise that I ended up in developer tools. Before I was a programmer, I was a magician doing magic shows. That's all about pleasing people, bringing joy and excitement to someone's day, subverting expectations and having them walk away with a memorable experience of something you spent a lot of time working on.Developer tools is the closest I can get to being a magician in programming, because I get to please my peers, help them be better, and bring a little magic to their day.I don't consider myself an entrepreneur. I never have, even though I do entrepreneurial things. I consider myself more of an inventor. The way that I like to figure out if my inventions are any good is by selling them, because I feel like the only true way to determine if something is of value is if someone's bought it.SH: Is the “inventor” identity something that you carry with you throughout your life?KP: Yeah, I think so. I like making stuff, whether it’s Lego with the kids or software for developers. I have a mad Lego collection, but I make something and then just pull it apart and put it in a box because I don't like displaying Lego. I like making it.SH: Tell me how you got started with Buildkite.KP: It was a side project of a side project. I started building an email transaction API like Mailgun. I needed some CI for it, and at work we were transitioning off Travis CI. My personal requirements collided with my work requirements and I thought, I'll quickly just bust something out. Years earlier I’d written a CI tool just for fun, so I dusted that off.At the same time, PIN Payments launched in Australia. It was sort of the first time in Australian development history where you could charge for something on the internet without messing around with PayPal or getting a merchant account and SOAP APIs. It was a REST API to charge credit cards.Because I'm a commercially minded inventor, I packaged up Buildkite. I spent my evenings working on it, and I wasn’t really building it to make money. I was just building it for me and what I thought was good.I'd go to work and show my peers, "Hey, what do you think of this?" Little did I know that I was testing product-market fit. I thought I was just working on something that I liked.SH: When did you know you had something people wanted?KP: I eventually strapped a credit card system on there and put it on the internet. People I knew bought it to start with, but then one company bought it that I didn't know from Europe. I think they were called Moneybird. I was like, "Who the hell are these people?" That's when I knew I had something that people wanted.SH: How did pricing evolve?KP: I started at $5, $30, and $100 a month. Just classic SaaS tiers.I remember I was walking back from lunch and I got a ping on my phone that someone had upgraded to $500 a month. That was a moment of pure joy for me because this particular customer knew who I was, but they had believed in me. There's a lot of people telling you no throughout the whole journey, and so part of that whole experience was just ignoring people that didn't believe in you.When that enterprise customer came through, it was the first moment that I felt like someone else believed in me. That's when I knew I would be okay.SH: Were you still working at Envato at that point?KP: I was doing Buildkite after hours because my wife was studying to be a social worker at the time. I would do my day job and come home and work on Buildkite in the evenings. The work at Envato was super easy. I was on a green fields project, but my creative itches weren't being scratched at work.I needed someone that could support my Buildkite work. I wanted to do one day a week on Buildkite, but Envato weren't too keen on a part-time position. So I ended up leaving Envato and going to work at PIN Payments. They were cool with me working four days a week.SH: At what point did the co-founders come into it?KP: I was two years in and still solo. I remember the moment it started. I was on Twitter and one of my competitors had announced they'd raised some money and I was really pissed off because I thought, "Why can't I raise money? Why is no one giving me money?"I tweeted something salty and Matt Allen from the Ruby community replied. He said, "You can raise money. I'll show you." So I started applying for accelerator programs. All of them knocked me back because they didn't want to support first-time founders. This was 13-14 years ago when the Australian startup ecosystem was pretty small and risk tolerance was basically non-existent.They were like, "You have to find a co-founder." I went co-founder hunting but couldn't really find one. I had this weird romantic relationship with bootstrapping and going at it alone. At that same moment, I asked Tim Lucas, who I was working with at PIN, "Hey man, can you make me a new logo for Buildkite?" Instead of making me a logo he said, "How about I be your co-founder instead?" I said, "Okay." That was basically what it was.A custom illustration of Keith and Tim, presented to Tim on his last day at Buildkite.KP: Matt Allen helped us raise 200 grand from people we didn't know. Just a bunch of rich people, some of whom I still have not met to this day. We quit our jobs, paid ourselves 80 grand a year, and just worked on becoming profitable.We built things and sold them, tried marketing, and made enough money to hire someone. We did this until we were 15 people, just rinse and repeat. Grow the bank balance, increase revenue, hire people.SH: You mentioned it was a hard slog during those years. Do any particular moments stand out?KP: I ran out of money. I stuffed up big time. In Australia you have to pay employees superannuation, and no one told me that superannuation payments were quarterly. I thought I was doing the right thing by using our cash to pre-buy EC2 instances, and then a couple weeks later our external accounting firm told me, "Super's due". I thought, "Oh, we don't have enough money."But I wasn't that scared because I had a plan. I thought, "Why not be open about it?" because it would probably help. I was completely open about it and said to the team, "All right, so here's the situation, but here's what we're going to do."I converted a bunch of customers to annual payments, went back to investors for loans, and did some invoice advances. It was about 100 grand to see us through until we got R&D tax credits and bigger invoices.SH: What did you learn from that experience?KP: Cash flow is an art form in and of itself. It's not just the bank balance. It's the bank balance at any one moment in time. At that point the game changed for me to making sure that I don't run out of money. That's the number one thing.Don't run out of money and do whatever it takes to not run out of money. Buildkite took a long time to bloom and blossom, but if we had run out of money earlier on, I might have just given up.Brought to you by MurmarSH: How did Lachlan join as the third co-founder?KP: Lachlan joined a couple years in as a late-stage co-founder. I wasn't precious about the titles. When he joined, I thought if he does what we think he's going to do, the company that exists will be just as much of his creation as mine.The reason he joined was that Tim and I didn't really know what we were doing. We had a good sense of how to navigate, but we didn't know big company enterprise stuff and were still thinking small fry. Lachlan really helped us charge lots of money.I didn't have the confidence to walk into a customer and say, "This is $30,000," but Lachlan did. That's probably the biggest gift he gave the company. He gave us the confidence to ask for more.I didn't realise at the time that by having such a low price point, people weren't taking us seriously. For us to charge more, we had to really believe in ourselves. To walk into a company and say, "This is $100,000" with a straight face and truly believe it in your soul.SH: How did you handle the dynamics between three founders?KP: It's always hard when each of you want to be the CEO. I think all of us wanted a little bit of it, and that was super hard to navigate.I gave the role away twice. I started as CEO, but I was the CEO of one person and I never really liked the title. I gave it to Tim because I was struggling with it. I always thought I wasn't doing what I thought that role was supposed to be. I was too invested in the product, too invested in customers, and wasn't interested in budgets or back office stuff.Later on Lachlan took it over. I struggled with that because I always thought I could do a good job of it, but I wasn't ready to take the title and really own it.It wasn't until a couple years later that I personally gained the confidence to say, "I'm the CEO." When I eventually could do it, I think I did a pretty good job because I learned I needed to be the sort of CEO that I was. I couldn't be trying to replicate something I thought in my head.I decided I was a product-centric CEO, and when I owned that, that's when I started to flourish in the role. If we were selling brake pads, you'd want the person in charge to be an expert on brake pads. If we're selling developer tools, the person in charge should be an expert on developer tools.SH: Tell me about the first major funding round.KP: In 2019 we raised a Series A of $28 million. The reason we did that was because I wanted to buy a house. I had previously been to the bank for a home loan and every bank rejected me. I was too risky because Buildkite's finances were largely US revenue, and my finances were Buildkite's finances.A lot of that Series A round was taken out as secondaries. Everyone who had invested the original 200 grand in the seed round got their money back plus some. I had enough money to buy a house, and only a few million went into the company as rainy day money.Keith in the early days of BuildkiteSH: What did you learn about taking VC money?KP: We effectively chose the one that gave us the highest valuation and a clean term sheet. At the time it was awesome because it meant we could sell less of our company for more money, but no one really tells you what happens if you go in at a high valuation early on.If you're given a high valuation, you're not worth that at the moment. They're pricing you based on what they think you're going to be worth. You effectively need to grow into the valuation, and if you don't then in your next round, you end up with a down round.It made the next round much harder. We hadn’t grown fast enough to justify the valuation, so the next round was effectively flat. No one warns you about that.I think we were naive going into that transaction. We always painted the picture of being a long-term sustainable business, and our position on that never changed. We weren't building something to sell. We were building something that would last forever. The VCs gave us money even though we said those words, but I think in their mind they were hoping we would change.Once you take big VC money, expectations change. They want big results, and we were still behaving like 37signals.Eventually I realised that if we’re going to play the enterprise game, we have to play it properly. That meant raising again, and building the team to go after bigger customers.SH: What changed when you took over as CEO the second time?KP: When I took over CEO, I really embraced having a sales team. Up to that point, Buildkite didn't have a sales team. I used to have this romantic relationship with the Atlassian approach, who famously had never had a salesperson. In reality they did have salespeople, they just called them something different.The biggest learning from hiring a salesperson was that there is a certain dance you need to have with customers during a sale, and you want someone whose job it is to do that tango.We hired a salesperson and built a sales team, and tripled revenue in a couple of years through doing that.SH: Buildkite is well known for being a much-loved product in the developer community. Tell me about your product development process.KP: It took me nine years to figure out my product voice. I read a book by Rory Sutherland called Alchemy. It was a book on marketing, but weirdly enough, this marketing book helped me find my product voice.I had a lot of stuff that was just instinct and gut, but I never figured out how to turn that gut into something actionable or a set of product principles. Reading this book helped me find that voice.I remember the day I showcased to the company, "Hey, I finally figured out what I've struggled with all this time." I did a three-hour presentation to the company, and I think everyone hated it. Everyone hated it because so many people disagreed with the principles.SH: What were some of those principles?KP: Here's a great example: don't listen to customers. Listen to them, but don't listen to them. What I learned is that when a customer comes to you with a problem, they come to you with a cry for help disguised as a feature request. You have to ignore the feature request and get at their problem.Ninety-nine percent of the time, they've had some configuration issue somewhere else, 10 steps earlier, that's led them to this point where they've fucked it up so badly that they need something to solve that.A feature request is not a feature request. It's a cry for help. That was difficult for a lot of people to unwind in their head, but that principle helped a lot.Another principle: I always wanted developers to be treated as humans, not robots. Just look at any error message in any developer tool. It's probably obscure and shit. One of the magical parts of Buildkite was that I spent a lot of time taking what the developer would give me, and interpreting it to be what they actually meant.You have to have pure empathy for the user. You're almost like a parent because you can't always give them what they want. You can easily just add all these checkboxes and make everyone happy, but you pay for it later with a million checkboxes.SH: Why do you think the team reacted negatively?KP: I think I should have packaged up my principles differently or had a different approach. They were pretty black and white, quite dogmatic. It was like, "This is how it is." Anyone receiving that would probably not like being told "this is the way it is from now on."At that moment, I realised the company I had was somewhat incompatible with that. I should have spent more time thinking about that stuff before going on mass hiring.KP: There's something not a lot of founders talk about because maybe they're scared about it, but in industry there's this thing called culture fit that people get wrong all the time.If you hire too many different people with different work styles, different wants, different needs, different approaches, different ideas, different values, different ethics, then everything becomes hard mode.I wish I had gone back and been more involved in hiring. I would have opted more for culture fit. I would have been more bullish and precise: here is the type of person we want, let's go find that type of person.At some point in hiring you get exhausted and you just hire the person who's at the top of the pile, even if they might not match who you wanted. You think, "We need somebody, so we just get them." That's a trap I see a lot of founders fall into, and it has major repercussions over time.When I'm starting my new company, Unreasonable Magic, I'm being very strict about who I let in, way more exclusionary this time around. Teams that build products aren't a party. It's a set of inventors and makers, and you need everyone on the same wavelength.SH: How did having a board change the way you operated?KP: I personally struggled with board stuff. The board was heavily American, and they were all operators who were used to working at a particular pace. I wasn't at that pace, and I couldn't help but feel that I was always letting them down. Not going fast enough.Board work at some point becomes theater, and I struggle with that. I struggle with having to put on a show for a board. I was always struggling to find the balance between how do I get the most out of these smart people versus how is this not just a press conference? I never figured it out.The thing about boards is they have a lot of control, but these people think about your company for only a couple of hours a month. That was super tough because you care a thousand percent, and they care, but they only care for a couple of hours.SH: You have since moved on from Buildkite. Can you talk about your exit?KP: I worked on Buildkite for 13 years, and the hardest part about leaving was that I didn't get to see what happened next. It was almost like I left halfway through a season of a TV show, and there were all these characters and stories and threads I never got to see the ending to.Whenever any founder exits a company, so much of that company is them, so you're leaving a part of yourself. The biggest struggle I've had since leaving is that no one's ever going to care as much about the thing as you did.It's like when you have an electrician come to your house. Sometimes they don't vacuum up as much as you would. You're always going to find that extra wire or bit of gyprock because it's not their house. Your company is your house.No exit is good enough for any founder after a 13-year thing. It's almost an impossible task to try to figure out how to exit someone from a company after 13 years gracefully.SH: What's next for you with Unreasonable Magic?KP: I've got 13 years of ideas to explore. Where I'm focusing my energy is on programming. A lot of programmers like programming, as they like to code. The rise of coding tools fundamentally changes the relationship you have with the work, more than anything in the history of programming.A lot of programmers who would program and get fulfilment out of it have become managers of a coding machine. Whenever I have a day of using Claude or similar tools, I walk away feeling dumb and empty. It's like popcorn. It's not a real meal, it's not feeding your soul.Unreasonable Magic is about how can we take these tools and make you feel fulfilled? How can we let you be as productive as using a coding assistant but also feel that you are the boss, that you walk away smarter at the end of a coding session?It's that doing-the-opposite thing again where everyone's trying to be more productive, but for me it's not about productivity. It's about relationships to the code.Programming is thinking. When I'm writing code, I'm thinking about how each line will be executed, what happens if this line goes wrong. You just don't get that same level of intimacy with the program when you use coding assistants because they can whip out so much code so quickly.The products I built with Claude are worse than without them because I use programming as a way to think and interact with the problem. When you're coding, you're deeply invested in the problem you're solving, getting intimate with the problem. With AI tools, it's surface level. It's a one-night stand with a problem versus a deep and meaningful relationship.Claude certainly makes me more productive, but at what cost? You're paying with the knowledge you would have learned from interacting with the problem.SH: What’s a book we should all read?KP: Alchemy by Rory Sutherland. It’s the book that helped me find who I am. That book changed more about Buildkite than I can list out. SH: What is a band or artist that we should all listen to?KP: Uhmm, I like beatboxing.SH: Do you beatbox yourself?KP: Oh gawd no. But there is this band I like, and the song is called Candy Thief. It’s K-pop. I probably listen to that song on repeat every day.SH: What is a podcast we should all listen to?KP: I listen to Conan O’Brien Needs A Friend. If I’m working all day, I feel like it's important for me to make sure my brain goes somewhere else at the end of the day. And Conan O'Brien is just a very silly human. SH: Amazing. Thanks for your time Keith, and good luck with Unreasonable Magic!]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[The Sound Blaster]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Sim Wong Hoo was born on the 28th of April in 1955, the tenth child in a family of twelve children (five brothers, seven sisters). His family were Singaporean Hoklo with ancestry in the southernmost area of Fujian, China, and they spoke Hokkien. He grew up in a kampung called End of Coconut Hill in Bukit Panjang, and his father, Sim Chye Thiam, was a factory worker while his mother, Tan Siok Kee, raised chickens, ducks, pigs, and rabbits, and grew fruits and herbs. The young Sim had chores around the house and around the farm as soon as he was physically able, and he often sold eggs at the local market before school classes started each day. This afforded him the ability to buy things for himself such as his harmonica when he was about 11. The harmonica was a hobby he greatly enjoyed throughout his life. He also enjoyed making his own games.Sim graduated from Bukit Panjang Government High School and then went on to attend Ngee Ann Technical College for engineering. At the college, Sim was a member of both the harmonica troupe, consisting of thirty people, and the Practice Theatre School. In the theatre, Sim provided musical accompaniment for the school’s performances with the harmonica and the accordion, often performing his own arrangements. His two interests collided at this time in his life. When writing or arranging music, he’d only be able to hear his composition during weekly practice. Having seen a computer, he realized that a computer could allow him to hear the music precisely as written while still working on it. Sim envisioned a computer that could play music, talk, or even sing, and his earlier entrepreneurial spirit drove him to an ambitious goal: selling 100 million units of a single piece of equipment. Sim graduated in 1975 and then entered the uniformed services for his obligatory two years.For three to four years following his service, Sim worked a brief stint on an offshore oil rig, designing computerized seismic data logging equipment. After that, he opened a computer education center at Coronation Plaza. As he was more interested in teaching and researching, he left the business work to his business partner. This wasn’t a great decision. His partner took off with all the money.Sim Wong Hoo with a variety of Creative productsOn the 1st of July in 1981, Sim founded Creative Technology with Ng Kai Wa, who had been his childhood friend and classmate in a 440 sqft shop at Pearls Center using his own savings of around $6000. The company initially did computer repair and sold parts and accessories for microcomputers. Business wasn’t great, so Sim also did some teaching. In whatever time he had left to him, he was busy developing his own products.Creative CUBIC 99 advertisementThe first Creative product (at least, for which I can find any evidence at all) was a memory board for the Apple II. Having an understanding of the Apple II, Creative followed their memory board by producing the CUBIC 99 in 1984. This was an Apple II compatible machine with a 6502, but it also featured a Zilog Z80 for compatibility with CP/M. I am not certain how this was arranged, but I imagine that it wasn’t entirely dissimilar to the Microsoft Z80 SoftCard. Of course, this is Creative Technology, so the machine also featured a voice synthesizer allowing users to record and playback words in English or Chinese. The computer also had an optional Cubic Phone Sitter which could make and answer calls. This was the first computer to be designed and manufactured in Singapore.The market was moving quickly, and the IBM PC had created a standard. The CUBIC CT was released in 1986 as a PC compatible, and it featured graphics and sound capabilities. This was, essentially, a multimedia PC (with a weaker CPU than that standard would later dictate) localized in the Chinese language. Unfortunately, it was too early. With nearly zero software support for anything approaching the capabilities of the CT and an even smaller local market, the product was a failure.Creative Music System advertisementRealizing that the sound features of the CUBIC CT were likely more salable and supportable than the computer itself, Sim and his company chose to sell the sound card by itself as the Creative Music System (also C/MS or CT-1300). This board was built around two Philips SAA1099 chips providing 12 channels of square-wave stereo sound on a half-length 8bit ISA card, and it shipped with five 360K 5.25 inch floppy disks (Master Disk, Intelligent Organ, Sound Disk 1, Sound Disk 2, Utilities). To promote this card, Sim moved to California in 1988 and established Creative Labs. His goal was to sell at least 20,000 cards generating $1 million in revenue. The USA was the largest PC market, and he knew that sound cards were seeing good sales.Creative Game Blaster, image from pixelatedarcade.comBeing in the USA, Sim quickly realized that games were the software titles driving sound card sales, and this meant that he’d need new branding and software partners. The C/MS became the Game Blaster, and the included software was now just the Intelligent Organ, a test utility, a TSR, and drivers for Sierra Online games. The inclusion of those drivers was key to what would follow. Creative’s partnership with Sierra meant that some of the most popular games of the era would support the Game Blaster; ultimately, over 100 games would support the C/MS and Game Blaster. Naturally, selling a card required a store front, and Creative found a partner in Radio Shack. While the Game Blaster sold better than any Creative product before it, it didn’t overtake the Adlib.Creative SoundBlaster with the CUBIC CT, image from Creative Labs PTETo better compete, Creative needing something that was better than the Adlib but still compatible with it. This came in 1989 with the CT1310, better known as the Sound Blaster. The Sound Blaster offered 12-voice C/MS stereo sound, 11-voice FM synthesis with Adlib compatibility (via the Yamaha YM3812), a MIDI interface, a joystick port, microphone jack with a built-in amplifier, a stereo amplifier with volume dial, the ability to play back mono-sampled sound at up to 22kHz, and record at 12kHz. While a sample rate of 22k doesn’t seem great (because it isn’t) this did allow simultaneous output of sound effects and music in a game. Likewise, while a game port doesn’t seem like all too big a deal, it saved the buyer an extra $50 to buy one separately, and it saved an ISA slot too. The Sound Blaster was the first sound card to feature digital sample playback, and it took over the market, quickly becoming the top-selling expansion card of any kind in under a year, and Creative’s revenues hit $5.5 million. With the C/MS never having been too popular, Creative followed the CT1310 with the CT1320 which removed the C/MS chips but kept sockets for them on the card.1989 also saw Creative release the PJS operating system and the PJ Views word processor and desktop publishing system which included support for 70,000 Chinese characters. As far as I know, these products were only released in Southeast Asia.Tandy Multimedia Audio Adapter, image from vcfed.org member CloudschatzeAnnounced in May of 1991, the Sound Blaster Pro, CT1330, was a major redesign of Creative’s sound card. This card used two Yamaha YM3812 chips to provide stereo sound while maintaining full backward compatibility with the original Sound Blaster and Adlib. Sample rates were increased to 22kHz for stereo, 44.1kHz for mono. A simple mixer, low-pass filter, high-pass filter, and CD-ROM interface were added. This CD-ROM interface could take multiple forms, but it was useful in pushing CD-ROMs into the mainstream. Many early CD-ROM drives were SCSI-only and that was expensive. Creative worked with MKE in Japan to produce low-cost IDE CD-ROM drives, and then included support on their cards. As for the card itself, while the card did have the AT connector, it wasn’t 16bit. The Pro was still an 8bit card. The presence of the 16bit AT connector was for additional interrupts and DMAs on the 16bit bus that supported the Multimedia PC standard from Microsoft. The Sound Blaster Pro 2 was released shortly after the original, and it replaced the YM3812s with a single YMF262. The Pro series was often sold in Multimedia Upgrade Kits where it was bundled with a CD-ROM drive and software titles. Given that CD-ROMs were quite new, these kits often represented a significant value to consumers.This card can also be found in Tandy Multimedia PCs as the Tandy Multimedia Audio Adapter. Immediately noticeable changes were from the regular joystick port to two mini-DIN connectors compatible with the Tandy 1000 joysticks, and the addition of a mini-DIN MIDI port. For both the joystick connectors and MIDI connector, adapters were required. A less noticeable change, the Tandy card used a different bus interface chip, the CT1346, and the output amplifier could be disabled via a jumper. Finally, the card featured a high-DMA channel allocated for audio which allowed 16bit 44.1kHz mono output in Windows.Creative Sound Blaster, CT1350b, image from theretroweb.comThe Sound Blaster 2, or Sound Blaster Deluxe, model CT1350 was released in October of 1991. This model improved the board layout allowing for a more compact card, and it completely eliminated the C/MS chips. This model improved on its predecessor by adding auto-init to DMA allowing the card to play continuously without the crackling or pausing that was experienced on the original. The sample rate for digital audio on this card was increased to 44kHz for playback and to 15kHz for recording. With this card, a DSP upgrade was made available to owners of the original Sound Blaster, which was required for full compatibility with the Windows 3 multimedia extensions.Creative was growing quickly, achieving an estimated 72% market share of the sound card market globally in 1992, but it was also facing significant competition. Media Vision’s Pro Audio Spectrum Plus, released in 1991, was capable of 8bit digital sampling and 16bit digital audio playback. It featured a CD-ROM interface, and it was Sound Blaster compatible. The Pro Audio Spectrum 16 of 1992 moved the company to 16bit ISA, added 16bit stereo digital audio, and featured stereo FM synthesis while maintaining full Sound Blaster compatibility. Then, there was Aztech in the more low-end market making some serious OEM deals with likes of Dell and Compaq. They entered the market in 1992 at a much lower price point and offered broad compatibility with sound cards like the Adlib, Sound Blaster 2, Sound Blaster Pro, Cover Speech Thing, Disney Sound Source, and Windows Sound System.To answer the competition and maintain their lead, the company released the Sound Blaster 16, CT1740, in June of 1992. This was a fully 16bit sound card and featured support for 16bit 44.1kHz digital audio. Creative had partnered with E-mu Systems to offer the Wave Blaster daughter board that brought wavetable synthesis to card through the header on the top of the card. The empty socket seen on the SB16 was for the Creative Signal Processor, CT1748, which brought hardware-assisted speech synthesis, QSound audio spatialization for digital wave playback, and PCM audio compression/decompression. The SB16 was more popular than any card before it, and the wavetable daughter board was popular enough to push Creative to acquire E-mu in March of 1993 for $54 million.Creative went public in August of 1992 and became the first Singaporean company to be listed on the NASDAQ. In September of 1992, Creative expanded into China establishing a joint venture in Beijing called Chuang Tong Multimedia Computer Ltd. Creative held 70%, NewStone 20%, and Da Heng 10%. In addition to selling the company’s multimedia hardware, the Chinese subsidiary developed and distributed CD-ROM software in the Chinese language, and sold PJS and PJ Views. The following year, Ed Esber, formerly of Ashton-Tate, joined Creative Labs as CEO, and he assembled a team that included Rich Buchanan, Gail Pomerantz, and Rich Sorkin. Of the new team in the USA, Sorkin had the most lasting impact. He began licensing programs, shortened product development cycles, and began legal endeavors to protect Creative’s intellectual property. Throughout 1993, Creative established itself Australia, Japan, the UK, and Ireland. Finally, that same year, Creative acquired ShareVision Technology who made videoconferencing technologies. Creative’s later attempts in that market didn’t make it far.Creative AWE32 advertisementBy 1994, the Sound Blaster 16 was the audio card. The company needed both a low-end product and high-end product, and so the ViBRA 16, CT2501, took the low, and the AWE32 took the high. The ViBRA was a cost-reduced, single-chip implementation of the SB16 and was frequently supplied to OEMs. Some ViBRA models included an on-board modem. The AWE32 featured the CT1748 CSP, CT1747A with OPL3 FM synth, CT1971 (EMU8000) and CT1972 (EM8011, 1MB sample ROM) wavetable synth, CT1745A mixer, CT1741 DSP, a CD-ROM interface, wavetable header, SPDIF header, and 512K of sample RAM upgradeable to 28MB via two 30-pin SIMM slots. The AWE32, CT3900, was a full-length, 16bit, ISA card. With the SB16, ViBRA, and AWE32 on the market, the company’s revenues exceeded $650 million, and the company was listed on the Singapore stock exchange.On the 26th of October in 1994, in time for the Christmas shopping season, Creative released the 3DO Blaster. This brought 3DO games to the PC via a full-length, 16bit, ISA card. On the card was a 32bit RISC CPU, a DSP for CD audio, two graphics processors, 2MB of RAM, 1MB of ROM, 1MB of VRAM, and 32K SRAM with battery backup. The box contained two games (Shockwave, Gridders), some demos, drivers, Aldus Photostyler and Gallery Effects, a controller, manuals, the card itself, and a registration card. Of course, the 3DO blaster was not, itself, a standard VGA card. To use the 3DO Blaster, one’s PC would need to be at least a 25MHz Intel 386, have at least 4MB of RAM, a VGA card, Windows 3.1, a CD-ROM drive (either Matsushita or Creative CR-564), a Sound Blaster, and some speakers. The press release from 3DO read, in part:With the introduction of 3DO Blaster, Creative is targeting their extensive installed base of CD-ROM users. 3DO Blaster provides PC owners with the ultimate game platform — exciting 3DO games recognized for unprecedented interactive realism, full-motion video, CD-quality audio and three-dimensional sound effects.“Today’s announcement reflects the efforts of two of the most advanced technology suppliers, Creative Technology and 3DO. The 3DO Blaster provides the advantage of Creative’s and 3DO’s innovation to the installed base of PC’s already using Creative multimedia products,” said Sim Wong Hoo, CEO and chairman of Creative Technology Ltd.“Creative’s and 3DO’s technologies create an advanced entertainment platform which will enhance the capabilities of PCs, and expand the imagination of users by providing them access to exciting, interactive products that fully exploit the potential of multimedia entertainment.”Trip Hawkins, president and CEO of The 3DO Company, said today’s announcement enables his company to expand quickly and aggressively into the vast PC market. “Creative is the leading supplier of multimedia products for PCs, providing us with the opportunity to deliver 3DO’s advanced interactive technology to an even broader audience,” said Hawkins.Given that the 3DO Blaster cost $399.95 and the 3DO console didn’t do too well, this product was moribund from the start. Also in October of 1994, Creative released HansVision. This was a Chinese-language office suite for Windows, and while Windows replaced PJS, HansVision replaced PJ Views. Also in 1994, Creative acquired Digicom Systems, a modem company. This resulted in the Creative Phone Blaster in 1995. The Phone Blaster, CT3110, was largely just a ViBRA 16 with an integrated modem and a wavetable header, but it was a full-length, 16bit, ISA card. It faired better than the company’s attempts at video conferencing, but it wasn’t much of a success.A cost reduced version of the AWE32 was released in 1995 as the Sound Blaster 32. It was roughly equivalent to the AWE32 but lacked the on-board RAM, Wave Blaster Support, and CSP. Additionally, it utilized the CQM chip from the ViBRA instead of the OPL3. The CQM (Creative Quadratic Modulation) commonly suffered audio clipping, hiss, and ringing when playing digital audio.Esber, Buchanan, and Pomerantz left the company in 1995. They’d never really got on with the folks in Singapore, and the two groups had disagreements over the company’s strategy. Sorkin, however, was promoted to General Manager of the audio division, and then to executive VP of business development and corporate investments.With the earlier success of the company’s CD-ROM and sound card bundles packing Matsushita, Mitsumi, and other vendors’ drives, Creative had gone into the CD-ROM drive business. In 1995, the industry had a large oversupply and Creative dumped its inventory incurring a loss of $30 million, and causing the company’s share price to drop nearly 75%.Creative 3D Blaster, image from wiki.peterhuman.netCreative 3D Blaster VLBIn 1995, Creative released the 3D Blaster, CT6200. This was a 3D accelerator card built around the 3DLabs GLINT 300SX processor. The GLINT 300SX was built of about a million transistors on IBM’s 3.3V, 0.5 micron process, and it was capable of about 2.5 billion operations per second. As with many cards that would follow, GLINT was designed to process Gouraud-shaded, Z-buffered, dithered triangles that were generated by an application or game and passed to GLINT via the OpenGL API (in this case CGL, and later DirectX). The chip was accompanied by 2MB (or 4MB with the 2MB daughter board) of DRAM, and this VESA Local Bus card achieved a pixel filtrate of 25MP/s. The card cost $349.95 at launch and it only handled 3D, requiring the user to have a 2D card installed and use VGA passthrough. This was roughly a year before the first Voodoo card, but shortly after the Diamond Edge 3D with an NV1 at $299 for 2MB. Given that this was a VLB card, the 3D Blaster was largely a card for 486 machines, and given the price, it didn’t sell well. As far as I am aware, there were roughly 13 game titles to support CGL. Of those, there was Rebel Moon which was exclusive to the CT6200, and even having been designed exclusively for this card, it wasn’t great. Frame rates would get quite sluggish at times, likely having been hampered by the 486 at the heart of VLB machines.Creative Sound Blaster AWE64 ValueCreative Sound Blaster AWE64 GoldThe Sound Blaster AWE64 was released in November of 1996, and it improved on the AWE32 in a few ways. First, it increased the signal to noise ratio (especially in the Gold version), and increased component integration resulting in traces that likewise avoided noise. Given increases in integration, the board also became smaller than its predecessor and decreased cost. It’s also notable that with general technological advancements made in the industry, the ICs were of a consistently higher quality than those used in earlier cards despite being less expensive. The card came in two versions; one was the standard version which later was re-branded as the Value version (CT4500) with 512K RAM, and the other was the Gold version (CT4390) with 4MB of RAM, a 20bit DAC, and separate SPDIF output. Functionally, there were two major differences between the AWE64 and AWE32. The AWE64 added WaveGuide which synthesizes instrument sounds. While the Wave Blaster is no longer supported, the AWE64 Gold does have line inputs on the rear for an external Sound Canvas or similar product. Effectively, the WaveGuide feature allowed for greater polyphony through the use of 32 extra software-emulated channels, but in practice this used more CPU time and wasn’t very popular. The other change was the removal of 30-pin SIMM slots in favor of proprietary memory daughter boards. In all other respects, the AWE64 was simply a better AWE32. For purists, the AWE64 lacks Sound Blaster Pro compatibility and genuine OPL3 FM Synthesis, but for those who want SB16 compatibility, mostly noise-free output, hassle-free plug-n-play, and General MIDI capabilities, the AWE64 is wonderful. For collectors today, however, owning a genuine AWE64 Gold will set a buyer back between $200 and $400. That price will increase for those desiring a SIMMConn (replacing the proprietary memory daughter board with a 30-pin SIMM adapter).Creative closed 1996 with $1.6 billion in revenues, and Sorkin left the company for Elon Musk’s Zip2.Media Vision will get its own article at some point, but the company collapsed in a scandal, and Aureal Semiconductor was formed on the 9th of November in 1995 out of the prior company’s remnants. On the 14th of July in 1997, Aureal announced the Vortex AU8820 with high quality positional audio via the company’s A3D technology. This allowed a human listener to perceive audio as coming from a rather precise location, and it had originally been developed by Crystal River Engineering for NASA’s Virtual Environment Workstation Project. Crystal River had been acquired by Aureal in May of 1996, and Aureal productized the technology. The Vortex proved to be extremely popular and its features were supported by many of the most popular gaming titles of the time: Half-Life, Unreal, Quake II, and so on.For Creative, the arrival of the Vortex card was existential. Most of the company’s revenues came from sound cards, and the Vortex had gained the respect of gamers and audiophiles almost immediately following its release. What was worse was that its feature set was being incorporated into games where once the Sound Blaster had been the de facto standard. The fastest way to gain expertise is to buy it, and Creative bought Ensoniq in January of 1998 for $77 million. Within Creative, Ensoniq was merged with E-mu Systems. The acquisition brought the Ensoniq AudioPCI into Creative, and this was a card intended to be cheap, functional, and feature rich. It supported digital effects such as reverb, chorus, and spatial enhancement, as well as DirectSound3D, and sample-based synthesis. For the new owner, the card couldn’t have been better as it support Sound Blaster compatibility through the use of a TSR despite being a PCI card. This card was rebranded several times as the Sound Blaster PCI 64, PCI 128, Vibra PCI and so on. The Ensoniq ES1370 that powered the card became the Creative 5507, and then revised into further AC97 variants. A major downside of the card was that it ran with a 44kHz sample rate only, and thus, audio recorded at any other rate was resampled which lowered fidelity and increased CPU time. The later AC97 variants supported only 48kHz natively, and therefore likewise resampled audio. While the AudioPCI wouldn’t win over audiophiles, its low cost moved units and won the company some OEM deals.3DBlaster Voodoo2, image from thunder.netOn the 20th of January in 1998, Creative chose to remedy the mistake it had made with their first 3D accelerator, and they released the CT6670, or 3D Blaster Voodoo2. It used the PCI bus, had 8MB of 25ns EDO RAM, and like all Voodoos, supported Glide. In September the same year, the company released the 3D Blaster Voodoo Banshee AGP card (CT6750) as well as the CT6760 PCI card. Depending upon the SKU, these could come with 8MB, 12MB or 16MB of SDRAM. While using the same name, the AGP card was designed entirely by Creative, and it was the only Creative board using a 3dfx chip to be so.In July of 1998, Creative proved to be a leader in a different market segment with the introduction of HansVision Future 2000 in schools around Singapore. HVF2K featured the HansWord word processor, the HansBrowser bidirectional English-Chinese dictionary, and the HanSight online translator of webpages. Creative had successfully implemented productivity tools on the web, and they’d done machine translation of the web. Truly outstanding for the time.Beginning in 1997, Creative Labs optical drive bundles began featuring DVD drives and speaker sets (thanks to the acquisition of Cambridge SoundWorks), and on the 10th of March in 1998 these products dropped in price rather dramatically and were expanded in their contents. One example, the Creative Components 700 (the most expensive on offer) included Creative’s PC-DVDx2 drive, Sound Blaster AWE64, the new Graphics Blaster Exxtreme (PCI, 3DLabs Permedia 2 chip, 4MB SGRAM, 64bit data path, OpenGL, up to 1600 by 1200, 60Hz to 150Hz refresh), Creative MPEG-2/Dolby Digital decoder board, and Cambridge SoundWorks’ PCWorks speaker system. This was priced at $479.99. The DVD-ROM drive was $149.99 stand-alone, and the decoder board was $169.99 stand-alone.Sound Blaster Live!In August of 1998, Creative released the Sound Blaster Live! (CT4670) as a successor to the ViBRA range of sound cards. These were built around the EMU10K1 chip and supported DirectSound3D, EAX (Environmental Audio Extensions) versions 1 and 2, and featured an onboard, 64-voice, wavetable synthesizer though it did use main memory for sample storage. This was a PCI bus card, and it utilized Ensoniq’s TSR for the emulation of Adlib, Sound Blaster, and General MIDI (the adaptation of that TSR was a condition of the acquisition of Ensoniq).EMU10K1 Digital Audio Processor652KB ∙ PDF fileDownloadEMU10K1 Digital Audio Processor, from IEEEDownload1998 was a year of intense litigation for Creative. The first suit was filed by Creative against Aureal over MIDI caching patent infringements. This was followed by a counter claim of defamation and unfair competition by Aureal against Creative. Creative’s advertising of the Sound Blaster Live! then sparked more lawsuits by Aureal against Creative over claimed falsehoods. By the end of 1999, Aureal had won but had gone bankrupt as a result of legal costs. I am sure it cut quite deeply, but Creative acquired Aureal in September of 2000 for $32 million.After 3dfx acquired STB, they began making their own cards. As a result, Creative began making, mostly, Nvidia-based cards for video and graphics. There were some exceptions. The Creative 3D Blaster Savage 4 obviously used the S3 Savage 4 chipset, and the Graphics Blaster Exxtreme used chips from 3DLabs. Possibly to prevent the sort of problem they’d had with 3dfx, Creative then acquired 3DLabs in June of 2002. From 1999 onward, Creative would release a handful of graphics cards, some did well and others didn’t, but they were no longer a substantial source of revenue for the company.Creative Nomad in box, image from peterhuman.netCreative Nomad, box, back, image from peterhuman.netCreative had some great timing with one particular product. WinAmp brought MP3 support to the desktop in 1997, and Windows Media Player 5.2 gained MP3 support in 1998. Creative released the NOMAD MP3 player in April of 1999 for $429. In June of 1999, Napster was born, and MP3s exploded in popularity. The NOMAD connected to a user’s PC via a cradle, and that cradle attached to the PC via parallel port. The device had either 32MB or 64MB of battery backed RAM depending upon the model purchased, with more storage provided by flash media. The NOMAD also provided an FM tuner for those who wished to listen to radio, and a microphone for voice recordings. On the PC side of things, Creative provided both a CD ripper and the NOMAD Manager. The latter of which was for handling the transfer of content to the device. The box proudly claims that 64MB would provide an hour of CD-quality audio, and that’s… well… not true at all. MP3 encoding is quite lossy, and to compress 700MB of lossless CD audio into 64MB infers an incredibly low sample rate. An hour of audio in 64MB would absolutely not be “CD-quality.” Marketing aside, the NOMAD was a cool product.nomadworld.com as of the 9th of October in 1999The NOMAD II launched the following year, and it was well received by the press. This time, Creative used USB 1.1 instead of parallel, 32MB of internal memory, bundled 64MB Smart Media flash, and added EAX support, WMA support, a backlight for the LCD, a wired remote for controls, and slightly better microphone for voice recording. This was followed by the IIc which removed the FM tuner and offered either 64MB or 128MB of internal memory.Creative released two further units in 2000, the NOMAD Jukebox and the NOMAD II MG. These also used USB. The II MG returned to the format of the original NOMAD, but it added equalizer presets, ID3-tag support, the wired remote, and the FM tuner returned and now featured. a sleep timer and recording. The NOMAD Jukebox was different. It was roughly the size and shape of a Discman, though slightly thicker, and had a 2.5 inch, 6GB, IDE hard disk in it. The Jukebox also had WAV support, line-in for recording, and two line-out jacks for four speaker systems like Creative’s own Cambridge SoundWorks four point surround. If NiMH batteries were being used, the Jukebox featured a DC jack, and it could charge those batteries. Given the use of spinning rust, battery life was just four hours. For adventurous folks today, the hard disk in this is upgradeable, but the disk didn’t have any identifiable partitions or formatting, and as a result the first 32MB need to be copied with something like dd and then the drive inserted into the Jukebox and the format function used by holding the Play and Stop buttons (or EAX and Down on newer units) during the “loading” sequence.Following the 2001 crash, Creative became an increasingly audio-only company. Some Chinese/English, electronic, pocketable dictionaries would continue in Asia, but most of Creative’s other endeavors ceased. The company was focused on speakers, headphones, sound cards, and portable music players.US patent 6928433 was awarded to Creative on the 9th of August in 2005 for the user interface of the Zen and NOMAD Jukebox MP3 Players. This patent had been applied for on the 5th of January in 2001. Creative filed suit against Apple in May of 2006, and the two companies reached a settlement in August with Apple agreeing to pay $100 million.Time wasn’t kind to Creative. Motherboard audio had become good enough for most people, and fewer than a quarter of desktop users bought dedicated sound cards. Worse, the shift to laptops during the first decade of the new millennium meant that a majority of PC users couldn’t make use of a sound card. Creative voluntarily delisted from the NASDAQ with the last day of trading having been the 31st of August in 2007. The company continued to be listed on SGX-ST. Layoffs of some staff in Stillwater, Oklahoma followed in 2008.In 2009, 3DLabs and Creative’s Personal Digital Entertainment divisions were combined and reformed as ZiiLABS. This division designed a series of semi-custom ARM chips with 24 to 96 processing units called StemCells. These StemCells were sort of DSPs, and video, audio, and 3D graphics tasks were handled by these coprocessors. ZiiLABS produced at least five SKUs: ZMS-05, ZMS-08, ZMS-20, ZMS-40, and ZMS-50. On the 19th of November in 2012, Creative announced that they’d licensed ZiiLABS technology and patents to Intel for $20 million, and they sold engineering resources and assets to Intel for $30 million. Creative stated in the announcement that they’d retained the patents themselves. The ZiiLABS website was online through 2023, but it later went dormant with a default tomcat page in 2024, and the domain is no longer active. From 2012 forward, the website hadn’t been updated.Today, Creative is led by Freddy Sim (Sim Wong Hoo’s brother), Tan Jok Jin is the executive chairman, and Ng Kai Wa is vice chairman. The company’s 2024 net sales stood at $62.8 million (12% increase over 2023) with $59.4 million of that being due to audio, speakers, and headphones. The company reported a net loss of $11 million for 2024, down from $17 million in 2023. The company continues to sell Sound Blaster products including both internal and external sound cards, DACs, and amplifiers. Their speakers, headphones, and headsets sell well and have won the company some awards.Creative rose to dominate the sound card market at a time when there weren’t many options. They made an excellent product, marketed well, and made solid relationships with software makers. The primary issue for the company was that their entire business was built around a single product category, and their attempts to break out of that category weren’t successful. With video cards, they were right on time with a decent product, but the Voodoo was superior. They pivoted and survived that transition only to have 3dfx abandon board partners. They then moved to MP3 players, saw some success, but were beaten by Apple. Today, the company continues in the same niche they once dominated, and they continue to make excellent sound cards. They are simply a much smaller company. Among retro-tech enthusiasts, however, the Sound Blaster 16, Pro, and AWE64 continue to have loyal fans.My dear readers, many of you worked at, ran, or even founded the companies I cover here on ARF, and some of you were present at those companies for the time periods I cover. A few of you have been mentioned by name. All corrections to the record are sincerely welcome, and I would love any additional insights, corrections, or feedback.

        Some people like to spend $3 on a cup of coffee. While that sounds like a gamble I probably wouldn’t take, I’ll always like to gamble– especially as little as three bucks– on what I might be able to dig up on Buffalo and Western New York, our collective past, and what it means for our future.
I recently came across a big pile of Buffalo News front sections from 1991, every day for the first three months of the year… collected as the First Gulf War unfolded. $3. I probably could have chiseled the guy down a buck, but I happily paid to see what else was in those papers.
There’s plenty about a run up to the first Superbowl appearance ever for the Bills, and mixed in with the disappointment is an air of hope and expectation for what is to come. Harumph. There are also some great local ads commemorating and/or coat-tailing on the Bills success.
We’ll get to those someday, but today, something much simpler. The back page of the front section on Saturday, February 16, 1991 was 4/5ths covered with a Radio Shack ad.
There are 15 electronic gimzo type items on this page, being sold from America’s Technology Store. 13 of the 15 you now always have in your pocket.



So here’s the list of what I’ve replaced with my iPhone.

All weather personal stereo, $11.88. I now use my iPhone with an Otter Box
AM/FM clock radio, $13.88. iPhone.
In-Ear Stereo Phones, $7.88. Came with iPhone.
Microthin calculator, $4.88. Swipe up on iPhone.
Tandy 1000 TL/3, $1599. I actually owned a Tandy 1000, and I used it for games and word processing. I now do most of both of those things on my phone.
VHS Camcorder, $799. iPhone.
Mobile Cellular Telephone, $199. Obvs.
Mobile CB, $49.95. Ad says “You’ll never drive ‘alone’ again!” iPhone.
20-Memory Speed-Dial phone, $29.95.
Deluxe Portable CD Player, $159.95. 80 minutes of music, or 80 hours of music? iPhone.
10-Channel Desktop Scanner, $99.55. I still have a scanner, but I have a scanner app, too. iPhone.
Easiest-to-Use Phone Answerer, $49.95. iPhone voicemail.
Handheld Cassette Tape Recorder, $29.95. I use the Voice Memo app almost daily.
BONUS REPLACEMENT: It’s not an item for sale, but at the bottom of the ad, you’re instructed to ‘check your phone book for the Radio Shack Store nearest you.’  Do you even know how to use a phone book?

You’d have spent $3054.82 in 1991 to buy all the stuff in this ad that you can now do with your phone. That amount is roughly equivalent to about $5100 in 2012 dollars.
The only two items on the page that my phone really can’t replace:

Tiny Dual-Superhet Radar Detector, $79.95. But when is the last time you heard the term “fuzzbuster” anyway?
3-Way speaker with massive 15″ Woofer, $149.95.

It’s nothing new, but it’s a great example of the technology of only two decades ago now replaced by the 3.95 ounce bundle of plastic, glass, and processors in our pockets.
Buffalo story teller  and Historian Steve Cichon brings us along as he explores the nooks and crannies of Buffalo’s past present and future, which can mean  just about anything– twice a week on Trending Buffalo. 
As he collects WNY’s pop culture history, Steve looks for Buffalo’s good stories and creative ways to tell them as the President and founder of Buffalo Stories LLC. He’d love to help your business tell its story. For a decade, he’s also collected and shared Buffalo’s pop culture history at staffannouncer.com.  His latest book, Gimme Jimmy! The James D. Griffin Story, is available now at  www.mayorgriffin.com.

    Key points
    
        Swinburne and CSIRO researchers are investigating ways to produce native metals using materials found on Mars.
              Martian settlements will require large amounts of metal that are difficult to ship from Earth.
              The team have successfully produced iron using regolith simulant that mimics what is available on the Red Planet.
    
  


The idea of building settlements on Mars is a popular goal of billionaires, space agencies and interplanetary enthusiasts.
But construction demands materials, and we can't ship it all from Earth: it cost US$243 million just to send NASA's one tonne Perseverance Rover to the Red Planet.
Unless we're building a settlement for ants, we'll need much, much more stuff. So how do we get it there?
CSIRO Postdoctoral Fellow and Swinburne alum Dr Deddy Nababan has been pondering this question for years. His answer lies in the Martian dirt, known as regolith.
"Sending metals to Mars from Earth might be feasible, but it's not economical. Can you imagine bringing tonnes of metals to Mars? It's just not practical," Dr Nababan says.
"Instead, we can use what's available on Mars. It's called in-situ resource utilisation, or ISRU."

More specifically, Dr Nababan is looking at astrometallurgy — making metals in space.
Building an off-world foundry
As it turns out, Mars has all the ingredients needed to make native metals. This includes iron-rich oxides in regolith and carbon from its thin atmosphere, which acts as a reducing agent.
Swinburne University of Technology astrometallurgist, Professor Akbar Rhamdhani, is working with Dr Nababan to test this process with regolith simulant - an artificial recreation of the stuff found of Mars.
"We picked a simulant with very similar properties to that found at Gale Crater on Mars and processed them on Earth with simulated Mars conditions. This gives us a good idea of how the process would perform off-world," he says.

The simulant is placed inside a chamber at Mars surface pressure and heated at increasing temperatures. The experiments showed pure iron metal formation around 1000°C, with liquid silicon-iron alloys produced around 1400°C.
"At high enough temperatures, all of the metals coalesced into one large droplet. This could then be separated from liquid slag the same way it is on Earth," Professor Rhamdhani says.
Along with Dr Nababan, Prof Rhamdhani is collaborating with CSIRO's Dr Mark Pownceby to further advance the process. They're particularly focused on making metals with zero waste, where the byproducts of the process are used to make useful items.
If you can't ship it, make it
ISRU is a growing area of space science because in rocket launches, every kilogram counts. While the cost of launches is going down, the demands of human exploration are immense.
But huge developments are already happening, including the first demonstration of ISRU off-world. The MOXIE experiment on board the Mars Perseverance rover produced breathable oxygen using only the carbon dioxide in the planet's atmosphere.
Metal production is the next giant leap. Prof Rhamdhani hopes Mars-made alloys could be used as shells for housing or research facilities, and in machinery for excavation.

"There are certainly challenges. We need to better understand how these alloys would perform over time, and of course whether this process can be recreated on the real Martian surface," Prof Rhamdhani says.
But in the meantime, Swinburne and its partners are doubling down. Prof Rhamdhani together with Dr Nababan and Dr Matt Shaw, another CSIRO researcher and Swinburne alum, recently delivered a 4-day bespoke workshop on astrometallurgy in South Korea. The feedback was promising.
"We're starting to see increased interest in this field globally as the world gets serious about Mars exploration," he says.
"To make it happen, we're going to need experts from many fields — mining, engineering, geology, and much more."
For Dr Nababan, the benefits go beyond exploration. He hopes their research will also drive more efficient metallurgy here on Earth.
"By doing this, I wish that I can help the development of space exploration, and at the end it will bring good to human life here on Earth."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[tl;dr:
There's no silver bullet, but if we put some "lead" bullets in the right
places, we have a good shot at keeping sensitive data out of logs."This is the blog version of a talk I gave at LocoMocoSec 2024. It’s
mostly a lightly edited transcript with some screenshots, so if you’d prefer,
you can watch the
video or just
flip through the slides."This post is about how to keep secrets out of logs, and my claim is that (like
many things in security) there isn’t a singular action or silver bullet that
lets you do this. I would go so far as to say that there’s not even an 80/20
rule, where one action fixes 80% of the problem. It’s not like preventing SQL
injection with prepared statements or preventing buffer overflows by using
memory-safe languages.What I will offer instead, are lead bullets, of which there are many. I’m going
to talk about 10 of them. They are imperfect and sometimes unreliable things
that, if put in the right places and with defense-in-depth, can still give us a
real good chance at succeeding. My hope is that by the end, you’ll
have a slightly better framework for how to reason about this problem and some
new ideas to add to your kit.Table of contents:The ProblemCauses🤦 Direct logging🚰 Kitchen sinks🔧 Configuration changes🥧 Embedded secrets📡 Telemetry🕺🏻 User inputFixes (lead bullets)📐 Data architecture🍞 Data transformations🪨 Domain primitivesCompile-timeRun-timeRun-time: part deux🎁 Read-once objects🔎 Taint checkingAwesomeNot awesome🗃️ Log formatters🧪 Unit tests🕵️ Sensitive data scannersSampling🤖 Log pre-processors🦸 PeopleRecapStrategy0. Lay the foundation1. Understand the data flow2. Protect at chokepoints3. Apply defense-in-depth4. Plan for response and recoveryConclusionThe ProblemWith that, let’s dive in and set the table by talking about the problem with
secrets in logs.So, there are some problems that are annoying. And there are some problems that
are difficult.This is both. I’m gonna level with you: I absolutely hate this problem. But I’m
not going to gaslight you and tell you that this is the most important thing to
work on worry about, because it probably isn’t!You have somewhere between 5 and 50 other problems in your backlog that seem
more important, 1 of which you found out about this morning. But I think it’s
likely that none of those problems are nearly as annoying. While researching
this topic, I interviewed about a dozen other engineers and, on this point, they
unanimously agreed! Nobody likes dealing with secrets in logs because it is
extraordinarily annoying.This is a problem that’s also difficult, but not even in the fun sense, like
being technically complex or interesting. Once you catch sensitive data in logs,
it’s usually pretty straightforward (at least in retrospect) to determine how
they got there. But, it’s also surprisingly elusive to prevent, and it crops up
in incredibly unexpected places and ways.Secrets could mean lots of different things to lots of different teams, but I’ll
use it interchangeably with “sensitive data”: stuff that you want to keep
confidential. What’s so frustrating when breaching confidentiality in logs is
the full spectrum of potential impact.In the best case (left), you might log an isolated, internal credential, like
an API key, which (kudos!) you rotate right after fixing the source of leak.
The impact is minimal, and you just move on. Of course, all the way on the other
end of the spectrum (right), you might log something that an attacker or
inside threat could use to do some real harm.And then somewhere in-between, where I suspect most of the incidents lie. You
might log secrets that you unfortunately, can’t rotate yourself. Things like PII
or your customer’s passwords, which are reused on other sites, because of course
they are. And, depending on your policies, threat model, or regulations, you
might choose to issue a disclosure or notification.And it is painful.You could be doing so many good data security practices, like
secure-by-design frameworks, database and field-level encryption, zero-touch
production, access control… but logging bypasses all of that… and ultimately
degrades trust, in your systems and in your company. It feels unfair because
it’s only a fraction of your security story.And this is a problem that happens to companies of all sizes:Something about “plaintext” just kinda stings, especially as a security
practitioner. It’s like… the most profane insult you can hurl at a security
engineer. Imagine retorting with, “Oh yea? Well, you store your passwords in
plaintext!”But logging passwords and storing them in plaintext are… kinda the same thing.Because while logs are rarely or purposefully public, they’re typically afforded
broader access than direct access to your databases.Everyone knows by now that storing plaintext secrets in your database is a
terrible idea. Logs, however, are still data-at-rest, and we should treat them
with the same level of scrutiny.I cherry picked those examples because they are established companies with very
mature security programs. I’m not trying to throw shade; in fact, I deeply
respect them for being public and transparent about this. I think this also
hints that preventing secrets in logs is a deceptively difficult and frustrating
problem.If we can understand some causes, we might gain a deeper appreciation for these
past occurrences, and stand a better chance at avoiding new incidents in the
future.CausesThis is certainly not comprehensive, but from my interviews and personal
experience, here are six of the most common causes.🤦 Direct logging🚰 Kitchen sinks🔧 Configuration changes🥧 Embedded secrets📡 Telemetry🕺🏻 User input🤦 Direct loggingconst temp = res.cookie["session"];

// TODO: remove after testing is done
Logger.info("session HERE", { temp });
Narrator: it was not removed after testing was doneThe first group is perhaps the most obvious and facepalm one: when sensitive
data is directly logged. Sometimes it’s purely accidental, like the example
above: someone wants to debug session cookies in their local environment and
then… accidentally commits the code. Sometimes it comes from an uninformed
position where the developer just doesn’t know any better.These tend to be fairly easy to trace down the exact line of code or commit that
introduces it. With this example, you can just grep the codebase for session here and you’ll find it instantly.🚰 Kitchen sinksconst client = googleSdk.admin(...);
try {
  const res = client.tokens.list(...);
} catch (e) {
  Logger.error("failed fetch", { e });
}
I’m sure you’ve seen or written code like this before. Here we have an API
client or SDK that is used to fetch some data. Exceptions are caught, kind of,
and then promptly logged so that on-call engineers can debug the errors.What happens?That error is decorated with a config object stuffed with secrets and the full
response object, which is also stuffed with secrets, and now they’re both in
your logs!{
  e: {
    status: 400,
    ...
    config: { 💥☠️🪦 },
    response: { 💣😭😱 },
  }
}
I call these “kitchen sinks,” objects that contain or hold secrets, often in
opaque or unexpected ways. Think of an actual kitchen sink that’s filled to the
brim with dirty dishes and you can’t easily tell what’s at the bottom without
reaching into it. Maybe it’s a spoon, or maybe it’s knife and now you have to
go to the hospital. What tends to happen is that the whole kitchen sink gets
logged, and the logging library happily serializes it, including parts that were
actually sensitive.This seems to happen with code that attaches additional data onto errors, or
code that logs full request and response objects. It’s typically a bit hard to
catch in code review unless you know to look for them. If you are blessed with
static types, seeing an any type flow into logs can be a good hint that you’re
logging too much.🔧 Configuration changesNarrator: it was not okayNext example: someone needs additional observability and changes a setting like
the global log level. You know exactly what happens, here. This dev is about to
have a bad time and find out that hope, in fact, is not a valid strategy.We started with an observability problem. Now we also have security problem: brand
new secrets are getting emitted into logs.In that example (that totally never happened to me ever), developers built
production around log levels set to WARN and above, but once you flip it to
DEBUG, all this new stuff comes out of the woodwork.These type of configuration changes tend to involve a system that was built with
one set of assumptions, but some kind of modification moves that system from a
known state into a unknown state, introducing a new set of problems.These often involve low-level or global utilities like logging config, HTTP
middleware, or some central piece of infra like a load balancer. They tend to be
singletons that are difficult or costly to test, or they crop up only at
runtime. On the positive side, it’s usually loud and quick to patch, but cleanup
can be kinda painful.🥧 Embedded secretsapp.get("/login/:slug", async (req, res) => {
  const magicLink = req.params["slug"];
  await login({ magicLink });
});
I completely made up this phrase, but the idea is that secrets are coupled to,
embedded into, and baked into more general formats like URLs or remote
procedure calls. The central idea is that it’s designed into the format and the
system, and can’t easily be separated.Say you have a magic login link handler (see above) where a user can click a
link and sign into a web app. There’s nothing in that code that logs the link,
but if you look at HTTP logs, it’s right there in plain view:47.29.201.179 - - [17/Jul/2024:13:17:10 +0000] "GET /login/Uj79z1pe01...
These types of leaks arise from fundamental designs that don’t take logging into
consideration or incorrectly assume some end-to-end flow. The sensitivity gets lost out of context, and ends up getting logged in another layer,
system, or service.📡 Telemetrytry:
    db_name = os.getenv("DB_NAME")
    db_pass = os.getenv("DB_PASS") # 🤫 Secret!
    conn = db.connect(db_name, db_pass)
    ...
except Error as e:
    # Don't log e! Not today!!11
    Logger.error("failed to connect")
finally:
    conn.close()
Next example: we have some Python code that’s connecting to a database, we’re
specifically NOT logging the error object, and we want to ensure we always close
out the connection.How can db_pass possibly make it into logs? Telemetry!"Oops, that's a log, too!"It turns out that things like error monitoring and analytics can totally be
logs, too. I kind of cheated in the code example, because there’s no mention of
telemetry in it at all, but it turns out that if you hook it up to error
monitoring like Sentry (above), run-time errors send the
local variable context right to the dashboard, and you can see the database
password in plaintext.These causes tend to bypass the central logging pipeline and become Yet Another
Place to have to worry about secrets.🕺🏻 User inputAlright, last example. Say there’s a sign in form and the entire dev team made
super duper sure that the password field is totally locked down from logging,
they read this super awesome post, and took care of all the causes we discussed.What happens?Users end up jamming passwords into the username field!So if you ever looked at login alerts for AWS and saw usernames replaced with
HIDDEN_DUE_TO_SECURITY_REASONS, this is precisely why!Everything that’s within proximity to sensitive user input tends to be
radioactive. It could be a UI issue, but users are surprisingly determined to
volunteer secrets in ways that you haven’t prepared for.We’ve touched on a half dozen causes, and the list of things goes on. We didn’t
even talk about the wonder that is crashdumps. But, I think it’s important to
zoom out and note that these are proximate causes.I stand by my claim that there’s no silver bullet to take these all out. If we
want to avoid playing whack-a-mole, we must bring out our lead bullets that
address these issues at a deeper level, and prevent these kinds of things from
happening.Fixes (lead bullets)So let’s dive in! We will survey 10 fixes, and the order we’ll go in is
somewhere between “a dependency graph of things that build on each other” and
“following the lifecycle of a secret.” Some of these are obvious or perhaps
things you’re already doing, so I’ll focus more on fixes that I think might be a
bit newer. That said, it is worth starting with the basics.📐 Data architecture🍞 Data transformations🪨 Domain primitives🎁 Read-once objects🗃️ Log formatters🧪 Unit tests🕵️ Sensitive data scanners🤖 Log pre-processors🔎 Taint checking🦸 People📐 Data architectureLead bullet #1 is the most basic and high-level: data architecture and
understanding that this is primarily a data flow problem. And part of the
solution is reducing the number of data flows and shrinking the problem space so
you simply have less things to worry about and protect.Instead of stray print statements or components that write directly to
filesystem, you instead centralize all your data flows through a single stream.
Make it so that there’s one and only one way to log something. If you can
understand and control the data structures that enter that funnel, you can
prohibit secrets from exiting it.This has the allure of being a silver bullet, because of course if you can get
to 100% of all the things we mentioned here, you’re golden! But in practice (and
as we’ve seen previously), that’s difficult because secrets find a way to sneak
in or new outflows and side channels are created.🍞 Data transformationsThe previous bullet was about controlling how data flows through your system,
this is about transforming, slicing, and disarming that data into safer forms
that can be logged. These are the data security fundamentals that you’re already
familiar with and likely already doing. This is your bread and butter, so I’m
not going to dive into every one. From top to bottom, this is generally arranged
from awesome to meh… basically, by how much information is retained.TransformationResultMinimization☁ (nothing)Redaction[redacted]Tokenization2706a40d-3d1d…Hashingdaadfab322b59…EncryptionAzKt7vBE7qEuf…Masking··········5309On the top, we have data minimization. The best way to not log secrets, is to
not have secrets to begin with! This is everything from going passwordless to
fetching only the data you need.Redaction is the next best thing. Blanking out the secret parts and before you pass
objects around in memory.Tokenization, hashing, encryption: these all have their pros, cons, and caveats.
Like… are you even doing it correctly?Dead last is masking. You leave parts of the secret intact. Maybe this works for you.
Maybe it doesn’t. Maybe you go straight to jail 🤷When these techniques work, they generally work well. But very often what
happens is that they aren’t used or are used too late, after something is
already logged. These have their places in our toolbox, but my claim again is
one bullet isn’t enough.🪨 Domain primitivesLet’s introduce lead bullet #3: domain primitives. Almost all the secrets you
run across in codebases are encoded in-memory as string primitives, and I think
that makes our jobs harder. Strings can be almost anything.Strings: any sequence of bytes from "" to "c̴̞̑ť̸͈̘̌ h̸͝ ̭̘̊ü̶̜̫̦̠͋̆͠ ļ̵̮̤̟̉̀͂ṹ̴̝̂🤷867-53-0999"const secret = "..."
There’s very little about them——at compile time or run-time——that lets you
know that it’s sensitive, dangerous to log, or somehow different than any other
vanilla string.The alternative is a concept I learned from the book Secure by
Design, and I think it’s one of
the most powerful concepts you can add to your codebase, for logs or anything
else where you want to layer in security at a fundamental level.Domain primitives: “combines secure constructs and value objects to define the
smallest building block of a domain”const secret = new Secret("...")
You use them as basic building blocks that hold secret values, and they provide
security invariants and guarantees that basic string primitives simply cannot.It’s one of the easiest things you can do. If you shift from “any string can be
a secret” to “secrets are secrets”, it makes things a lot easier to reason about
and protect.Compile-time"Check out a previous blog post on branded types, which are fantastic domain primitives with strong
compile-time guardrails."You can use these to great advantage at compile-time, giving developers
immediate feedback right in their editors.We can type a logging function (log()) so that it never accepts secrets.
Then, we use some fetching function that returns secrets, typed as secrets (and
not as strings). If we try to log that secret, it will not compile. The type
system will not let you log this secret.// Types
declare const brand: unique symbol;
type Secret = string & { [brand]: string }; // Branded type that extends string
type NotSecret<T> = T extends Secret ? never : T; // Type that excludes secrets

// Logging function
function log<T extends string>(message: NotSecret<T>) { ... };
const message: string = "this is fine"; // 🧵 string primitive
const secretz: Secret = getSecret();    // 👈 domain primitive

log(message); // 👌 compiles!
log(secretz); // 💥 error!
See this example in the TypeScript Playground.I’m omitting and glossing over a ton of details here, because I don’t want you
to focus on the implementation or even TypeScript, for that matter. The salient
point here is that instead of tossing secret strings around, you brand them as
secret types, providing useful context to both compiler and developer.Run-timeIt’s really easy to get started, even with code that is functionally a no-op.
This is basically the simplest form I can think of—an almost empty
class:class OpenAIToken extends String { /* that could be it! */ }

const token = new OpenAIToken(...);
It’s supposed to represent OpenAI credentials, but it’s just using and extending
basic language primitives. You can introduce these objects where secrets
originate, like password fields or anytime you decrypt sensitive data fetched
from the database. And then layer in behaviors and invariants for where they
tend to end up. You progressively start introducing these at both sources and
sinks, allowing you to control where secrets should or shouldn’t go. You can
embed these into data structures so you know what contains secrets. And along
the way, you increase the clarity and safety of your codebase: not only can you
prevent these tokens from going into logs, you can make sure you’re sending them
only to OpenAI and not to some other API by accident.I think in the long run, domain primitives are the most powerful control we have
because it makes our code secure by design, but it does take some time to get
there. These can easily address the direct logging cause we discussed earlier,
and with some modifications can help with many more.Run-time: part deuxWe can extend this and make it so that the default serialization behavior is
redaction.class Secret extends String {
    toString() { return "[redacted]" } // Override!
}
const secret = new Secret("shhh!");
console.log(secret);
Secret: "[redacted]"
If you try to stuff this into logs, into JSON, into kitchen sinks, into error
monitoring, wherever, it’ll always spit out the word “redacted”. You have to
intentionally reach for the value.Let’s take it further. We can create a custom class with an explicit unwrap()
function:class Secret<T> {
    constructor(private readonly value: T) {}
    toString() { return "[redacted]" } // Override serialization
    unwrap() { return this.value }     // Explicit getter function
}
There’s so many things you can do here, like maybe you want to encrypt or zero it out
in memory, because that’s in your threat model. You can take this as far as you need
to or are comfortable with. We’ll take it just one step further.🎁 Read-once objectsThere’s a bit to unpack here, but these build off domain primitives in a very
powerful way.class Secret<T> {
    private locked = false;
    constructor(private readonly value: T) {}
    toString() { return "[redacted]" }

    /* @returns the sensitive value (once and only once) */
    unwrap() {
        if (this.locked) { throw new Error("already read") }
        this.locked = true;
        return this.value;
    }
}
These objects wrap and keep the secret safe, until you actually
need it. The code in the unwrap() function is the crux: there’s a latch or
lock that activates after the secret is retrieved the first time. It goes into a
“locked” state, and any following reads result in an error that fails loudly.const secret = getSecret();
const res = await authenticate(secret.unwrap()); // Proper usage

Logger.info(secret);          // [redacted]
Logger.info(secret.unwrap()); // 💥 Error!
Once you get a secret (from user input, database, decryption, etc.) you wrap
it in a read-once object immediately and keep it wrapped for as long as you can.
And for its single, intended purpose, like using it for some kind of API
authentication, you unwrap the value, use it, and then the object stays locked
for good. This is surprisingly effective at preventing and detecting
unintentional use. It addresses and disarms many of the proximate causes that we
discussed earlier.This object pairs extremely well with static analysis. Tools like CodeQL or
Semgrep can help ensure that developers aren’t bypassing any safety guarantees.These are generally high signal, especially when you have good unit test
coverage. One drawback is that read-once objects, if handled incorrectly but not
necessarily unsafely, could cause errors at run-time. But I think the tradeoffs
are usually worth it, especially if you complement it with testing, static
analysis, and taint-checking. Speaking of which…🔎 Taint checkingI like to think of taint checking as static analysis with superpowers. I
absolutely love it and the first time I used it, it was like someone just handed
me a lightsaber. Quick review for the uninitiated: the general idea here is that
you add taint to various sources (like database objects), and yell loudly if the
data flows into certain sinks (like logs).The red data flow trace on the right detects the secret flowing into logs. But
the green path is fine, because the secret is tokenized. Let’s walk through a
quick example:
semgrep.dev/playground/s/4bq5LOn the left, we’ve marked a couple sources like decrypt and a database fetcher.
We’ve also marked our logger as a sink, and the tokenize() function as a
sanitizer.On the right in red, we can see that taint was created from the decrypt
function, propagated through the getSSN() function, and then flagged for
going into the logs on line 18.In blue, there’s a much shorter path where the user model from the database is
tainted and then flagged for going into logs.And then lastly, in green, we’re tokenizing the decrypted SSN, so it’s not
flagging that it’s logged.The idea that this is checking millions or more different data flows is the
real magic part for me.AwesomeSome of the strengths of taint analysis: obviously automation. Tracing these
data flows is 100% a job for a machine. This can really help with domain
primitives but also can be used standalone and can even key in on heuristics
like variable names: for example, all variables containing “password”. You can
tie this into all of your critical tools, from code review to CI/CD.This is especially potent against kitchen sinks and embedded secrets, because
those data structures can be tainted by secret values and checked accordingly.Not awesomeSome personal opinions on drawbacks: I do feel like taint checking rules tend to
be a bit difficult to write. I really, really like Semgrep, but I’m also not the
biggest fan of YAML.It also turns out that data flow analysis is an NP-hard problem so for large
codebases and monorepos, you likely can’t run full taint analysis on every pull
request or commit. Because it runs in CI/CD and as part of change management,
when it works, it can prevent the introduction of insecure logging into the
codebase.But, like all of the lead bullets we’ve discussed and will discuss, they can
miss. How can we handle that?🗃️ Log formattersLet’s say we made the mistake of logging too much data with our email service:{
  tenantId: "52902156-7fb6-4ab0-b659-6b07b80cf89a",
  email: {
    subject: "Log in to your account",
    html: '<a href="https://acme.com/login/98fPm...">Click here</a> to log in!',
    from: "AcmeCorp <[email protected]>",
    to: "Darth Plagueis (The Wise) <[email protected]>",
    ...
  },
  response: {
    status: 200,
    originalRequest: {
      headers: {
        Authorization: "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIi..."
      },
      body: '{"html": "<a href=\\"https://acme.com/login/98fP...\\">Click..."}',
      ...
    }
    ....
  },
  ...
}
We have a couple of our usual suspects here. Because we’re logging email
contents, magic links show up in logs… twice! We’re also logging some kitchen
sinks, like email metadata and the original request, so we have PII and
authorization headers also in logs. But because this data is structured, if we
can traverse these objects, it turns out that we can zero in on these leaks
quite effectively.{
  tenantId: "52902156-7fb6-4ab0-b659-6b07b80cf89a",
  email: {
    subject: "Log in to your account",
    html: '<a href="https://acme.com/login/REDACTED">Click here</a> to log in!',
    from: "AcmeCorp <[email protected]>",
    to: "REDACTED",
    ...
  },
  response: {
    status: 200,
    originalRequest: {
      headers: "REDACTED",
      body: '{"html": "<a href=\\"https://acme.com/login/REDACTED\\">..."}',
      ...
    }
    ....
  },
  ...
}
If we can introspect these objects, we can scan for dangerous substrings like our
login links, and then drop or redact them. Or we can drop whole values, if we
know that certain paths like email.to are particularly dangerous. Fields like
request or headers tend to be risky objects that we can also remove. We can
even drop the whole log object if it doesn’t meet some admission criteria,
or—we can simply error out.So, how and where do we deploy something like this? Most application loggers
should have some type of middleware stack or pipeline, kinda like here on the
right. These are typically configured for operations like converting objects
into JSON, turning error objects into readable formats, or enriching logs by
inserting useful context like network information. We can invert that, and
instead of enriching with useful data, we can remove or redact sensitive data.export const logger = createLogger({
  format: format.combine(
    transform(),
    handleErrors(),
    enrich(),

      redact(), // 👈 insert here!

    truncate(),
    jsonify(),
    ...
  ),
  ...
});
This is a type of guardrail that helps catch many of the common problems we
described previously, like request headers or config objects. I’ve used this
with decent success and found that it works best as a rifle instead of a
shotgun. Because it’s at the application tier, you can customize it for the type
of data or context that each application handles. For example, we can make it so
that any of our domain primitives that reach this layer are quickly detected and
removed.This is extremely cheap to introduce, but there are some trade-offs. It’s
certainly more of a safety net than hard control, and a developer determined to
bypass it, can and will. Steady state, I measured this at less than 1% of clock
time, but there are some deeply unfortunate ways this can go wrong such as
poorly written regexes and self-ReDoS.More or less, these risks can be mitigated with solid unit-testing. Which leads
us to…🧪 Unit testsLead bullet #7: hooking into and using the existing test suite—that’s already
there—to our advantage. We can use several of the tools we discussed, but
instead of simply detecting or redacting secrets, we can ramp up the sensitivity
in our test environment to fail or error loudly.TechniqueProdTest🪨 Domain primitivesRedactError🎁 Read-once objectsErrorError🗃️ Log formattersRedactError🕵️ Sensitive data scannersDetectErrorI’ll cover sensitive data scanners next, but many test suites are already set up
to capture stdout and stderr, and so you can even point your scanners to
these capture buffers.The takeaway here is that you can reap the same benefits of CI/CD and change
management by catching unsafe code before it’s merged or deployed, but of
course, you’re also dependent on coverage and if the right code and data paths
are exercised.🕵️ Sensitive data scannersThese are fairly blunt but effective tools that can discover and remove
sensitive data. I’m actively going to avoid diving deep here, because it does
seem like many teams and vendors focus on this as the solution. So instead, I’d
like to pose a few questions that might help you reason about trade-offs:Where and when in your logging pipeline is it most effective?Is it a gate, in-line of the critical path, or does it scan asynchronously?Do you simply want to detect or do you bias towards masking and
redaction? How will your team handle and deal with false positives?How far do the general, out-of-box rules take you? Can you tailor it
specifically to your usage patterns?Can you verify the credentials? Can that even keep up with log throughput?And then perhaps what tends to be the long pole in the tent: what are the
costs, and can you sample instead?I think these tools tend to be better suited for defense-in-depth, because
they presume that secrets made it into logs to begin with. They can help catch the
more elusive causes we discussed like configuration changes or user input.SamplingA very brief segue into sampling. Logs tend to have a kind of power law
distribution, where certain types of logs vastly outnumber others. And typically
what you see is that log sources have static points in code, generally with the
same type of data running through them. And so within each log type, scanning
and finding a single true positive might be highly representative of that group.And so you might run into a scenario where, given some global sample rate,
you’re wasting a lot of work for high frequency logs and not even scanning lower
frequency logs. I think a better alternative to a global sample rate is to
aggregate logs by some heuristic like type or origin, and to ensure you hit some
minimum threshold.In practice, I’ve found this difficult or impossible to configure with
out-of-box solutions. I’ve had to introduce additional infrastructure to help.
And that’s our next lead bullet.🤖 Log pre-processorsSecond to last lead bullet, #9: log pre-processors. These sit between apps that
emit logs, and the final data stores.In the above example, something like Vector can receive
and process logs from our microservices before dispatching them to DataDog or
wherever logs end up. We can configure it to drop sensitive data in-place using
many of the techniques we discussed before. And we can sample some subset of
them and store them onto an S3 bucket, using a more powerful tool like
Trufflehog or an LLM to catch
and verify secrets.The idea here is to process logs streams before they’re persisted. It doesn’t
need to be Vector, chances are, you already have this existing infrastructure
that’s used for deduping, aggregation, and dropping noisy debug logs. We can
re-use it to prevent and detect secrets in logs. This pairs very well with
sensitive data scanners that we discussed earlier, and might even unlock new
ones you thought were out of reach.🦸 People“Human practitioners are the adaptable element of complex systems.
Practitioners and first line management actively adapt the system to maximize
production and minimize accidents.”-Richard Cook, https://how.complexsystems.fail/#12Our last stop is people. Modern software is a complex system. And while people
will write the code that accidentally introduces sensitive data into logs,
they’re also the ones that will report, respond, and fix them. They’ll build out
the systems and infrastructure that will keep these complex systems safe. And
early on in your maturity story and before you’re able to build out
secure-by-design frameworks, this is the lead bullet you’ll most likely use the
most.The most important message I want to convey here is that your security team isn’t
alone, especially if you:educate your teammates on secure logging designempower them to report and address these issuesand equip them with tools that get out of their way and helps them succeed.RecapAlright, so we’ve covered lead bullets that protect code, protect data, and
protect logs:📐 Data architecture🍞 Data transformations🪨 Domain primitives🎁 Read-once objects🗃️ Log formatters🧪 Unit tests🕵️ Sensitive data scanners🤖 Log pre-processors🔎 Taint checking🦸 PeopleSome of these might work for you, some of these won’t, and some that we haven’t
even mentioned could be a homerun for you. Maybe you have super tight control
over your log schemas or maybe you’re using LLMs in a really neat and effective
way. Or maybe you’re building or using a language that has first class support
for controlling secrets.These worked for me. I have some personal opinions on ones which are
foundational, some that are powerful in the long-run, and some that are really
easy to get started. But your story is different, so I’d like to zoom
out and close out with a high-level, methodical strategy that you can apply for
your security programs, and that we’ll apply and walk through with an example.StrategyHere’s a general strategy:Lay the foundationUnderstand the data ﬂowProtect at chokepointsApply defense-in-depthPlan for response and recoveryI’m not shooting for a Nobel, here. You’re probably doing some of these already,
and chances are, you have some type of playbook or process that looks just like
this. The key idea here is to not miss the forest for the trees, and use these
explicit steps to place our efforts where they’ll matter most. I’ll walk you
through a hypothetical system and we’ll apply these in order.0. Lay the foundationStep zero is the foundation. Table stakes. This is like the base tier of
Maslow’s hierarchy, and we need these before we try anything else.Developing expectations, culture, and support is a must-have. They’re easy to
ignore or forget about, but can make or break success. If you work at place that
hasn’t addressed these in the past, it can be quite jarring or difficult to
shift that mentality.I don’t have a ton of advice here other than making sure your org is aligned on
this. It’ll probably feel like it’s getting worse before it’s getting better,
but that is a sign of progress. A great litmus test for a solid foundation is if
developers will (or already have) come to you to report secrets they found in
logs.The second thing we’ll need is to decide is what we consider a secret to begin
with. I, admittedly, used secrets and sensitive data interchangeably. This may
not be the case for you. It doesn’t need to be perfect or comprehensive, and
maybe it’s just a framework. But employees, especially the security team, need
common understanding.The third item is technical. If our logs aren’t structured or aren’t JSON, it’ll
make this endeavor a lot more difficult. A lot of the techniques we discussed
just won’t work. If we don’t have that central pipeline or there isn’t One and
Only One Way to both dispatch and view logs, we’ll have to do a lot more
lifting. We’ve seen a few ways that logs bypass this, but having a central
pipeline should cover most of the bases.1. Understand the data flowWith the foundation laid, the next best thing to do is to understand and chart
out how secrets flow through your system. This is basically a Data Flow Diagram,
and we’ll go through a fairly modest example.On the left, we have users that visit some type of single-page web app. Requests
and data flow through an application load balancer to several web application
services running in containers. This is our core compute and where all the
application code runs. Let’s assume that these are disparate microservices
processing all types of data, some of which are considered secret. For the most
sensitive data, they use KMS to encrypt and then store the ciphertext blobs in
their respective database.And then, applications use a standard logging library to emit to stdout, which
gets shipped to CloudWatch and then forwarded to Datadog. That’s the final stop,
and that’s where employees, devs, support staff, etc. can view them.I highly recommend going through an exercise like this, because not only does it
force you to understand the flows and boundaries of the system, if you spend
time at each node and threat model it, you end up finding a bunch of unexpected
ways and places that secrets make it into logs. For example…Front-end analytics! It turns out that secrets from things like form contents
to session replays could end up getting sent to your user analytics platform.And then what about our application load balancers? These ship their HTTP logs
directly to CloudWatch, so we could be logging embedded secrets in URLs, and
it’s totally bypassing our application tiers.Last surprise: error monitoring! Let’s just say that some team wired up Sentry
instead of DataDog for error monitoring, because of course they did, and now
you have another stream of secrets in logs.We could go further, and we haven’t even drilled into application architecture,
but I think this is a good time to move from discovery to action.2. Protect at chokepointsThe next step we want to take is to protect the chokepoints. And if some flow
isn’t going through that chokepoint, like our rogue team that yeeted Sentry
into prod, we fix it! We can get rid of Sentry and get that team onto the paved
path of our logging pipeline.We have a very clear chokepoint; a narrow path that most logs eventually flow
through. Here’s where most of our lead bullets should go.Here’s that chokepoint splayed out. I also added an upstream node to represent
CI/CD, because that’s how code get into our apps. We can then put the bulk of
our protective controls here on the critical path.We can re-architect the app to use a single logging library and
secure-by-default domain primitives. Then we could use those to build out and
augment our static analysis, taint-checking, and unit tests. These give us a
decent front-line defense for our logging pipeline.3. Apply defense-in-depth“Every preventative control should have a detective control at the same level
and/or one level downstream in the architecture.”
-Phil Venables, https://www.philvenables.com/post/defense-in-depthThe third step is about adding depth to that defense, a concept we’re all
familiar with. I really like how Phil Venables crystallizes what
defense-in-depth means and I think he generally gives great advice. The idea is
that our controls are not simply overlapping, but mutually supportive.
Something’s always got your back.Along this chokepoint we add our downstream components, in depth. Some are
preventative, while some are detective.We can add additional protections like tokenization and read-once objects. We
can add the downstream tools like our custom log formatters, and employ various
sensitive data scanners at different points. And then finally, we can educate
and equip our team.This is what defense-in-depth looks like to me, and I think this maximizes
chances of success.4. Plan for response and recoveryDetermine the scopeRestrict accessStop the bleeding / ﬁx the sourceClean up all the places, e.g. indexesRestore accessDo a post-mortemMake it ~impossible to happen againBut, of course, if we do miss or if we manage to only detect vs. prevent, we
should be prepared for response and recovery. You already know how to respond to
incidents like this, so I won’t add much here, other than making sure you’re
sticking to a playbook in the right order, pulling levers to restrict and
restore access while you’re responding, as well as thinking about all the weird
places secrets might persist in logs, like indexes.ConclusionAnd that’s it. This is the culmination of our strategy, our work, and about 30
some minutes of blabber.With a solid foundation and understanding of our data
flows, we protected our chokepoints in-depth and kept secrets out of logs. We’ve
also introduced a lot of other strong primitives that materially improve our
security program. So is that it? Is the job done?Well, no, because the data team wired up some ETL jobs that are now spewing
secrets into data lake logs, because of course they did.Like most things in security, the job often isn’t ever done. But we have the
understanding, the tools, and a strategy to fight the next fight. Keeping
secrets out of logs is in your hands.*meIf you liked what you heard, or if you hated it, I’d love to hear your story.

1.0 Introduction


SQLite is a TCL extension that has escaped into the wild.



The design of SQLite was inspired by the design of TCL, both in
the way it handles datatypes and in the formatting of its source
code.
The index use case for SQLite was in a Tcl/Tk application for an
industrial company.
From its inception, SQLite has always depended heavily on TCL.
These days, SQLite no longer uses TCL internally and can be run
separately from any TCL interpreter, and yet the SQLite development
process still depends heavily on TCL.


1.1 About SQLite


SQLite is an SQL database engine, and 
the most widely used database engine in the world.
SQLite is built into all cellphones as a core component and is the
primary means of data persistence on phones.  SQLite is also an
integral part of most web browsers.  SQLite is built into MacOS and
is used by most of the default applications on that platform.
Windows10 requires the C:\Windows\System32\winsqlite3.dll file in
order to boot.  Countless other popular applications like Skype 
and WhatsApp and iTunes depend on SQLite.


Because SQLite is open source and can be freely downloaded and
duplicated, exact usage numbers are unavailable.  But reasonable
estimates are that there are more SQLite instances in operation
today than there are people on earth.  Most devices that
use the SQLite database engine contain hundreds of separate databases,
and there are billions of such devices.  Hence, there are likely
around one trillion SQLite databases in active use.


There are more copies of SQLite in use than there are copies of Linux.
We know this because SQLite is used on almost all Linux systems, but
SQLite is also used on many other non-linux systems such as Macs, iPhones,
and Windows computers.
By similar arguments, there are more copies of SQLite in use than
there are Macs, or Windows PCs.
There are probably more copies of SQLite in use than all other database
engines combined.
It seems likely that SQLite is the most widely used and deployed
software component of any kind, with the possible exception of the
zLib compression library.

1.2 SQLite Is A TCL Extension, Not A TCL Application


SQLite is not written in TCL.  Rather, SQLite is intended to be used
by TCL.  Like the TCL interpreter, SQLite is written in ANSI C.


The fact that SQLite was primarily intended to be used from TCL
is evident in an number of ways.


All programming languages, other than C/C++, require some kind of
adaptor in order to interface with the SQLite C implementation.  Language
adaptors for SQLite are widely available from third party programmers.
The adaptors for PHP and Python are built into those languages, for
example.  A Java adaptor is baked into Android.  And so forth.  Only
the TCL adaptor is included as part of the SQLite core.  The source code
file that implements the TCL adaptor for SQLite, "tclsqlite.c",
was part of the very first check-in on the SQLite source repository
on 2000-05-29.  (See 
https://sqlite.org/src/ci/6f3655f79f9b6fc9.)


All modern SQL implementations provide a means to do late binding of
parameter values to the SQL statements.  Usually a naked "?" character,
or a "?" followed by an integer is used.  For example:

SELECT passwd, photo FROM user WHERE uid=?1



The "?1" token in the SQL above would be assigned a value at run-time
in order to look up the password and photograph of a particular user.


SQLite supports this syntax.  But because of its TCL heritage, SQLite
also allows the parameter to take the form of a TCL variable.  Hence:

SELECT passwd, photo FROM user WHERE uid=$uid



When a statement such as the above is run, the TCL language adaptor
automatically binds the value of the $uid TCL variable to the SQL statement
before it is evaluated, providing an intuitive and seamless interface
between TCL and SQL.  SQLite is the only database engine that behaves
this way.


The TCL heritage of SQLite is visible in the type system of
SQLite.  Early versions of SQLite (prior to 2004) operated on the classic
TCL principal that "everything is a string".  Beginning with SQLite3
(2004-06-18), SQLite also supports binary data.  However, types are still
very flexible in SQLite, just as they are in TCL.  SQLite treats the datatypes
on column names in a CREATE TABLE statement as suggestions rather than
hard requirements.  SQLite is happy to store a 100KB string value in a
column that is declared "SHORT INT", just as TCL is happy to store either
a large string or a small integer in the same variable.  There are some
differences in how SQLite deals with datatypes, in comparison to TCL, due
to the different nature of the SQL language.  SQLite has the concept of
"type affinity".  If a column is declared "INT" and one inserts a string
into that column that looks like an integer and can be safely converted into
an integer without loss of information, then that conversion occurs
automatically.  This provides a measure of compatibility with the rigid
type systems of other SQL database engines.


The flexible type system of SQLite seems natural and intuitive to programmers
with prior experience programming in TCL.  Curiously, though, it is a source
of frustration and frequent complaining from programmers accustomed to the
rigid and unforgiving type systems of languages like Java.


The similarities in the type systems of TCL and SQLite extends to more than
just the interface.  An important part of the C/C++ interface for SQLite
is the "sqlite3_value" object
(https://sqlite.org/c3ref/value.html) which is analogous to the
Tcl_Obj object in TCL.  Both TCL and SQLite use a dual-representation approach,
where each value can be represented simultaneously as both a string and
some other type.

2.0 How SQLite Depends On Tcl


SQLite began as a TCL extension, though these days most uses of SQLite
are in applications written in languages other than TCL.  Many programmers
who use SQLite in their applications have no knowledge or awareness of TCL.
The SQLite source code used by most developers is a single file of pure
C code named "sqlite3.c" that contains no TCL code.  
This is what we mean when we
say that SQLite as "escaped" into the wild.  Deployed instances of SQLite
no longer depends on TCL.


Nevertheless, SQLite is still heavily dependent upon TCL and the ongoing
support, maintenance, and enhancement of SQLite would not be possible without
TCL, and would be seriously inconvenienced without Tk.


2.1 SQLite Source Code Is Mostly TCL


The deliverable source code for SQLite is a single file named
"sqlite3.c" and its companion header "sqlite3.h".
Both files are 100% ANSI-C code.  But developers do not edit these
files directly.  The sqlite3.c and sqlite3.h source files are build
products, and the source tree used to build those files is over 50%
TCL code.  Figure 1 nearby shows the exact ratios.



Figure 1: Breakdown Of SQLite Source Code By Language



Figure 1 is for the main SQLite source repository.  Many of the test
cases and much of the documentation is held in separate repositories,
not included in Figure 1.  The separate repositories also contain a great
deal of TCL code.


Much of the TCL code in the main SQLite repository consists of test scripts.
At this writing, the core repository contains 1153 separate test scripts
totally about 389 KB of space.
But this is not the only use of TCL in SQLite.

2.2 Machine Generated C Code


A non-trivial amount of the deliverable C code for SQLite is machine
generated.  Some of the machine generated code is created by C programs,
such as LEMON which translates the SQL language grammar into C code to
implement a push-down automaton to parse the SQL language.  But much of
the automatically generated code is created using TCL scripts.  TCL is
well suited for scanning source files to extract information to be
merged with other files and for making mechanized edits.  For example,
the byte-code engine used to evaluate SQL statements inside of SQLite
is implemented as a large "switch" statement inside a "for" loop, with a
separate "case" for each opcode, all in the "vdbe.c" source file.
At build-time, TCL scripts scan the vdbe.c source file looking for the
appropriate "case" statements and then build header files that assign
consecutive integers to each symbolic opcode name.  (The opcodes used by
the SQLite byte-code engine are not an API as they are in TCL and thus
can change from one build to the next.)  This mapping of symbolic opcode
names into integers is not a simple as one might suppose.  For reasons
of optimization, there are many constraints on the specific values that
are assigned to opcodes.  For example, many opcodes such as OP_Add must
have the same numeric value as the corresponding "+" token in the SQL
language parser.  Sometimes a group of related opcodes, such as the
comparison operators OP_Eq, OP_Ne, OP_Lt, OP_Le, OP_Ge, and OP_Gt, need
to be assigned consecutive integers in a specific order.  These constraints
are all handled effortlessly in TCL.  Accomplishing the
same with AWK would be rather more difficult.


Perhaps the most important task for TCL during the SQLite build process
is constructing the SQLite amalgamation source code file.
Recall that most developers use SQLite in the form of a single big file
of C code named "sqlite3.c" and referred to as "the amalgamation".
A TCL script named "mksqlite3c.tcl" runs in order to construct the
amalgamation from over one hundred separate input files.  Each of these
inputs files must be added to the amalgamation in just the right order.
Furthermore, the source files are edited as part of the amalgamation building
process.  When mksqlite3c.tcl encounters a "#include" for an SQLite header,
it replaces the "#include" with a copy of that header file, taking care
to make sure each header file is only included once.  The mksqlite3.tcl
script automatically adds the "static" keyword to internal SQLite APIs
to give them file linkage, and makes other similar edits.

2.3 The sqlite3_analyzer.exe Utility


In addition to the core SQLite library, the SQLite source tree also contains
code for several analysis and control programs.  One of these programs
is called "sqlite3_analyzer" (or "sqlite3_analyzer.exe" on Windows).
The sqlite3_analyzer program examines an SQLite database and generates
a detailed report on the disk usage by the various tables and indexes
within that database.  The sqlite3_analyzer program is very useful in
understanding how an application is using disk space.


It turns out that sqlite3_analyzer, though disguised as an ordinary
executable, is really a TCL application.  The main source code file for
this application is
tool/spaceanal.tcl.
During the build process, this script is converted into a C-language
string constant (using another TCL script) and added to a very simple
C-language wrapper than starts a TCL interpreter and then passes the
application script to that interpreter.


The sqlite3_analyzer program could be rewritten in pure C.  But that
would be a lot of code.  The TCL script that implements sqlite3_analyzer is
less than 1000 lines long.  The equivalent C program would surely be at
least ten times larger.


Note that the sqlite3_analyzer utility program statically links a TCL
interpreter and so does not require a TCL installation on the target
computer to use.  The sqlite3_analyzer utility program is used by
tens of thousands of developers, most of whom do not realize that they
are really running a TCL application.

2.4 TCL Used For Testing SQLite


One of the key features of SQLite is that it uses aviation-grade testing.
The tests of SQLite, at a minimum, provide 100% modified condition/decision
coverage (MC/DC) of the SQLite code, with independence.  100% MC/DC roughly
means that every branch instruction at the machine code level is exercised
at least once in each direction.  The precise definition of
MC/DC is slightly stricter than this, for example when comparing boolean
vectors, but the 100% branch tests coverage definition is very close
approximation.  The "with independence" term means that SQLite is tested
in multiple ways with test code being written and maintained by different
individuals.


The amount of testing done on SQLite is fanatical.  On the other hand,
that level of testing is necessary for a fundamental low-level component,
such as a database engine, that is used by billions of devices.  If an
ordinary application encounters an obscure bug, it can normally be rebooted 
to clear the problem.  But the job of a database engine is to remember things,
and so databases tend to remember their mistakes across reboots.  For these
reasons, it is important that SQLite have a very low bug density.


TCL is used in every aspect of SQLite testing.
The test cases that are part of the primary SQLite source code
repository are written in TCL.
Other test cases such as 
TH3 and
SQLLogicTest are written
in C but still depend on TCL for operation.


The TH3 test suite is a set of proprietary tests for SQLite that form the
primary means of achieving 100% MC/DC.  TH3 is designed to
run on embedded hardware without the support of a desktop operating system.
TH3 consists of over 1350 test modules together with over 100 control files.
The test modules are written in either C or SQL or a combination of both.
The control files are text formatted in a way that easily parsed by TCL.
To build a TH3 test, a TCL script is run that combines some subset of the
test modules and control files into a single large C program that will
automatically run the required tests.  This C program is then linked against
the "sqlite3.c" amalgamation and the resulting binary is moved to the target
computer and executed.  TCL scripts automate this entire process on
all major host platforms.


To verify that the TH3 tests really do provide 100% MC/DC, special options
are added to the TCL scripts that run the tests, causing the GCC coverage
analysis tools to be invoked.  The output of gcov is then postprocessed to
reveal and report any branch instructions that were missed by the tests.
The TH3 tests themselves are all implemented in C and SQL, but the operation
and management of those tests is all done with TCL.

2.5 TCL Generated Documentation


The extensive documentation for SQLite available on the SQLite website
(https://sqlite.org/) is all generated
by TCL.  Many of the documents, such as the API reference documentation and
the descriptions of the byte-code engine opcodes, are created by TCL scripts
that scan C source code and extract the necessary information from the code
and comments.  Thus, the API documentation is largely derived from
comments in the source code.  Keeping the official documentation (in
comments) and the source code close together helps ensure that they are
in agreement.


Other whitepaper documents are generated from source files that look 
mostly like
HTML but which contain additional TCL code embedded inside of
<tcl>...</tcl> markup.  The added TCL code is used for
advanced formatting techniques, for automatically creating cross-references
and cross-links, and for constructing complex displays such as the
popular "rail-road" syntax diagrams for SQL.

2.6 Tcl/Tk Used During Development Of SQLite


The text editor used by the primary author of SQLite is a custom editor
with emacs-style key bindings that is built on top of the Tk Text widget.
The "e" editor, as it is called, is cross-platform, which helps in the
development of a cross-platform software library like SQLite.  The "e"
editor has been used for the entire 17-year history of SQLite.  It has
been enhanced over the years with various customizations created especially
to help manage the SQLite source code.


The Fossil version control system used for the SQLite source code
(and written specifically for that purpose) uses Tcl/Tk to show graphical
side-by-side diffs in a separate window.  When the "fossil diff --tk"
command is run, Fossil generates a script to show the diff graphically
and then kicks off a separate "wish" process to run that script and
display the diff in a separate window.  This graphical diff window has
a "Save" button which will cause the Tcl/Tk code needed to reproduce itself
to be written to a file.  This file can be, in turn, sent to a collaborator
for display.  Passing around graphical diffs as ordinary text files is
much simpler and easier than passing around JPEG images or text "context"
diffs.


No two SQLite developers work in the same office.  The team is
geographically distributed.  To help the team stay in touch, a custom
chatroom has been created using a Tcl/Tk script.  The same script works
as both client and server.  The chatroom is private and uses a proprietary
protocol, so that developers are free to discuss sensitive matters without
fear of eavesdropping.  The chatroom is implemented as just over
1000 lines of Tk code, and is thus accessible and easy to customize.
Among the customizations is the ability to send saved "fossil diff --tk"
graphical diffs to collaborators and have the diff pop automatically on
the collaborators screen.  Small features like this seem trivial
by themselves, but together than help the developers
to work much more efficiently.  These kinds of productivity-enhancing
features are unavailable to users of commercial business collaboration 
packages such as HipChat.

3.0 Summary


SQLite is an indispensable element of most modern computer systems, and
TCL is an indispensable tool used in the production and maintenance of
SQLite.  Thus, the computing infrastructure we enjoy today would not exist
except for TCL.


As deployed, SQLite contains no TCL code.
However, the design of SQLite is inspired by TCL.
And TCL is used extensively in the code generation, testing,
analysis, documentation, and development of SQLite.  Without
TCL, SQLite would not exist.


Every developer and every team has a finite number of "brain cycles"
available to do their job.  The fewer cycles spent messing with tools,
the more cycles are available to devote towards solving the problem.
So for maximum productivity, it is important to use tools that get
the job done with a minimum of fuss and bother.
Our 17-year experience using TCL in the SQLite project has convinced
us that TCL is just such a tool.  Tcl provides the most help per
brain cycle of any similar technology.

  The Intel 285K CPU in my high-end 2025 Linux
PC died again! 😡 Notably,
this was the replacement CPU for the original 285K that died in
March, and
after reading through the reviews of Intel CPUs on my electronics store of
choice, many of which (!) mention CPU replacements, I am getting the impression
that Intel’s current CPUs just are not stable 😞. Therefore, I am giving up on
Intel for the coming years and have bought an AMD Ryzen 9950X3D CPU instead.
What happened? Or: the batch job of death
On the 9th of July, I set out to experiment with
layout-parser and
tesseract in order to
convert a collection of scanned paper documents from images into text.
I expected that offloading this task to the GPU would result in a drastic
speed-up, so I attempted to build layout-parser with
CUDA. Usually, it’s not required to
compile software yourself on NixOS, but CUDA is non-free,
so the default NixOS cache does not compile software with CUDA. (Tip: Enable the
Nix Community Cache, which contains prebuilt
CUDA packages, too!)
This lengthy compilation attempt failed with a weird symptom: I left for work,
and after a while, my PC was no longer reachable over the network, but fans kept
spinning at 100%! 😳 At first, I suspected a Linux
bug, but now I am thinking this was
the first sign of the CPU being unreliable.
When the CUDA build failed, I ran the batch job without GPU offloading
instead. It took about 4 hours and consumed roughly 300W constantly. You can see
it on this CPU usage graph:


































On the evening of the 9th, the computer still seemed to work fine.
But the next day, when I wanted to wake up my PC from suspend-to-RAM as usual,
it wouldn’t wake up. Worse, even after removing the power cord and waiting a few
seconds, there was no reaction to pressing the power button.
Later, I diagnosed the problem to either the mainboard and/or the CPU. The Power
Supply, RAM and disk all work with different hardware. I ended up returning both
the CPU and the mainboard, as I couldn’t further diagnose which of the two is
broken.
To be clear: I am not saying the batch job killed the CPU. The computer was
acting strangely in the morning already. But the batch job might have been what
really sealed the deal.
No, it wasn’t the heat wave
Tom’s Hardware recently
reported
that “Intel Raptor Lake crashes are increasing with rising temperatures in
record European heat wave”, which prompted some folks to blame Europe’s general
lack of Air Conditioning.
But in this case, I actually did air-condition the room about half-way
through the job (at about 16:00), when I noticed the room was getting
hot. Here’s the temperature graph:















I would say that 25 to 28 degrees celsius are normal temperatures for computers.
I also double-checked if the CPU temperature of about 100 degrees celsius is too
high, but no: this Tom’s Hardware
article
shows even higher temperatures, and Intel specifies a maximum of 110
degrees. So, running at “only” 100 degrees for a few hours should be fine.
Lastly, even if Intel CPUs were prone to crashing under high heat, they should
never die.
Which AMD CPU to buy?
I wanted the fastest AMD CPU (for desktops, not for servers), which currently is
the Ryzen 9 9950X, but there is also the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, a variant with 3D
V-Cache. Depending on the use-case, the variant with or without 3D V-Cache is
faster, see the comparison on
Phoronix.
Ultimately, I decided for the 9950X3D model, not just because it performs better
in many of the benchmarks, but also because Linux 6.13 and newer let you
control whether to prefer the CPU cores with larger V-Cache or higher
frequency,
which sounds like an interesting capability: By changing this setting, maybe one
can see how sensitive certain workloads are to extra cache.
Aside from the CPU, I also needed a new mainboard (for AMD’s socket AM5), but I
kept all the other components. I ended up selecting the ASUS TUF
X870+
mainboard. I usually look for low power usage in a mainboard, so I made sure to
go with an X870 mainboard instead of an X870E one, because the X870E has two
chipsets (both of which consume power and need cooling)! Given the context of
this hardware replacement, I also like the TUF line’s focus on endurance…
Performance
The performance of the AMD 9950X3D seems to be slightly better than the Intel
285K:

In case you’re curious, the commands used for each workload are:

make test

(I have not included the gokrazy UEFI integration tests because I think there is
an unrelated difference that prevents comparison of my old results with how the
test runs currently.)
Power consumption
In my high-end 2025 Linux PC I
explained that I chose the Intel 285K CPU for its lower idle power consumption,
and some folks were skeptical if AMD CPUs are really worse in that regard.
Having switched between 3 different PCs, but with identical peripherals, I can
now answer the question of how the top CPUs differ in power consumption!
I picked a few representative point-in-time power values from a couple of days
of usage:

          idle power

Looking at two typical evenings, here is the power consumption of the Intel 285K:















…and here is the same PC setup, but with the AMD 9950X3D:















I get the general impression that the AMD CPU has higher power consumption in
all regards: the baseline is higher, the spikes are higher (peak consumption)
and it spikes more often / for longer.
Looking at my energy meter statistics, I usually ended up at about 9.x kWh per
day for a two-person household, cooking with induction.
After switching my PC from Intel to AMD, I end up at 10-11 kWh per day.
Conclusion
I started buying Intel CPUs because they allowed me to build high-performance
computers that ran Linux flawlessly and produced little noise. This formula
worked for me over many years:

Back in 2008, I bought a mobile Intel CPU in a desktop case (article in
German).
Then, in 2012, I could just buy a regular Intel CPU (i7-2600K) for my Linux
PC, because they had gotten so
much better in terms of power saving.
Over the years, I bought an i7-8700K, and later an i9-9900K.
The last time this formula worked out for me was with my 2022 high-end Linux
PC.

On the one hand, I’m a little sad that this era has ended. On the other hand, I
have had a soft spot for AMD since I had one of their K6 CPUs in one of my early
PCs and in fact, I have never stopped buying AMD CPUs (e.g. for my Ryzen
7-based Mini
Server).
Maybe AMD could further improve their idle power usage in upcoming models? And,
if Intel survives for long enough, maybe they succeed at stabilizing their CPU
designs again? I certainly would love to see some competition in the CPU market.

                The craft of programming is almost universally concerned with different types of
data and operations/algorithms that act on this data [1]. Therefore, it's
hardly surprising that designing abstractions for data types and operations has
been on the mind of software engineers and programming-language designers
since... forever.
Yet I've only recently encountered a name for a software design problem which I
ran into multiple times in my career. It's a problem so fundamental that I was
quite surprised that I haven't seen it named before. Here is a quick problem
statement.
Imagine that we have a set of data types and a set of operations that act on
these types. Sometimes we need to add more operations and make sure they work
properly on all types; sometimes we need to add more types and make sure all
operations work properly on them. Sometimes, however, we need to add both - and
herein lies the problem. Most of the mainstream programming languages don't
provide good tools to add both new types and new operations to an existing
system without having to change existing code. This is called the "expression
problem". Studying the problem and its possible solutions gives great insight
into the fundamental differences between object-oriented and functional
programming and well as concepts like interfaces and multiple dispatch.

A motivating example
As is my wont, my example comes from the world of compilers and interpreters.
To my defense, this is also the example used in some of the seminal historic
sources on the expression problem, as the historical perspective section below
details.
Imagine we're designing a simple expression evaluator. Following the standard
interpreter design pattern, we have
a tree structure consisting of expressions, with some operations we can do on
such trees. In C++ we'd have an interface every node in the expression tree
would have to implement:
class Expr {
public:
  virtual std::string ToString() const = 0;
  virtual double Eval() const = 0;
};

This interface shows that we currently have two operations we can do on
expression trees - evaluate them and query for their string representations.
A typical leaf node expression:
class Constant : public Expr {
public:
  Constant(double value) : value_(value) {}

  std::string ToString() const {
    std::ostringstream ss;
    ss << value_;
    return ss.str();
  }

  double Eval() const {
    return value_;
  }

private:
  double value_;
};

And a typical composite expression:
class BinaryPlus : public Expr {
public:
  BinaryPlus(const Expr& lhs, const Expr& rhs) : lhs_(lhs), rhs_(rhs) {}

  std::string ToString() const {
    return lhs_.ToString() + " + " + rhs_.ToString();
  }

  double Eval() const {
    return lhs_.Eval() + rhs_.Eval();
  }

private:
  const Expr& lhs_;
  const Expr& rhs_;
};

Until now, it's all fairly basic stuff. How extensible is this design? Let's
see... if we want to add new expression types ("variable reference", "function
call" etc.), that's pretty easy. We just define additional classes inheriting
from Expr and implement the Expr interface (ToString and Eval).
However, what happens if we want to add new operations that can be applied to
expression trees? Right now we have Eval and ToString, but we may want
additional operations like "type check" or "serialize" or "compile to
machine code" or whatever.
It turns out that adding new operations isn't as easy as adding new types. We'd
have to change the Expr interface, and consequently change every existing
expression type to support the new method(s). If we don't control the original
code or it's hard to change it for other reasons, we're in trouble.
In other words, we'd have to violate the venerable open-closed principle,
one of the main principles of object-oriented design, defined
as:

software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for
extension, but closed for modification
The problem we're hitting here is called the expression problem, and the
example above shows how it applies to object-oriented programming.
Interestingly, the expression problem bites functional programming languages as
well. Let's see how.


The expression problem in functional programming
Update 2018-02-05: a new post
discusses the problem and its solutions in Haskell in more depth.
Object-oriented approaches tend to collect functionality in objects (types).
Functional languages cut the cake from a different angle, usually preferring
types as thin data containers, collecting most functionality in functions
(operations) that act upon them. Functional languages don't escape the
expression problem - it just manifests there in a different way.
To demonstrate this, let's see how the expression evaluator / stringifier looks
in Haskell. Haskell is a good poster child for functional programming since its
pattern matching on types makes such code especially succinct:
module Expressions where

data Expr = Constant Double
          | BinaryPlus Expr Expr

stringify :: Expr -> String
stringify (Constant c) = show c
stringify (BinaryPlus lhs rhs) = stringify lhs
                                ++ " + "
                                ++ stringify rhs

evaluate :: Expr -> Double
evaluate (Constant c) = c
evaluate (BinaryPlus lhs rhs) = evaluate lhs + evaluate rhs

Now let's say we want to add a new operation - type checking. We simply have
to add a new function typecheck and define how it behaves for all known
kinds of expressions. No need to modify existing code.
On the other hand, if we want to add a new type (like "function call"), we get
into trouble. We now have to modify all existing functions to handle this new
type. So we hit exactly the same problem, albeit from a different angle.



A visual representation of the expression problem can be helpful to appreciate
how it applies to OOP and FP in different ways, and how a potential solution
would look.
The following 2-D table (a "matrix") has types in its rows and operations in its
columns. A matrix cell row, col is checked when the operation col is
implemented for type row:
In object-oriented languages, it's easy to add new types but difficult to add
new operations:
Whereas in functional languages, it's easy to add new operations but difficult
to add new types:



A historical perspective
The expression problem isn't new, and has likely been with us since the early
days; it pops its head as soon as programs reach some not-too-high level of
complexity.
It's fairly certain that the name expression problem comes from an email sent
by Philip Wadler to a mailing
list deailing with adding generics to Java (this was back in the 1990s).
In that email, Wadler points to the paper "Synthesizing Object-Oriented and
Functional Design to Promote Re-Use" by
Krishnamurthi, Felleisen and Friedman as an earlier work describing the problem
and proposed solutions. This is a great paper and I highly recommend reading it.
Krishnamurthi et.al., in their references, point to papers from as early as 1975
describing variations of the problem in Algol.


Flipping the matrix with the visitor pattern
So far the article has focused on the expression problem, and I hope it's
clear by now. However, the title also has the word solution in it, so let's
turn to that.
It's possible to kinda solve (read on to understand why I say "kinda") the
expression problem in object-oriented languages; first, we have to look at how
we can flip the problem on its side using the visitor pattern. The visitor
pattern is very common for this kind of problems, and for a good reason. It lets
us reformulate our code in a way that makes it easier to change in some
dimensions (though harder in others).
For the C++ sample shown above, rewriting it using the visitor pattern means
adding a new "visitor" interface:
class ExprVisitor {
public:
  virtual void VisitConstant(const Constant& c) = 0;
  virtual void VisitBinaryPlus(const BinaryPlus& bp) = 0;
};

And changing the Expr interface to be:
class Expr {
public:
  virtual void Accept(ExprVisitor* visitor) const = 0;
};

Now expression types defer the actual computation to the visitor, as
follows:
class Constant : public Expr {
public:
  Constant(double value) : value_(value) {}

  void Accept(ExprVisitor* visitor) const {
    visitor->VisitConstant(*this);
  }

  double GetValue() const {
    return value_;
  }

private:
  double value_;
};

// ... similarly, BinaryPlus would have
//
//    void Accept(ExprVisitor* visitor) const {
//      visitor->VisitBinaryPlus(*this);
//    }
//
// ... etc.

A sample visitor for evaluation would be [2]:
class Evaluator : public ExprVisitor {
public:
  double GetValueForExpr(const Expr& e) {
    return value_map_[&e];
  }

  void VisitConstant(const Constant& c) {
    value_map_[&c] = c.GetValue();
  }

  void VisitBinaryPlus(const BinaryPlus& bp) {
    bp.GetLhs().Accept(this);
    bp.GetRhs().Accept(this);
    value_map_[&bp] = value_map_[&(bp.GetLhs())] + value_map_[&(bp.GetRhs())];
  }

private:
  std::map<const Expr*, double> value_map_;
};

It should be obvious that for a given set of data types, adding new visitors is
easy and doesn't require modifying any other code. On the other hand, adding new
types is problematic since it means we have to update the ExprVisitor
interface with a new abstract method, and consequently update all the visitors
to implement it.
So it seems that we've just turned the expression problem on its side: we're
using an OOP language, but now it's hard to add types and easy to add ops, just
like in the functional approach. I find it extremely interesting that we can do
this. In my eyes this highlights the power of different abstractions and
paradigms, and how they enable us to rethink a problem in a completely different
light.
So we haven't solved anything yet; we've just changed the nature of the problem
we're facing. Worry not - this is just a stepping stone to an actual solution.


Extending the visitor pattern
The following is code excerpts from a C++ solution that follows the extended
visitor pattern proposed by Krishnamurthi et. al. in their paper; I strongly
suggest reading the paper (particularly section 3) if you want to understand
this code on a deep level. A complete code sample in C++ that compiles and runs
is available here.
Adding new visitors (ops) with the visitor pattern is easy. Our challenge is to
add a new type without upheaving too much existing code. Let's see how it's
done.
One small design change that we should make to the original visitor pattern is
use virtual inheritance for Evaluator, for reasons that will soon become
obvious:
class Evaluator : virtual public ExprVisitor {
  // .. the rest is the same
};

Now we're going to add a new type - FunctionCall:
// This is the new ("extended") expression we're adding.
class FunctionCall : public Expr {
public:
  FunctionCall(const std::string& name, const Expr& argument)
      : name_(name), argument_(argument) {}

  void Accept(ExprVisitor* visitor) const {
    ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall* v =
        dynamic_cast<ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall*>(visitor);
    if (v == nullptr) {
      std::cerr << "Fatal: visitor is not ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall\n";
      exit(1);
    }
    v->VisitFunctionCall(*this);
  }

private:
  std::string name_;
  const Expr& argument_;
};

Since we don't want to modify the existing visitors, we create a new one,
extending Evaluator for function calls. But first, we need to extend the
ExprVisitor interface to support the new type:
class ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall : virtual public ExprVisitor {
public:
  virtual void VisitFunctionCall(const FunctionCall& fc) = 0;
};

Finally, we write the new evaluator, which extends Evaluator and supports
the new type:
class EvaluatorWithFunctionCall : public ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall,
                                  public Evaluator {
public:
  void VisitFunctionCall(const FunctionCall& fc) {
    std::cout << "Visiting FunctionCall!!\n";
  }
};

Multiple inheritance, virtual inheritance, dynamic type checking... that's
pretty hard-core C++ we have to use here, but there's no choice. Unfortunately,
multiple inheritance is the only way C++ lets us express the idea that a class
implements some interface while at the same time deriving functionality from
another class. What we want to have here is an evaluator
(EvaluatorWithFunctionCall) that inherits all functionality from
Evaluator, and also implements the ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall
interface. In Java, we could say something like:
class EvaluatorWithFunctionCall extends Evaluator implements ExprVisitor {
  // ...
}

But in C++ virtual multiple inheritance is the tool we have. The virtual part of
the inheritance is essential here for the compiler to figure out that the
ExprVisitor base underlying both Evaluator and
ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall is the same and should only appear once in
EvaluatorWithFunctionCall. Without virtual, the compiler would complain that
EvaluatorWithFunctionCall doesn't implement the ExprVisitor interface.
This is a solution, alright. We kinda added a new type FunctionCall and can
now visit it without changing existing code (assuming the virtual inheritance
was built into the design from the start to anticipate this approach). Here I
am using this "kinda" word again... it's time to explain why.
This approach has multiple flaws, in my opinion:

Note the dynamic_cast in FunctionCall::Accept. It's fairly ugly that
we're forced to mix in dynamic checks into this code, which should supposedly
rely on static typing and the compiler. But it's just a sign of a larger
problem.
If we have an instance of an Evaluator, it will no longer work on the
whole extended expression tree since it has no understanding of
FunctionCall. It's easy to say that all new evaluators should rather be
EvaluatorWithFunctionCall, but we don't always control this. What about
code that was already written? What about Evaluators created in
third-party or library code which we have no control of?
The virtual inheritance is not the only provision we have to build into the
design to support this pattern. Some visitors would need to create new,
recursive visitors to process complex expressions. But we can't anticipate
in advance which dynamic type of visitor needs to be created. Therefore,
the visitor interface should also accept a "visitor factory" which extended
visitors will supply. I know this sounds complicated, and I don't want to
spend more time on this here - but the Krishnamurthi paper addresses this
issue extensively in section 3.4
Finally, the solution is unwieldy for realistic applications. Adding one
new type looks manageable; what about adding 15 new types, gradually over
time? Imagine the horrible zoo of ExprVisitor extensions and dynamic
checks this would lead to.

Yeah, programming is hard. I could go on and on about the limitations of
classical OOP and how they surface in this example [3]. Instead, I'll just
present how the expression problem can be solved in a language that supports
multiple dispatch and separates the defintion of methods from the bodies of
types they act upon.


Solving the expression problem in Clojure
There are a number of ways the expression problem as displayed in this article
can be solved in Clojure using the language's built-in features. Let's start
with the simplest one - multi-methods.
First we'll define the types as records:
(defrecord Constant [value])
(defrecord BinaryPlus [lhs rhs])

Then, we'll define evaluate as a multimethod that dispatches upon the type
of its argument, and add method implementations for Constant and
BinaryPlus:
(defmulti evaluate class)

(defmethod evaluate Constant
  [c] (:value c))

(defmethod evaluate BinaryPlus
  [bp] (+ (evaluate (:lhs bp)) (evaluate (:rhs bp))))

Now we can already evaluate expressions:
user=> (use 'expression.multimethod)
nil
user=> (evaluate (->BinaryPlus (->Constant 1.1) (->Constant 2.2)))
3.3000000000000003

Adding a new operation is easy. Let's add stringify:
(defmulti stringify class)

(defmethod stringify Constant
  [c] (str (:value c)))

(defmethod stringify BinaryPlus
  [bp]
  (clojure.string/join " + " [(stringify (:lhs bp))
                              (stringify (:rhs bp))]))

Testing it:
user=> (stringify (->BinaryPlus (->Constant 1.1) (->Constant 2.2)))
"1.1 + 2.2"

How about adding new types? Suppose we want to add FunctionCall. First,
we'll define the new type. For simplicity, the func field of
FunctionCall is just a Clojure function. In real code it could be some sort
of function object in the language we're interpreting:
(defrecord FunctionCall [func argument])

And define how evaluate and stringify work for FunctionCall:
(defmethod evaluate FunctionCall
  [fc] ((:func fc) (evaluate (:argument fc))))

(defmethod stringify FunctionCall
  [fc] (str (clojure.repl/demunge (str (:func fc)))
            "("
            (stringify (:argument fc))
            ")"))

Let's take it for a spin (the full code is here):
user=> (def callexpr (->FunctionCall twice (->BinaryPlus (->Constant 1.1)
                                                         (->Constant 2.2))))
#'user/callexpr
user=> (evaluate callexpr)
6.6000000000000005
user=> (stringify callexpr)
"expression.multimethod/twice@52e29c38(1.1 + 2.2)"

It should be evident that the expression problem matrix for Clojure is:
We can add new ops without touching any existing code. We can also add new types
without touching any existing code. The code we're adding is only the new code
to handle the ops/types in question. The existing ops and types could come from
a third-party library to which we don't have source access. We could still
extend them for our new ops and types, without ever having to touch (or even
see) the original source code [4].


Is multiple dispatch necessary to cleanly solve the expression problem?
I've written about multiple dispatch in Clojure
before, and in the previous section we see another example of how to use the
language's defmulti/defmethod constructs. But is it multiple dispatch at
all? No! It's just single dispatch, really. Our ops (evaluate and
stringify) dispatch on a single argument - the expression type) [5].
If we're not really using multiple dispatch, what is the secret sauce that
lets us solve the expression problem so elegantly in Clojure? The answer is -
open methods. Note a crucial difference between how methods are defined in
C++/Java and in Clojure. In C++/Java, methods have to be part of a class and
defined (or at least declared) in its body. You cannot add a method to a class
without changing the class's source code.
In Clojure, you can. In fact, since data types and multimethods are orthogonal
entities, this is by design. Methods simply live outside types - they are first
class citizens, rather than properties of types. We don't add methods to a
type, we add new methods that act upon the type. This doesn't require
modifying the type's code in any way (or even having access to its code).
Some of the other popular programming languages take a middle way. In languages
like Python, Ruby and JavaScript methods belong to types, but we can dynamically
add, remove and replace methods in a class even after it was created. This
technique is lovingly called monkey patching. While initially enticing, it
can lead to big maintainability headaches in code unless we're very careful.
Therefore, if I had to face the expression problem in Python I'd prefer to roll
out some sort of multiple dispatch mechanism
for my program rather than rely on monkey patching.


Another Clojure solution - using protocols
Clojure's multimethods are very general and powerful. So general, in fact, that
their performance may not be optimal for the most common case - which is single
dispatch based on the type of the sole method argument; note that this is
exactly the kind of dispatch I'm using in this article. Therefore, starting with
Clojure 1.2, user code gained the ability to define and use protocols - a
language feature that was previously restricted only to built-in types.
Protocols leverage the host platform's (which in Clojure's case is mostly Java)
ability to provide quick virtual dispatch, so using them is a very efficient way
to implement runtime polymorphism. In addition, protocols retain enough of
the flexibility of multimethods to elegantly solve the expression problem.
Curiously, this was on the mind of Clojure's designers right from the start. The
Clojure documentation page about protocols lists this as one of their
capabilities:

[...] Avoid the 'expression problem' by allowing independent extension of the
set of types, protocols, and implementations of protocols on types, by
different parties. [...] do so without wrappers/adapters
Clojure protocols are an interesting topic, and while I'd like to spend some
more time on them, this article is becoming too long as it is. So I'll leave
a more thorough treatment for some later time and for now will just show how
protocols can also be used to solve the expression problem we're discussing.
The type definitions remain the same:
(defrecord Constant [value])
(defrecord BinaryPlus [lhs rhs])

However, instead of defining a multimethod for each operation, we now define
a protocol. A protocol can be thought of as an interface in a language like
Java, C++ or Go - a type implements an interface when it defines the set of
methods declared by the interface. In this respect, Clojure's protocols are more
like Go's interfaces than Java's, as we don't have to say a-priori which
interfaces a type implements when we define it.
Let's start with the Evaluatable protocol, that consists of a single method
- evaluate:
(defprotocol Evaluatable
  (evaluate [this]))

Another protocol we'll define is Stringable:
(defprotocol Stringable
  (stringify [this]))

Now we can make sure our types implement these protocols:
(extend-type Constant
  Evaluatable
    (evaluate [this] (:value this))
  Stringable
    (stringify [this] (str (:value this))))

(extend-type BinaryPlus
  Evaluatable
    (evaluate [this] (+ (evaluate (:lhs this)) (evaluate (:rhs this))))
  Stringable
    (stringify [this]
      (clojure.string/join " + " [(stringify (:lhs this))
                                  (stringify (:rhs this))])))

The extend-type macro is a convenience wrapper around the more general
extend - it lets us implement multiple protocols for a given type.
A sibling macro named extend-protocol lets us implement the same protocol
for multiple types in the same invocation [6].
It's fairly obvious that adding new data types is easy - just as we did above,
we simply use extend-type for each new data type to implement our current
protocols. But how do we add a new protocol and make sure all existing data
types implement it? Once again, it's easy because we don't have to modify any
existing code. Here's a new protocol:
(defprotocol Serializable
  (serialize [this]))

And this is its implementation for the currently supported data types:
(extend-protocol Serializable
  Constant
    (serialize [this] [(type this) (:value this)])
  BinaryPlus
    (serialize [this] [(type this)
                       (serialize (:lhs this))
                       (serialize (:rhs this))]))

This time, extending a single protocol for multiple data types -
extend-protocol is the more convenient macro to use.


Small interfaces are extensibility-friendly
You may have noted that the protocols (interfaces) defined in the Clojure
solution are very small - consisting of a single method. Since adding methods to
an existing protocol is much more problematic (I'm not aware of a way to do this
in Clojure), keeping protocols small is a good idea. This guideline comes up in
other contexts as well; for example, it's good practice to keep interfaces in Go
very minimal.
In our C++ solution, splitting the Expr interface could also be a good idea,
but it wouldn't help us with the expression problem, since we can't modify which
interfaces a class implements after we've defined it; in Clojure we can.




[1]"Types of data" and "operations" are two terms that should be fairly
obvious to modern-day programmers. Philip Wadler, in his discussion of
the expression problem (see the "historical perspective" section of the
article) calls them "datatypes" and "functions". A famous quote from Fred
Brooks's The Mythical Man Month (1975) is "Show me your flowcharts and
conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your
tables, and I won’t usually need your flowcharts; they’ll be obvious."





[2]Note the peculiar way in which data is passed between Visit* methods
in a Expr* -> Value map kept in the visitor. This is due to our
inability to make Visit* methods return different types in different
visitors. For example, in Evaluator we'd want them to return
double, but in Stringifier they'd probably return
std::string. Unfortunately C++ won't let us easily mix templates and
virtual functions, so we have to resort to either returning void* the
C way or the method I'm using here.
Curiously, in their paper Krishnamurthi et.al. run into the same issue in
the dialect of Java they're using, and propose some language extensions
to solve it. Philip Wadler uses proposed Java generics in his approach.






[3]I can't resist, so just in brief: IMHO inheritance is only good for a
very narrow spectrum of uses, but languages like C++ hail it as the main
extension mechanism of types. But inheritance is deeply
flawed for many other use cases, such as implementations of
interfaces. Java is a bit better in this regard, but in the end the
primacy of classes and their "closed-ness" make a lot of tasks - like the
expression problem - very difficult to express in a clean way.





[4]In fact, there are plenty of examples in which the Clojure implementation
and the standard library provide protocols that can be extended by the
user for user-defined types. Extending user-written protocols and
multimethods for built-in types is trivial. As an exercise, add an
evaluate implementation for java.lang.Long, so that built-in
integers could participate in our expression trees without requiring
wrapping in a Constant.





[5]FWIW, we can formulate a multiple dispatch solution to the expression
problem in Clojure. The key idea is to dispatch on two things: type and
operation. Just for fun, I coded a prototype that does this which you can

I think the approach presented in the article - each operation being its
own multimethod - is preferable, though.

The Microdot
web framework is quite small, as its name would imply; it supports both
standard CPython and MicroPython,
so it can be used on systems ranging from internet-of-things (IoT) devices
all the way up to large, cloudy servers.  It was developed by Miguel
Grinberg, who gave a presentation about it at EuroPython 2025.  His name
may sound familiar from his well-known Flask
Mega-Tutorial, which has introduced many to the Flask lightweight Python-based
web framework.  It should come as no surprise, then, that Microdot is
inspired by its rather larger cousin, so Flask enthusiasts will find much
to like in Microdot—and will come up to speed quickly should their needs turn
toward smaller systems.



We have looked at various pieces of this software stack along the way: Microdot itself in January 2024, MicroPython in 2023, and Flask as part of a look at Python microframeworks in
2019.



Grinberg began his talk with an introduction.  He has been living in
Ireland for a few years and "I make stuff".  That includes open-source projects, blog posts (on a
Flask-based blog platform that he wrote), and "a bunch of books".
He works for Elastic and is one of the maintainers of the Elasticsearch
Python client, "so maybe you have used some of the things that I
made for money".


Why?


With a chuckle, he asked: "Why do we need another web framework?  We
have so many already."  The story starts with a move that he made to
Ireland from the US in 2018; he rented a house with a "smart" heating
controller and was excited to use it.  There were two thermostats, one for
each level of the house, and he was "really looking forward to the
winter" to see the system in action.



As might be guessed, he could set target temperatures in each thermostat;
they would communicate with the controller that would turn the heating on
and off as needed.  In addition, the system had a web server that could be
used to query various parameters or to start and stop the heaters.  You
could even send commands via SMS text messages; "there's a SIM card
somewhere in that box [...] very exciting stuff".



When winter rolled around, it did not work that well, however; sometimes
the house was too chilly or warm and he had to start and stop the heaters
himself. He did some debugging and found that the thermostats were
reporting temperatures that were off by ±3°C, "which is too much for
trying to keep the house at 20°".  The owner of the house thought that
he was too used to the US where things just work; "at least she thinks that in America everything is super-efficient,
everything works, and she thought 'this is the way things work in
Ireland'".  So he did not make any progress with the owner.



At that point, most people would probably just give up and live with the
problem; "I hacked my heating controller instead".  He set the
temperatures in both thermostats to zero, which effectively disabled their
ability to affect the heaters at all, and built two small boards running
MicroPython, each connected to a temperature and humidity sensor device.
He wrote code that would check the temperature every five minutes and send
the appropriate commands to start or stop the heaters based on what it
found.



So the second half of his first winter in Ireland went great.  The sensors
are accurate to ±0.5°C, so "problem solved".  But, that led to a new
problem for him.  "I wanted to know things: What's the temperature right
now?  Is the heating running right now or not?  How many hours did it run
today compared to yesterday?"  And so on.



He added a small LCD screen to display some information, but he had to
actually go to the device and look at it; what he really wanted was to be
able to talk to the device over WiFi and get information from the couch
while he was watching TV. "I wanted to host a web server [...]  that
will show me a little dashboard".



So he searched for web frameworks
for MicroPython; in the winter of 2018-2019, "there were none".
Neither Flask nor Bottle,
which is a good bit smaller, would run on MicroPython; both are too large
for the devices,
but, in addition, the standard library for MicroPython is a subset of that of
CPython, so many things that they need are missing. A "normal
person" would likely have just accepted that and moved on; "I
created a web framework instead."


Demo


He brought one of his thermostat devices to Prague for the conference and
did a small demonstration of it operating during the talk.  The device was
connected to his laptop using USB, which provided power, but also a serial
connection to the board.  On the laptop, he used the rshell
remote MicroPython shell to talk to the board, effectively using the laptop
as a terminal.





He started the MicroPython read-eval-print loop (REPL) on the board in
order to simulate the normal operation of the board.  When it is plugged
into the wall, rather than a laptop, it will boot to the web server, so he
made that happen with a soft-reboot command.  The device then connected to
the conference WiFi and gave him the IP address (and port) where the server
was running.



He switched over to Firefox on his laptop and visited the site, which showed a
dashboard that had the current temperature (24.4°) and relative humidity
(56.9%) of the room.  He also used curl from the laptop to contact the
api endpoint of the web application, which returned JSON with the
two values and the time.  There is no persistent clock on the board, so the
application contacts an NTP server to pick up the time when it boots; that
allows it to report the last time a measurement was taken.



Grinberg said that he wanted to set the expectations at the right level by
looking at the capabilities of the microcontrollers he often uses with
Microdot.  For example, the ESP8266 in his thermostat device has 64KB of
RAM and up to 4MB of flash.  The ESP8266 is the smallest and least expensive (around €5)
device with WiFi that
he has found; there are many even smaller devices, but they lack
the networking required for running a web server.  The other devices
he uses are the Raspberry Pi Pico W with 2MB of flash and 256KB of RAM and
the ESP32 with up to 8MB of flash and 512KB of RAM.  He contrasted those
with his laptop, which has 32GB of RAM, so "you need 500,000
ESP8266s" to have the same amount of memory.


Features


The core framework of Microdot is in a single microdot.py
file.  It is fully asynchronous, using the MicroPython
subset of the CPython
asyncio module, so it can run on both interpreters.  It uses
asyncio because that is the only way to do concurrency on the
microcontrollers; there is no support for processes or threads on those devices.



Microdot has Flask-style route
decorators to define URLs for the application.  It has Request
and Response
classes, as well as hooks
to run before and after requests, he said.  Handling query strings,
form data, and JSON are all available in Microdot via normal Python
dictionaries.  Importantly, it can handle streaming requests and responses;
because of the limited memory of these devices, it may be necessary to split
up the handling of larger requests or responses.



It supports setting
cookies and sending static
files.  Web applications can be constructed from a set of modules, using sub-applications,
which are similar to Flask
blueprints.  It also has its own web
server with TLS support.  "I'm very proud of all the stuff I was
able to fit in the core Microdot framework", Grinberg said.



He hoped that attendees would have to think for a minute to come up with
things that are missing from Microdot, but they definitely do exist.  There
are some officially
maintained extensions, each in its own single .py file, to
fill some of those holes.  They encompass functionality that is important,
but he did not want to add to the core because that would make it too large
to fit on the low-end ESP8266 that he is using.



There is an extension for multipart
forms, which includes file uploads; "this is extremely complicated
to parse, it didn't make sense to add it into the core because most people
don't do this".  There is support for WebSocket
and server-sent
events (SSE).  Templates
are supported using utemplate
for both Python implementations or Jinja, which only
works on CPython.  There are extensions for basic
and token-based authentication and for secure
user logins with session data; the latter required a replacement for
the CPython-only PyJWT, which Grinberg
wrote and contributed to MicroPython as jwt.py.
There is a small handful of other extensions that he quickly mentioned as well.



"I consider the documentation as part of the framework"; he is
"kind of fanatical" about documenting everything.  If there is
something missing or not explained well, "it's a bug that I need to
fix".  He writes books, so the documentation is organized similarly;
it comes in at 9,267 words, which equates to around 47 minutes of reading
time.  There is 100% test coverage, he said, and there are around 30
examples, with more coming.



A design principle that he follows is "no dark magic".  An example
of dark magic to him is the Flask
application context, "which very few people understand".  In
Microdot, the request object is explicitly passed to each route function.
Another example is the dependency
injection that is used by the FastAPI framework to add
components; Microdot uses explicit decorators instead.



He used the cloc
utility to count lines of code, while ignoring comments and blank
lines.  Using that, Django
comes in at 110,000 lines, Flask plus its essential Werkzeug library
is 15,500 lines, FastAPI with Starlette is 14,900 lines, Bottle is
around 3,000 lines, while the Microdot core has 765 lines ("believe it
or not") and a full
install with all the extensions on MicroPython comes in at just shy of 1,700
lines of code.



He ended with an example of how Microdot can be so small by comparing the
URL matching in Flask with Microdot.  The Flask version does lots more than
Microdot, with more supported types of arguments in a URL and multiple classes
in the werkzeug.routing
module; it has 1,362 lines of code.  For Microdot, there is a more
limited set of URL arguments, though there is still the ability to define
custom types, and a single
URLPattern class; all of that is done in 63 lines of
code. "I don't intend to support everything that Flask supports, in
terms of routing, but I intend to support the 20% that covers 80% of the
use cases."  That is the overall mechanism that he has used to get to
something that is so small.



An audience member asked about whether the Microdot code was minified in
order to get it to fit.  Grinberg said that doing so was not all that
useful for MicroPython, but the code is smaller on the board because it is
precompiled on another system; that results in a
microdot.mpy file, which is bytecode for MicroPython.  For
example, on the
low-end device he is using for his thermostats, Microdot would not be able
to be compiled on the device itself.  There are some other tricks that can
also be used for reducing the RAM requirements, like putting the code into
the firmware as part of the MicroPython binary.



The final question was about performance, and how many requests per second
could be handled. Grinberg said that he did not
have any real numbers, but that the device he demonstrated is "really
really slow".  That question led to a blog
post in late July where Grinberg tried to more fully answer it.
