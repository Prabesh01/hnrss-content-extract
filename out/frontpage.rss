            <description><![CDATA[Is SQLite durable by default? What settings guarantee durability? The documentation and even comments from its creator give conflicting answers.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[



One of the most important properties of a database is durability.  Durability means that after a transaction commits, you
can be confident that, absent catastrophic hardware failure, the changes made by the commit won't be lost.  This should
remain true even if the operating system crashes or the system loses power soon after the commit.  On Linux, and most other Unix operating systems, durability is ensured by calling the fsync system call at the right time.



Durability comes at a performance cost, and sometimes applications don't need durability.  Some applications can tolerate
losing the last several seconds of commits in the event of a power failure, as long as the database doesn't end up
corrupted.  Thus, databases typically provide knobs to configure if and when they call fsync.  This is fine, but it's essential
that the database clearly documents what its default durability properties are, and what each configuration setting guarantees.



Unfortunately, SQLite's documentation about its durability properties is far from clear.  I cannot tell whether SQLite is durable
by default, and if not, what are the minimal settings you need to use to ensure durability.


The two relevant configuration
options are journal_mode and synchronous.  journal_mode has several possible values, but most people use either DELETE or WAL.  synchronous has four possible values: EXTRA, FULL, NORMAL, and OFF.



This is how I interpret SQLite's documentation after a careful reading:


The default value of journal_mode is DELETE:The DELETE journaling mode is the normal behavior (source; archived)The default value of synchronous is FULL:If not overridden at compile-time, the default setting is 2 (FULL) (source; archived)The default value of synchronous is FULL even in WAL mode:If not overridden at compile-time, this value is the same as SQLITE_DEFAULT_SYNCHRONOUS. (source; archived)When journal_mode is DELETE, you need to set synchronous to EXTRA to get durability:EXTRA synchronous is like FULL with the addition that the directory containing a rollback journal is synced after that journal is unlinked to commit a transaction in DELETE mode. EXTRA provides additional durability if the commit is followed closely by a power loss. (source; archived)When journal_mode is WAL, FULL is sufficient for durability:With synchronous=FULL in WAL mode, an additional sync operation of the WAL file happens after each transaction commit. The extra WAL sync following each transaction helps ensure that transactions are durable across a power loss (source; archived)Note that this is not mentioned under the definition of FULL, but rather further down in the documentation for synchronous.


Based on the above, I conclude that:


By default, SQLite is not durable, because the default value of journal_mode is DELETE, and the default value of synchronous is FULL, which doesn't provide durability in DELETE mode.If you change journal_mode to WAL, then SQLite is durable, because synchronous=FULL provides durability in WAL mode.




However, a recent Hacker News comment by a user who credibly claims to be Richard Hipp, the creator of SQLite, says:


"In its default configuration, SQLite is durable.""If you switch to WAL mode, the default behavior is that transactions ... are not necessarily durable across OS crashes or power failures"


That's literally the opposite of what the documentation seems to say!



A Hacker News commenter who agrees with my reading of the documentation asked Hipp how his comment is consistent with the documentation, but received no reply.



Hipp also says that WAL mode used to be durable by default, but it was changed after people complained about poor performance.
This surprised me, since I had the impression that SQLite cared deeply about backwards compatibility, and weakening the
default durability setting is a nasty breaking change for any application which needs durability.



There are a couple other pitfalls around SQLite durability that you should be aware of, though I don't necessarily
blame the SQLite project for these:


Libraries that wrap SQLite can override the default value of synchronous.  For example, the most popular Go driver for SQLite sets it to NORMAL when in WAL mode, which does not provide durability.On macOS, fsync is nerfed to make macOS appear faster.  If you want a real fsync, you have to make a different, macOS-specific system call.  SQLite can do this, but it's off by default.


My takeaway is that if you need durability, you'd better set the synchronous option explicitly because who knows what the default is, or what it will be in the future.  With WAL mode, FULL seems to suffice.  As for DELETE mode, who knows if FULL is enough, so you'd better go with EXTRA to be safe. And if your application might be used on macOS, enable fullfsync.



The SQLite project ought to clarify their documentation.  Since the meaning of synchronous depends on the value of journal_mode, I think it would be quite helpful to document the values of synchronous separately for each possible journal_mode, rather than mixing it all together.  A table with synchronous values on one axis and journal_mode on the other which tells you if the combination provides durability would do wonders.



By the way, there are definitely many applications for which losing a few seconds of data in exchange for better performance is a great tradeoff, which is why SQLite and macOS have made the choices they have made.  But programmers need to know what guarantees their tools provide, which is why unclear documentation and breaking previously-held assumptions is not cool.

            <description><![CDATA[Manage all your inboxes effortlessly with a single app. Stay on top of your emails, no matter the provider or device.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[IntroductionWhen we set out to build Marco, we knew we were committing to two very difficult requirements: (1) IMAP-based, not API-based, and (2) cross-platform – web, Mac, Windows, Android, iOS.We had a handful of additional ancillary requirements. One of these was offline-first, and I can now say confidently that we drastically underestimated its complexity.I mentioned in a previous blog post that Missive was my daily driver in the recent past. It lacks offline support though, and this is one of the major downfalls of the product.At Marco we believe that full offline support is crucial. "Managing your emails on an airplane with no wifi" is an example use case we frequently come back to. You should be able to read, delete, respond, and organise your emails with no internet connection. When you land and connect to wifi, everything should seamlessly sync.That said, Marco is not a simple todo app. Marco is not an application that starts with zero data and grows in size gradually, as is the case with user-generated content like Notion, etc.Marco is an application that deals with hundreds of MB of data, and hundreds of thousands (or millions) of rows/entities.Essentially this means we are instantly jumping into the top 1% of heavy-duty use cases for offline-first implementations. Over time we realised that this actually rules out almost all available offline-first options.Starting Point: WatermelonDBI spent about a week deeply investigating the offline-first options available to us, in August 2024.We (perhaps naively) had committed to the idea that our offline-first architecture should be database-agnostic – the offline-first logic should "end" at the API layer. We did not want to manage sync tables or schemas in Postgres – we wanted to write API endpoints, and manage our database ourselves.Here's a rundown of the initial offline-first options we looked at:WatermelonDBFOSS, self-hostedDatabase agnosticBeen around for ages, used in many production applicationsPowerSyncNot quite FOSS, but has a free Self-Hosted EditionRequires Postgres-level integrationVery complex architecture, requires both changes to Postgres _and_ a separate HA MongoDB deployment clusterAppears to have been around quite awhile, but all their case studies are on demo/tiny/side projectsElectricSQLLooked interesting, but was in the middle of a complete rewriteRequires Postgres-level integrationNew version only handles data sync one way – it does not handle mutationsThere are many other options, including RxDB, MongoDB Atlas, Couchbase, and on and on. The three listed above are the options that we deeply investigated. As will become clear, we should have looked further at this stage.We settled on WatermelonDB and built the initial alpha version of Marco on it. The backend implementation is rather simple: there is a "pull" endpoint to GET data, and a "push" endpoint to POST mutations.It is important here to note that although Marco is a native application in some targets, it also must run in a web browser. While we may have access to a filesystem or "true" SQLite in native targets, our common denominator is web, where persistent storage options are very limited.On the (web) frontend, Watermelon uses IndexedDB (as do essentially all other options – even the WASM SQLite options are usually SQLite-on-top-of-IndexedDB). However, it turns out Watermelon faces a serious problem that all other relational frontend databases face – IndexedDB performance is terrible. To solve this, Watermelon uses a LokiJS adapter, which is literally just an in-memory database.Yes, you heard that right. To get around IndexedDB performance issues, Watermelon uses LokiJS to... hold the entire database in memory. When your database size is 100MB+, this starts to become a serious problem.Moreover, clients must pull data before they can push any new mutations, and mutations can easily be clobbered if the row has been updated on the backend before the frontend can push mutations.On top of this, WatermelonDB is not as actively-maintained as it once was. Many issues and PRs are left without a response. For example, chunked initial syncing is not supported out of the box. We opened a PR for this in early December, but it's still not been merged.We got quite far along with the Marco alpha build, and then had a bit of a panic in November. Our confidence in our WatermelonDB-based offline-first approach was decreasing steadily. We began to seriously question if this technology could actually support a rock-solid, modern user experience.We decided we needed to find something better.New Wave of Offline-FirstThis time around, we threw out any preconceptions we had about Postgres, separation of concerns at the API layer, etc. We had completely open minds and desperately wanted to find the "best" solution, no matter what that might look like. We were now extremely clear on the fact that we had a "tough" offline-first use case, and needed some serious help.We discovered a host of "new wave" offline first implementations. We talked with the founders/developers of these projects and found so many extremely intelligent and talented people working on what is a very tough problem.The leaders in this new wave are:TriplitInstantDBConvexWhile Triplit and InstantDB can be described as "full stack databases", Convex is instead an entire backend solution, including API endpoints, etc. For this reason we excluded Convex, as it seems like a huge leap and essentially 100% lock-in.Problems with TriplitOur first (of several) rewrites was from WatermelonDB to Triplit. Both Triplit and InstantDB use triples to represent data – entities are stored as "triples" of (<entity id>, <entity field>, <entity value>). Such a representation makes syncing a straightforward affair.Triplit's API and DX is best-in-class. However, although we desperately wanted to love the product, we found it unusable for our use case. The server-side implementation was eating gigabytes of RAM while sitting idle and would regularly OOM/crash. The client-side triples implementation would balloon 5MB of JSON into 1GB of SQLite.We believe Triplit is a fantastic choice for any offline-first applications with relatively small storage needs. On top of this, we found the Triplit team to be incredibly talented and hard-working, and truly believe that by mid-2025, it will be a robust and capable product.We absolutely love the developer experience with Triplit, and are rooting for the team to succeed!But we need something which is reliable, highly performant, and battle-tested, now.Problems with InstantDBWe next moved onto InstantDB, which can be considered a direct competitor to Triplit. Although both InstantDB and Triplit essentially solve the same problem, we found InstantDB to be a far worse implementation.TypeScript types were non-existent. There was no sort/ordering by fields. There was no support for $like operators, and certainly no full text search. I believe some of these features have since been added – both teams are certainly scrambling to handle a million features and requests.On the backend side of things, there are no webhooks, so it is impossible to respond to mutations in a scalable way. We would have had to build our own singleton subscriber microservice that then translated reactive queries into scalable webhooks. But reactive queries themselves are prone to dropped data, so we would need some sort of polling fallback... The backend story for InstantDB feels extremely incomplete.Even looking past all of this, frontend queries that returned in 2-5ms with Watermelon+LokiJS were taking 200-500ms to return data with InstantDB. This is primarily because InstantDB is not optimistic, and was hitting network to fetch data with almost every request. There is no granular control as to what gets cached on the client side and what does not.InstantDB is another promising product, and our understanding is that some teams are already building production applications on top of it. But it's simply too immature for our use case right now. There's essentially zero backend support, and the frontend UX felt like a massive downgrade coming from Watermelon.Problems with PowerSyncFinally, to our great disappointment, we begrudgingly moved on to PowerSync. We were wary of PowerSync from the beginning, and our reluctance proved to be well-founded.Although PowerSync is undoubtedly a mature product, and probably the most capable (on paper) of all options mentioned thus far, we hated every minute of working with it. The underlying tech might be the most production/enterprise friendly, but the DX is the worst by quite a margin.There is a paid SaaS offering, but their pricing model would have made our use case prohibitively expensive. Therefore we needed to self-host PowerSync, which is quite a complex and expensive task in itself. Not only does it require Postgres-level integration, it also needs a HA MongoDB cluster, a lot of arcane yaml configuration, etc. It also required us to completely denormalise our Postgres tables, as relations are not properly supported across the sync buckets.On the frontend side of things, PowerSync runs SQLite in WASM, and although the DX is fairly good, we found horrifying problems like off-by-one bugs in their Drizzle ORM integration, queries returning data from local db very slowly (100ms+), and long initialisation times (45s+ after login to Marco) with the UI view not updating until the sync fully completed.Why So Many Problems?There is a saying: if everyone is an asshole, maybe you're the asshole. Is the problem 5+ offline-first tools, or is it us?Like with most things, the reality is "a bit of both". As mentioned, Marco is an incredibly data-intensive application, and from day one, we were pushing these offline-first tools to their absolute limits.However, we also found the practical limits of these tools to be way lower than one would expect.What is the underlying cause? In my estimation, the root cause is that all of these offline-first tools for web are essentially hacks. Because of Marco's web deployment target, which becomes our common denominator, we must support offline-first in a web browser, and web browsers only really support KV storage via IndexedDB.All attempts to implement relational or graph databases within a web browser are essentially hacks. PowerSync itself is WASM SQLite... On top of IndexedDB. Binary SQLite chunks are literally stored in IndexedDB.There are essentially three different variables:The underlying (true) data store – this will always be IndexedDB for web implementationsHow the data is represented for sync purposesHow the data is presented to developersThe new wave of tools are attempting triples/graph implementations, but the story is the same. Browsers only give you a KV API, and anything on top of that will be built in userland and will suffer poor performance once you hit a certain scale. Although triples are easy to store and sync, when you try to jam a relational layer on top, the whole thing starts to fall apart.To be absolutely clear: these relational and graph implementations on top of IndexedDB do not start to show their cracks unless you have 10s/100s of MB of data, or hundreds of thousands of rows/entities. But at a certain scale, performance grinds to a halt and they become unusable. For lesser use cases, Triplit and InstantDB offer exceptional DX and velocity, with almost no drawbacks.At this point, we were starting to pull our hair out, and were wondering if we needed to build our own sync engine. Like many others, we're highly impressed with Linear, but are also aware that their sync engine was a monumental engineering effort.We're only a team of two, and we have a lot to work on besides offline-first itself.Finally, A SolutionSome time in early December, I came back across an option which I had glanced over before, but disregarded: Replicache.I think we were initially put off by their strange pricing model and the fact that it's closed-source.I am so glad we took another look.In terms of backend implementation, Replicache is somewhat similar to WatermelonDB, in that you need to implement push and pull endpoints in your backend, and it is otherwise entirely database-agnostic.The frontend is where the crucial difference lies – Replicache is just a KV store. It is a thin layer on top of IndexedDB that adds reactivity and some querying DX. That's it. You get raw get and set performance. Some performance benchmarks are outlined here. The perf is truly remarkable.The drawback to this KV approach is that searching/sorting/ordering entities would require scanning through entire collections. This is obviously a non-starter. In other words, if we wanted to use Replicache, we would need to handle indexing and search on our own.We'll post more detailed write-ups on our tech stack in the future, but a quick summary of where we landed on the frontend is: Replicache + Orama. This gives us sophisticated and battle-tested data sync with conflict resolution and rebasing, but also extremely flexible and powerful indexing, full-text search, and more.At the time of writing (January 2025), the Replicache team have just made it completely free and open source. This is because they've just released Zero, which looks extraordinarily compelling and will likely jump into the #1 spot for any offline-first product available.We're eager to try Zero once it's a bit more stable, but for now will build our product on the extremely capable and robust piece of software that is Replicache.Future of Offline-FirstWe embarked on a long and rambling journey through essentially all prior art and work in the offline-first world. It's a very hard problem to solve.The good news is that there are many new teams and projects actively and energetically working on this problem.Imagine a world where, as a fullstack developer, you can read and write data from an SDK in both your backend and your frontend, and they magically sync with each other. All your apps are instantly responsive. All your apps work offline out of the box.This is already possible today with Triplit or InstantDB, if your use case is reasonable. And things are only improving.I believe 2025 will be a year where HTTP/REST APIs will start to feel antiquated. Don't share endpoints – share databases.]]></content:encoded>

W. Jherek Swanger writes in his introduction to Camillo7 Agrippa's "A Treatise on the Science of Arms, with a philosophical Dialogue (1553)" that:

"Scienzia [...] was and is often held to relate only to the study of the eternal: that which exists in nature, or was created by God. Thus theology and astronomy/astrology are held to be sciences. Indeed, Ridolfo Capoferro held that strictly speaking fencing is not a science, but rather an art, because it was not divinely created."

16th Century Italy asks then if science is concerned only with divine (natural) knowledge1 and art is the realm of the secular and human-made, then was Leopold Kronecker right when he said2:

"God made the integers; all else is the work of man"

The integers look little like the natural world and very much like the simple and powerful abstractions that humans find elegant.
Much to the frustration of the human mind, that which created fig wasps, Leucochloridium paradoxum, quantum foam, and plasmids, does not create works of abstract simplicity.
If such a divinity left fingerprints in mathematics, that inhuman complexity and irrational strangeness6 can be found in the reals but not the integers.
One can imagine the God of the Book of Job creating the square root of two and pi.
I have an imperfect rule of thumb for determining if something is of human construction or for the purposes of this exploration, divine.
If the something under examination causes a sense of existential nausea, disorientation, and a deep feeling that is can't possibly work like that, it is divine3.
If on the other hand it feels universal, simple, and ideal, it is the product of human effort.
The Hierarchy of Weirdness
This distinction science=divine/nature, art=made by human is more complex than just two separate categories.
When humans create something, the created thing is contained, and is a function of, what already exists, so while art is the part of the universe that is created by humans, it also emerges from the part of the universe that isn't created by humans.

The human idea of the triangle choke (sankaku-jime) only works because humans have arms, legs and necks.
It wouldn't be meaningful to talk about it in a universe without chokeable necks, but necks existed before human ideas.
So the idea of a triangle exists both because of the specific context of humanity and also because humans created it.
More specifically, we can define a hierarchy of creation, or what a 16th Century Italian would call divine creation.
At the top of the hierarchy we have eternal nature. Eternal nature gives rise to nature, which in turn gives rise to humans, which gives rise to human ideas.
As shown below, the closer we get to eternal nature the greater the weirdness5 (from a human perspective).

The real numbers are much closer to eternal nature4, whereas the integers are much closer to human ideas.
This is why to human mind the integers feel more perfect, feel more divine.
A hammer feels like the perfect tool to hammer a nail not because a hammer is closer to eternal nature or more divine, but because it isn't divine.
Hammers feel like the perfect tool because they were invented by humans specifically to solve the human problem of hammering nails.
Kronecker, Cantor and God
Kronecker's quote about the integers being divine was not made so much because Kronecker wanted to elevate the reputation of the integers but because he wanted to damn infinity.
It was that reaction of horror at the creepy crawly bugs you see when you lift up the rock of Mathematics.
The main target of Kronecker's campaign against infinity was the mathematician Cantor8 and his work on transfinites.
Cantor viewed infinity in a much more positive light and he wasn't alone in this reaction.

"From the paradise that Cantor created for us no-one shall be able to expel us." - David Hilbert (1926)11

Cantor's ideas also sparked a theological debate since if the mind can reason about infinity, perhaps the mind can also reason about God9.
Cantor himself was deeply invested in the theological implications of his mathematical work.
He believed that God was beyond the mind12 and thus his mathematical work was not the result of his own effort but rather God was speaking through him.
This is an inversion of God of the gaps10 where the gaps filled in by the God of the filling and the lack of gaps is evidence of God rather than the reverse.
This echos Descartes'14 deeply unsatisfying Trademark Argument of the existence of God because finite beings like humans can perceive aspects of God like infinity, we must only be able to perceive16 them because God exists.

"The idea of infinite substance, or God, must have “proceeded from some substance which really was infinite. [..] If a finite thing could produce the idea of an infinite thing, the Meditator reasons, this would violate the principle that there is more reality in a cause than in its effect, since the Idea of God is at the top of the Hierarchy of Ideas." - René Descartes, Meditations on First Philosophy, in which the existence of God and the immortality of the soul are demonstrated (1641)15

I much prefer the notion put forward by Chesterton that it is gaps themselves which are important.

"The whole secret of mysticism is this: that man can understand everything by the help of what he does not understand. The morbid logician seeks to make everything lucid, and succeeds in making everything mysterious. The mystic allows one thing to be mysterious, and everything else becomes lucid" - Orthodoxy by G. K. Chesterton (1908)13

A Final Note
Versions of this essay sat on my hard drive for the last few years and in private correspondence.
I couldn't find a conclusion to draw these threads together so I'm leaving it as a vibes-based meandering through these ideas.
This post originally came about because of a conversation with Madars Virza about my rejection of the Kronecker quote.  I bounced it off of a number of other people including Andrew Poelstra, Russell O’Connor, Karina Poelstra, Peter Berard over the years. The observations of the real number line are taken from conversations with my dad, Ward Heilman. Hopefully I got it mostly correct, any errors are my own.

We can ignore the question of the existence of God since by "divine" here we mean that which does not depend on us. Or in more modern atheistic terms, we are talking about nature and what if anything is prior to nature. ↩


We don't have Leopold Kronecker actual words. Heinrich Weber wrote in a 1893 issue of the journal Mathematische Annalen 43(1) that Kronecker at a 1886 lecture made the statement: "Die ganzen Zahlen hat der liebe Gott gemacht, alles andere ist Menschenwerk" (translated: "God made the integers; all else is the work of man"). 
The full context in German is: "Eine wesentliche Liicke wiirde aber in dem Bilde des Mathematikers Kronecker bleiben, wenn ich seine Stellung zu den fundamentalen, philosophischen Fragen der Mathematik mit Stillschweigen iibergehen wollte. Es ist ein Standpunkt, der besonders in seinen spiteren Jahren hervortrat, vielleicht mehr noch im persénlichen Verkehr als in der Oeffentlichkeit; aber auch 6ffentlich hat er seine Anschauungen nicht verleugnet und z. B. in der Festschrift zu Zeller’s Jubiléum scharf hervorgekehrt. 
In Bezug auf Strenge der Begriffe stellt er die héchsten An-forderungen und sucht alles, was Biirgerrecht in der Mathematik haben soll, in die krystallklare eckige Form der Zahlentheorie zu zwingen. 
Manche von Ihnen werden sich des Ausspruchs erinnern, den er in einem Vortrag bei der Berliner Naturforscher- Versammlung im Jahre 1886 that: ,,Die ganzen Zahlen hat der liebe Gott gemacht, alles andere ist Menschenwerk“.
So war ihm alles, was sich nicht eines arithmetischen Ursprungs unmittelbar bewusst war, unsympathisch, und sein Streben ging dahin, nicht nur in der Algebra, sondern auch in der Functionentheorie die arithmetische Abstammung deutlich hervortreten zu lassen."
Translated via google into english: "However, a significant gap would remain in the picture of Kronecker as a mathematician if I were to ignore his position on the fundamental, philosophical questions of mathematics. It is a standpoint that became particularly prominent in his later years, perhaps more so in personal interaction than in public; but even publicly, he did not deny his views and, for example, sharply emphasized them in the Festschrift for Zeller's anniversary.
Regarding conceptual rigor, he sets the highest standards and seeks to force everything that should have a civil right in mathematics into the crystal-clear, angular form of number theory.
Some of you will recall the statement he made in a lecture at the Berlin Natural Scientists' Meeting in 1886: "The good Lord created the integers; everything else is the work of man."
Thus, he disliked anything that was not directly conscious of an arithmetic origin, and his aim was to make the arithmetic origin clearly evident not only in algebra but also in function theory." ↩


I leave to the reader to decide if this is an argument in favor or opposed to intelligent design. ↩


One could argue that integers exist in the same way that the reals do and therefore at both eternal nature. This seems impossible to dispute because the reals contain the integers, so if the reals are eternal nature, integers contained in the reals must be as well. My argument is that the human invention of the integers, is not the integers themselves but the idea of the integers as a thing that exists separate from the reals. Mathematical Platonism does not prevent human invention in Mathematics. Anyone who wants to argue this point should present an argument for the concept of "a bakers dozen" is not of human invention. ↩


I use the word weirdness above rather than complexity because what matters is the strangeness of eternal nature to human thought, it need not be more complex and could in fact have simpler cause than many things we consider normal like pants or a traffic jam. We see this with evolution, more complex life emerged from more simple life. ↩


Humans can't even agree on a single definition. You have the reals with or without the continuum hypothesis, you can have the reals with or without the Axiom of Choice. What even are the reals? ↩


This is the same Agrippa mentioned in the Princess Bride.  ↩

"[Gutberlet] had responded by seizing upon Cantor's Mathematical work to argue that it provided clear evidence that the human mind could contemplate the actual infinite. Moreover, it if did so, it would get closer to the true nature of the divine. The collection of divine thoughts in the mind of an unchanging, he argument must comprise a complete and infinite set. This was for him evidence that Cantor's infinites actually existed, and to deny it would require you to give up the infinite and absolute mind of God." -  The Infinite Book: A Short Guide to the Boundless, Timeless and Endless - The Madness of Georg Cantor (2006) by John D. Barrow ↩


I always find the argument about the God of the gaps self-defeating because the more knowledge about reality we gain the greater the number and size of gaps. That gaps aren't shrinking and once you add Godel to the picture, they seemt to grow quite a bit. ↩


"Fruchtbaren Begriffsbildungen und Schlußweisen wollen wir, wo immer nur die geringste Aussicht sich bietet, sorgfältig nachspüren und sie pflegen, stützen und gebrauchsfähig machen. Aus dem Paradies, das Cantor uns geschaffen, soll uns niemand vertreiben können." - Hilbert, David (1926), "Über das Unendliche", Mathematische Annalen, 95 (1): 161–190  ↩


"The Transfinite with its abundance of formations and forms, points with necessity to an Absolute, to the “truly Infinite”, to whose Magnitude nothing can be added or subtracted and which therefore is to be seen quantitatively as absolute Maximum. The latter exceeds, so to speak, the human power of comprehension and eludes particularly mathematical determination; whereas the Transfinite not only fills the vast field of the possible in God’s knowledge, but also offers a rich, constantly increasing field of ideal inquiry and attains reality and existence, I am convinced, also in the world of the created, up to a certain degree and in different relations, to bring the Magnificence of the Creator, following His absolute free decree, to greater expression than could have occurred through a merely "finite world"."  - from a letter written by Georg Cantor to A. Eulenberg (Feb. 28, 1886) from Gesammelte Abhandlungen mathematischen und philosophischen Inhalts, Georg Cantor, ed by Ernst Zermelo, Springer-Verlag, 2013, translation by Gabriele Chaitkin in On the Theory of the Transfinite. ↩


This quote always reminded me of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem ↩


Both Agrippa and Descartes were Swordman and Mathematicians with a passion for Geometry. Unlike Agrippa, Descartes did not leaving any writing on the art of combat with a sword. If he had maybe he would have namechecked in the Princess Bride. 
A paper by Kevin Delapp Philosophical Duelism: Fencing in Early Modern Thought (2018) in the Journal of Early Modern Studies looks at influence of fencing on the development of early modern philosophers including Descartes. It is behind a paywall so I have not read it. ↩

Consider what it would actually look like for humanity to have knowledge which humanity could not create. For instance imagine a human mind was told the solution to a mathematical problem that can easily be verified but would require more energy than our universe to compute. This would be strong evidence that this mathematical revelation was placed in our minds by an intelligence with greater computing power than our universe, i.e. a cryptographic proof for the existance of something godlike. I am aware of no such knowledge and such a relevation is very different than the knowledge of infinity. ↩

            <description><![CDATA[Can AI truly collaborate with human coders? Researchers highlight the hurdles and potential solutions in AI-driven software engineering.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the coding sphere, with AI coding tools completing source code, correcting syntax errors, creating inline documentation, and understanding and answering questions about a codebase. As the technology advances beyond automating programming tasks, the idea of full autonomy looms large. Is AI ready to be a real coder?A new paper says not yet—and maps out exactly why. Researchers from Cornell University, MIT CSAIL, Stanford University, and UC Berkeley highlight key challenges that today’s AI models face and outline promising research directions to tackle them. They presented their work at the 2025 International Conference on Machine Learning.The study offers a clear-eyed reality check amid all the hype. “At some level, the technology is powerful and useful already, and it has gotten to the point where programming without these tools just feels primitive,” says Armando Solar-Lezama, a co-author of the paper and an associate director at MIT CSAIL, where he leads the computer-aided programming group. He argues, however, that AI-powered software development has yet to reach “the point where you can really collaborate with these tools the way you can with a human programmer.”Challenges With AI Coding ToolsAccording to the study, AI still struggles with several crucial facets of coding: sweeping scopes involving huge codebases, the extended context lengths of millions of lines of code, higher levels of logical complexity, and long-horizon or long-term planning about the structure and design of code to maintain code quality.Koushik Sen, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley and also a co-author of the paper, cites fixing a memory safety bug as an example. (Such bugs can cause crashes, corrupt data, and open security vulnerabilities.) Software engineers might approach debugging by first determining where the error originates, “which might be far away from where it’s crashing, especially in a large codebase,” Sen explains. They’ll also have to understand the semantics of the code and how it works, and make changes based on that understanding. “You might have to not only fix that bug but change the entire memory management,” he adds.These kinds of complex tasks can be difficult for AI development tools to navigate, resulting in hallucinations about where the bug is or its root cause, as well as irrelevant suggestions or code fixes with subtle problems. “There are many failure points, and I don’t think the current LLMs [large language models] are good at handling that,” says Sen.Among the various paths suggested by the researchers toward solving these AI coding challenges—such as training code LLMs to better collaborate with humans and ensuring human oversight for machine-generated code—the human element endures.“A big part of software development is building a shared vocabulary and a shared understanding of what the problem is and how we want to describe these features. It’s about coming up with the right metaphor for the architecture of our system,” Solar-Lezama says. “It’s something that can be difficult to replicate by a machine. Our interfaces with these tools are still quite narrow compared to all the things that we can do when interacting with real colleagues.”Enhancing AI-Human Collaboration in CodingCreating better interfaces, which today are driven by prompt engineering, is integral for developer productivity in the long run. “If it takes longer to explain to the system all the things you want to do and all the details of what you want to do, then all you have is just programming by another name,” says Solar-Lezama.Shreya Kumar, a software engineer and an associate teaching professor in computer science at the University of Notre Dame who was not involved in the research, echoes the sentiment. “The reason we have a programming language is because we need to be unambiguous. But right now, we’re trying to adjust the prompt [in a way] that the tool will be able to understand,” she says. “We’re adapting to the tool, so instead of the tool serving us, we’re serving the tool. And it is sometimes more work than just writing the code.”As the study notes, one way to address the dilemma of human-AI interaction is for AI systems to learn to quantify uncertainty and communicate proactively, asking for clarification or more information when faced with vague instructions or unclear scenarios. Sen adds that AI models might also be “missing context that I have in my mind as a developer—hidden concepts that are embedded in the code but hard to decipher from it. And if I give any hint to the LLM about what is happening, it might actually make better progress.”For Abhik Roychoudhury, a professor of computer science at the National University of Singapore who was also not involved in the research, a crucial aspect missing from the paper and from most AI-backed software development tools entails capturing user intent.“A software engineer is doing a lot of thinking in understanding the intent of the code. This intent inference—what the program is trying to do, what the program is supposed to do, and the deviation between the two—is what helps in a lot of software engineering tasks. If this outlook can be brought in future AI offerings for software engineering, then it will get closer to what the software engineer does.”Where Does AI Coding Go From Here? Roychoudhury also assumes that many of the challenges identified in the paper are either being worked on now or “would be solved relatively quickly” due to the rapid pace of progress in AI for software engineering. Additionally, he believes that an agentic AI approach can help, viewing significant promise in AI agents for processing requirements specifications and ensuring they can be enforced at the code level.“I feel the automation of software engineering via agents is probably irreversible. I would dare say that it is going to happen,” Roychoudhury says.Sen is of the same view but looks beyond agentic AI initiatives. He pinpoints ideas such as evolutionary algorithms to enhance AI coding skills and projects like AlphaEvolve that employ genetic algorithms “to shuffle the solutions, pick the best ones, and then continue improving those solutions. We need to adopt a similar technology for coding agents, where the code is continuously improving in the background.”However, Roychoudhury cautions that the bigger question lies in “whether you can trust the agent, and this issue of trust will be further exacerbated as more and more of the coding gets automated.”That’s why human supervision remains vital. “There should be a check and verify process. If you want a trustworthy system, you do need to have humans in the loop,” says Notre Dame’s Kumar.Solar-Lezama agrees. “I think it’s always going to be the case that we’re ultimately going to want to build software for people, and that means we have to figure out what it is we want to write,” he says. “In some ways, achieving full automation really means that we get to now work at a different level of abstraction.”So while AI may become a “real coder” in the near future, Roychoudhury acknowledges that it probably won’t gain software developers’ complete trust as a team member, and thus might not be allowed to do its tasks fully autonomously. “That team dynamics—when an AI agent can become a member of the team, what kind of tasks will it be doing, and how the rest of the team will be interacting with the agent—is essentially where the human-AI boundary lies,” he says.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[DeepSeek is a popular open-source large language model (LLM) praised for its strong performance. However, its large size and unique architecture, which uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture of Experts (MoE), require an advanced system for efficient serving at scale. In this blog, we explain how we match DeepSeek's inference system performance with SGLang.

Our implementation, shown in the figure above, runs on 12 nodes in the Atlas Cloud, each equipped with 8 H100 GPUs.
It uses prefill-decode disaggregation and large-scale expert parallelism (EP), achieving a speed of 52.3k input tokens per second and 22.3k output tokens per second per node for 2000-token input sequences.
To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first open-source implementation to nearly match the throughput reported in the official DeepSeek blog at large scale.
By deploying this implementation locally, it translates to a cost of $0.20/1M output tokens, which is about one-fifth the cost of the official DeepSeek Chat API.
Compared to vanilla tensor parallelism using the same resources, this optimized strategy improves the output throuhgput by up to 5x.
This blog dives into our parallelism design, optimization methods, and results. All components of our work are fully open-source, allowing others to explore and build on our efforts. The instructions for reproducing our experiments are fully available here.

Parallelism Design
Efficient parallelism is essential to manage the computational complexity and memory demands of DeepSeek's architecture. This section outlines our approach to optimizing key components: attention layers, dense feed-forward networks (FFNs), sparse FFNs, and the language model (LM) head. Each component leverages tailored parallelism strategies to enhance scalability, memory efficiency, and performance.
Attention Layers
DeepSeek employs Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) to effectively model complex dependencies within input sequences. To optimize this mechanism, we implement DP Attention, a data parallelism strategy that eliminates KV cache duplication across devices, significantly reducing memory overhead. Introduced in SGLang v0.4, this approach has been extended to support hybrid data and tensor parallelism, offering flexibility for processing small batch sizes efficiently.
Dense FFNs
Despite using only three dense FFN layers, DeepSeek-V3's computation can significantly increase peak memory usage, potentially leading to system crashes if not carefully managed. To address this, we adopt Data Parallelism (DP) over tensor parallelism (TP), leveraging the following advantages:

Enhanced Scalability: With an intermediate dimension of 18,432, high TP degrees (e.g., TP32) result in inefficient fragmentation into small-unit segments (e.g., 576 units), which are not divisible by 128—a common alignment boundary for modern GPUs such as H100. This misalignment hampers computational efficiency and memory utilization. DP provides a more scalable solution by avoiding fragmentation, ensuring balanced workload distribution across devices.
Optimized Memory Efficiency: Traditionally, TP reduces memory usage as worker size increases, but this advantage diminishes under DP attention. In a pure TP setup, memory demand for a single-layer Transformer model scales with DP size as: $$\text{Memory}=\frac{N_{\text{param}}}{\text{TP}}+(1+k)N_{\text{hidden_state}}\cdot \text{DP}\notag$$ Here, $N_{\text{hidden_state}}=n_\text{token}\times n_\text{hidden_size}$ is the size of the hidden state on each device (DP rank), $N_{\text{param}}=n_\text{intermediate_size}\times n_\text{hidden_size}$ is the number of model parameters, and $k$ is a coefficient representing extra memory overhead from CUDA Graph duplication. By assuming $\text{DP}=\text{TP}$, this memory usage function is minimized when $\text{TP}=\sqrt{\frac{N_{\text{param}}}{(1+k)N_{\text{hidden_state}}}}$. DeepSeek-V3 uses an intermediate size of 18,432. During the prefill phase, CUDA Graph is typically disabled, so $k = 0$. However, the token size per device can easily exceed 2,048, resulting in an optimal TP size of 3 or less. In the decode phase, a practical configuration might use 128 tokens per device and set $k = 3$. In this case, the memory-optimal TP size is 6. In both phases, a lower TP degree minimizes memory usage per device. As a result, DP may offer a more memory-efficient approach for scaling compared to relying solely on TP.
Minimized Communication Overhead: In pure TP, each FFN necessitates two all-reduce operations, resulting in substantial communication overhead. By leveraging DP, we optimize this process to a single reduce-scatter following the prior attention layer and an all-gather before the next, reducing communication costs by 50%. Furthermore, when attention is also computed under pure DP, inter-device communication is entirely eliminated, significantly enhancing overall efficiency.

The integration of DP dense FFN with DP attention is illustrated in the left figure below. Users can enable this feature by setting --moe-dense-tp-size=1.

Sparse FFNs
In DeepSeek-V3's Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, sparse FFNs require substantial expert weights, creating a significant memory bottleneck. To address this, we implement Expert Parallelism (EP), which distributes expert weights across multiple devices. This approach effectively scales memory capacity while maintaining high performance, though it does introduce challenges like irregular all-to-all communication and workload imbalance.
The figure in the right figure above illustrates our EP implementation using the DeepEP framework, with further details on our EP design and optimizations provided in the following sections.
LM Head
The LM head computes output probabilities over a large vocabulary, a resource-intensive operation traditionally handled with vocabulary parallelism to aggregate token logits from TP groups. To enhance scalability and efficiency, we adopt Data Parallelism (DP), mirroring our dense FFN strategy. This reduces memory overhead and simplifies communication across devices, delivering a more streamlined solution.
Prefill and Decode Disaggregation
LLM inference comprises two distinct phases: Prefill and Decode. The Prefill phase is computation-intensive, processing the entire input sequence, while the Decode phase is memory-intensive, managing the Key-Value (KV) cache for token generation. Traditionally, these phases are handled within a unified engine, where combined scheduling of prefill and decode batches introduces inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we introduce Prefill and Decode (PD) Disaggregation in SGLang.
Issues with Unified Scheduling
The conventional unified engine, which processes prefill and decode batches together, results in three significant problems:

Prefill Interruption: Incoming prefill batches frequently interrupt ongoing decode batches, causing substantial delays in token generation.
DP Attention Imbalance: In DP attention, one DP worker may process a prefill batch while another handles a decode batch simultaneously, leading to increased decode latency.
Incompatible with DeepEP: As we will discuss in a later section, DeepEP executes different dispatch modes for prefill and decode, making unified scheduling imcompatible with DeepEP.

PD Disaggregation resolves these by separating the two stages, enabling tailored optimizations for each.
Implementation Details
The PD Disaggregation design in SGLang, depicted in the diagram below, interleaves execution between a Prefill Server and a Decode Server:

Upon receiving an input request, the workflow proceeds as follows:

A Prefill Server and a Decode Server pair via a handshake, establishing a local sender and receiver, respectively.
The Decode Server pre-allocates the KV cache, signaling the Prefill Server to begin the model forward pass and compute the KV caches.
Once computed, the data transfers to the Decode Server, which handles iterative token generation.

This separation ensures each phase operates under optimal conditions, maximizing GPU resource utilization. To further enhance performance, our implementation incorporates:

Non-blocking Transfer: Data send and receive operations run in a background thread, keeping the scheduler’s event loop uninterrupted.
RDMA-Based Transfer: Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) leverages queue pairs for connections and scatter-gather elements (SGE) for efficient transfer of non-contiguous memory chunks.
Flexible API Integration: SGLang offers adaptable APIs that integrate high-performance RDMA libraries like Mooncake and NIXL, streamlining data transfers.

More details can be found in our design document.
Large-scale Expert Parallelism
Expert Parallelism with DeepEP
DeepEP, implemented by the DeepSeek team, is a communication library designed to streamline EP in MoE models. It tackles the challenge of efficiently routing tokens to specific experts across multiple GPUs. By providing optimized communication kernels, DeepEP reduces latency and boosts throughput, making it ideal for large-scale inference tasks.
DeepEP provides two specialized dispatch modes to address varying workload demands:

Normal Dispatch: Optimized for handling long input sequences, such as during the prefill phase, this mode prioritizes maximum computational throughput. However, it generates symbolic shapes that are incompatible with CUDA Graph, rendering it less effective for the decode phase, where kernel launch overhead becomes a significant bottleneck.
Low-Latency Dispatch: Tailored for generating output tokens during the decode phase, this mode prioritizes minimal delay to ensure real-time performance. It supports CUDA Graph but requires preallocating a fixed memory size. If the memory demand exceeds this preallocation, a runtime error occurs.

In SGLang, the integration of DeepEP provides auto mode that dynamically selects between these two dispatch modes based on the workload. However, without PD disaggregation, the auto mode faces a limitation: it cannot simultaneously support both normal dispatch (for prefill) and low-latency dispatch (for decode) within the same communication group. This restriction hinders its compatibility with DP attention, which is crucial for memory-efficient inference. The compatibility of each mode is outlined in the table below:



Mode

Long Output
DP Attention
CUDA Graph




Normal
✅
❌
✅
❌


Low-Latency

✅
✅

Auto

PD disaggregation addresses this by separating prefill and decode phases, allowing normal dispatch for the prefill phase and low-latency dispatch for the decode phase, both under DP attention. This integration optimizes resource utilization and enhances overall performance by aligning the dispatch mode with the specific needs of each phase.
DeepGEMM Integration
DeepGEMM is another high-efficient library developed by the DeepSeek team, specifically designed to optimize computations in MoE models. It provides two specialized functions for handling MoE-related matrix multiplications (Grouped GEMMs), each tailored to different phases of the inference process.

Grouped GEMMs (contiguous layout): This kernel is designed for dynamic input shapes, making it ideal for the prefill phase of MoE inference. It processes inputs where the data for different experts is concatenated contiguously, allowing for flexible handling of varying input sizes.
Grouped GEMMs (masked layout): This kernel assumes a fixed input shape and uses a mask tensor to compute only the valid portions of the input. It is compatible with CUDA Graph, which optimizes kernel launches, making it well-suited for the decode phase where reducing overhead is critical.

DeepGEMM integrates smoothly with the dispatch modes of DeepEP:

For the contiguous layout kernel, which is used with normal dispatch in the prefill phase, an additional step is required. Since normal dispatch outputs a symbolic shape, a permutation is needed to transform the output into the contiguous format expected by the kernel. We referred to the LightLLM project and implemented a custom Triton kernel for efficient permutation. This kernel ensures that the output from normal dispatch is correctly rearranged, enabling smooth integration with the contiguous GEMM kernel.
The masked layout kernel pairs seamlessly with DeepEP’s low-latency dispatch, as both are optimized for the decode phase and support CUDA Graph.

SGLang also integrates DeepGEMM for MoE computation under tensor parallelism. Additionally, DeepGEMM provides a highly efficient general GeMM kernel, which can be activated in SGLang by setting the environment variable SGL_ENABLE_JIT_DEEPGEMM to 1, offering even greater computational efficiency for non-MoE operations.
Two-batch Overlap
In multi-node environments, limited communication bandwidth can significantly increase overall latency. To tackle this challenge, we implemented Two-batch Overlap (TBO) following DeepSeek's system design. TBO splits a single batch into two micro-batches, allowing computation and communication to overlap, which also lowers peak memory usage by halving the effective batch size. However, putting TBO into practice introduces specific implementation difficulties.
Implementation Challenges
Although DeepSeek released the design framework of TBO, there are two slight implementation challenges.

Code Complexity: Directly coding TBO can lead to duplicated logic for managing multiple micro-batches. This increases the complexity of the codebase, making it harder to maintain and prone to errors, especially as the number of micro-batches or overlapping scenarios grows.
Synchronization Issues in the Prefill Phase: Achieving effective overlap between computation and communication needs consideration when the normal dispatch in DeepEP block the CPU. This blocking behavior can stall the pipeline, leaving the GPU idle and undermining the performance benefits of TBO.

Abstraction for Clean Implementation
To create a more maintainable and reusable codebase, we use an abstraction layer consisting of operations and yield points. This method simplifies development by allowing us to write code as if handling a single micro-batch, while strategically pausing execution by inserting yield points to let other micro-batches proceed. It eliminates code duplication, reduces the potential need for variable postfixes, and efficiently manages cases where some executions complete at a layer's end while others have not. Additionally, it supports easy adaptation to different overlapping region choices or future enhancements, like a three-batch overlap, with minimal code changes. Below is a concise demonstration of this approach:
operations = [
    self._forward_attn,
    YieldOperation(),  # Pause execution for other micro-batches
    self._forward_dispatch,
    self._forward_mlp,
    YieldOperation(),  # Another pause point
    self._forward_combine,
]

# Process a single micro-batch without duplicating code
def _forward_attn(self, state):
    state.hidden_states = self.self_attn(state.hidden_states, ...)

Prefill Overlapping Implementation
We refine the launch order during the prefill phase to avoid CPU-blocking via the dispatch operation in DeepEP, even though we are using its asynchronous mode. Specifically:

The dispatch operation blocks the CPU until the GPU receives metadata from other ranks to allocate correctly sized tensors.
An improper implementation would leave the computation stream idle during this period, as no computation tasks are submitted to the GPU.

To optimize, we prioritize submitting computation tasks to the GPU before launching CPU-blocking communication. This ensures the GPU remains active during communication. As illustrated in the figure below, TBO with a proper launch order, indicated by bolded borders, avoids bubble caused by a CPU-blocking operation (i.e., normal dispatch).

Expert Parallelism Load Balancer
In MoE models, EP often leads to uneven workload distribution across GPUs. This imbalance forces the system to wait for the slowest GPU computation or communication, wasting compute cycles and increasing memory usage due to expert activations. As the number of GPUs (EP size) increases, the imbalance issue gets more severe.
To address this, DeepSeek developed the Expert Parallelism Load Balancer (EPLB). EPLB takes expert distribution statistics as input and computes an optimal arrangement of experts to minimize imbalance. Users can allocate redundant experts (e.g., 32 additional experts), which, when combined with the original 256, create a pool of 288 experts. This pool allows EPLB to strategically place or replicate experts—for instance, duplicating the most frequently used expert multiple times or grouping a moderately used expert with rarely used ones on a single GPU.
Beyond balancing workloads, EPLB offers greater flexibility in parallelism design. With the original 256 experts, parallelism sizes are restricted to powers of two. EPLB’s use of 288 experts enables more diverse configurations, such as parallelism sizes of 12 or 72.
In the figure below, we demonstrate the effects of scale and EPLB algorithm to the imbalance issue via simulation. We compute GPU balancedness as the ratio between mean computation time and maximum computation time for a MoE layer among GPUs, and we use the number of tokens for a GPU to estimate the computation time for it. As can be seen, utilization rate decreases when the system scales with the number of nodes, and enabling EPLB significantly improves the utilization.

EPLB for Real-World Serving
For EPLB to be effective, the input distribution must closely match the actual serving workload. Two strategies enhance this alignment:

Increasing Batch Size: Larger batches reduce random fluctuations in expert usage, which improves balance, which can be achieved by scaling the cluster or using techniques like Multi-Token Prediction (MTP).
Periodic Rebalancing: Regularly updating the expert arrangement leverages temporal locality but requires efficient reloading of experts. This necessitates minimizing the cost of expert reloading operations.

Even with EPLB, some imbalance is inevitable, making further optimization a valuable future direction.
Implementation of Rebalancing
SGLang implements expert rebalancing in three stages to ensure efficiency and minimal disruption:

System Loading Stage: Weights are optionally preloaded from disk to main memory for faster rebalancing or kept on disk with memory mapping (mmap) for reduced memory usage.
Rebalance Preparation Stage: Required weights are asynchronously transferred to device memory in the background, utilizing free DMA hardware engines without interrupting ongoing GPU operations.
Rebalance Execution Stage: A device-to-device copy updates the weights. This step can be further optimized through physical memory rebinding techniques.

This staged approach ensures that rebalancing is both efficient and non-disruptive, maintaining system performance during updates.
Evaluation
End-to-end Performance
Experimental Setup
We evaluated the end-to-end performance of different configurations of SGLang using DeepSeek-V3 on a cluster of 12 nodes, connected via InfiniBand and each equipped with 8 H100 GPUs. This evaluation highlights the throughput improvements enabled by our advanced optimization techniques. We compared the following four settings:

SGLang with TP16 x 6: Every two nodes are paired with an independent group, running DeepSeek-V3 inference with a TP size of 16 and DP attention.
SGLang with PD Disaggregation: This version incorporates PD disaggregation and full EP optimization. For the EPLB, we adopt a distribution matching the input/output data, as real-time serving statistics are unavailable.
SGLang with PD Disaggregation and simulated MTP: To simulate MTP’s effects, we firstly double the batch size and halve the Key-Value KV cache length to maintain the same workload for GroupedGeMM computation and memory access. Moreover, we insert dummy kernels after the real attention computation to ensure the attention phase takes the same time as in DeepSeek’s profile, accurately reflecting the slowdown caused by MTP’s attention mechanism. We conservatively assume a 70% acceptance rate under MTP.
DeepSeek Profile Results: Throughput estimates are derived from DeepSeek’s official profiling data.

Performance Analysis of Prefill and Decode Phases
To accommodate varying workload demands, we independently evaluated the prefill (P) and decode (D) phases, assuming unlimited resources for the non-tested phase to isolate and maximize the load on the tested nodes—mirroring the setup used by DeepSeek. The results are summarized below:

Prefill Phase: On 4 nodes (4×8×H100, EP32), the system achieved per-node throughputs of 57,674, 54,543, and 50,302 tokens per second for prompt lengths of 1K, 2K, and 4K, respectively. As shown in the bar chart below, this represents up to a 3.3× improvement over the TP16 baseline, largely attributable to the optimized GroupedGeMM kernel (DeepGEMM) and two-batch overlap. Assuming a perfectly balanced workload, our system’s throughput is within 5.6% of DeepSeek's official profile.
Decode Phase: Evaluated on 9 nodes (9×8×H100, EP72; half the scale of DeepSeek), the system achieved 22,282 tokens/sec per node for 2K inputs—representing a 5.2× speedup over the TP16 baseline. Under simulated MTP conditions—with attention kernels intentionally slowed to reflect real-world latency—the system sustained a high throughput of 17,373 tokens/sec per node for 4K inputs, just 6.6% below DeepSeek’s official profile. As shown in the figure on the right, these performance gains are largely attributed to 4× larger batch sizes enabled by EP, which enhances scalability by significantly reducing per-GPU memory consumption of model weights.


Profile Results
This section compares SGLang’s performance with DeepSeek’s inference system, aligning our experimental setup as closely as possible to DeepSeek’s production environment. We analyze overall throughput and detailed kernel breakdowns, benchmarking against DeepSeek’s blog and public profile data.
Overall Throughput
For prefill, we tested a scenario with 16,384 tokens per device and an input length of 4,096. Due to uncertainty in DeepSeek’s expert distribution, we evaluated two cases: one with default expert distribution and another with simulated perfect EPLB (random expert selection following group-limited routing semantics) as a performance upper bound.
The results are presented below:

Using half the nodes of DeepSeek, SGLang with simulated MTP is only slightly slower than DeepSeek’s profile. In a higher batch size setting (256 sequences, 2,000 input length), SGLang achieves 22,282 tokens per second per node, demonstrating strong scalability.
Detail Breakdown
The figure below breaks down kernel execution times for prefill, including unit test results as a theoretical upper bound:


Default EPLB: Communication kernels exhibit longer execution times and higher variance compared to DeepSeek’s profile, likely due to greater expert imbalance. This leads to extended computation stream bubbles, slowing down overall performance.
Simulated Perfect EPLB: This setup aligns more closely with DeepSeek’s profile, though discrepancies remain, indicating potential areas for optimization.
Comparison with Unit Tests: Both DeepSeek and SGLang have a communication time slower than unit test results, while the latter is achievable when disabling TBO, revealing a potential optimization direction if communication is the bottleneck.

SGLang’s decode kernel breakdown aligns closely with DeepSeek’s, as shown below:

Key observations include:

Combine Time Discrepancy: SGLang’s combine operation appears 2x slower than DeepSeek’s due to shorter attention computation, causing communication kernels to busy-wait. In the simulated slow attention experiment, combine time matches DeepSeek’s, confirming this hypothesis.
MoE Performance: SGLang’s MoE kernels are 25% slower, possibly because DeepSeek’s 18 nodes (versus our 9) distribute experts more efficiently, reducing memory access overhead for GEMM operations.
Dispatch Optimization Potential: Both DeepSeek and SGLang show dispatch times of ~0.17ms per layer, but unit tests with DeepEP reveal a potential of 0.06ms occupying SMs. Currently, dispatch spends significant time busy-waiting for data. Inserting slow dummy kernels between send/receive operations reduces dispatch time to 0.09ms, and in-flight duration analysis using unit test data suggests further improvements are possible.

While minor enhancements remain—primarily in kernel fusion under "Other Kernels"—SGLang’s decode performance is largely aligned with DeepSeek’s, with prefill optimization as the next focus.
Ablation Study: Two-batch Overlap
Impact of Batch Size and Attention Time
This section investigates TBO performance across varying batch sizes and simulated MTP scenarios.

TBO delivers two significant benefits in the prefill phase, as evidenced by throughput comparisons and memory usage optimizations:

Support for Larger Batch Sizes: In the vanilla configuration, each device processes up to 8,192 tokens before encountering out-of-memory (OOM) errors at 16,384 tokens. TBO mitigates this by optimizing memory usage for input tokens, enabling inference with batches as large as 16,384 tokens per device. This further boosts performance to 40.5% increase when comparing the TBO flag with all other configurations made optimal.
Enhanced Throughput: By overlapping computation (e.g., attention and MLP phases) with communication (e.g., DeepEP Combine and Dispatch), TBO achieves a 27% to 35% throughput increase compared to the vanilla setup, even when processing the same token count per device.

TBO’s impact in the decode phase varies by scenario, with performance tied to batch size and attention processing time:

Real Test Cases: Speedup in practical scenarios is contingent on batch size exceeding a threshold between 64 and 128 tokens. Below this, TBO yields minimal or negative gains (e.g., -27% at 32 tokens/device), as small decode batch sizes hinder kernel efficiency. The speedup reaches 25.5% at 256 tokens with a performance of 22,310 tokens per second.
Simulated MTP Scenario: TBO provides the most substantial speedup in simulated MTP cases when processing 128 requests to generate 256 tokens per decode step. This is due to prolonged attention processing time, which aligns computation (e.g., DP Attention layers) with DeepEP communication overhead (e.g., combine and dispatch steps). The evaluation shows a 35% speedup at 128 sequences/device, with throughput 17,552 tokens per second compared to 12,929 without TBO.

Detail Breakdown
We evaluated three prefill scenarios: TBO with 16k tokens per batch, TBO with 8k tokens, and no-TBO with 8k tokens. The figure below reveals key insights:

TBO Efficiency: Comparing the 8k cases, TBO improves overall efficiency by overlapping computation and communication, as expected.
Batch Size Impact: Reducing the batch size from 16k to 8k with TBO results in a slight slowdown, reflecting diminished kernel efficiency with smaller batches.
Kernel Performance: Interestingly, the no-TBO 8k case outperforms the TBO 16k case in per-kernel speed, despite both having an effective batch size of 8k for kernels. This may stem from reduced streaming multiprocessors (SMs) with TBO, potential noisy neighbor effects during overlap, or kernel incompatibility between computation and communication. These findings suggest future optimization directions for SGLang.


For the decode phase, we analyzed three configurations: TBO with a batch size of 256, no-TBO with 256, and no-TBO with 128. The time breakdown is shown below:

TBO vs. No-TBO (Batch Size 256): Without TBO, communication time increases significantly due to the lack of overlap. However, computation kernels, particularly GEMM, benefit from a larger effective batch size, resulting in faster execution.
TBO (256) vs. No-TBO (128): Comparing cases with the same kernel batch size, only non-overlapped communication slows down in the no-TBO setup, while computation remains consistent. Unlike prefill, decode communication kernels either fully utilize SMs (during send/receive) or none (during inflight waiting), avoiding resource contention with computation kernels.


Ablation Study: EPLB
This section evaluates the impact of the EPLB on system performance through overall throughput analysis and detailed case studies. Given EPLB's sensitivity to workload distribution and distribution shifts in production environments, we focus on qualitative and generalizable insights rather than real-world performance, which requires production data.
Overall Results
The figure below illustrates EPLB's effect on throughput in large-scale settings. EPLB delivers a significant speedup of 1.49x (prefill) and 2.54x (decode), as expected, due to its ability to mitigate workload imbalances across GPUs. As the number of ranks scales, imbalances grow, and EPLB effectively addresses this in our large-scale experiments, leading to notable throughput improvements.

Case Study: Workload Imbalance Versus Overall Throughput
To explore the relationship between workload imbalance and throughput, we conducted a case study using a decode experiment with 1800 input tokens, 100 output tokens, and a batch size of 256. Throughput and balancedness (average token count divided by maximum token count across experts) were plotted against decoding steps:

The results reveal a strong correlation between balancedness and throughput, emphasizing the importance of maintaining high balancedness for optimal performance.
Case Study: Expert Distribution Statistics
The following figure presents expert distribution statistics for prefill and decode sample data:

Key observations include:

Imbalance in Expert Usage: Most experts are infrequently used, while a small subset is heavily utilized, underscoring the inherent imbalance in MoE models.
Prefill vs. Decode Differences: Although prefill and decode distributions share similarities, notable differences exist. This supports the use of PD disaggregation, which enables distinct expert placements for each phase, optimizing performance.

These findings highlight EPLB's role in addressing workload imbalances and the value of tailoring expert placement to phase-specific demands.
Toolkits
Disposable Tensor
Memory management in PyTorch can be challenging due to persistent object references, especially in GPU-intensive workflows where CUDA memory is a scarce resource. Consider the following example:
def ffn(hidden_state: torch.Tensor, linear1: nn.Linear, linear2: nn.Linear):
    intermediate_state = linear1(hidden_state)
    del hidden_state  # Attempt to free memory, but no effect due to external reference
    return linear2(nn.ReLU(intermediate_state))

hidden_state = ffn(hidden_state, linear1, linear2)

In this code, del hidden_state is intended to release the memory occupied by hidden_state after intermediate_state is computed. However, as hidden_state is still referenced outside the function, the del operation has no effect. This increases peak memory usage, risking performance slowdowns or out-of-memory errors.
SGLang addresses this with the DisposableTensor class, a subclass of torch.Tensor which introduces a dispose() method to explicitly and immediately release a tensor’s memory, circumventing Python’s reference counting limitations. Here’s how it works:
def ffn(hidden_state: torch.Tensor, linear1: nn.Linear, linear2: nn.Linear):
    intermediate_state = linear1(hidden_state)
    hidden_state.dispose()  # Immediately releases CUDA memory
    return linear2(nn.ReLU(intermediate_state))

# Wrap the tensor in DisposableTensor
hidden_state = DisposableTensor(hidden_state)
hidden_state = ffn(hidden_state, linear1, linear2)

By wrapping hidden_state in a DisposableTensor and calling dispose() when it’s no longer needed, the CUDA memory is freed right away. This ensures that memory is released as soon as the tensor’s role in the computation is complete, reducing peak memory usage and improving overall efficiency.
Expert Workload Extraction and Simulation
SGLang also includes a toolset for analyzing and simulating expert workload distribution in MoE models. This feature enables users to:

Dump Expert Workload Statistics: Extract either accumulated statistics or per-batch workload data. Accumulated stats support the EPLB manager for real-time optimization, while per-batch data provides granular insights for analysis and simulation.
Simulate Expert Utilization: Model expert balance across various configurations without requiring costly hardware or repeated trials. For instance, users can gather workload data from a modest setup (e.g., 2x8xH100 or 8xH200) and simulate the performance for a large-scale 22-node deployment.

This simulation capability allows users to evaluate how factors like rebalancing frequency, node count, or batch size impact system performance. It’s a cost-effective way to fine-tune configurations before scaling up.
Limitations and Future Work
While our implementation of SGLang for DeepSeek-V3 inference demonstrates significant throughput improvements, several limitations and areas for future enhancement remain:

Latency Optimization: The current focus on throughput leaves Time to First Token (TTFT) at 2–5 seconds and Inter-Token Latency (ITL) at approximately 100ms, requiring further optimizations for real-time use cases.
Sequence Length Constraints: Limited to shorter sequences due to the use of 96 GPUs. Expanding GPU resources would support longer sequences, essential for specific applications.
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) Integration: SGLang supports MTP but lacks full integration with DP attention, reducing efficiency in mixed parallelism configurations.
EPLB Distribution: The experiments in this blog utilizes in-distribution data for Expert Parallelism Load Balancer (EPLB), which may not reflect real-world variability. Future work should experiment performances when having distribution shifts.
Flexible Tensor Parallelism (TP) Sizes: For DeepSeek-V3, memory-optimal TP sizes for dense FFNs are small but larger than 1. Currently, SGLang only supports pure TP or DP, leading to suboptimal memory use. Flexible TP options are needed.
Blackwell Support: Currently, our implementation supports only the NVIDIA Hopper architecture. We are actively working to extend compatibility to the next-generation Blackwell architecture. If you are interested in supporting or sponsoring this development, welcome to contact lmsys.org@gmail.com.

Conclusion
By leveraging PD disaggregation, EP, and a carefully crafted parallelism design, we’ve reproduced DeepSeek’s inference framework in SGLang with exceptional performance. Our open-source efforts—achieving 52.3k input tokens per second and 22.3k output tokens per second—demonstrate SGLang’s power for large-scale LLM inference. We invite the community to explore, replicate, and extend this work to push the boundaries of efficient AI deployment.

            <description><![CDATA[I didn't misclick any buttons. My best wasn't good enough. I'm not good enough.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
Here's a vague overview of what just happened:

I recently applied for
Anthropic's Developer Relations role.
My friend who works there gave me a glowing recommendation (thanks again,
dude!).
I completed their secret take-home assignment.
On top of their secret take-home assignment, I independently published
diggit.dev and a companion blogpost
about my [sincerely] positive experiences with Claude. I was hoping that
some unsolicited "extra credit" would make me look like an
exceptional/ambitious candidate.
I
posted diggit.dev to HackerNews
and it hit the frontpage!
I submitted my take-home assignment and my unsolicited extra credit.
They sent me
the "unfortunately" email.

Anthropic obviously didn't do anything wrong. I'm just bummed.
Claude Code truly is one of my favorite dev tools ever, and if you've suffered
through my talks/interviews, you're probably sick of my
enthusiasm for software. I was particularly excited to interview with Anthropic
because I respect their approach to responsible AI adoption. This very blog
is too often a crazed celebration of humans, of software, of AI, of progress, of
sincerity -- I, I felt like I was a perfect fit.
The first time I flunked an Anthropic interview (ca. 2022), I accidentally
clicked a wrong button during their automated coding challenge. It was easy to
swallow that failure. I made an honest mistake; I expect companies to reject
candidates who make honest mistakes during interviews.
This is different. I didn't misclick any buttons. My best wasn't good enough.
I'm not good enough.
This essay started as a fantasy: some hero at Anthropic reads this on HackerNews
and vouches for me and I get the job and I help them guide humanity toward
post-scarity AI abundance, forever and ever, amen. I'm ashamed of these
thoughts. It's the same folly of explaining to an ex-girlfriend why she's wrong
about her own experience.
Dating was difficult for me. I don't mind feeling ugly or low-status or whatever
-- I know my place. But it hurts to feel seen, feel considered, but ultimately
rejected due to mysterious forces: "He's cute, but he's too weird."
Yes, I'm weird. My eccentric habits have been an overall boon for my career, for
my relationships, for my well-being. But it's moments like these when I just
want to turn all my weird off. I want to be a square peg for this square hole
and do honest work and feed my family and help humanity thrive.
I can't turn my weird off, so I think I defensively dial it up sometimes. I
exaggerate my eccentricities. It's easy to swallow criticism when it isn't the
real me, when it isn't my best, when it's honest mistakes -- what a load
of crap. This is me. This is my best. Hello, world.
Now it's all coming back in waves, in gasps -- I spent so much of my life being
an unlikable jerk. Becoming somebody else has been slow/painful and I'm so
deeply afraid of regressing. Over the past decade, I've been striving to spread
joy, to do good, to be better. I'm trying so hard.
And all this keyboard vomit is a promise to myself that I'm not giving up. I
hate this feeling, and I'm staring these nightmares straight in their stupid
eyeballs, and they're not blinking. I am still alive, and I have so much more to
do.
I'm okay. I mean it. I don't need (or deserve) your sympathy. I'm so lucky to be
alive, at this time, at this place, in this body, with these people. My life is
great, and it will get even better if I keep putting in this effort.
Spewing my insides like this onto The Internet is terrifying, but I suspect many
strangers are facing similar feelings. It's rough out there. Whatever it is,
wherever you are, I hope this helps. You've got this. You're not alone, and
we're only human.]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Private equity firms have acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers in recent years. Some have been accused of patient harm.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                                
                                    Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.Cash CowPrivate equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”David vs. GoliathAfter two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.State SolutionsSome states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.This article was published by Stateline.

        The secrecy battle over the Army’s Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) for Sig Sauer’s P320 has followed Glasscock v. Sig Sauer to the Eighth Circuit. A media intervenor is now asking the appellate court to keep key records open—and their brief places Practical Shooting Insights (this site) squarely in the middle of the story.

What’s new


  The Trace intervenes in the appeal. The newsroom moved to intervene for the limited purpose of opposing sealed filings tied to class certification and the FMECA, arguing the public’s right of access and noting the district court cited the FMECA nine times when it certified the class.





  Sig Sauer says “national security” and asks for deference to the Army. In opposing intervention, Sig Sauer urges the court to leave FMECA-related material sealed and to give the Army time to weigh in, framing the dispute in terms of protecting “military secrets.”







  A second FMECA document emerges. Sig Sauer’s opposition confirms there are two FMECA records in the class-certification exhibits: a FMECA Spreadsheet and a FMECA Memorandum—the latter not previously described in public filings—raising fresh questions about what the memo contains and who authored it.





  PSI’s reporting is part of the record. The Trace’s filing tells the court the unredacted FMECA was found on CourtListener, de‑obscured, and published on Practical Shooting Insights, where it “remains available”—and it recounts Sig Sauer’s own executive discussing it on a podcast while pointing viewers to this website.






The FMECA document was previously published here.



The Trace’s pitch: This isn’t secret anymore

The Trace walks the appellate court through how the FMECA left the bottle: it was posted on this website and then widely republished; a YouTube explainer discussing it surpassed 100,000 views. The filing quotes Sig Sauer’s VP of Consumer Affairs Phil Strader being asked on the Behind the Lens podcast why the FMECA shouldn’t be public and responding, “No, there’s not” (nothing to hide), while directing viewers to this website to see the document and describing its contents.





The reporting regarding Phil Strader’s interview was previously published here

How many times has the unredacted FMECA been “shared”? The filings don’t give a precise share count. What they do document is widespread republication and discussion, including the 100k‑plus video and multiple re‑posts mirroring the PSI copy. In other words, the genie is out of the bottle.

The Trace also points to DoD Instruction 5230.24, the policy Sig Sauer invokes, noting it does not authorize withholding unclassified information about evaluations of performance and reliability of military equipment—and that the PSI‑hosted FMECA bears no DoD distribution markings.





Sig Sauer’s response: Let the Army decide—and keep the lid on

Sig Sauer tells the Eighth Circuit The Trace lacks standing and that parallel briefing is already underway in the district court. Substantively, Sig Sauer leans on military‑secrets concerns, requests time for the Army to opine on release, and characterizes the FMECA as controlled technical information created under the MHS contract. (The company also recounts how the spreadsheet briefly became public in another case before being pulled down.)



Two details in Sig Sauer’s papers matter going forward:

1) The “FMECA Memorandum.” Sig Sauer identifies the memo alongside the previously published spreadsheet. If the memo is Sig Sauer‑authored, it could reveal how the company framed the Army analysis internally—an issue directly relevant to notice, risk mitigation, and marketing claims.

2) Ongoing Army communications. Sig Sauer’s litigation counsel filed a declaration stating he asked the Army about the FMECA’s distribution status and that key Army decision‑makers were unavailable the week of the deadline; Sig Sauer says the Army may submit information and seeks additional time.





The transparency question, distilled


  
    Is the FMECA “national‑security” material? The Trace says no—and points to DoDI 5230.24’s carve‑out: it does not provide authority to withhold unclassified evaluations of performance and reliability—exactly what a FMECA is. It also underscores the lack of any DoD marking on the PSI copy.
  
  
    Is secrecy even possible at this point? The record shows the unredacted spreadsheet is online on this website, has been reposted broadly, and has been discussed by Sig Sauer’s own executive on air—who told listeners where to find it. One video discussing it has 100,000+ views.
  




Why this matters to the class action—and to owners

The district court relied on the FMECA repeatedly when certifying the Missouri class, including on notice and risk‑mitigation questions—the very issues consumers care about. Keeping the heart of that analysis under seal on appeal would blunt the public’s ability to scrutinize a product‑safety fight with real‑world consequences.

The Trace’s filing names PSI as the first publisher of the unredacted spreadsheet and quotes Strader pointing viewers here. I will continue to publish filings and analysis so readers can compare the arguments to the documents themselves.



What to watch next

1) Whether the Eighth Circuit permits intervention and applies the strong presumption of public access to class‑certification records.
2) If the Army weighs in—and on what basis—regarding the FMECA’s distribution status.
3) Disclosure of the FMECA Memorandum. If it’s Sig Sauer-authored, it could illuminate internal framing of hazards and fixes—material at the core of consumer‑protection claims.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[   Why is Facebook cloud-processing my device's camera roll?   Meta is uploading and analyzing your camera roll photos and videos, even ones you haven't posted, in its cloud in order to generate AI-powered suggestions like collages, monthly recaps, themed albums, or AI-restyled versions of your images.      Where is this feature being tested?   Meta has confirmed the feature is a test, saying, "We're exploring ways to make content sharing easier for people on Facebook by testing suggestions of ready-to-share and curated content from a person's camera roll."   The test is currently available in the US and Canada, but it's not available in Illinois or Texas due to those states' privacy laws.      Did Facebook ask for my consent before turning this on?   Meta is showing a pop-up asking users if they want to enable cloud processing, but some users claim they haven't seen it. Instead, they found the toggles in their settings already switched on by default, raising questions about whether clear consent was given.      Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET Can I remove my photos once they've been uploaded? ZDNET's sister site, CNET, reports that Meta pulls from your newer pictures (roughly the last 30 days) and if you disable the feature, your uploaded photos will be deleted after 30 days. The only way to confirm is by downloading your Facebook account data.   Why is this a potential privacy issue?   It expands Meta's reach beyond the content you've chosen to upload and share online -- into your private, unposted photos and videos. For many, that's a major red flag and a line they're not comfortable crossing, understandably so.   Also: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves outEven if Meta is asking for consent to access your camera roll in order to analyze your phone's photos and provide AI-powered suggestions, the company could have done a better job of being clear and explicit about what it's trying to do.   How many users, like me, simply dismissed the consent pop-up without fully realizing what they'd just agreed to?   Editor's note: This article was updated on Aug. 24, 2025 to clarify that Meta's camera roll sharing suggestions are not turned on by default and are entirely opt-in. Still, some users say they never knowingly agreed and are finding the features enabled in their settings.]]></content:encoded>
