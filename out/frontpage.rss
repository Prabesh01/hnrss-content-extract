            <description><![CDATA[Building MVT tiles from scratch]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ As I add more data to the NYC Chaos Dashboard, a website that maps live urban activity, I have been looking for a more efficient way to render the map.
Since I collect all of the data in one process and return the Dashboard as one HTML file, I kept wondering how I could
optimize the map’s loading time by pre-processing the data as much as possible in the backend. This is where vector tiles come in.
The code shown in this post is written in Go.
Why generate tiles?
Initially, all of the map’s data was passed to the rendering library in GeoJSON format (embedded directly in the HTML file).
For those who don’t know, GeoJSON is a JSON based standard to represent geographic information. You can go see the full RFC here,
but here’s a quick preview of what it looks like so you can get an idea:
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [-74.04452395542852, 40.68987850656795]
  },
  "properties": {
    "name": "Statue of Liberty",
    "status": "open"
  }
}
Now, I’m definitely not JSON’s greatest fan. It’s all text, meaning that a number is stored in a base 10 ASCII representation, where a number like 42 gets stored as "4" and "2".
I could go on, but I think you see the problem: it’s not the most efficient way to store data. Nonetheless, JSON has a lot of merits: it’s human-readable and easy to share between systems, so I find myself using it more
than I’d like to - more often than not, simplicity is the way to go, and a simple format like GeoJSON just gets the job done, and that alone makes it a worthy geographic standard.
So what happens when I start adding more layers to the map? It gets slow. I’m working on adding flood sensor data (thank you Floodnet for granting me access to the API), LIRR and MetroNorth data, NYISO power data,
and many more datasets which will start adding a lot of layers to the map. I can already see that the HTML file, at the time of writing, is 4.5Mb (once decompressed) and takes ~770ms to transfer from Cloudflare’s CDN to my browser.
This seems pretty reasonable for now, but it won’t scale as the future datasets are much larger, and running a quick check on the website, chrome is already telling me that the site has performance issues:

And if I look more closely, I can see that it’s the result of a long rendering (over 2s!), which I can see here:

Now, I suspect this is the result of a few things:

As mentioned above, all of the embedded data is GeoJSON. This means the rendering library (MapLibre GL JS) needs to parse the JSON. There’s a lot, with a lot of properties, so this takes time.
MapLibre GL needs to then take the coordinates and then place the lines, points and polygons on the map accordingly. This takes time, and it all happens on your browser.

I don’t like this - I want a map that people can use to check on the status of their city, and not a bloated HTML page that gets slower as more data gets onboarded, ironically making it less and less usable.
So, how can I display many large datasets on a map?
An obvious, and honestly wise, solution would be to simply load the GeoJSONs separately, via a GET request. You can do this simply in MapLibre:
map.addSource('resurfacing', {
    type: 'geojson',
    data: 'https://dash.hudsonshipping.co/data/resurfacing.geojson'
});
This is so much better than my current solution:
map.addSource('resurfacing', {
    type: 'geojson',
    data: {{.Geo.Resurfacing}}
});
{{.Geo.Resurfacing}} is the code in my HTML template that gets rendered in my Go process.
Loading GeoJSONs via a GET request will result in a lighter HTML file and a faster rendering of the Dashboard (the non-map components at least), but MapLibre still needs to parse that JSON and figure out how and where to plot the geometries.
This is still not optimal.
So how do big companies handle this? To display large amounts of data on map at scale and with performance, they use Vector Tiles, loading geometries sector by sector.
What are Vector Tiles?
Vector Tiles are small files that also represent geographic features, similar to GeoJSON. The key difference is that they represent a specific sector, a tile (thus the name), at a specific zoom.
That means if I want to display a map of the world with Vector Tiles, it will actually be a collection of square tiles pieced together.
Imagine taking a globe and cutting it up in multiple squares - that’s what vector tiles are (we’ll ignore distortion and projections for now, that’ll be a post for another time).
You may already be familiar with them when interacting with online maps, like Google Maps, where you can notice your features contained in squares, with some squares loaded before others:

MapTiler made a great demonstration of Tiles, showing the tile coordinates at different zoom levels.

Unlike GeoJSON where all features (point, line or polygon) of a layer are stored in one file, Vector Tiles (MVT) store features in smaller files that represent a specific area (at a specific zoom, or resolution).
In the above image, the points from the GeoJSON file are split into 3 tiles (tile 4 being empty).
So this is just a raster, then?
No, and this is where vector tiles get even more interesting. Like rasters, they represent data in a specific part of the world. But unlike rasters,
vector tiles don’t store an image, they store instructions. This is very, very similar (you’ll see just how much in the next section) to a JPEG vs an SVG.
This means vector tiles contain commands to draw layers and features that can then be customized in the rendering library:

Have a road you want to display as congested? Just set the line-color to red
Have a live event you want to display? Go for it, just add some custom animation to make the point pulsate


AS you can see in the above illustration, an Vector Tile file contains commands on how to plot the data using a local coordinate system, and not just a grid of pixels.
Ok, so how do I create one of these tiles and load it on a map?
Ok, this is the fun part - and it’s a lot easier than I first thought it would be. We’ll use the current
standard for vector tiles, which you may have glimpsed in the previous sections: Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT). MapLibre can handle this natively, and the documentation seems
pretty easy:
map.addSource('some id', {
    type: 'vector',
    tiles: ['https://dash.hudsonshipping.co/{z}/{x}/{y}/tile.mvt'],
    minzoom: 6,
    maxzoom: 14
});
So I need to have an endpoint that serves up MVT files for a given tile (x,y) at a given zoom z. That part isn’t too hard,
it’s a simple HTTP endpoint. So now, I need to actually be able to generate the MVT file.
Mapbox has done a great job documenting the spec, you can find it here.
I used this as the main reference for the project, as it contains everything you need to construct a vector tile. For all transformations, I simply used
the code made available my MapTiler.
An MVT represents information in binary format - this means it’s not human-readable, unlike GeoJSON. To generate the binary output,
Mapbox has opted for Protobuf. If you don’t know Protobuf, it’s Google’s standard to normalize structured data in a binary format with predefined fields and datatypes described in a .proto file. If you want to learn more about the project, I recommend checking this out. This is what the MVT proto file looks like:
message Tile {
        enum GeomType {
             UNKNOWN = 0;
             POINT = 1;
             LINESTRING = 2;
             POLYGON = 3;
        }

        message Value {
                optional string string_value = 1;
                optional float float_value = 2;
                optional double double_value = 3;
                optional int64 int_value = 4;
                optional uint64 uint_value = 5;
                optional sint64 sint_value = 6;
                optional bool bool_value = 7;

                extensions 8 to max;
        }
        message Feature {
                optional uint64 id = 1 [ default = 0 ];
                repeated uint32 tags = 2 [ packed = true ];
                optional GeomType type = 3 [ default = UNKNOWN ];
                repeated uint32 geometry = 4 [ packed = true ];
        }

        message Layer {
                required uint32 version = 15 [ default = 1 ];
                required string name = 1;
                repeated Feature features = 2;
                repeated string keys = 3;
                repeated Value values = 4;
                optional uint32 extent = 5 [ default = 4096 ];

                extensions 16 to max;
        }

        repeated Layer layers = 3;
        extensions 16 to 8191;
}
Ok, so looking at the proto, we can see that a tile is essentially an array of layers, each layer being able to contain multiple features.
To make this more understandable, here’s an example of what you could put in a tile:


Layer 1: Monuments

Feature 1: Statue of Liberty (type: Point)
Feature 2: Eiffel Tower (type: Point)



Layer 2: Airports

Feature 1: JFK (type: Point)
Feature 2: CDG (type: Point)



We’ll use this example throughout this section to construct a tile, and specifically focus on the Statue of Liberty. We can see that a layer represents a dataset you want to display on a map,
and a feature is a datapoint in that dataset. A tile can contain multiple layers, and thus multiple datasets. At a certain resolution,
we expect the Statue of Liberty to be in the same tile as the JFK airport, same for the Eiffel Tower and CDG, meaning they’ll be in the same MVT file.
Ok, so now we understand what’s contained in a tile. But how do you actually construct it?
Here are the steps required:

For a given zoom level, identify what tile (x, y) a feature belongs to
Create the tile and add the geometry
Add properties via tags
Return the tile via HTTP

1. Identifying the tiles
Let’s restate the problem we’re trying to solve: we have a GeoJSON file that we want to convert into multiple MVT tiles for performance reasons.
As stated earlier, to use MVT tiles in MapLibre we need to be able to return a response for:
https://dash.hudsonshipping.co/{z}/{x}/{y}/tile.mvt
So, this means I need to have multiple tiles generated in the backend, and return the correct one. But how do I know what tile each feature belongs to?
For example, when I am currently at zoom level 9, I can see that the the Statue of Liberty will be in the tile x = 150, y = 192:

And if I zoom to level 10, I can see that the Statue of Liberty will be in the tile
x = 301, y = 385:

To properly identify the tile, we need to do a few conversions. At this point, all of my geographic data is normalized to use EPSG:4326, a format most people are familiar with to represent coordinates. For example,
the Statue of Liberty’s coordinates in EPSG:4326, expressed in degrees, are:
longitude:-74.04452395542852, latitude: 40.68987850656795.
For vector tiles, the coordinate system used is called Web Mercator (EPSG:3857). In this system, expressed in meters, the
Statue is Liberty is located at:
x = -8242598.70274865, y = 4966705.869136138
So we need to convert the Statue of Liberty’s coordinates from degrees to meters, and then identify which square it belongs to at a specific
zoom level. This is pretty straight forward, so let’s get right to it.
Let’s finally get our hands dirty and write some code (please add proper error handling, this code is only for demonstration purposes).
First off, I want to convert my coordinates from EPSG:4326 (lon/lat) to EPSG:3857 (meters):
// We will use these constants throughout
const (
	EarthRadius = 6378137 // meters
	TileSize    = 512 // pixels
	OriginShift = 2 * math.Pi * EarthRadius / 2.0
)

func LonLatToMeters(lon float64, lat float64) (x float64, y float64) {
	mx := lon * OriginShift / 180.0
	my := math.Log(math.Tan((90 + lat) * math.Pi / 360.0)) / (math.Pi / 180.0)
	my = my * OriginShift / 180.0
	return mx, my
}
The spec refers to 4096 tile sizes, but MapLibre seems to use 512 pixels, so we’ll stick with this.
Once we’ve successfully written the function to convert our coordinates, we can now write the code to get the appropriate tile:
func Resolution(zoom int) float64 {
	// Returns meters / pixel
	initialResolution := 2 * math.Pi * EarthRadius / TileSize
	return initialResolution / (math.Pow(2, float64(zoom)))
}

func MetersToTile(mx float64, my float64, zoom int) (x int, y int) {
	res := Resolution(zoom) // meters / pixel
	px := (mx + OriginShift) / res
	py := (my + OriginShift) / res

	tx := int(math.Ceil(px / float64(TileSize)) - 1)
	ty := int(math.Ceil(py / float64(TileSize)) - 1)
	return tx, ty
}

func GoogleTile(tx int, ty int, zoom int) (x int, y int) {
	ty = int(math.Pow(2, float64(zoom))-1) - ty
	return tx, ty
}
Once we have these utility functions, determining the appropriate tile only requires a few lines of code:
mx, my   := LonLatToMeters(lon, lat)
tx, ty   := MetersToTile(mx, my, zoom)
gtx, gty := GoogleTile(tx, ty, zoom)
We use GoogleTile() because it seems MapLibre uses this standard (simply shift the origin to the top left). I couldn’t find documentation on it,
but I was able to see this behavior during my tests. I’ll update this part if I find the relevant documentation.
Here is what we now have:

mx and my are the point’s coordinates in meters, using the Web Mercator projection.
tx and ty are the tile coordinates in TMS format.
gtx and gty are the tile coordinates in Google format (also known as the XYZ format).

Great, we know what tile our feature belongs to for a given zoom. Let’s go create the tile.
2. Create the tile and add the geometry
Now that we know which tile a feature belongs to, let’s create the MVT file. You’ll need to install protoc for Go:
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
Go ahead and get the official .proto here: https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/blob/master/2.1/vector_tile.proto
Generate the struct:
protoc --go_out=./path/to/dir/mvt ./path/to/dir/mvt/vector_tile.proto
This will generate a vector_tile.pb.go that will look something like this:
// Code generated by protoc-gen-go. DO NOT EDIT.
// versions:
// 	protoc-gen-go v1.36.8
// 	protoc        v3.21.12
// source: internal/geo/mvt/vector_tile.proto

package mvt // Make sure to use the correct package here

import (
	protoreflect "google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect"
	protoimpl "google.golang.org/protobuf/runtime/protoimpl"
	reflect "reflect"
	sync "sync"
	unsafe "unsafe"
)

const (
	// Verify that this generated code is sufficiently up-to-date.
	_ = protoimpl.EnforceVersion(20 - protoimpl.MinVersion)
	// Verify that runtime/protoimpl is sufficiently up-to-date.
	_ = protoimpl.EnforceVersion(protoimpl.MaxVersion - 20)
)

// GeomType is described in section 4.3.4 of the specification
type Tile_GeomType int32

const (
	Tile_UNKNOWN    Tile_GeomType = 0
	Tile_POINT      Tile_GeomType = 1
	Tile_LINESTRING Tile_GeomType = 2
	Tile_POLYGON    Tile_GeomType = 3
)
// ...
Once we have generated the protobuf class, we can create an empty tile like this:
func NewTile(layerName string) *Tile {
    // The Tile struct comes from the generated protobuf
	version := uint32(0)
	extent := uint32(TileSize)
	layers := []*Tile_Layer{
	    {
	        Name:     &layerName,
	        Version:  &version,
	        Features: make([]*Tile_Feature, 0),
	        Extent:   &extent,
	    },
	}
	return &Tile{Layers: layers}
}
t = NewTile("monuments")
Great, we now have an empty tile. Let’s add our monument to ut, as a feature in the first layer called monuments.
A feature is defined by a few things:

A geometry type, in our case a Point
Tags (properties for that feature, which we’ll add in the next section)
A geometry

As mentioned earlier, a vector tile behaves similarly to an SVG file: you specify instructions to move a cursor. And that’s
exactly what goes into the geometry field: a series of instructions for a cursor.
Since our monument is a Point, we only have one instruction: move to location (x, y):

As you can see in the above example, we’re telling the cursor to move from the Origin to a specific part of the tile.
In this case, we’re letting MapLibre GL know to move the cursor 200 pixels to the right (x axis) and 75 pixels down (y axis).
But how do we get these instructions? Instructions are relative to the Origin of the tile, which is located at the top-left corner.
Coordinates go from 0 to 512 (the Extent of the tile, which we defined above).:

This means we need a few things:

Get the Web Mercator coordinates of the tile’s Origin
Calculate the offset, dx and dy for a given Point
Convert the offset in meters to an offset in pixels

Getting the tile’s origin is pretty straight forward:
func GetTileOrigin(tx int, ty int, zoom int) (minx int64, maxy int64) {
	res := Resolution(zoom)
	minX := int64(float64(tx) * TileSize * res - OriginShift)
	maxY := int64(float64(ty + 1) * TileSize * res - OriginShift)
	return minX, maxY
}
originX, originY := TileBounds(tx, ty, zoom)
Now that we have the Origin’s coordinates in meters, let’s calculate the offsets dx and dy:
dx := mx - originX
dy := originY - my
Finally, let’s divide the offsets by the resolution, expressed in meters / pixel, to get the parameters for the instruction:
res := Resolution(zoom)
shiftX := uint32(math.Floor(float64(dx) / res))
shiftY := uint32(math.Floor(float64(dy) / res))
We now have everything we need to construct our feature:
geomType := Tile_POINT
feature := Tile_Feature{
    Type: &geomType,
    Geometry: []uint32{
        1 & 0x7 | 1 << 3, // Command 1 (moveTo), count of 1
        (shiftX << 1) ^ (shiftX >> 31),
        (shiftY << 1) ^ (shiftY >> 31),
    },
}
The geometry is a little odd, but here’s what’s happening:

We pass in a slice of instructions, which is made up of a command followed by parameters
To place a Point, we use the command moveTo, to move the cursor
This command expects two parameters, dX and dY, which we pass in using zigzag encoding

We can go ahead and add this feature to our tile:
t.Layers[0].Features = append(t.Layers[0].Features, &feature)
3. Add properties
We now have a tile that meets the basic requirements:

1 layer
1 feature in the layer with a valid geometry

I now want to add the properties defined in the GeoJSON, in this case, the name and the status for the Statue of Liberty.
As with GeoJSON, you can store properties for each feature. So here, the status could be one of three:

open: Open for visit.
closed: Closed for visit.
maintenance: Closed for maintenance.

Adding the status open to the Statue of Liberty in GeoJSON looks like this:
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [-74.04452395542852, 40.68987850656795]
  },
  "properties": {
    "name": "Statue of Liberty",
    "status": "open"
  }
}
So, if I have 10’000 monuments, I’ll have 10,000 dictionaries like this:
"properties": {
    "name": "<Monument Name>",
    "status": "<Monument Status>"
  }
That means repeating open, closed or maintenance 10,000 times. Best case scenario, that’s 40,000 bytes (open 10,000 times),
and you probably want a unique name for your monument, so add another 10,000 strings to your file.
You can definitely improve this by shortening the status to something like o for open, and s for status, but this will only
get you so far as you scale (especially if you’re dealing with numbers, where these tricks won’t work) and add more properties and features.
Vector Tiles use a different approach: tags. In each layer, you define a set of keys and a set of values.
In our previous example, the keys would be [name, status] and the values would be [Statue of Liberty, open, closed, maintenance]:

So let’s add the known keys and values to our layer:
t.Layers[0].Keys = []string{"name", "status"}

SoLName := "Statue of Liberty"
StatusOpen := "open"
StatusClosed := "closed"
StatusMaintenance := "maintenance"
t.Layers[0].Values = []*Tile_Value{
    {StringValue: &SoLName},           // 0
    {StringValue: &StatusOpen},        // 1
    {StringValue: &StatusClosed},      // 2
    {StringValue: &StatusMaintenance}, // 3
}
Now that our layer knows what keys and values to expect, we can go ahead and set the property for the Statue of Liberty:
t.Layers[0].Features[0].Tags = []uint32{0, 0, 1, 1} // name: Statue of Liberty, status: open
If we wanted to update the status to inform users the Statue of Liberty is closed for maintenance, we would simply update the tags to:
t.Layers[0].Features[0].Tags = []uint32{0, 0, 1, 3} // name: Statue of Liberty, status: maintenance
4. Return the tile via HTTP
Our tile t isready to be returned to the frontend via an HTTP GET request.
To convert our tile to the MVT binary, simply use:
import 	"github.com/gogo/protobuf/proto"

out, _ := proto.Marshal(t)
out contains the []byte data that represents the .mvt file. Be sure to set the following header in your HTTP response:
"Content-Type" : "application/vnd.mapbox-vector-tile"
And there it is - a vector tile built entirely from scratch, using geographic information contained in a GeoJSON file.
When you’re using a map, you’ll almost always be visualizing more than one tile at a time, and zooming in and out. This means
each feature will be on multiple tiles, one per zoom level, so you’ll need to design a strategy to handle this. The below code is
a quick snippet of the implementation used for the Dashboard (some of the HTTP code is using an internal library, it can easily be replaced with
your own HTTP server implementation / library):
type TileMap struct {
	Tiles map[int]map[int]map[int]*Tile // [z][x][y]Tile
}

func NewTileMap() *TileMap {
	tiles := make(map[int]map[int]map[int]*Tile)
	for _, zoom := range Zooms {
		tiles[zoom] = make(map[int]map[int]*Tile)
	}
	return &TileMap{Tiles: tiles}
}

func (tm *TileMap) GetTile(z int, x int, y int) *Tile {
	if xyMap, zExists := tm.Tiles[z]; zExists {
		if yMap, xExists := xyMap[x]; xExists {
			if tile, yExists := yMap[y]; yExists {
				return tile
			}
		}
	}
	return nil
}
tm := NewTileMap()

// Generate the tiles here and populate the tile map using the above code
// ...

h.PublicHandler("GET", "/layer/potholes/{z}/{x}/{y}/tile.mvt", func(r *http.Request) web.HttpResp {
		z := r.PathValue("z")
		x := r.PathValue("x")
		y := r.PathValue("y")
		zInt, _ := strconv.Atoi(z)
		xInt, _ := strconv.Atoi(x)
		yInt, _ := strconv.Atoi(y)
		var out []byte
		if tm == nil {
			out, _ = proto.Marshal(mvt.NewTile("empty"))
		} else {
			tile := tm.GetTile(zInt, xInt, yInt)
			out, err = proto.Marshal(tile)
			if err != nil {
				// Generate an empty tile
				out, _ = proto.Marshal(mvt.NewTile("empty"))
			}
		}
		return web.HttpResp{
			Data:        out,
			StatusCode:  http.StatusOK,
			ContentType: "application/vnd.mapbox-vector-tile",
		}
	})
We’ve now created an HTTP server that returns MVT files on demand, as a user explores the map.
Did the performance improve?
After deploying the MVT tile server for my GeoJSON layers that contain points, this is what we get:

File size decreased to 3.7Mb (I mean, we removed GeoJSON data, so no surprise there), meaning the site now loads in 500ms
The paint time has decreased (by about 200ms, not bad for migrating just 2 datasets over), and the performance score went up by 8% according to Lighthouse:


I’m running this process off of a server in my office, and I use Cloudflare Tunnels to expose the site, which unfortunately means
the tiles don’t return very fast. This means I’m going to have to move this over to AWS, something I’ve been meaning to do, and I expect
the tiles to return a lot faster, hopefully sub 100ms.
I still have to move over the non-Point layers that are still GeoJSON, so I expect a big gain in performance there. More soon!
What’s next?
This simple example only focuses on Points. Implementing lines and polygons requires more work, as they can span multiple tiles.
I’ll put out a new post once I’ve implemented these, along with performance metrics of the Dashboard.
I’m also looking forward to seeing MapLibre tiles ready for production use, so I can generate MapLibre tiles
and get some additional performance gain and contribute to the MapLibre ecosystem.
I’m working on making the Go code open source in a small geographic library, which I’ll put on Hudson Shipping Co’s github.
Thank you!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Brioches and Knife, Eliot Hodgkin, 08/1961When people talk about the value of paying attention and slowing down, they often make it sound prudish and monk-like. Attention is something we “have to protect.” And we have to “pay”1 attention—like a tribute.But we shouldn’t forget how interesting and overpoweringly pleasurable sustained attention can be. Slowing down makes reality vivid, strange, and hot.Let me start with the most obvious example.As anyone who has had good sex knows, sustained attention and delayed satisfaction are a big part of it. When you resist the urge to go ahead and get what you want and instead stay in the moment, you open up a space for seduction and fantasy. Desire begins to loop on itself and intensify.I’m not sure what is going on here, but my rough understanding is that the expectation of pleasure activates the dopaminergic system in the brain. Dopamine is often portrayed as a pleasure chemical, but it isn’t really about pleasure so much as the expectation that pleasure will occur soon. So when we are being seduced and sense that something pleasurable is coming—but it keeps being delayed, and delayed skillfully—the phasic bursts of dopamine ramp up the levels higher and higher, pulling more receptors to the surface of the cells, making us more and more sensitized to the surely-soon-to-come pleasure. We become hyperattuned to the sensations in our genitals, lips, and skin.And it is not only dopamine ramping up that makes seduction warp our attentional field, infusing reality with intensity and strangeness. There are a myriad of systems that come together to shape our feeling of the present: there are glands and hormones and multiple areas of the brain involved. These are complex physical processes: hormones need to be secreted and absorbed; working memory needs to be cleared and reloaded, and so on. The reason deep attention can’t happen the moment you notice something is that these things take time.What’s more, each of these subsystems update what they are reacting to at a different rate. Your visual cortex can cohere in less than half a second. A stress hormone like cortisol, on the other hand, has a half-life of 60–90 minutes and so can take up to 6 hours to fully clear out after the onset of an acute stressor. This means that if we switch what we pay attention to more often than, say, every 30 minutes, our system will be more or less decohered—different parts will be “attending to” different aspects of reality.2 There will be “attention residue” floating around in our system—leftovers from earlier things we paid attention to (thoughts looping, feelings circling below consciousness, etc.), which crowd out the thing we have in front of us right now, making it less vivid.Inversely, the longer we are able to sustain the attention without resolving it and without losing interest, the more time the different systems of the body have to synchronize with each other, and the deeper the experience gets.Locked in on the same thing, the subsystems begin to reinforce each other: the dopamine makes us aware of our skin, and sensations on the skin ramp up dopamine release, making us even more aware of our skin. A finger touches our belly, and we start to fantasize about where that finger might be going; and so now our fantasies are locked in, too, releasing even more dopamine and making us even more aware of our skin. The more the subsystems lock in, the more intense the feedback loops get. After twenty minutes, our sense of self has evaporated, and we’re in a realm where we do, feel, and think things that would seem surreal in other contexts.Similar things happen when we are able to sustain our attention to things other than sex, too. The exact mechanics differ, I presume, but the basic pattern is that when we let our attention linger on something, our bodily systems synchronize and feed each other stimuli in an escalatory loop that restructures our attentional field.Almost anything that we are able to direct sustained attention at will begin to loop on itself and bloom.To take a dark example, if you focus on your anxiety, the anxiety can begin to loop on itself until you hyperventilate and get tunnel vision and become filled with nightmarish thoughts and feelings—a panic attack.And you do the same thing with joy. If you learn to pay sustained attention to your happiness, the pleasant sensation will loop on itself until it explodes and pulls you into a series of almost hallucinogenic states, ending in cessation, where your consciousness lets go and you disappear for a while. This takes practice. The practice is called jhanas, and it is sometimes described as the inverse of a panic attack. I have only ever entered the first jhana, once while spending an hour putting our four-year-old to sleep and meditating on how wonderful it is to lie there next to her. It was really weird and beautiful. If you want to know more about these sorts of mental states, I recommend José Luis Ricón Fernández de la Puente’s recent write-up of his experiences, Nadia Asparouhova on her experiences, and her how-to guide.Here is José, whose blog is normally detailed reflections on cell biology and longevity and metascience, describing the second evening of a jhana retreat:So I went down to the beach. “Kinda nice”, I thought. The sky had a particularly vibrant blue color, the waves had ‘the right size’, their roar was pleasant. I started to walk around trying to continue meditating. I focused my awareness on an arising sensation of open heartedness and then I noticed my eyes tearing up (“Huh? I thought”). I looked again at the ocean and then I saw it. It was fucking amazing. So much color and detail: waves within waves, the fractal structure of the foamy crests as they disintegrate back into the ocean. The feeling of the sun on my skin. I felt overwhelmed. As tears ran down my face and lowkey insane grin settled on my face I found myself mumbling “It’s... always been like this!!!!” “What the fuck??!” followed by “This is too much!! Too much!!!”. The experience seemed to be demanding from me to feel more joy and awe than I was born to feel or something like that. In that precise moment I felt what “painfully beautiful” means for the first time in my life.The fact that we can enter fundamentally different, and often exhilarating, states of mind by learning how to sustain our attention is fascinating. It makes you wonder what other states are waiting out there. What will happen if you properly pay attention to an octopus?3 What about your sense of loneliness?4 A mathematical idea?5 The weights of a neural net?6 The footnotes here take you to examples of people who have done that. There are so many things to pay attention to and experience.One of my favorite things to sustain attention toward is art.There was a period in my twenties when I didn’t get art. I thought artists were trying to say something, but I felt superior because I thought there had to be better ways of getting their ideas across (and also, better ideas). But then I realized that good art—at least the art I am spontaneously drawn to—has little to do with communication. Instead, it is about crafting patterns of information that, if you feed them sustained attention, will begin to structure your attentional field in interesting ways. Art is guided meditation. The point isn’t the words, but what happens to your mind when you attend to those words (or images, or sounds). There is nothing there to understand; it is just something to experience, like sex. But the experiences can be very deep and, sometimes, transformative.In 2019, for example, I saw a performance of Jean Sibelius’s 5th Symphony at the University Hall in Uppsala.Before the concert began, I spent a few minutes with my eyes closed, doing a body scan, to be fully present when the music began. As the horns at the opening of the piece called out, I decided to keep my eyes closed, so I wouldn’t be distracted by looking at the hands of the musicians. Then… a sort of daydream started up. The mood suggested to me the image of a cottage overlooking a sloping meadow and a thick wood of pines, a few hours from Helsinki. It was a pretty obvious image, since I knew that Sibelius wrote the piece at Aniola, which is 38 km north of Helsinki. But then I saw an old man walking up the meadow and into the house. The camera cut. Through an open door, I saw the man, alone, working at a desk. I saw it as clearly as if it had been projected on a screen before me: the camera moved slowly toward the back of the man.Through the window above his desk, I could see a light in the distance. Perhaps it was Helsinki? No, it felt alive, like a being—something alive and growing, something that was headed here. But then again, if you were to see a city from space, watching it sped up by 100,000x, it would look like a being moving through the landscape, spreading, getting closer. The old man sat there for a hundred years, watching the light. There was a sinking feeling in my body.One spring, birds fell dead from the sky. They littered the fields, whole droves of them filled the ditches—blue birds, red birds, and black. The man carried them into his woodshed and placed them in waist-high piles.The film kept going, and the emotional intensity and complexity gradually ramped up. For the thirty minutes that it took the orchestra to play the three movements of the symphony, I experienced what felt like two or three feature films, all interconnected by some strange emotional logic. In the third movement, a group of hunter-gatherers was living in a cave that reminded me of the entrance to a nuclear waste facility. A girl hiding behind a tree saw men with cars arrive…The structure of the music was such that it gave me enough predictability and enough surprise to allow my attention to deeply cohere. The melody lines and harmonies dredged up memories and images from my subconscious, weaving them into a rich cinematic web of stories. Guided by the music, my mind could tunnel into an attentional state where I was able to see things I had never seen before and where I could work through some deep emotional pain that seemed to resolve itself through the images.When the music stopped, I barely knew where I was.I opened my eyes and remembered that my brother was sitting next to me.“What did you think?” I said.“I don’t know,” he said. “I felt kind of restless.”Like always, the research for this essay was funded by the contribution of paying subscribers.

If you enjoy the essays and want to support Escaping Flatland, we are not yet fully funded:A special thanks to Johanna Karlsson, Nadia Asparouhova, Packy McCormick, and Esha Rana, who all read and commented on drafts of this essay. The image of the University Hall is by Ann-Sofi Cullhed.If you liked this essay, you might also like:Becoming perceptive·September 10, 2024This is the second part of an essay series that began with “Everything that turned out well in my life followed the same design process.” There is also a third part. It can be read on its own.1In Spanish, you “lend” attention. In Swedish, you “are” attention.2It is not like 30 minutes is some ideal. Attention can, under the right conditions, keep getting deeper and more coherent for much longer, as attested by people who meditate for weeks. Inversely, you can, if you have a well developed dorsal attention network and low cortisol level etc, cohere to a high degree in a few minutes. (Though if you have a lot of stress hormones, thirty minutes will not be nearly enough to get out of a flighty mode of attention.) In other words, I don’t think you can put a precise number at it.Time to coherence depends on your starting place (mood, hormones, chemical make up in the brain), your skill, and the level of coherence you want to pursue. There is a famous study saying it takes people 23 minutes to get to full productivity after an interruption, which seems like it is correlated to the time it takes them to deeply cohere their attentional field. On the other hand, there is also be an upper limit at how long you can cohere, which also depends on a bunch of factors. If I’m working on an essay, I notice that the quality of my thinking drops after about 20 minutes of sustained attention and I need to pause for a few minutes and walk around to get back up to full focus. So in my case, my deepest thinking seem to decohere before I even reach that infamous 23 minute mark! And after 3-4 hours, the quality of my attention goes down so much that everything I write ends up being deleted the day after. For more relaxed attention, like meditation, I haven’t reached the limit for how long I can deepen my coherence—after an hour, which is the longest I’ve gone, I’m still shifting deeper into attention.3Charles Darwin:[During our stay in Porto Praya,] I was much interested, on several occasions, by watching the habits of an Octopus, or cuttle-fish. Although common in the pools of water left by the retiring tide, these animals were not easily caught. By means of their long arms and suckers, they could drag their bodies into very narrow crevices; and when thus fixed, it required great force to remove them. At other times they darted tail first, with the rapidity of an arrow, from one side of the pool to the other, at the same instant discolouring the water with a dark chestnut-brown ink. These animals also escape detection by a very extraordinary, chameleon-like power of changing their colour. They appear to vary their tints according to the nature of the ground over which they pass: when in deep water, their general shade was brownish purple, but when placed on the land, or in shallow water, this dark tint changed into one of a yellowish green.The colour, examined more carefully, was a French grey, with numerous minute spots of bright yellow: the former of these varied in intensity; the latter entirely disappeared and appeared again by turns. These changes were effected in such a manner, that clouds, varying in tint between a hyacinth red and a chestnut-brown, were continually passing over the body. Any part, being subjected to a slight shock of galvanism, became almost black: a similar effect, but in a less degree, was produced by scratching the skin with a needle. These clouds, or blushes as they may be called, are said to be produced by the alternate expansion and contraction of minute vesicles containing variously coloured fluids.This cuttle-fish displayed its chameleon-like power both during the act of swimming and whilst remaining stationary at the bottom. I was much amused by the various arts to escape detection used by one individual, which seemed fully aware that I was watching it. Remaining for a time motionless, it would then stealthily advance an inch or two, like a cat after a mouse; sometimes changing its colour: it thus proceeded, till having gained a deeper part, it darted away, leaving a dusky train of ink to hide the hole into which it had crawled.While looking for marine animals, with my head about two feet above the rocky shore, I was more than once saluted by a jet of water, accompanied by a slight grating noise. At first I could not think what it was, but afterwards I found out that it was this cuttle-fish, which, though concealed in a hole, thus often led me to its discovery. That it possesses the power of ejecting water there is no doubt, and it appeared to me that it could certainly take good aim by directing the tube or siphon on the under side of its body. From the difficulty which these animals have in carrying their heads, they cannot crawl with ease when placed on the ground. I observed that one which I kept in the cabin was slightly phosphorescent in the dark.from:  https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9444Sasha Chapin writes: In late winter 2024, I noticed that I wasn’t living up to my stated policy of trying to accept every emotion passing through my system. There were certain shades of existential loneliness that I was pushing away. This was causing some friction. Solitude is simply part of my current life chapter, since Cate is more independent than any of my previous partners, and Berkeley is a place where I don’t feel at home socially.As a response, I made feelings of solitude the central focus of my practice. I tried to become like a sommelier, going out of my way to appreciate all the shades of loneliness that colored my afternoons, trying to zoom in on every micro-pixel and embrace rather than reject.Again—normal. This is what, for me, long-term practice often consists of: noticing when my reactions don’t line up with my principles, and seeing if I can bring myself into deeper alignment.However, I noticed something odd. Dropping the resistance to loneliness allowed me to slip into deeper sensations of flow. It was almost as if the emotional resistance had been preventing the emergence of a more intuitive part of my will. There were a few memorable walks I took where the feeling of solitude felt like a portal into an exquisitely smooth parallel world. When I allowed my emotions to pierce me more deeply, I fell into a different degree of cooperation with reality. Every step felt precise and necessary, like a choreographed dance.5Michael Nielsen writes about this in an essay where he describes the experience of pushing himself to go deeper than usual in understanding a mathematical proof:I gradually internalize the mathematical objects I’m dealing with [using spaced repetition]. It becomes easier and easier to conduct (most of) my work in my head. [. . .] Furthermore, as my understanding of the objects change – as I learn more about their nature, and correct my own misconceptions – my sense of what I can do with the objects changes as well. It’s as though they sprout new affordances, in the language of user interface design, and I get much practice in learning to fluidly apply those affordances in multiple ways. [. . .]After going through the [time-consuming process of deeply understanding a proof,] I had a rather curious experience. I went for a multi-hour walk along the San Francisco Embarcadero. I found that my mind simply and naturally began discovering other facts related to the result. In particular, I found a handful (perhaps half a dozen) of different proofs of the basic theorem, as well as noticing many related ideas. This wasn’t done especially consciously – rather, my mind simply wanted to find these proofs.6Chris Olah writes: Research intimacy is different from theoretical knowledge. It involves internalizing information that hasn’t become part of the “scientific cannon” yet. Observations we don’t (yet) see as important, or haven’t (yet) digested. The ideas are raw.(A personal example: I’ve memorized hundreds of neurons in InceptionV1. I know how they behave, and I know how that behavior is built from earlier neurons. These seem like obscure facts, but they give me powerful, concrete examples to test ideas against.)Research intimacy is also different from research taste. But it does feed into it, and I suspect it’s one of the key ingredients in beating the “research taste market.”As your intimacy with a research topic grows, your random thoughts about it become more interesting. Your thoughts in the shower or on a hike bounce against richer context. Your unconscious has more to work with. Your intuition deepens.I suspect that a lot of “brilliant insights” are natural next steps from someone who has deep intimacy with a research topic. And that actually seems more profound.No posts]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[It’s a big bet on AI for Atlassian, which makes tools like Jira and Confluence, and a work-focused shift for Dia.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Mike Cannon-Brookes, the CEO of enterprise software giant Atlassian, was one of the first users of the Arc browser. Over the last several years, he has been a prolific bug reporter and feature requester. Now he’ll own the thing: Atlassian is acquiring The Browser Company, the New York-based startup that makes both Arc and the new AI-focused Dia browser. Atlassian is paying $610 million in cash for The Browser Company, and plans to run it as an independent entity.The conversations that led to the deal started about a year ago, says Josh Miller, The Browser Company’s CEO. Lots of Atlassian employees were using Arc, and “they reached out wondering, how could we get more enterprise-ready?” Miller says. Big companies require data privacy, security, and management features in the software they use, and The Browser Company didn’t offer enough of them. Eventually, as companies everywhere raced to put AI at the center of their businesses, and as The Browser Company made its own bets in AI, Cannon-Brookes suggested maybe the companies were better off together.The acquisition is mostly about Dia, which launched in June. Dia is a mix of web browser and chatbot, with a built-in way to chat with your tabs but also do things across apps. Open up three spreadsheets in three tabs and Dia can move data between them; log into your Gmail and Dia can tell you what’s next on the calendar. Anything with a URL immediately becomes data available to Dia and its AI models. For a company like Atlassian, which makes a whole suite of work apps — the popular project-tracker Jira, the note-taking app Confluence, plus Trello, Loom, and more — a way to stitch them all together seems obviously compelling.Miller is clear, even forceful, that Dia is not about to become just a wrapper for Atlassian apps, or shift to thinking primarily about IT managers and enterprise features. Dia is still for individual users. It’s just that now, it’s primarily for individual users at work. Before, Miller says, “we talked a lot about shopping, making reservations, finding showtimes. That is going to go away in terms of our focus.” He says he sees everyone else, from ChatGPT to Claude to Gemini to Replika, competing to be a central new character in your personal life. He’s happy to build a work tool instead.For The Browser Company, the deal is both a big exit and a slightly surprising one. With companies like Anthropic tripling their valuation out of nowhere and practically any startup with a .ai domain name raking in billions in funding, why get out of the race now? It’s easy to look at this deal as The Browser Company waving the white flag, getting out while the getting’s good and before the bigger players fully take over.Not surprisingly, Miller doesn’t see it that way. He offers a couple of reasons to do this deal now, starting with the sheer speed at which this market is moving. “I think the winner of the AI browser space is going to be crowned in the next 12 to 24 months,” he says. For Dia to become truly mainstream, The Browser Company needs huge distribution, a sales organization, and scale it simply doesn’t have and probably can’t get quickly enough. “It didn’t feel like something money could buy, in the time horizon we had,” Miller says. He says this is the way to make sure Dia doesn’t get swallowed by the big names.“I think the winner of the AI browser space is going to be crowned in the next 12 to 24 months”Selling to a company like Atlassian also gives The Browser Company some much-needed stability in an incredibly frothy market. “It reverts us back to a clear focus,” Miller says. He seems very excited to not have to worry about raising more money. The only goal, he says, is to get more active users for Dia, and trust that Atlassian can figure out how to turn that into more revenue for the company.As for what this all means for The Browser Company’s browsers, it’s still too early to say for sure. Miller promises no favored-nation features for Atlassian products, nor any Microsoft Edge-style popups begging you to sign up for Jira. Miller says the team is even more committed to being a truly cross-platform product, and that Windows in particular is about to get a lot more attention. He also says there’s an aggressive roadmap for bringing the best of Arc to Dia, after the company’s pivot angered some of its most dedicated users. Arc’s status hasn’t changed, and will still be maintained but not actively developed. (Reading between the lines, though? I wouldn’t count on Arc being around for too long — there’s just no place for it in this new arrangement.)The Browser Company has been through a lot of changes the last few years, but its biggest idea has both stayed consistent and been largely correct: that the era of siloed apps was coming to an end, and that the browser would be a powerful new way to interact with computers. Almost everyone agrees with this theory, too: Perplexity has a browser, Google is AI-ifying Chrome at a blistering pace, even OpenAI is reportedly close to launching a browser based on ChatGPT. The job in front of Miller now is not to convince the world he’s right, but to make sure he wins. And when you need to win, it really does help to have a sales team.24 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.David Pierce]]></content:encoded>

					Building the AI browser for knowledge workers
					
					
Today, I’m excited to share an exciting step forward for Atlassian. We’ve entered into an agreement to acquire The Browser Company of New York, the team behind the incredible Dia and Arc browsers.



By combining The Browser Company’s passion for building browsers people love with Atlassian’s deep expertise on how the world’s best teams operate, we have the opportunity to transform how work gets done in the AI era.









A Browser for Doing, Not Just Browsing



Today’s browsers weren’t built for work. They were built for browsing – reading the news, watching videos, looking up recipes. And sure, you may do some of those things in your browser during the workday, but most of those tabs represent a task that needs to get done. A meeting to schedule. A design to review. A work item to update in Jira. A memo to write. Before you know it, it’s hard to see through the forest of tabs.







Here’s the rub: your current browser isn’t designed to help you move any of that work forward. It was designed before the explosion of SaaS apps, and well before the current AI revolution. It’s a bystander in your workflow, treating every tab the same, with no awareness of your work context, no understanding of your priorities, and no help connecting the dots between your tools.



It’s time for a browser that’s actually built for work – a browser that helps you do, not just browse.



Making Dia the Knowledge Worker’s Browser



Knowledge workers need a browser designed for their specific needs, not one that’s been built for everyone on the planet. That’s what we will build with The Browser Company. Our vision is to make Dia the browser:




Optimized for the SaaS apps where you spend your day. Whether you’re working in email or a project management tool or a design app, your tabs will be enriched with context that helps move your work forward.









Packed with AI skills and your personal work memory to connect the dots between your apps, tabs, and tasks.









Built with trust and security in mind, so you can bring it to the office. While 85% of enterprise workflows occur within web browsers, less than 10% of organizations have adopted a secure browser. Security, compliance, and admin controls will be baked into every aspect of Dia.




Looking Ahead



We are set to create a browser knowledge workers will love.



Together, we’re sprinting toward this opportunity, leveraging each other’s strengths. I am stoked for the road ahead and can’t wait to see how we will extend Atlassian’s mission – to unleash the potential of every team – to the browser.

            <description><![CDATA[A new technique can reshape your vision without lasers. Learn how electricity might change future eye surgeries.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[A new, promising technique has the potential to replace laser surgeries in ophthalmologists’ offices in the future, for a fraction of the cost. Called electromechanical reshaping (EMR), the technique offers a gentler approach to correcting the cornea than Laser-Assisted in Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK), today’s gold standard for treating vision issues including nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism.The eye develops these and other conditions when the cornea’s curvature is off—too steep, too flat, or too uneven. To solve the problem, surgeons generally use laser techniques such as LASIK to “sculpt” the eye surface by cutting away small parts of corneal tissue. The results can be life-changing, but the procedure has its risks, as LASIK permanently reduces corneal strength, raising the risk of new vision problems.Alternative nonsurgical methods such as specially designed contact lenses can temporarily mold the cornea, but these require nightly wear and can cause infection. Now, engineers and eye doctors are trying to find a way to permanently reshape collagen-rich tissues like the cornea without cutting, burning, or removing material.Brian Wong, a surgeon-engineer at the University of California, Irvine, stumbled upon a possible solution about a decade ago. He had long worked with thermal techniques for reshaping cartilage tissues—which include the cornea—but found a puzzling “Goldilocks problem” during his research: The heating needed to change shapes often killed too many tissue cells. Then a “happy accident” opened a different perspective, he says. “My postdoctoral fellow connected a pair of electrodes and a Coke can to a power supply…and out of spite, fried a piece of cartilage,” Wong recalls. The cartilage began to bubble, which the postdoc thought was from heat. “But it wasn’t hot. We touched it and thought, this is getting a shape change. This must be electrolysis,” he says. That surprise pointed to electrochemistry rather than heat as the mechanism. To explore further, Wong partnered with Michael Hill, a chemist at Occidental College. Together, they began exploring the chemistry behind EMR and testing it in different tissues. In mid-August, they presented results from their most recent tests at the American Chemical Society’s fall meeting that took place in Washington, D.C. How Electricity Reshapes TissueEMR uses small electrical pulses to split water at the tissue surface into hydrogen and oxygen, releasing protons that spread into the part of the corneal tissue that gives it structural integrity, the ability to hydrate, and other mechanical properties. Once protons are spread throughout the cornea’s surface, they disrupt the chemical bonds that hold collagen fibers in place, also changing the corneal tissue’s pH. This, Wong explains, is the moment when the cornea becomes moldable. Once shaped with a metal contact lens–like mold, it “locks in” to the new shape as the electric pulses are turned off and the body’s natural physiological response returns the cornea’s pH back to its normal value. In 2023, Wong and Hill coauthored a proof-of-concept paper in ACS Biomaterials Science & Engineering, showing that EMR could reshape rabbit corneas without compromising transparency. “That paper was really about asking, is it even possible? Can we change the shape of a cornea without gross damage?” Hill says. “Now, after two more years of work, we’ve systematically gone through the parameters—and we can say yes, it is possible, and we can do it safely,” he adds.Their team built custom platinum contact lenses, press-molded to precise curvatures, and connected them to electrodes. Mounted onto rabbit eyes immersed in a saline solution, the electrodes delivered pulses of around 1.5 volts. X-ray imaging tests confirmed the corneas had indeed matched the mold’s shape. Microscopy tests also confirmed the collagen tissue remained organized post-surgery. “Fine control is the key,” Wong observes. The cost of procedures using the new technique can be significantly lower than laser eye surgery, according to Wong. That’s because, unlike LASIK, EMR doesn’t rely on “laser platforms that cost as much as luxury cars.” The new technique could also be more affordable for clinics and regions priced out of LASIK. While the technique has a long way to go before being used in eye surgeries, the research is advancing to in-vivo animal tests to prove safety and durability—and for long-term tracking to ensure the results last. “Nobody’s getting this at the optometrist next year,” Hill cautions. “Now comes the hard work—refining parameters, confirming long-term viability, and making sure treated eyes don’t revert back,” he adds.That hard work, Hill adds, depends a lot on funding for basic science. EMR was born not from a targeted medical-device program but from curiosity-driven experiments in electrochemistry. “You don’t always know where basic research will lead,” Hill says. “We were looking at electroanalytical chemistry, not eye surgery. But those foundational insights are what made this possible. If you cut off that basic research, you don’t get these kinds of unexpected, transformative opportunities,” he adds.]]></content:encoded>

Release notes

Better transaction balancing, include improvements, auto posting account interpolation, csv data commands, import archiving, timeclock improvements, fixes
hledger 1.50
Breaking changes


Transaction balancing is now done in a more robust way, using local precisions only (like Ledger) #2402.
Until now, a transaction was required to balance using its commodities's global display precisions.
Small imbalances were tolerated by configuring display precisions for the whole journal (with commodity directives).
Now, a transaction is required to balance using the precisions in its journal entry only.
This means each entry can use the precision it needs, and balancing precision and display precision are independent.
(So eg, increasing the display precision with -c no longer breaks the journal.)
In practice this requires journal entries to be more accurate, and you will probably need to fix some old entries.
There are three main ways to fix an entry:

reduce the amounts' precision (use fewer decimal digits, so a lower balancing precision is inferred)
make the amounts more accurate (use better decimal digits, so the amounts sum to zero more closely)
or (easiest) add an amountless "expenses:rounding" posting (this is not a cheat, it's a more accurate record of what your bank/broker is doing).

You can also keep the old transaction-balancing behaviour with --txn-balancing=old, for now.
But updating your entries is recommended.
The old behaviour could allow small remainders to accumulate over time,
in accounts that often have an inexact posting amount or cost amount and are never reconciled -
typically equity, revenues, and expenses.
You can check for this in your old journals with a command like
hledger bal cur:\\$ -c '$1.000000000000' | grep -E '\...0*[1-9]'

(show $ account balances, with many decimals, which have a non-zero decimal in the 3rd place or beyond)


Timeclock format has had various changes:

Timeclock syntax and parsing is now more robust (when not using --old-timeclock):

Semicolon always starts a comment (and timeclock account names may not include semicolons).
Trailing spaces are ignored.
Clock-ins now require an account name.
Clock-outs now can have a comment and tags.
Timeclock entries are processed in parse order.


Some order-related bugs in 1.43 have been fixed.
Concurrent/overlapping sessions are now fully supported, even if they have the same account name.
The timeclock doc has been rewritten.
The --old-timeclock hidden flag has been renamed, documented, and now also affects included files.
#2141, #2365, #2400, #2417



Some edge cases in balance report behaviour were changed for internal consistency:

--declared now treats parent accounts consistently.
--flat --empty now ensures that implied accounts with no postings are not displayed,
but accounts with zero balance and actual postings are.
(Stephen Morgan, #2360, #2395)



hledger now requires at least GHC 9.6 (and base 4.18), to ease maintenance.


Fixes


Paging long output no longer gives an error when LESS is undefined and
less does not have mouse support (as on some FreeBSD systems).


The all: query now requires at least one posting to match.
(Previously, matching no postings at all was also considered a success.)


When using journal format's include directive, several kinds of
error (read failure, cyclic include..) could show an off-by-one line
number or excerpt, confusingly. This has been fixed.
Also, attempting to include a rules file now gives a better error message.


In CSV if rules, match group references like \1 no longer get confused
by differing case.
(Jay Neubrand, #2419)


add, commodities, and diff now support the --conf and -n/--no-conf flags,
like other commands.
#2446


On Windows machines, the add command now properly shows green prompts instead of ANSI codes.
#2410


Balance reports now properly show the historical balance even when the report period is empty.
#2403


Balance reports' csv output, and the balance --budget report, now respect the --summary-only flag.
(Stephen Morgan, #2411, #2443)


The demo command no longer mentions -- ASCIINEMAOPTS in help (that longer works).
Also it shows a better error message when asciinema is not installed.


hledger help -m TOPIC or hledger help -i TOPIC now show the help for TOPIC, as intended.
#2399


Since hledger 1.32.1, the import command, when importing multiple files at once,
would write an empty .latest file for data files with no new transactions
(causing all transactions in those data files to appear new on next import).
This is now fixed.
#2444


Features


CSV rules files can now run a shell command to clean the data:
# read the latest foo*.csv file, and replace "USD" with "$"
source foo*.csv | sed -e 's/USD/$/g'

or to generate the data:
# fetch JSON from simplefin.org, then transform it to CSV
source | simplefinjson | simplefincsv

Whenever hledger runs one of these commands, it will echo the command on stderr.


The import command can now automatically archive imported CSV data files,
saving a dated copy in a data/ directory. This can be useful for troubleshooting,
or for regenerating entries later with improved rules.
To enable it, add archive to the rules file.
This and the previous feature can simplify file management and reduce the need for support scripts.


Improvements


In command line help, flag group headings have been simplified.
And the help for -f/--file, add, and import is now clearer.


When given both an unknown command and an unknown flag, hledger now gives
a clearer error message (about the command, not the flag).
#2388


A long standing awkwardness with addon commands has been solved:
you can now use addon options freely in a hledger command line;
you don't need to write a -- argument first.
#458


In smart dates and period expressions, quarter syntax like 2025q1 or Q2 is now fully supported.


In end-value reports where the end date is unspecified, market prices
in the future can no longer influence the report end date and valuation date.
(Market prices on or before today, still can.)
#2445


A tag: query with the accounts command now only matches account tags, not posting tags.
Eg, hledger accounts tag:t now lists only account a from this journal:
account a  ; t:

2025-01-01
    a          1
    b         -1  ; t:



Journal format's include directive now has more robust and convenient glob patterns:

** can match both directories and filenames
** now automatically ignores anything under dotted directories, like .git/, foo/.secret/, etc.
(If you do want it to search dotted directories,
you can use the --old-glob flag for now to restore the old behaviour. See also Glob#49.)
Glob patterns with wildcards now automatically exclude the current file.
Eg include **.journal will include all other .journal files in this directory and below.



include's error messages and debug messages have been improved.
Eg, the including file paths are also shown.


Journal format's auto posting rules can now use %account to insert the account name
from the matched posting.
(Stephen Morgan, #1975, #2412)


The aregister command no longer abbreviates account names
when producing csv, html, or fods output.
(savanto, #1995, #2416)


The commodities, payees and tags commands now have --used/--declared/--undeclared/--unused flags, like accounts.
And there has been a general cleanup of options and help across these four commands.


The import command now shows info messages on stderr, not stdout.
Its "no new transactions" output is more compact, showing file names not file paths.
And it no longer prints an extra newline.


The setup command's output has been improved.
Lack of a pager is now reported as info, not warning (there's no default pager on Windows).
Shell completions are ignored for now.

check "Show extracted files when complete"
click Extract, wait for the destination folder to open
find the hledger, hledger-web icons (if you extracted to \Windows, you'll need to scroll down)
for each icon: double-click, uncheck "Always ask before opening this file", click Run
close those Explorer windows
open a command window (press Windows-r, type CMD, press enter)
hledger --version; hledger-ui --version; hledger-web --version    should show 1.50
echo # >> .hledger.journal to ensure a default journal file exists. (Important: the doubled >> is needed to avoid overwriting existing data.)

Problems:

Starting hledger by double-clicking its icon won't work because it needs arguments; run it from the command window instead.
Starting hledger-web by double-clicking its icon may fail eg because Explorer's command window is too small;
configure that to be larger, or run hledger-web from a command window instead.
hledger or hledger-web may fail to run if there is not enough memory available.


Next steps
Once installed, run hledger, and perhaps read hledger.org: Quick start.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[La Gare Saint-Lazare, arrivée d'un train, by Claude Monet (1877)My favorite color has changed throughout my life, cycling through the entire spectrum of visible light and beyond. I don’t remember when blue was the chosen one, exactly; maybe when I was 13 or so. After that, yellow, purple, orange, green, and pink occupied the top spot for various periods. Blue never made a comeback. I saw it as a banal, common color. After all, the sky is made of it, and the sky is everywhere. Then I realized when compiling the tech tree that blue is the most fascinating color, because it is the hardest of the common colors to create artificially.1 You can’t just take a piece of the sky and put it into a painting. And blue pigments are fairly rare in minerals, plants, and animals. So blue had to be invented, time and time again, from 4000 BC to the 21st century. It is the most technological color, and I’m willing to claim that this is why it is usually, in science fiction and elsewhere, used to represent the future.The story of blue starts with indigo. It is an organic dye made from plants in the Indigofera genus, which grow throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The first known traces of indigo dye come from the New World, in ancient Peru, 6,000 years ago, using Indigofera suffruticosa, or anil.2 In the Old World, it was known from Africa to East Asia, but became particularly associated with India (hence indi-go), where Indigofera tinctoria was domesticated. Indigo soon became a luxury, traded from India to Greco-Roman and then medieval Europe, where the same blue dye could only be made from a less productive plant, woad or Isatis tinctoria. Eventually the “blue gold” became an important colonial crop in the Caribbean and was part of the story of slavery, next to sugar, tobacco, and cotton. A bucket  of indigo in China (source)Before indigo was a thing in the Old World (that started circa 2400 BC), the Egyptians had already become obsessed with the color blue. Besides the sky, it was available in the form of semiprecious stones like turquoise and lapis lazuli, cobalt oxide (more on that later), as well as the mineral azurite, which they mined in Sinai and the Eastern Desert.Azurite geode from Sweden (source)Azurite would later enjoy a fruitful career as the main blue pigment in European painting, but to the Egyptians it was costly, and besides it isn’t the most stable blue color: it degrades and fades when in contact with air. And so they created the first synthetic pigment in history: Egyptian blue. The oldest evidence of it is in a bowl dated to 3250 BC. Egyptian blue is a calcium copper silicate with formula CaCuSi4O10 or CaOCuO(SiO2)4. Its method of manufacturing, in a rare example of lost technology, was forgotten towards the end of antiquity, but has been plausibly reconstructed. It likely involved heating together quartz sand (silica) and some source of copper (either copper ores or scraps from the bronze industry), together with an alkali (like natron) and a calcium oxide (unintentionally added as impurities in the other materials).  Various Egyptian blue objects from the British Museum (source)In another cradle of civilization, a very similar story unfolded from about 800 BC. So similar, in fact, that it has been speculated that knowledge of Egyptian blue spread along the early silk road, all the way to China, where Han blue (together with Han purple) makes an appearance during the Zhou dynasty. Han blue has almost the same chemical formula as Egyptian blue, but replaces calcium with barium: BaCuSi4O10. It may also have been an independent invention, perhaps the work of Taoist alchemists and glassmakers. Its use declined after the Han dynasty, and few examples survive.Almost the only example of Han blue and purple found on the internet, from a Han dynasty tomb in Luoyang (source)Much later, China would become famous for another application of blue: the “blue and white” porcelain style. The blue here comes from cobalt oxide, which had colored Egyptian faience since at least 1500 BC, though nobody at the time knew what cobalt was. You could make cobalt blue in the form of glass and then grind it into a pigment called smalt. Despite porcelain originating in China, it seems that the use of smalt for the blue and white style began in Iraq. It spread from the Middle East to China, and then from China to the rest of the world including Europe, would eventually allow Swedish chemist Georg Brandt to identify cobalt as an element in 1735, the first time a new metal was discovered since antiquity.3 Vase from the Ming dynasty, between 1403 and 1424 (source)Meanwhile, in the New World, the local indigo dye was being combined with a clay called palygorskite to create what became known as Maya blue, which was the main blue pigment in Mesoamerican art from about 800, and was still used as late as the 19th century, though it, too, was forgotten about for a while.Mural from Bonampak in what is now Chiapas, Mexico (source)But none of the pigments mentioned so far, not azurite, not cobalt blue, not Egyptian blue, could rival with the purest and deepest of blues, the one that came from grinding the rare lapis lazuli stone into a powder. Lapis lazuli had been extracted from mines in what is now Afghanistan since ancient times, but began being used for paint around the 5th to 7th centuries, for use in Zoroastrian and Buddhist religious art. This pigment became known to medieval and Renaissance Europeans as ultramarine, meaning “beyond the sea,” since it had to be imported at great cost from central Asia (which, to the Venetian merchants who mostly controlled this trade, was beyond the Mediterranean sea, I suppose). Nobody has written about this more eloquently than Scott Alexander:Here is the process for getting ultramarine. First, go to Afghanistan. Keep in mind, you start in England or France or wherever. Afghanistan is four thousand miles away. Your path takes you through tall mountains, burning deserts, and several dozen Muslim countries that are still pissed about the whole Crusades thing. Still alive? Climb 7,000 feet through the mountains of Kuran Wa Munjan until you reach the mines of Sar-i-Sang. There, in a freezing desert, the wretched of the earth work themselves to an early grave breaking apart the rocks of Badakhshan to mine a few hundred kilograms per year of blue stone - the only lapis lazuli production in the known world.Buy the stone and retrace your path through the burning deserts and vengeful Muslims until you’re back in England or France or wherever. Still alive? That was the easy part. Now you need to go through a chemical extraction process that makes the Philosopher's Stone look like freshman chem lab. “The lengthy process of pulverization, sifting, and washing to produce ultramarine makes the natural pigment … roughly ten times more expensive than the stone it came from.”Finally you have ultramarine! How much? I can’t find good numbers, but Claude estimates that the ultramarine production of all of medieval Europe was around the order of 30 kg per year - not enough to paint a medium-sized wall. Ultramarine had to be saved for ultra-high-value applications.In practice, the medievals converged on a single use case - painting the Virgin Mary’s coat.The Virgin in Prayer by Giovanni Battista Salvi da Sassoferrato (c. 1654)By the beginning of the 18th century, Egyptian blue had been long forgotten, and painters in Europe relied on indigo, smalt, azurite, and when they could get their hands on it, ultramarine. But this was the modern, enlightened era of European science. Great things were to come.It began with a chance discovery. In Berlin around 1706, a paintmaker, Johann Jacob Diesbach, was trying to prepare red dye from cochineal.4 The details of the story are not totally ascertained, but it seems that his intended mix of cochineal insects, ferric sulfate, and potash had been tainted by another substance, perhaps bone oil from the alchemist Johann Konrad Dippel. The result was a deep blue pigment, soon to be known as Prussian blue, since Berlin was the capital of Prussia. It immediately found its niche in the art market: a deep blue, like ultramarine, but which unlike ultramarine didn’t cost more than literal gold. Within a couple of years, painters were already depicting the Virgin Mary’s robes with Prussian blue.Entombment of Christ, by Pieter van der Werff (1709). The first known painting to use Prussian blueThus Prussian blue became the first modern synthetic pigment. It spread far and wide, even to isolationist Japan. Large quantities of Prussian blue began entering the country around 1829, through the single trading post the Japanese allowed with Westerners, at Dejima, and very soon after, revolutionized the woodblock printing art of ukiyo-e. As early as 1831, one of the most famous works in art history was created with abundant Prussian blue. The author, plagiarizing Hokusai with some blue ben that probably doesn’t contain Prussian bluePrussian blue is also the blue of blueprints, created with the cyanotype process, one of the first ways to make many copies of a document. The blueprint was invented in 1842 by John Herschel and became the standard for engineering drawings; it was also used abundantly to duplicate photographs. Though it has become obsolete (replaced by whiteprint and then xerography, the currently dominant photocopying technique), it survives as the word to describe any technical, detailed plan.Blueprint for a whaling boat, 1911 (source)Prussian blue was only the first of a series of synthetic blue pigments that span the history of industrial civilization. In 1789, cerulean appears, the creation of Albrecht Höpfner in Switzerland. It is another compound of cobalt, but combined with tin: a cobalt stannate (Co2SnO4). It would become available to artists in paint form only in the middle of the 19th century.Around the same period, in 1799 or 1802 (sources differ), the French chemist Louis Jacques Thénard reinvented cobalt blue. It was a commission from another chemist, Jean-Antoine Chaptal, who happened to be a minister in the government of the First French Republic. Thénard investigated the pigments at the Sèvres porcelain factory, but used a different method than the originators of smalt pigments in Egypt, Iraq, or China, using aluminium (formula: CoAl2O4). By the middle of the 19th century, the leader in the production of cobalt aluminate was Blaafarveværket, a large industrial enterprise in Norway.In this golden age of blue pigment synthesis, would it be possible to create even synthetic ultramarine? Goethe, already, had noticed the blue deposits on lime kilns when visiting Sicily in 1787. The locals used it for decoration as if it were lapis lazuli. The same phenomenon was observed in limeworks in France in the 1810s, and in 1824, the Société d’encouragement pour l’industrie nationale — a government organization dedicated to further French industry in response to the industrial revolution in Britain, and led by the aforementioned Jean-Antoine Chaptal — announced a prize of 6,000 francs to anyone who could make ultramarine for much cheaper than the price of lapis lazuli. In 1826, Jean-Baptiste Guimet succeeded in Lyon. He won the prize and established a thriving business, though he kept his methods secret and, as a result, forever has to share credit with Christian Gmelin in Tübingen, who did publish the process. It involves heating up clay, sodium hydroxide, and coal together.5 Like many painters of the second half of the 19th century (including Monet), Berthe Morisot uses all three of cerulean, cobalt blue, and synthetic ultramarine in Summer's Day (1879)Artists and decorators now had their main blue pigments. Soon, industry and science would extend the use of blue to other domains. In 1897, it became practical to prepare artificial indigo in industrial quantities, eventually replacing all use of the plant. Today 80,000 tonnes are produced per year, mostly for the purpose of dying textiles, primarily denim.Around the turn of the 20th century, artificial food colorings became widespread, derived primarily from coal tar. One of them would become known as brilliant blue FCF or Blue No. 1. Together with Blue No. 2, which is made from indigo, it is one of the two main blue colorings, and has a strong association with the familiar-yet-mysterious blue raspberry flavor.The 1920s saw the introduction of another synthetic pigment, phthalo blue (also known as copper phthalocyanine), perhaps in a way harking back to the copper-derived compounds of ancient Egypt. It has grown to be most widely produced blue. Though the discovery of new pigments is a rare occurrence, it still happens. In 2009, a serendipitous discovery at the Oregon State University led to YInMn Blue, so named because it contains yttrium, indium, and manganese, and pronounced “yinmin.” It is a near-perfect blue that furthermore avoids the toxicity and environmental problems of the pre-existing pigments. I have this half-baked theory that science fiction is associated with blue because of blue LEDs. Consider this chart, which I wrote about in an old post: Dominant color of computer interfaces as shown in science fiction movies from selected years between 1968 and 2011 (source). The analysis ultimately comes from Chris Noessel and Nathan Shedroff’s book Make It So: Interaction Design Lessons From Science Fiction. Noessel has a long-running blog about sci fi interfaces.Examples of fictional sci fi user interfaces, from the same sourceThere are a number of competing hypotheses for why science fiction movie directors and video game designers overwhelmingly choose blue as the color of fictional user interfaces. They include:Accidental reasons from filmmaking considerations (from Mark Coleran):Using simple interfaces with primary RGB colors on black looks better in film than ordinary liquid-crystal screens, so most UIs in video media is either red, green, or blue Red is associated with weapons, and green with vintage electronics (which commonly used green-phosphor monochrome monitors), leaving blue as the generic and/or futuristic choice Blue is easier to color-correct: a lot of filmed material tends to look blue before color correction, but you don’t need this when the image is supposed to be blue Cultural associations:Blue fits well with science fiction thanks to associations like coldness, knowledge, otherworldliness, and creative transcendence (found in some academic paper in Korean thanks to Elicit)Something something near-far Robin Hanson something something6Blue is rare in nature except the for sea and sky, so “there’s something fundamentally mystical, unnatural, and inhuman about it” (from Noessel, cited in ‘Future Screens are Mostly Blue’)Most science fiction creators simply copy the tropes of existing science fiction, so they choose blue because it already is the “science fiction color.” (And picking something else is likely to be interpreted as an intentional deviation for a specific purpose.)I’d guess that the actual, immediate reason for most blue in science fiction is the last one. Unless creators make a conscious artistic choice to deviate, they tend to copy what’s typical and expected in their chosen genre. Yet those norms and expectations have to come from somewhere. It’s possible that the items in the first part of the list, about decisions having to do with the techniques of filmmaking rather than with the artistic meaning of blue, are the actual cause for some early shows that snowballed into the ubiquity of blue interfaces today, but that seems a bit like post-hoc justification to me unless we can find evidence of those decisions being made. So it’s probably cultural associations, but most of them also just kick the can further. Overall I suppose I somewhat agree with Noessel: it may well come down to the difficulty in finding blue in nature. Or finding it in technology, considering the history of blue pigments that we just went over.And not just pigments. There is another realm in which blue has proven incredibly difficult to produce: light. In fact we found the solution so recently that it is why, I speculate, the future is still strongly associated with blue. The story of how we produce light is a fun one, spanning all of our technological history and involving dozens of solutions, from prehistoric oil lamps to candles to coal gas to cold-cathode tubes. But most of those solutions have produced light somewhere between white and the reddish yellow of flames or black-body radiation. If you wanted blue light, you could make a bulb out of blue glass (with cobalt!) and put an incandescent filament in it. This worked okay, but blue light bulbs did tend to be less satisfying than the other colors, or at least that’s what I remember from Christmas lights when I was a kid.7 There were other strategies for blue lights: construct a tube like the familiar red-glowing neon ones, and put mercury vapor in it. Low-brightness phosphors for RGB screens. Greenish-blue vacuum fluorescent displays. So, blue light was not an unsolved problem. But it wasn’t as conclusively solved as light in the other spectral colors. In the 1960s, light-emitting diodes started becoming practical. LEDs are the most efficient way of creating light by far, but the properties of the materials they are made of — semiconductors that emit light when traversed with an electrical current — make it much easier to generate radiation in the less energetic part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Thus the first practical LED emitted infrared light, by Texas Instruments in 1962. Later that same year, the first visible-light LED was made at General Electric, in red. Displays made of red LEDs soon became widespread in electronic devices (replacing Nixie tubes, also reddish) after some further advances by Hewlett-Packard circa 1968.For a while, the future was red. Now something like this display seems rather vintage (image source)Humanity then gradually conquered the rest of the visible light spectrum, with orange, yellow, and green LEDs being developed in the 1970s. But blue remained elusive. A practical, bright blue LED would not be made, despite much research being poured into it by electronics companies around the world, until a breakthrough by Shuji Nakamura in Japan in 1993. This completed the color spectrum and enabled us to create white LEDs, which are now quickly replacing nearly every lighting technology since they cost so little and are so customizable. We can say we have essentially “solved” lighting. Blue LEDs also enabled the first blue lasers in the mid-1990s.This is a very recent development! For a very long time, blue would have been the color that only “future tech” could create. Then, for a brief period, it would have been the color of cutting-edge tech. Now, 30 years later, the tech exists and is widespread, but we still have the memory of that time. And furthermore no other color can take its place as the inaccessible one; we’ve conquered the entire spectrum.8Sometimes people post pictures of Chinese cities at night (this is Shenzhen) to show how futuristic they look, especially compared to Western cities. But really it all comes down to adding blue LED strips all over the place! (image source)Does the futuristic quality of blue really come from LEDs? Maybe, maybe not. I’m not sure there’s a direct causal link. But given the full history of blue pigments, I wouldn’t be surprised to find some truth in this speculative scenario: that there were just enough innovations in blue, a steady trickle of serendipitous discoveries and long-term research efforts to produce better versions of it, to keep it in the mind of humans as the color of the artificial and the cutting-edge. If you wore indigo-dyed clothes in ancient India, you were one step more removed from nature than the person who wore plain cotton. If you used blue pottery in Egypt or Iraq or China, you were clearly cooler than the people who used plain terracotta. If you hired an engineer or architect at the peak of the Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century, they’d be way more efficient at their job if they duplicated their drawings with Prussian blue instead of copying them by hand. And if you want to make your city a herald of the high-tech future, you decorate everything with programmable blue LEDs. No other color would do.La Gare Saint-Lazare, by Claude Monet (1877)This post was written as part of the Roots of Progress Institute’s Blog-Building Intensive, and I thank the fellows who provided feedback: Allison Lehman, Kelly Vedi.1One could say the same about purple, which has its own history of being a super expensive pigment, Tyrian purple, and holds the distinction of being one of the first synthetic dyes, mauveine. But purple is less common and important than blue. Besides, it doesn’t really exist.While we’re here, let’s note that Tyrian purple, made from sea snails, may be related to a blue dye of great significance in Jewish culture, tekhelet. It has been speculated that tekhelet comes from Hexaplex trunculus snails. I didn’t mention it in the main text because its origin is uncertain.2From which we derive the word aniline, a common industrial chemical that is nowadays used to make indigo and various other dyes.3Fun fact: cobalt is named after kobolds, mischievous spirits from German folklore, because miners in Germany would attribute to them the unusual properties of the ore containing the metal. 4As an aside, the history of cochineal dye, made from insects grown on cactus according to secret ancestral techniques of the Zapotec people, and the second-highest valued export from New Spain after silver, is fascinating in its own right. By the way it’s still used as food coloring, so if you eat artificially red foods, you probably eat insects. 5Synthetic ultramarine is also (in)famous for being the main component (together with a resin) of International Klein Blue, the creation of artist Yves Klein, who painted large monochrome paintings with it.6Specifically posts like ‘Is Blue Far?’ and ‘Near Far in Science Fiction’. Blue might be associated with “far” in terms of construal level theory and likewise for science fiction, which makes an association natural. I thought this was a mind blowing point when I first encountered it some years ago but now it seems rather unconvincing, which is why I’m relegating it to a footnote.7I think it’s because the filaments glow yellow, and a lot of the light is filtered by the blue glass, leaving dim light bulbs. But also the blue glass tended to become discolored, and then you’d just get a plain white bulb.8There can’t be a purple LED since purple isn’t a spectral color, with the exception of violet. And violet LEDs appeared about the same time as the blue ones. There is active development of ultraviolet LED, especially for disinfecting lamps, but of course we won’t be able to see them.I suppose one intriguing possibility would be if we were to invent new colors altogether, by modifying the biology of color perception. Then maybe the color of the future would become octarine or something.No posts]]></content:encoded>

Which Services Were Impacted?
The outage did not seem to be universal for all Google services, but the affected apps were critical to many:

YouTube: Users experienced an inability to load videos, with many seeing error messages or an endless loading loop. Both the website and mobile app were affected.
Google Maps: The service was failing to load map data, search for locations, or calculate routes, leaving travellers and commuters without navigation assistance.
Google Search: In a particularly impactful failure, the core Google Search engine was returning error messages or failing to complete searches for a significant number of users.
Gmail: Some users were reporting issues with sending and receiving emails, though this appeared to be less consistent than the other outages.
Google Drive: Access to cloud-stored documents and files was also disrupted for many.

The common thread among error messages was a "5xx server error" – a type of error that indicates a problem on Google's end, not with the user's individual internet connection.

Alternatively, users can use other search engines such as Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, and Brave Search.
This is a developing story. We will update this article with more information as it becomes available, including an official response from Google.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
  
  
    Melvyn’s passion for the arts, his intellectual curiosity, and his unwavering commitment to public service broadcasting over the last 60-plus years have enriched the lives of millions. Through In Our Time on Radio 4 he has brought depth, insight, and humanity to our airwaves every single week for more than a quarter of a century. 
    
  
Having presented well over 1,000 episodes of the much-loved BBC Radio 4 series, Melvyn Bragg has made the decision to step down from In Our Time following the series which aired earlier this year. Melvyn has presented every episode of In Our Time since the series first launched in 1998.
In Our Time is regularly one of the BBC’s most listened to on-demand programmes around the world, its appeal spanning generations. It is one of BBC Sounds' most popular podcasts amongst under 35s.
Over the last quarter of a century, Melvyn has skilfully led conversations about everything from the age of the Universe to ‘Zenobia’, Queen of the Palmyrene Empire. He has welcomed the company of the brightest and best academics in their fields, sharing their passion and knowledge with a fascinated audience right around the globe.
While he will be much missed on In Our Time, Melvyn will continue to be a friend of Radio 4 with more to come to celebrate his extraordinary career, and a new series in 2026 (details to be announced soon).
Melvyn Bragg says: "For a programme with a wholly misleading title which started from scratch with a six-month contract, it's been quite a ride! I have worked with many extremely talented and helpful people inside the BBC as well as some of the greatest academics around the world. It's been a great privilege and pleasure. I much look forward to continuing to work for the BBC on Radio 4. Thank you for listening."
Melvyn first joined the BBC in 1961 as a general trainee. His BBC career has spanned the World Service, a ten-year stint presenting Radio 4's Start the Week from 1988 - 1998 as well as numerous arts and culture programmes. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society and of The British Academy and was given a Peerage in 1998 and a Companion of Honour in 2017. Melvyn will continue to work with the BBC on future projects which are yet to be announced.
Tim Davie, BBC Director General, says: “Melvyn’s passion for the arts, his intellectual curiosity, and his unwavering commitment to public service broadcasting over the last 60-plus years have enriched the lives of millions. Through In Our Time on Radio 4 he has brought depth, insight, and humanity to our airwaves every single week for more than a quarter of a century. He leaves behind not just an extraordinary body of work, but a gold standard of broadcasting and interviewing excellence that will inspire generations to come.”
Mohit Bakaya, Director of Speech and Controller of BBC Radio 4 says: "Melvyn has been part of the heartbeat of Radio 4 for over three decades. His fierce intellect, coupled with a wonderful curiosity and extraordinary passion for knowledge marks him out as one of the broadcasting greats. Though we will miss him on In Our Time, he leaves behind a unique legacy: the treasure trove of over 1,000 archive episodes, which are a wonderful resource for all those with a love of learning. I look forward to working with him on new projects for Radio 4.”
To mark the end of an era, later this year Radio 4 will be airing some of Melvyn’s most cherished episodes and there will also be a curated selection on BBC Sounds chosen by some of In Our Time's most notable fans.
In Our Time will be back on Radio 4 with a new presenter who will be announced in due course.
Biography
Melvyn Bragg was born in Wigton, Cumbria in 1939. He went to the local Grammar School and then to Wadham College, Oxford. He joined the BBC in 1961, and published his first novel For Want of a Nail in 1965. By that time he had become a Director on Huw Wheldon’s Arts programme Monitor. He worked with Ken Russell on The Debussy Film and again on The Music Lovers starring Glenda Jackson, and Isadora starring Vanessa Redgrave; he wrote the screenplay for Jesus Christ Superstar and for Play Dirty starring Michael Caine.

We often live near people of the same race and class. The education system funnels us into the same schools and similar jobs. Online algorithms group us with like-minded people. These relationships are called “bonding” social capital—a term popularized by Robert Putnam in his landmark 2000 book, Bowling Alone. 
But Putnam also pointed out that what we’re missing is “bridging” social capital—relationships with people unlike us. Most of our friends are of the same race and class as we are. We have the same political views as most of our friends. And the number of people who say they trust others has been decreasing for generations:

In 2014 study, researchers conducted a series of experiments on Illinois trains and buses. 
Some commuters were told to keep to themselves during their trip; these participants predicted the isolation would give them a positive experience. 
Other commuters were told to talk to strangers; these participants predicted they would have a negative experience. They assumed strangers wouldn’t want to talk to them, that strangers wouldn’t like them, and that they would have trouble maintaining a conversation. 
After all, what if the person you approach gets angry? What if they accuse you of harassing them? What if they just think you’re weird? 8m 11s8m 12s8m 13s8m 14s8m 15s8m 16s8m 17s8m 18s8m 19s8m 20s8m 21s8m 22s8m 23s8m 24s8m 25s8m 26s8m 27s8m 28s8m 29s8m 30s Hank, 38, held a beer and vaped during this conversation.

Paige, 28, said she used to work at a senior living facility and that people didn’t care enough about Covid-19 because it mostly kills old people.

What these participants reported back was almost no rejections, pleasant conversations, and an overall positive experience.
This phenomenon has been replicated in several experiments. Whether it’s interacting with strangers in a scavenger hunt, meeting new people in a college dorm, or chatting up a barista, researchers have repeatedly found that people don’t think they’ll enjoy interacting with strangers. 
But after the interaction, participants tend to say it was a positive experience.
Early in the pandemic, the activity people missed most were things like going to restaurants, the gym, church, and the barbershop—places where we’re around strangers and acquaintances, or “weak ties.” We normally have between 11 and 16 interactions with weak ties each day, but devoid of these spontaneous opportunities, only 15% of Americans said they made a new acquaintance during the pandemic. 19m 31s19m 32s19m 33s19m 34s19m 35s19m 36s19m 37s19m 38s19m 39s19m 40s19m 41s19m 42s19m 43s19m 44s19m 45s19m 46s19m 47s19m 48s19m 49s19m 50s I watched the entirety of many conversations.

Several conversations were derailed by a comment that turned off the other person, and caused the conversation to grind to a halt.
But those interactions were rare. In most conversations, people enjoyed hearing about their partner’s life and sharing their own lives—even when they had very little in common. 21m 51s21m 52s21m 53s21m 54s21m 55s21m 56s21m 57s21m 58s21m 59s22m 0s22m 1s22m 2s22m 3s22m 4s22m 5s22m 6s22m 7s22m 8s22m 9s22m 10s22m 11s22m 12s22m 13s22m 14s22m 15s22m 16s22m 17s22m 18s22m 19s22m 20s22m 21s22m 22s22m 23s22m 24s22m 25s22m 26s22m 27s22m 28s22m 29s22m 30s22m 31s22m 32s22m 33s22m 34s22m 35s22m 36s22m 37s22m 38s22m 39s22m 40s22m 41s22m 42s22m 43s22m 44s22m 45s22m 46s22m 47s22m 48s22m 49s22m 50s22m 51s22m 52s22m 53s22m 54s22m 55s22m 56s22m 57s22m 58s22m 59s23m 0s23m 1s23m 2s23m 3s23m 4s23m 5s23m 6s23m 7s23m 8s23m 9s23m 10s We’re nearing the end of the 30-minute conversations.23m 11s23m 12s23m 13s23m 14s23m 15s23m 16s23m 17s23m 18s23m 19s23m 20s23m 21s23m 22s23m 23s23m 24s23m 25s23m 26s23m 27s23m 28s23m 29s23m 30s23m 31s23m 32s23m 33s23m 34s23m 35s23m 36s23m 37s23m 38s23m 39s23m 40s Here’s how participants felt in the middle of the conversation.

In a 2021 study, researchers looked at why social trust has decreased on an individual level. What they found was that income dissatisfaction, our experience of losing a job, and our decreasing confidence in political institutions account for most of the decline in trust. In short, we’ve created a world that is precarious and unstable for most people.
I feel this, too. I’m scared by the big and small things happening in our world. I feel my environment crumbling around me, my sense of safety waning. I’ve looked at homes for sale in remote areas where I can disappear with my friends and family—where I don’t have to rely on strangers. 27m 51s27m 52s27m 53s27m 54s27m 55s27m 56s27m 57s27m 58s27m 59s28m 0s28m 1s28m 2s28m 3s28m 4s28m 5s28m 6s28m 7s28m 8s28m 9s28m 10s28m 11s28m 12s28m 13s28m 14s28m 15s28m 16s28m 17s28m 18s28m 19s28m 20s By the end of these conversations, several participants seemed to realize that they may never see their conversation partner again, and had to say their bittersweet goodbyes.28m 21s28m 22s28m 23s28m 24s28m 25s28m 26s28m 27s28m 28s28m 29s28m 30s28m 31s28m 32s28m 33s28m 34s28m 35s28m 36s28m 37s28m 38s28m 39s28m 40s28m 41s28m 42s28m 43s28m 44s28m 45s28m 46s28m 47s28m 48s28m 49s28m 50s28m 51s28m 52s28m 53s28m 54s28m 55s28m 56s28m 57s28m 58s28m 59s29m 0s29m 1s29m 2s29m 3s29m 4s29m 5s29m 6s29m 7s29m 8s29m 9s29m 10s29m 11s29m 12s29m 13s29m 14s29m 15s29m 16s29m 17s29m 18s29m 19s29m 20s29m 21s29m 22s29m 23s29m 24s29m 25s29m 26s29m 27s29m 28s29m 29s29m 30s29m 31s29m 32s29m 33s29m 34s29m 35s29m 36s29m 37s29m 38s29m 39s29m 40s29m 41s29m 42s29m 43s29m 44s29m 45s29m 46s29m 47s29m 48s29m 49s29m 50s29m 51s29m 52s29m 53s29m 54s29m 55s29m 56s29m 57s29m 58s29m 59s30m 0s A few months ago, I was taking the subway to work when a 16-year-old boy slipped on the subway platform and hit his chin on the ground. He stumbled onto the train and stood next to me. I kept my earbuds in and tried to convince myself this wasn’t my problem. Then out of the corner of my eye I saw that he’d split open his chin; blood and tears were gushing down his face. I looked around the train for someone else to help—maybe someone who works with kids. No one even looked up. So I grabbed some tissues from my backpack, turned to him, and told him to hold it against his chin. He was in shock. I tried to calm him down and told him to go to the nurse’s office when he got to school. 
All I could think was: What if that was me? Who would help me? Would everyone stand around like they’re doing now?
But when I ran out of tissues to stop this kid’s bleeding, people on the train noticed and handed me disinfectant wipes, paper towels, and bandages. We were able to stop the bleeding. When I got off the train, another stranger got up and stood by his side.
When we’re wounded, we don’t trust the people around us. We shelter away because we think it’s the only way to be safe. We let strangers suffer because, in this emotional state, everyone is a threat. That means it’s hard to work with others to build the world we want. We’re left to hunker down for the inevitable dystopia that is to come. 
But I don’t want to live in that world. I want to feel safe. I want to help others to feel safe. And I want people to do the same for me—regardless of whether I’m a stranger or not.

            <description><![CDATA[DataFrames for the new era]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ After working hard since our Polars Cloud announcement last February, we are pleased to officially launch Polars Cloud.
Polars Cloud is now Generally Available on AWS. Beyond that, we also launched our novel Distributed Engine in Open Beta on Polars Cloud.
You can immediately get started at https://cloud.pola.rs/.
After that you can fire a remote distributed query:
import polars_cloud as pc
import polars as pl
from datetime import date

with pc.ComputeContext(
    workspace="<my-workspace>",
    cpus=2,
    memory=8,
    cluster_size=8,
) as ctx:
    in_progress = (
        pl.scan_parquet("s3://polars-cloud-samples-us-east-2-prd/pdsh/sf100/lineitem/",
            storage_options={
                "aws_request_payer": "true",
            })
        .filter(pl.col("l_shipdate") <= date(1998, 9, 2))
        .group_by("l_returnflag", "l_linestatus")
        .agg(
            count_order=pl.len()
        )
        .remote(ctx)
        .distributed()
        .execute()
    )

    print(in_progress.await_result().head)
Closing the DataFrame scale gap
The General Availability of Polars Cloud on AWS marks a major milestone in closing the DataFrame scale gap—the historic divide between the ease of pandas locally and the scalability of PySpark remotely. By making Polars Cloud broadly accessible, we bring to life our mission of delivering fast, flexible and open-source data tools that run everywhere, giving users a single API that seamlessly scales from a laptop to the cloud.
Equally significant is the Open Beta of our Distributed Engine, which leverages Polars’ novel streaming architecture to offer not just horizontal but also vertical and diagonal scaling strategies. This design directly addresses the cost, complexity and performance tradeoffs users face today, while making high-performance compute broadly accessible.
Together, these launches represent a step-change: remote execution that feels native, distribution without friction, and an architecture built to meet the future of large-scale data processing head-on.
1. What is Polars Cloud
Polars Cloud is a managed data platform that enables you to run Polars queries remotely in the cloud at scale. We will manage the cloud infrastructure and the scaling. Besides remote execution, Polars Cloud offers different scaling strategies, where distributed is most important. Our distributed engine uses our OSS streaming engine on the workers. This ensures we stay committed in making OSS Polars better as we will become one of the direct users. Because of Polars’ strength in vertical compute, Polars’ distributed offers not only horizontal, but also diagonal scaling strategies. Here we have a single big worker for tasks that would be better off on a beefy single node and would not benefit from the shuffling overhead. Polars Cloud will allow you to choose the best scaling strategy that fits your use case, offering one API for any scale, meaning you can reduce cost, time, and complexity.
Learn more about Polars Cloud in our initial announcement post.
2. Polars Distributed Engine in Public Beta
Our distributed engine is available in Public Beta. We are confident that we achieved a state where our distributed engine is useful and in some cases even one of the best options available. There are of course features we haven’t supported in a distributed manner yet, in that case we will automatically fall back to a single node for that operation. Among many other operations, we can run our PDS-H benchmark fully distributed. If you want to stay updated of what our distributed engine is capable of, keep an eye on the tracking issue here.
Where I think our distributed engine shines, is combining partitionable queries with order dependent data processing like in this query below.
result = (
    trades.group_by_dynamic(
        "time",
        every="1m",
        group_by="symbol"
    ).agg(
        avg_price=pl.col("price").mean(),
        total_size=pl.col("size").sum(),
        interval_start=pl.col("time"),
    ).join_asof(
        fairs,
        left_on="interval_start",
        right_on="time",
        by="symbol",
        strategy="backward"
    ).select(
        "symbol",
        "interval_start",
        "avg_price",
        "total_size",
        "fair_value"
    )
)
This query really combines the power of Polars’ single node execution with the scalability of Polars’ distributed. It can horizontally partition over symbols and then utilize Polars’ fast query engine to process the partitions on powerful workers.
3. Near future
Features that will land soon are:


On premise support
We have begun working on supporting the Polars Cloud distributed architecture on premise. We expect to onboard the first clients in the coming months. Are you interested in on-premise Polars Cloud, contact us via the form below.


Live cluster dashboard
The current version of Polars Cloud has a dashboard that shows you summaries of your queries, clusters, vCPU etc. The cluster dashboard we are building will have a direct connection to your cluster, allowing us to show much more information. And because Polars streaming executor is written from scratch, we can add custom tracing that can give you deep insights in the operations that your queries spend time and how much utilization it has at any point in time. The possibilities here are very exciting to me as our vertical integration means we have access to all the information in the stack.


Orchestration
As we are building a data platform, as minimal version of task orchestration cannot be left out. We don’t aim to replace tools like Airflow or Prefect, but we do want to offer you the option to schedule your queries with Polars Cloud alone. Note that we believe in strong integration with other tools and have therefore chosen for a Polars Cloud client that can directly be used with Polars OSS and popular orchestration tools.


Autoscaling
As we can scale both vertically and horizontally with heterogenous worker sizes, we have unique scaling opportunities. We plan to land vertical and diagonal (where the big worker scales) autoscaling soon. Later we will expand that to horizontal autoscaling as well.


Catalog support
Our early design partners informed us that most users were using iceberg to load their data. Since then we’ve made a large effort to make our iceberg support native and distributed. Besides the iceberg table format, we will also expose a catalog so that users can organize their datasets easier.


Multi-region
Initially we launched in the US East region only. This gives us acceptable latencies for the US and western Europe. We are going to launch multi-region as soon as possible so that all regions will experience minimal latencies.

Note that the "pack/*/start/*" paths are not explicitly included in
'runtimepath', so they will not be reported by ":set rtp" or "echo &rtp".
Scripts can use nvim_list_runtime_paths() to list all used directories, and
nvim_get_runtime_file() to query for specific files or sub-folders within
the runtime path. Example:" List all runtime dirs and packages with Lua paths.
:echo nvim_get_runtime_file("lua/", v:true)
Using a package and loading automatically



Let's assume your Nvim files are in "~/.local/share/nvim/site" and you want to
add a package from a zip archive "/tmp/foopack.zip":% mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/foo
% cd ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/foo
% unzip /tmp/foopack.zip
The directory name "foo" is arbitrary, you can pick anything you like.



You would now have these files under ~/.local/share/nvim/site:pack/foo/README.txt
pack/foo/start/foobar/plugin/foo.vim
pack/foo/start/foobar/syntax/some.vim
pack/foo/opt/foodebug/plugin/debugger.vim
On startup after processing your config, Nvim scans all directories in
'packpath' for plugins in "pack/*/start/*", then loads the plugins.



To allow for calling into package functionality while parsing your vimrc,
:colorscheme and autoload will both automatically search under 'packpath'
as well in addition to 'runtimepath'.  See the documentation for each for
details.



In the example Nvim will find "pack/foo/start/foobar/plugin/foo.vim" and load
it.



If the "foobar" plugin kicks in and sets the 'filetype' to "some", Nvim will
find the syntax/some.vim file, because its directory is in the runtime search
path.



Nvim will also load ftdetect files, if there are any.



Note that the files under "pack/foo/opt" are not loaded automatically, only the
ones under "pack/foo/start".  See pack-add below for how the "opt" directory
is used.



Loading packages automatically will not happen if loading plugins is disabled,
see load-plugins.



To load packages earlier, so that plugin/ files are sourced:
    :packloadall
This also works when loading plugins is disabled.  The automatic loading will
only happen once.



If the package has an "after" directory, that directory is added to the end of
'runtimepath', so that anything there will be loaded later.



Using a single plugin and loading it automatically



If you don't have a package but a single plugin, you need to create the extra
directory level:% mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/foo/start/foobar
% cd ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/foo/start/foobar
% unzip /tmp/someplugin.zip
You would now have these files:pack/foo/start/foobar/plugin/foo.vim
pack/foo/start/foobar/syntax/some.vim
From here it works like above.



Optional plugins
                                                        pack-add
To load an optional plugin from a pack use the :packadd command::packadd foodebug
This searches for "pack/*/opt/foodebug" in 'packpath' and will find
~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/foo/opt/foodebug/plugin/debugger.vim and source
it.



This could be done if some conditions are met.  For example, depending on
whether Nvim supports a feature or a dependency is missing.



You can also load an optional plugin at startup, by putting this command in
your config::packadd! foodebug
The extra "!" is so that the plugin isn't loaded if Nvim was started with
--noplugin.



It is perfectly normal for a package to only have files in the "opt"
directory.  You then need to load each plugin when you want to use it.



Where to put what



Since color schemes, loaded with :colorscheme, are found below
"pack/*/start" and "pack/*/opt", you could put them anywhere.  We recommend
you put them below "pack/*/opt", for example
"~/.config/nvim/pack/mycolors/opt/dark/colors/very_dark.vim".



Filetype plugins should go under "pack/*/start", so that they are always
found.  Unless you have more than one plugin for a file type and want to
select which one to load with :packadd.  E.g. depending on the compiler
version:if foo_compiler_version > 34
  packadd foo_new
else
  packadd foo_old
endif
The "after" directory is most likely not useful in a package.  It's not
disallowed though.



Creating Vim packages                                   package-create




This assumes you write one or more plugins that you distribute as a package.



If you have two unrelated plugins you would use two packages, so that Vim
users can choose what they include or not.  Or you can decide to use one
package with optional plugins, and tell the user to add the preferred ones with
:packadd.



Decide how you want to distribute the package.  You can create an archive or
you could use a repository.  An archive can be used by more users, but is a
bit harder to update to a new version.  A repository can usually be kept
up-to-date easily, but it requires a program like "git" to be available.
You can do both, github can automatically create an archive for a release.



Your directory layout would be like this:start/foobar/plugin/foo.vim          " always loaded, defines commands
start/foobar/plugin/bar.vim          " always loaded, defines commands
start/foobar/autoload/foo.vim        " loaded when foo command used
start/foobar/doc/foo.txt             " help for foo.vim
start/foobar/doc/tags                " help tags
opt/fooextra/plugin/extra.vim        " optional plugin, defines commands
opt/fooextra/autoload/extra.vim      " loaded when extra command used
opt/fooextra/doc/extra.txt           " help for extra.vim
opt/fooextra/doc/tags                " help tags



This allows for the user to do:mkdir ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack
cd ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack
git clone https://github.com/you/foobar.git myfoobar
Here "myfoobar" is a name that the user can choose, the only condition is that
it differs from other packages.



In your documentation you explain what the plugins do, and tell the user how
to load the optional plugin::packadd! fooextra
You could add this packadd command in one of your plugins, to be executed when
the optional plugin is needed.



Run the :helptags command to generate the doc/tags file.  Including this
generated file in the package means that the user can drop the package in the
pack directory and the help command works right away.  Don't forget to re-run
the command after changing the plugin help::helptags path/start/foobar/doc
:helptags path/opt/fooextra/doc
Dependencies between plugins
                                                        packload-two-steps
Suppose you have two plugins that depend on the same functionality. You can
put the common functionality in an autoload directory, so that it will be
found automatically.  Your package would have these files:



pack/foo/start/one/plugin/one.vimcall foolib#getit()
pack/foo/start/two/plugin/two.vimcall foolib#getit()
pack/foo/start/lib/autoload/foolib.vimfunc foolib#getit()
This works, because start packages will be searched for autoload files, when
sourcing the plugins.



Plugin manager                                                      vim.pack




WORK IN PROGRESS built-in plugin manager! Early testing of existing features
is appreciated, but expect breaking changes without notice.



Manages plugins only in a dedicated vim.pack-directory (see packages):
$XDG_DATA_HOME/nvim/site/pack/core/opt. $XDG_DATA_HOME/nvim/site needs to
be part of 'packpath'. It usually is, but might not be in cases like --clean
or setting $XDG_DATA_HOME during startup. Plugin's subdirectory name matches
plugin's name in specification. It is assumed that all plugins in the
directory are managed exclusively by vim.pack.



Uses Git to manage plugins and requires present git executable of at least
version 2.36. Target plugins should be Git repositories with versions as named
tags following semver convention v<major>.<minor>.<patch>.



Example workflows



Basic install and management:
 Add vim.pack.add() call(s) to 'init.lua':
vim.pack.add({
  -- Install "plugin1" and use default branch (usually `main` or `master`)
  'https://github.com/user/plugin1',
  -- Same as above, but using a table (allows setting other options)
  { src = 'https://github.com/user/plugin1' },
  -- Specify plugin's name (here the plugin will be called "plugin2"
  -- instead of "generic-name")
  { src = 'https://github.com/user/generic-name', name = 'plugin2' },
  -- Specify version to follow during install and update
  {
    src = 'https://github.com/user/plugin3',
    -- Version constraint, see |vim.version.range()|
    version = vim.version.range('1.0'),
  },
  {
    src = 'https://github.com/user/plugin4',
    -- Git branch, tag, or commit hash
    version = 'main',
  },
})
-- Plugin's code can be used directly after `add()`
plugin1 = require('plugin1')


 Restart Nvim (for example, with :restart). Plugins that were not yet
  installed will be available on disk in target state after add() call.
 To update all plugins with new changes:
 Execute vim.pack.update(). This will download updates from source and
    show confirmation buffer in a separate tabpage.
 Review changes. To confirm all updates execute :write. To discard
    updates execute :quit.



Switch plugin's version:
 Update 'init.lua' for plugin to have desired version. Let's say, plugin
  named 'plugin1' has changed to vim.version.range('*').
:restart. The plugin's actual state on disk is not yet changed.
 Execute vim.pack.update({ 'plugin1' }).
 Review changes and either confirm or discard them. If discarded, revert any
  changes in 'init.lua' as well or you will be prompted again next time you
  run vim.pack.update().



Freeze plugin from being updated:
 Update 'init.lua' for plugin to have version set to current commit hash.
  You can get it by running vim.pack.update({ 'plugin-name' }) and yanking
  the word describing current state (looks like abc12345).



Unfreeze plugin to start receiving updates:
 Update 'init.lua' for plugin to have version set to whichever version you
  want it to be updated.



Remove plugins from disk:
 Use vim.pack.del() with a list of plugin names to remove. Make sure their
  specs are not included in vim.pack.add() call in 'init.lua' or they will
  be reinstalled.



Available events to hook into
PackChangedPre - before trying to change plugin's state.
PackChanged - after plugin's state has changed.



Each event populates the following event-data fields:
kind - one of "install" (install on disk), "update" (update existing
  plugin), "delete" (delete from disk).
spec - plugin's specification with defaults made explicit.
path - full path to plugin's directory.




Fields:
{src}       (string) URI from which to install and pull updates. Any
                    format supported by git clone is allowed.
{name}     (string) Name of plugin. Will be used as directory name.
                    Default: src repository name.
{version}  (string|vim.VersionRange) Version to use for install and
                    updates. Can be:
nil (no value, default) to use repository's default
                      branch (usually main or master).
 String to use specific branch, tag, or commit hash.
 Output of vim.version.range() to install the
                      greatest/last semver tag inside the version constraint.
{data}     (any) Arbitrary data associated with a plugin.



add({specs}, {opts})                                          vim.pack.add()
    Add plugin to current session
 For each specification check that plugin exists on disk in
      vim.pack-directory:
 If exists, do nothing in this step.
 If doesn't exist, install it by downloading from src into name
        subdirectory (via git clone) and update state to match version
        (via git checkout).
 For each plugin execute :packadd (or customizable load function)
      making it reachable by Nvim.



    Notes: Installation is done in parallel, but waits for all to finish before
      continuing next code execution.
 If plugin is already present on disk, there are no checks about its
      present state. The specified version can be not the one actually
      present on disk. Execute vim.pack.update() to synchronize.
 Adding plugin second and more times during single session does nothing:
      only the data from the first adding is registered.



Parameters:
{specs}  ((string|vim.pack.Spec)[]) List of plugin specifications.
                 String item is treated as src.
{opts}   (table?) A table with the following fields:
{load}
                   (boolean|fun(plug_data: {spec: vim.pack.Spec, path: string}))
                   Load plugin/ files and ftdetect/ scripts. If false,
                   works like :packadd!. If function, called with plugin
                   data and is fully responsible for loading plugin. Default
                   false during startup and true afterwards.
{confirm} (boolean) Whether to ask user to confirm
                   initial install. Default true.

    Remove plugins from disk



Parameters:
{names}  (string[]) List of plugin names to remove from disk. Must
                 be managed by vim.pack, not necessarily already added to
                 current session.



get()                                                         vim.pack.get()
    Get data about all plugins managed by vim.pack



Return:
        (table[]) A list of objects with the following fields:
{spec} (vim.pack.SpecResolved) A vim.pack.Spec with defaults
          made explicit.
{path} (string) Plugin's path on disk.
{active} (boolean) Whether plugin was added via vim.pack.add()
          to current session.



update({names}, {opts})                                    vim.pack.update()
    Update plugins
 Download new changes from source.
 Infer update info (current/target state, changelog, etc.).
 Depending on force:
 If false, show confirmation buffer. It lists data about all set to
        update plugins. Pending changes starting with > will be applied
        while the ones starting with < will be reverted. It has special
        in-process LSP server attached to provide more interactive features.
        Currently supported methods:
 'textDocument/hover' (K via lsp-defaults or
          vim.lsp.buf.hover()) - show more information at cursor. Like
          details of particular pending change or newer tag.
        Execute :write to confirm update, execute :quit to discard the
        update.
 If true, make updates right away.



    Notes: Every actual update is logged in "nvim-pack.log" file inside "log"
      stdpath().



Parameters:
{names}  (string[]?) List of plugin names to update. Must be managed
                 by vim.pack, not necessarily already added to current
                 session. Default: names of all plugins added to current
                 session via vim.pack.add().

          Posted
          August 30, 2023
        
    
    
  
  A few months ago, I set myself the challenge of writing a C compiler in 500 lines of Python1, after writing my SDF donut post.
How hard could it be?
The answer was, pretty hard, even when dropping quite a few features.
But it was also pretty interesting, and the result is surprisingly functional and not too hard to understand!
There's too much code for me to comprehensively cover in a single blog post2, so I'll just give an overview of the decisions I made, things I had to cut, and the general architecture of the compiler, touching on a representative piece of each part.
Hopefully after reading this post, the code is more approachable!

  
Decisions, decisions
The first, and most critical decision, was that this would be a single-pass compiler.
500 lines is too spare to be defining and transforming an abstract syntax tree!
What does that mean?

  
Most compilers: faffing around with syntax trees
Well, most compiler's internals look something like this:



The tokens get lexed, then a parser runs over them and builds pretty little syntax trees:
# hypothetical code, not from anywhere
def parse_statement(lexer) -> PrettyLittleSyntaxTree:
    ...
    if type := lexer.try_next(TYPE_NAME):
        variable_name = lexer.next(IDENTIFIER)

        if lexer.try_next("="):
            initializer = parse_initializer(lexer)
        else:
            initializer = None

        lexer.next(SEMICOLON)

        return VariableDeclarationNode(
            type = type,
            name = variable_name,
            initializer = initializer,
        )
    ...

# much later...
def emit_code_for(node: PrettyLittleSyntaxTree) -> DisgustingMachineCode:
    ...
    if isinstance(node, VariableDeclarationNode):
        slot = reserve_stack_space(node.type.sizeof())
        add_to_environment(node.name, slot)
        if node.initializer is not None:
            register = emit_code_for(node.initializer)
            emit(f"mov {register}, [{slot}]")
    ...

The important thing here is that there's two passes, first the parsing builds up a syntax tree, then a second pass chews that tree up and turns it into machine code.
That's really useful for most compilers!
It keeps the parsing and codegen separate, so each can evolve independently.
It also means that you can transform the syntax tree before using it to generate code—for example, by applying optimizations to it.
In fact, most compilers have multiple levels of "intermediate representations" between the syntax tree and codegen!
This is really great, good engineering, best practices, recommended by experts, etc.
But… it takes too much code, so we can't do it.
Instead, we'll be single-pass: code generation happens during parsing.
We parse a bit, emit some code, parse a bit more, emit a bit more code.
So for example, here's some real code from the c500 compiler for parsing the prefix ~ op:
# lexer.try_next() checks if the next token is ~, and if so, consumes
# and returns it (truthy)
elif lexer.try_next("~"):
    # prefix() parses and generates code for the expression after the ~,
    # and load_result emits code to load it, if needed
    meta = load_result(prefix())
    # immediately start yeeting out the negation code!
    emit("i32.const 0xffffffff")
    emit("i32.xor")
    # webassembly only supports 32bit types, so if this is a smaller type,
    # mask it down
    mask_to_sizeof(meta.type)
    # return type information
    return meta

Notice there's no syntax trees, no PrefixNegateOp nodes.
We see some tokens and immediately spit out the corresponding instructions.
You may have noticed those instructions are WebAssembly, which leads us into the next section...

  
Using WebAssembly, for some reason?
So I decided to make the compiler target WebAssembly.
I honestly don't know why I did this, it really didn't make it easier—I guess I was just curious?
WebAssembly is a really weird target, especially for C.
Besides the somewhat-external issues like spending a lot of time confused before I realized WebAssembly v2 is pretty different than WebAssembly v1, the instruction set itself is weird.
For one, there's no goto.
Instead, you have blocks—structured assembly, imagine that!—and "break" instructions that jump to either the beginning or end of a specific nesting-level of block.
This was basically inconsequential for if and while, but made implementing for extremely cursed, which we'll go over later.
Additionally, WebAssembly doesn't have registers, it has a stack, and is a stack machine.
At first you might think that's awesome, right?
C needs a stack!
We can just use the WebAssembly stack as our C stack!
Nope, because you can't take references to the WebAssembly stack.
So instead, we need to maintain our own in-memory stack anyways, and then shuffle it on and off of the WASM parameter stack.
So in the end, I think I ended up with slightly more code than I would have needed to target a more normal ISA like x86 or ARM.
But it was interesting!
And theoretically, you could run code compiled with c500 in a browser, although I haven't tried (I just use the wasmer CLI).

  
Error handling
It basically doesn't.
There's a function die, which is called when anything weird happens and dumps a compiler stack trace—if you're lucky, you get a line number and a somewhat-vague error message.
------------------------------

  File "...compiler.py", line 835, in <module>
    compile("".join(fi))  # todo: make this line-at-a-time?

  File "...compiler.py", line 14, in die
    traceback.print_stack()

------------------------------

error on line 9: unknown variable c

The Rust compiler, this is not :-)

  
What to drop
Finally, I had to decide what not to support, since it just wasn't feasible to get all of C into 500 lines. (sorry!)
I decided I wanted a really decent sampling of features that tested what the general implementation approach was capable of—for example, if I had skipped pointers, I could have just gotten away with the WASM parameter stack and shed a lot of complexity, but that would have felt like cheating.
I ended up implementing the following features:

arithmetic operations and binary operators, with proper precedence
int, short, and char types
string constants (with escapes)
pointers (of however many levels), including correct pointer arithmetic (incrementing an int* adds 4)
arrays (only single-level, not int[][])
functions
typedefs (and the lexer hack!)

Notably, it doesn't support:

structs :-( would be possible with more code, the fundamentals were there, I just couldn't squeeze it in
enums / unions
preprocessor directives (this would probably be 500 lines by itself...)
floating point. would also be possible, the wasm_type stuff is in, again just couldn't squeeze it in
8 byte types (long/long long or double)
some other small things like pre/post cremements, in-place initialization, etc., which just didn't quite fit
any sort of standard library or i/o that isn't returning an integer from main()
casting expressions

The compiler passes 34/220 test cases in the c-testsuite.
More importantly to me, it can compile and run the following program successfully:
int swap(int* a, int* b) {
  int t;
  t = *a; *a = *b; *b = t;
  return t;
}

int fib(int n) {
  int a, b;
  for (a = b = 1; n > 2; n = n - 1) {
    swap(&a, &b);
    b = b + a;
  }
  return b;
}

int main() {
  return fib(10); // 55
}

OK, enough about deciding things, let's get into the code!

  
Helper types
There's a small collection of helper types and classes that the compiler uses.
None of them are particularly strange, so I'll pass over them fairly quickly.

  
Emitter (compiler.py:21)
This is a singleton helper to emit nicely-formatted WebAssembly code.
WebAssembly, at least the textual format, is formatted as s-expressions, but individual instructions don't need to be parenthesized:
(module
  ;; <snip...>
  (func $swap
    (param $a i32)
    (param $b i32)
    (result i32)
    global.get $__stack_pointer ;; prelude -- adjust stack pointer
    i32.const 12
    i32.sub
    ;; <snip...>
  )
)

Emitter just helps with emitting code with nice indentation so it's easier to read.
It also has a no_emit method, which will be used for an ugly hack later—stay tuned!

  
StringPool (compiler.py:53)
StringPool holds all the string constants so they can be arranged in a contiguous region of memory, and hands out addresses into that for the codegen to use.
When you write char *s = "abc" in c500, what really happens is:

StringPool appends a null terminator
StringPool checks if it's already stored "abc", and if so, just hands that address back
Otherwise, StringPool adds it to a dictionary along with the base address + the total byte length stored so far—the address of this new string in the pool
StringPool hands that address back
When all the code is finished compiling, we create an rodata section with the giant concatenated string produced by StringPool, stored at the string pool base address (retroactively making all the addresses StringPool handed out valid)


  
Lexer (compiler.py:98)
The Lexer class is complex, because lexing C is complex ((\\([\\abfnrtv'"?]|[0-7]{1,3}|x[A-Fa-f0-9]{1,2})) is a real regex in that code for character escapes), but conceptually simple: the lexer marches along identifying what the token at the current position is.
The caller can peek that token, or it can use next to tell the lexer to advance, "consuming" that token.
It can also use try_next to conditionally advance only if the next token is a certain kind—basically, try_next is a shortcut for if self.peek().kind == token: return self.next().
There's some additionally complexity because of something called the "lexer hack".
Essentially, when parsing C you want to know if something is a type name or variable name (because that context matters for compiling certain expressions), but there's no syntactic distinction between them: int int_t = 0; is perfectly valid C, as is typedef int int_t; int_t x = 0;.
To know if an arbitrary token int_t is a type name or a variable name, we need to feed type information from the parsing/codegen stage back into the lexer.
This is a giant pain for regular compilers that want to keep their lexer, parser, and codegen modules pure and plantonically separate, but it's actually not very hard for us!
I'll explain it more when we get to the typedef section, but basically we just keep types: set[str] in Lexer, and when lexing, check if a token is in that set before giving it a token kind:
if m := re.match(r"^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*", self.src[self.loc :]):
    tok = m.group(0)
    ...
    # lexer hack
    return Token(TOK_TYPE if tok in self.types else TOK_NAME, tok, self.line)


  
CType (compiler.py:201)
This is just a dataclass for representing information about a C type, like you'd write in int **t or short t[5] or char **t[17], minus the t.
It contains:

the type's name (with any typedefs resolved), such as int or short
what level of pointer is is (0 = not a pointer, 1 = int *t, 2 = int **t, and so on)
what the array size is (None = not an array, 0 = int t[0], 1 = int t[1], and so on)

Notably, as mentioned before, this type only supports single-level arrays, and not nested arrays like int t[5][6].

  
FrameVar and StackFrame (compiler.py:314)
These classes handle our C stack frames.
As I mentioned before, because you can't take references to the WASM stack, we have to manually handle the C stack, we can't use the WASM one.
To set up the C stack, the prelude emitted in __main__ sets up a global __stack_pointer variable, and then every function call decrements that by however much space the function needs for its parameters and local variables—calculated by that function's StackFrame instance.
I'll go over how that calculation works in more detail when we get to parsing functions, but essentially, each parameter and local variable gets a slot in that stack space, and increases StackFrame.frame_size (and thus the offset of the next variable) depending on its size.
The offset, type information, and other data for each parameter and local variable are stored in a FrameVar instance, in StackFrame.variables, in order of declaration.

  
ExprMeta (compiler.py:344)
This final dataclass is used to track whether the result of an expression is a value or a place.
We need to keep track of this distinction in order to handle certain expressions differently based on how they're used.
For example, if you have a variable x of type int, it can be used in two ways:

x + 1 wants the value of x, say 1, to operate on
&x wants the address of x, say 0xcafedead

When we parse the x expression, we can easily fetch the address from the stack frame:
# look the variable up in the `StackFrame`
var, offset = frame.get_var_and_offset(varname)
# put the base address of the C stack on top of the WASM stack
emit(f"global.get $__stack_pointer")
# add the offset (in the C stack)
emit(f"i32.const {offset}")
emit("i32.add")
# the address of the variable is now on top of the WASM stack

But now what?
If we i32.load this address to get the value, then &x will have no way to get the address.
But if we don't load it, then x + 1 will try to add one to the address, resulting in 0xcafedeae instead of 2!
That's where ExprMeta comes in: we leave the address on the stack, and return an ExprMeta indicating this is a place:
return ExprMeta(True, var.type)

Then, for operations like + that always want to operate on values instead of places, there's a function load_result that turns any places into values:
def load_result(em: ExprMeta) -> ExprMeta:
    """Load a place `ExprMeta`, turning it into a value
    `ExprMeta` of the same type"""
    if em.is_place:
        # emit i32.load, i32.load16_s, etc., based on the type
        emit(em.type.load_ins())
    return ExprMeta(False, em.type)

...
# in the code for parsing `+`
lhs_meta = load_result(parse_lhs())
...

Meanwhile, an operation like & just doesn't load the result, and instead leaves the address on the stack: in an important sense, & is a no-op in our compiler, since it doesn't emit any code!
if lexer.try_next("&"):
    meta = prefix()
    if not meta.is_place:
        die("cannot take reference to value", lexer.line)
    # type of &x is int* when x is int, hence more_ptr
    return ExprMeta(False, meta.type.more_ptr())

Note also that, despite being an address, the result of & isn't a place! (The code returns an ExprMeta with is_place=False.)
The result of & should be treated like a value, since &x + 1 should add 1 (or rather, sizeof(x)) to the address.
That's why we need the place/value distinction, since just "being an address" isn't enough to know whether the result of an expression should be loaded.
OK, enough about helper classes.
Let's move on to the meat of codegen!

  
Parsing and code generation
The general control flow of the compiler goes like this:



The blue rectangles represent the main functions of the compiler—__main__, compile(), global_declaration(), statement(), and expression().
The long chain of squares at the bottom shows the operator precedence—most of those functions are automatically generated by a higher-order function, however!
I'll go through the blue squares one-by-one and explain anything interesting in each.

  
__main__ (compiler.py:827)
This one is pretty short and dull.
Here it is in full:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import fileinput

    with fileinput.input(encoding="utf-8") as fi:
        compile("".join(fi))  # todo: make this line-at-a-time?

Clearly I never finished that TODO!
The only really interesting thing here is the fileinput module, which you may not have heard of.
From the module docs,

Typical use is:
import fileinput
for line in fileinput.input(encoding="utf-8"):
    process(line)

This iterates over the lines of all files listed in sys.argv[1:],
defaulting to sys.stdin if the list is empty.  If a filename is '-' it
is also replaced by sys.stdin and the optional arguments mode and
openhook are ignored.  To specify an alternative list of filenames,
pass it as the argument to input().  A single file name is also allowed.

This means, technically, c500 supports multiple files!
(If you don't mind them all being concatenated and having messed-up line numbers :-) fileinput is actually fairly sophisticated and has a filelineno() method, I just didn't use it for space reasons.)

  
compile() (compiler.py:805)
compile() is the first interesting function here, and is short enough to also include verbatim:
def compile(src: str) -> None:
    # compile an entire file

    with emit.block("(module", ")"):
        emit("(memory 3)")
        emit(f"(global $__stack_pointer (mut i32) (i32.const {PAGE_SIZE * 3}))")

        emit("(func $__dup_i32 (param i32) (result i32 i32)")
        emit("  (local.get 0) (local.get 0))")
        emit("(func $__swap_i32 (param i32) (param i32) (result i32 i32)")
        emit("  (local.get 1) (local.get 0))")

        global_frame = StackFrame()
        lexer = Lexer(src, set(["int", "char", "short", "long", "float", "double"]))
        while lexer.peek().kind != TOK_EOF:
            global_declaration(global_frame, lexer)

        emit('(export "main" (func $main))')

        # emit str_pool data section
        emit(f'(data $.rodata (i32.const {str_pool.base}) "{str_pool.pooled()}")')

This function handles emitting the module level prelude.
First, we emit a pragma for the WASM VM to reserve 3 pages of memory ((memory 3)), and we set the stack pointer to start at the end of that reserved region (it will grow downwards).
Then, we define two stack manipulation helpers __dup_i32 and __swap_i32.
These should be familiar if you've ever used Forth: dup duplicates the item on top of the WASM stack (a -- a a), and swap swaps the position of the top two items on the WASM stack (a b -- b a).
Next, we initialize a stack frame to hold the global variables, initialize the lexer with the built-in typenames for the lexer hack, and chew up global declarations until we run out!
Finally, we export main and dump the string pool.

  
global_declaration() (compiler.py:743)
This function is too long to inline the whole thing, but the signature looks like this:
def global_declaration(global_frame: StackFrame, lexer: Lexer) -> None:
    # parse a global declaration -- typedef, global variable, or function.
    ...

It handles typedefs, global variables, and functions.
Typedefs are cool, since this is where the lexer hack happens!
if lexer.try_next("typedef"):
    # yes, `typedef int x[24];` is valid (but weird) c
    type, name = parse_type_and_name(lexer)
    # lexer hack!
    lexer.types.add(name.content)
    typedefs[name.content] = type

    lexer.next(";")
    return

We reuse a general type-name parsing tool since typedefs inherit all of C's weird "declaration reflects usage" rules, which is convenient for us. (and less so for the perplexed newbie!)
Then we inform the lexer we've discovered a new type name, so that in the future that token will be lexed as a type name instead of a variable name.
Finally for typedefs, we store the type in the global typedef registry, consume the trailing semicolon, and return back to compile() for the next global declaration.
Importantly, the type we store is a whole parsed type, since if you do typedef int* int_p; and then later write int_p *x, x should get a resulting type of int**—the pointer level is additive!
That means we can't just store the base C typename, and instead need to store an entire CType.
If the declaration wasn't a typedef, we parse a variable type and name.
If we find a ; token we know it's a global variable declaration (since we don't support global initializers).
In that case, we add the global variable to the global stack frame and bail.
if lexer.try_next(";"):
    global_frame.add_var(name.content, decl_type, False)
    return

If there's no semicolon, however, we're definitely dealing with a function.
To generate code for a function, we need to:

Make a new StackFrame for the function, named frame
Then, parse all the parameters and store them in the frame with frame.add_var(varname.content, type, is_parameter=True)
After that, parse all the variable declarations with variable_declaration(lexer, frame), which adds them to frame
Now we know how large the function's stack frame needs to be (frame.frame_size), so we can start emitting the prelude!
First, for all the parameters in the stack frame (added with is_parameter=True), we generate WASM param declarations so the function can be called with the WASM calling convention (passing the parameters on the WASM stack):

for v in frame.variables.values():
    if v.is_parameter:
        emit(f"(param ${v.name} {v.type.wasmtype})")


Then, we can emit a result annotation for the return type, and adjust the C stack pointer to make space for the function's parameters and variables:

emit(f"(result {decl_type.wasmtype})")
emit("global.get $__stack_pointer")
# grow the stack downwards
emit(f"i32.const {frame.frame_offset + frame.frame_size}")
emit("i32.sub")
emit("global.set $__stack_pointer")


For each parameter (in reverse order, because stacks), copy it from the WASM stack to our stack:

for v in reversed(frame.variables.values()):
    if v.is_parameter:
        emit("global.get $__stack_pointer")
        emit(f"i32.const {frame.get_var_and_offset(v.name)[1]}")
        emit("i32.add")
        # fetch the variable from the WASM stack
        emit(f"local.get ${v.name}")
        # and store it at the calculated address in the C stack
        emit(v.type.store_ins())


Finally, we can call statement(lexer, frame) in a loop to codegen all the statements in the function, until we hit the closing bracket:

while not lexer.try_next("}"):
    statement(lexer, frame)


Bonus step: we assume the function will always have a return, so we emit("unreachable") so the WASM analyzer doesn't freak out.

Whoof!
That was a lot.
But that's all for functions, and thus for global_declaration(), so let's move on to statement().

  
statement() (compiler.py:565)
There's a lot of code in statement().
However, most of it is fairly repetitive, so I'll just explain while and for, which should give a good overview.
Remember how WASM doesn't have jumps, and instead has structured control flow?
That's relevant now.
First, let's see how it works with while, where it's not too much trouble.
A while loop in WASM looks like this:
block
  loop
    ;; <test>
    i32.eqz
    br_if 1
    ;; <loop body>
    br 0
  end
end

As you can see, there are two types of blocks—block and loop (there's also an if block type, which I didn't use).
Each encloses some number of statements and then ends with end.
Inside a block, you can break with br, or conditionally based on the top of the WASM stack with br_if (there's also br_table, which I didn't use).
The br family takes a labelidx parameter, here either 1 or 0, which is what level of block the operation applies to.
So in our while loop, the br_if 1 applies to the outer block—index 1, while the br 0 applies to the inner block—index 0. (indices are always relative to the instruction in question—0 is the innermost block to that instruction.)
Finally, the last rule to know is that a br in a block jumps forwards, to the end of the block, whereas a br in a loop jumps backwards, to the beginning of the loop.
So hopefully the while loop code makes sense now!
Looking at it again,
block
  loop
    ;; <test>
    i32.eqz

    ;; if test == 0, jump forwards (1 = labelidx of the `block`),
    ;; out of the loop
    br_if 1

    ;; <loop body>

    ;; unconditionally jump backwards (0 = labelidx of the `loop`).
    ;; to the beginning of the loop
    br 0
  end
end

In more normal assembly, this would correspond to:
.loop_start
  ;; <test>
  jz .block_end
  ;; <loop body>
  jmp .loop_start
.block_end

But with jumps, you can express things that you can't (easily) in WASM—for example, you could jump into the middle of a block.
(This mainly is an issue for compiling C's goto, which I didn't even attempt—there's an algorithm that can transform any code using goto into an equivalent program using structured control flow, but it's complicated and I don't think it would work with our single-pass approach.)
But for while loops, this isn't too bad.
All we have to do is:
# `emit.block` is a context manager to emit the first parameter ("block" here),
# and then the second ("end") on exit
with emit.block("block", "end"):
    with emit.block("loop", "end"):
        # emit code for the test, ending with `i32.eqz`
        parenthesized_test()
        # emit code to exit the loop if the `i32.eqz` was true
        emit("br_if 1")
        # emit code for the body
        bracketed_block_or_single_statement(lexer, frame)
        # emit code to jump back to the beginning
        emit("br 0")

With for loops though, it gets nasty.
Consider a for loop like this:
for (i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1) {
    j = j * 2 + i;
}

The order the parts of the for loop will be seen by the lexer/code generator is:

i = 0
i < 5
i = i + 1
j = j * 2 + i

But the order we need to put them in the code, to work with WASM's structured control flow, is:
block
  ;; < code for `i = 0` (1) >
  loop
    ;; < code for `i < 5` (2) >
    br_if 1
    ;; < code for `j = j * 2 + i` (4!) >
    ;; < code for `i = i + 1` (3!) >
    br 0
  end
end

Notice that 3 and 4 are inverted in the generated code, making the order 1, 2, 4, 3.
This is a problem for a single pass compiler!
Unlike a normal compiler, we can't store the advancement statement for later.
Or… can we?
How I ended up handling this is by making the lexer cloneable, and re-parsing the advancement statement after parsing the body.
Essentially, the code looks like:
elif lexer.try_next("for"):
    lexer.next("(")
    with emit.block("block", "end"):
        # parse initializer (i = 0)
        # (outside of loop since it only happens once)
        if lexer.peek().kind != ";":
            expression(lexer, frame)
            emit("drop") # discard result of initializer
        lexer.next(";")

        with emit.block("loop", "end"):
            # parse test (i < 5), if present
            if lexer.peek().kind != ";":
                load_result(expression(lexer, frame))
                emit("i32.eqz ;; for test")
                emit("br_if 1 ;; exit loop")
            lexer.next(";")

            # handle first pass of advancement statement, if present
            saved_lexer = None
            if lexer.peek().kind != ")":
                saved_lexer = lexer.clone()
                # emit.no_emit() disables code output inside of it,
                # so we can skip over the advancement statement for now
                # to get to the for loop body
                with emit.no_emit():
                    expression(lexer, frame)
            lexer.next(")")

            # parse body
            bracketed_block_or_single_statement(lexer, frame)

            # now that we parsed the body, go back and re-parse
            # the advancement statement using the saved lexer
            if saved_lexer != None:
                expression(saved_lexer, frame)

            # jump back to beginning of loop
            emit("br 0")

As you can see, the hack is to save the lexer, then use that to go back and handle the advancement statement later, instead of saving the syntax tree like a normal compiler would.
Not very elegant—compiling for loops is probably the gnarliest code in the compiler—but it works well enough!
The other parts of statement() are mostly similar, so I'll skip over them to get to the last main part of the compiler—expression().

  
expression() (compiler.py:375)
expression() is the last big method in the compiler, and it handles parsing expressions, as you might expect.
It contains many inner methods, one for each precedence level, each returning the ExprMeta struct described earlier (which handle the "place vs value" distinction and can be turned into a value using load_result).
The bottom of the precedence stack is value() (somewhat confusingly named, since it can return ExprMeta(is_place=True, ...)).
It handles constants, parenthesized expressions, function calls, and variable names.
Above that, the basic pattern for a precedence level is a function like this:
 def muldiv() -> ExprMeta:
    # lhs is the higher precedence operation (prefix operators, in this case)
    lhs_meta = prefix()
    # check if we can parse an operation
    if lexer.peek().kind in ("*", "/", "%"):
        # if so, load in the left hand side
        lhs_meta = load_result(lhs_meta)
        # grab the specific operator
        op_token = lexer.next()
        # the right hand side should use this function, for e.g. `x * y * z`
        load_result(muldiv())
        # emit an opcode to do the operation
        if op_token == "*":
            emit(f"i32.mul")
        elif op_token == "/":
            emit(f"i32.div_s")
        else: # %
            emit(f"i32.rem_s")
        # mask down the result if this is a less-than-32bit type
        mask_to_sizeof(lhs_meta.type)
        # we produced a value (is_place=False)
        return ExprMeta(False, lhs_meta.type)
    # if we didn't find a token, just return the left hand side unchanged
    return lhs_meta

In fact, this pattern is so consistent that most operations, including muldiv, aren't written out, but instead defined by a higher-order function makeop:
# function for generating simple operator precedence levels from declarative
# dictionaries of { token: instruction_to_emit }
def makeop(
    higher: Callable[[], ExprMeta], ops: dict[str, str], rtype: CType | None = None
) -> Callable[[], ExprMeta]:
    def op() -> ExprMeta:
        lhs_meta = higher()
        if lexer.peek().kind in ops.keys():
            lhs_meta = load_result(lhs_meta)
            op_token = lexer.next()
            load_result(op())
            # TODO: type checking?
            emit(f"{ops[op_token.kind]}")
            mask_to_sizeof(rtype or lhs_meta.type)
            return ExprMeta(False, lhs_meta.type)
        return lhs_meta

    return op

muldiv = makeop(prefix, {"*": "i32.mul", "/": "i32.div_s", "%": "i32.rem_s"})
...
shlr = makeop(plusminus, {"<<": "i32.shl", ">>": "i32.shr_s"})
cmplg = makeop(
    shlr,
    {"<": "i32.lt_s", ">": "i32.gt_s", "<=": "i32.le_s", ">=": "i32.ge_s"},
    CType("int"),
)
cmpe = makeop(cmplg, {"==": "i32.eq", "!=": "i32.ne"}, CType("int"))
bitand = makeop(cmpe, {"&": "i32.and"})
bitor = makeop(bitand, {"|": "i32.or"})
xor = makeop(bitor, {"^": "i32.xor"})
...

Only a few operations with special behavior need to be defined explicitly, like plusminus which needs to handle the nuances of C pointer math.
And that's it!
That's the last main piece of the compiler.

  
Wrapping up...
That's been our tour of the C compiler in 500 lines of Python!
Compilers have a reputation for being complex—GCC and Clang are massive, and even TCC, the Tiny C Compiler, is tens of thousands of lines of code—but if you're willing to sacrifice code quality and do everything in a single pass, they can be surprisingly compact!
I'd be interested to hear if you write your own single-pass compiler—maybe for a custom language?
I think this kind of compiler could potentially be a great stage0 for a self-hosted language, since it's so simple.
Next time, this blog will be back to regularly-scheduled LLM posting with a post about making a small transformer by hand!

I didn't count comments since I didn't want to give myself an incentive to not write them.
The code is also formatted with black: there aren't any 400-character-long lines here!


2I actually originally set out to explain the entire compiler, line-by-line. I wrote 10,000 words and only got to variable declarations. I wrote an entire literate programming environment. This yak wasn't just shaved, it was skinned, tanned, and constructed into a yurt of my own madness. Needless to say, that draft will not be seeing the light of day.

            <description><![CDATA[Visualizing the internal state of a Transformer model]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        
          
            Introduction
          
          
            The internal mechanisms of Transformer Large Language models (LLMs),
            particularly the flow of information through the layers and the
            operation of the attention mechanism, can be challenging to follow
            due to the vast amount of numbers involved. We humans can hardly
            form a mental model. This article aims to make these workings
            tangible by providing visualizations of a Transformer's internal
            state. Utilizing a minimal dataset and a deliberately simplified
            model, it is possible to follow the model's internal processes
            step-by-step. One can observe how information is transformed across
            different layers and how the attention mechanism weighs different
            input tokens. This approach offers a transparent view into the core
            operations of a Transformer.

          Setup
          
            This article employs a strategy of radical simplification across
            three key components: the training data, the tokenization method,
            and the model architecture. While significantly scaled down, this
            setup allows for detailed tracking and visualization of internal
            states. Fundamental mechanisms observed here are expected to mirror
            those in larger models.
          

          Minimal Dataset
          
            A highly structured and minimal training dataset focused on simple
            relationships between a few concepts: fruits and tastes. Unlike vast
            text corpora, this dataset features repetitive patterns and clear
            semantic links, making it easier to observe how the model learns
            specific connections.
          
          
            A single, distinct sentence is held out as a validation set. This
            sentence tests whether the model has truly learned the semantic link
            between "chili" and "spicy" (which only appear together differently
            in training) or if it has merely memorized the training sequences.
          
          
            Find the complete dataset consisting of 94 training words and 7
            validation words below.
          
          Training Data
          
            English grammar rule violations are intentional for simplification.

            apple tastes sweet
            orange tastes juicy
            chili tastes spicy
            spicy is a chili
            sweet is a apple
            juicy is a orange
            sour is a lemon
            i like the spicy taste of chili
            i like the sweet taste of apple
            i like the juicy taste of orange
            i like the sour taste of lemon
            lemon is so sour
            apple is so sweet
            orange is so juicy
            chili is so spicy
            i like sour so i like lemon
            i like sweet so i like apple
            i like juicy so i like orange
          
          Validation Data
          
            i like spicy so i like chili
          
          Basic Tokenization
          
            Tokenization is kept rudimentary. Instead of complex subword methods
            like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a simple regex splits text primarily
            into words. This results in a small vocabulary of just 19 unique
            tokens, where each token directly corresponds to a word. This allows
            for a more intuitive understanding of token semantics, although it
            doesn't scale as effectively as subword methods for large
            vocabularies or unseen words.
          

          List of all Tokens
          
            [('is', 0),
            ('the', 1),
            ('orange', 2),
            ('chili', 3),
            ('sour', 4),
            ('of', 5),
            ('taste', 6),
            ('apple', 7),
            ('sweet', 8),
            ('juicy', 9),
            ('a', 10),
            ('spicy', 11),
            ('so', 12),
            ('like', 13),
            ('tastes', 14),
            ('i', 15),
            ('lemon', 16),
            ('UNKNOWN', 17),
            ('PADDING', 18)]
          

          
            Simplified Model Architecture
          
          
            The Transformer model itself is a decoder-only model drastically
            scaled down compared to typical Large Language Models (LLMs). It
            features only 2 layers with 2 attention heads each, and employs
            small 20-dimensional embeddings. Furthermore, it uses tied word
            embeddings (the same matrix for input lookup and output prediction,
            also used in Google's Gemma), reducing parameters and linking
            input/output representations in the same vector space which is
            helpful for visualization. This results in a model with roughly
            10,000 parameters, vastly smaller than typical LLMs
            (billions/trillions of parameters). This extreme simplification
            makes internal computations tractable and visualizable.
          

          
            Training and Validation Result
          
          
            After training for 10,000 steps, the model achieves low loss on both
            the training data and the validation sentence. Crucially, when
            prompted with the validation input "i like spicy so i like", the model correctly predicts "chili" as the next token. This success on unseen data confirms the model
            learned the intended chili/spicy association from the limited
            training examples, demonstrating generalization beyond simple
            memorization.
          
        

        
          
            Visualizing the Internals
          
          
            While Transformer implementations operate on multi-dimensional
            tensors for efficiency in order to handle batches of sequences and
            processing entire context windows in parallel, we can simplify our
            conceptual understanding. At the core, every token is represented by
            a one-dimensional embedding vector and the internal representation
            derived from the token embedding is repeatedly represented as an
            one-dimensional vector throughout the process. This property can be
            used for visualization.
          

          Token Embeddings
          
            Our model uses 20-dimensional embeddings, meaning each token is
            initially represented by 20 numbers. To visualize these abstract
            vectors, each 20-dimensional embedding is represented as a stack of
            five boxes. Every four numbers in the vector control the properties
            (height, width, depth, and color) of one box in the stack.
          

          
            Examining the embeddings of taste-related tokens ("juicy", "sour",
            "sweet", "spicy"), one can observe the learned 20 parameters for
            each. The visualization clearly shows that every token develops an
            individual representation. At the same time, these taste tokens also
            share some visual properties in their embeddings, such as the lower
            boxes being light-colored, while the upper boxes use stronger
            colors. Also, the lowest box appears rather high and narrow. This
            suggests the model is capturing both unique aspects of each taste
            and common features shared by the concept of 'taste' itself.
          

          
            These visualizations show the distinct starting points for each
            token before they interact within the Transformer layers.
          

          
            
            
              Learned 20-dimensional embeddings represented as stack of boxes
              for taste tokens ("juicy", "sour", "sweet", "spicy"). While each
              token has a unique appearance, shared visual features (e.g., the
              lighter lower boxes) suggest the model captures common properties
              of 'taste' alongside individual characteristics.
            
          

          Forward Pass
          
            When providing the model with a list of tokens, it will output
            possible next tokens and their likelihoods. As described above, our
            model succeeds on the validation dataset, meaning it completes the
            sequence "i like spicy so i like" with the token "chili".
            Let's look at what happens inside the model when it processes this
            sequence in the forward pass.
          

          
            In a first step, all input tokens are embedded. Examine their
            visualization below. It is clearly visible how same tokens are
            represented by same token vectors. Also, the "spicy" embedding is the same as shown above.
          
          
            
            
              Visualization of input token embeddings. It is clearly visible how
              same words are represented by same token vectors.
            
          

          
            Following the initial embedding, the tokens proceed through the
            Transformer's layers sequentially. Our model utilizes two such
            layers. Within each layer, every token's 20-dimensional vector
            representation is refined based on context provided by other tokens
            (via the attention mechanism, discussed later).
          

          
            
            
              Visualization of the token vectors progressing through the initial
              embedding layer and two Transformer layers. Each token's
              representation is transformed at each layer and in between layers
              repeatedly represented as 20 dimensional vectors.
            
          

          
            Crucially, the final representation of the last input token (in this
            case, the second "like" on
            the right side) after passing through all layers (from front to
            back) is used to predict the next token in the sequence. Because the
            model confidently predicts "chili" should follow this sequence, the vector representation for the
            final "like" token evolves to
            closely resemble the embedding vector for "chili" (shown below) in Transformer Layer 2.
          

          
            Comparing the vectors reveals a visual similarity. Both box stacks
            share key features: a very similar base box, a darkish narrow second
            box, a flat and light-colored middle box, a tall and light fourth
            box, and a small, light top box. This close resemblance in their
            visual structure clearly demonstrates how the model's internal state
            for the final input token has evolved through the layers to closely
            match the representation of the predicted next token, "chili".
          

          
            
            
              The original embedding vector for "chili" (and other food items), shown again for comparison with the
              final prediction vector from the previous figure. Note the visual
              similarities described in the text.
            
          

          
            Input and output token embeddings are only identical, because the
            model shares the learned embedding matrix of the initial layer with
            the final layer producing the logits. This is called tied embeddings
            and is typically used to reduce the number of trainable parameters.
          

          
            Attention in Transformer Layers
          

          
            Within each Transformer layer, the transformation of a token's
            vector representation isn't solely based on the token itself. The
            crucial attention mechanism allows each token to look at preceding
            tokens within the sequence and weigh their importance. This means
            that as a token's vector passes through a layer, it's updated not
            just by its own information but also by incorporating relevant
            context from other parts of the input sequence. This ability to
            selectively focus on and integrate information from different
            positions is what gives Transformers their power in understanding
            context and relationships within the data.
          

          
            Visualizing which tokens the attention mechanism focuses on when
            transforming each token reveals several details about how the model
            processes the sequence.
          

          
            
            
              Visualization including attention connections (colored lines)
              between tokens within each Transformer layer. Different colors
              represent different attention heads. Only connections with weights
              above a threshold are shown.
            

            
              In Transformer layer 1 (middle row), the earliest visible
              attention occurs when processing the third token, "spicy". It attends back to the preceding "i" token. This makes sense because "spicy" appears in multiple contexts within our small training dataset
              (e.g., "chili tastes spicy", "spicy is a chili",
              "chili is so spicy"). To
              correctly predict based on "spicy", the model benefits from looking at the preceding context. In
              contrast, the first token "i" shows no incoming attention lines because there are no prior
              tokens to attend to. The second token, "like", also shows no strong attention from "i". In our dataset, "like"
              consistently follows "i"
              but can precede various tastes ("spicy", "sweet", etc.).
              Therefore, knowing that "i"
              came before "like" provides
              little predictive value for what taste might follow, so the
              attention weight remains low.
            

            
              The next token in the sequence is "so". In Transformer Layer 1 (middle row), this token exhibits
              strong attention towards both the preceding token "spicy" and the initial token "i", indicated by the distinct colored lines connecting them
              (representing different attention heads). The focus on "spicy" is necessary because "so" appears in different contexts in the training data (e.g.,
              "i like sour so i like" and
              "lemon is so sour"), making
              the immediate preceding context crucial. The attention back to the
              initial "i" further helps
              establish the overall sentence structure ("i like ... so i like ...").
            
            
              Finally, let's examine the last token in the input sequence, the
              second "like" on the right.
              In both Transformer Layer 1 (middle row) and Transformer Layer 2
              (back row), this token shows strong attention directed towards the
              token "spicy". This focus
              is crucial for the model's prediction. The training data contains
              similar sentences such as "i like sweet so i like apple" and "i like sour so i like lemon". The key piece of information that distinguishes the current
              sequence and points towards "chili" as the correct completion is the word "spicy". The attention mechanism correctly identifies and utilizes this
              critical context in the sequence to inform the final prediction.
            
          
        

        
          Conclusion
          
            By radically simplifying the dataset, tokenization, and model
            architecture, this article provided a step-by-step visualization of
            a decoder-only Transformer's internal workings. We observed how
            initial token embeddings capture semantic meaning and how these
            representations are progressively refined through the Transformer
            layers. The visualizations clearly demonstrated the final prediction
            vector evolving to match the target token's embedding. Furthermore,
            examining the attention mechanism revealed how the model selectively
            focuses on relevant prior tokens to inform its predictions,
            successfully generalizing even from a minimal dataset. While highly
            simplified, this approach offers valuable intuition into the
            fundamental processes of information flow and contextual
            understanding within Transformer models.

            <description><![CDATA[From the Zed Blog: You asked, and here it is. Use Claude Code in public beta directly in Zed, built on the new Agent Client Protocol.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[You asked for it. A lot.

So we built it: our Claude Code integration is now available in public beta, running natively in Zed through our new Agent Client Protocol (ACP).
For months, developers have been asking us to bring Claude Code into Zed. We didn’t just want to bolt on a one-off integration; we wanted to build something better. ACP is our new open standard that lets any agent connect to Zed (and other editors, too). Claude Code is a perfect example of what’s possible.
Now you can:

Run Claude Code as a first-class citizen in Zed's high-performance editor, not just a terminal interface
Follow along in real-time as it edits across multiple files, with full syntax highlighting and language server support
Review and approve granular changes in a multibuffer - accept or reject individual code hunks
Keep Claude Code's task list anchored in your sidebar, so you always see what the agent is working on
Define custom workflows with Claude Code's custom slash commands for your most common development tasks

Escape the Terminal
A walkthrough of Claude Code in Zed.
Claude Code has gained broad popularity among developers thanks to its powerful code generation and finely tuned tools. While the command-line interface is powerful, when Claude Code is making changes across multiple files or refactoring complex logic, you may want to see the bigger picture and have more control on what code you accept or reject. With Zed, you get the best of both worlds: Claude Code's intelligence, freed from the terminal and deeply integrated into a highly performant editor.
You can now run Claude Code directly in Zed and use it side-by-side with Zed's first-party agent, Gemini CLI, and any other ACP-compatible agent. Make sure you’re on the latest version of Zed and find your available agents in the Plus menu in the Agent Panel.
Built with ACP
Rather than creating a tightly-coupled integration specific to Claude Code, we built this integration using the Agent Client Protocol. We launched ACP as our open standard for connecting any AI agent with any compatible editor.
We built an adapter that wraps Claude Code's SDK and translates its interactions into ACP's JSON RPC format. This adapter bridges between Claude Code and ACP's standardized interface, allowing Claude Code to run as an independent process while Zed provides the user interface.
We are open sourcing the Claude Code adapter under the Apache license, making it freely available for any editor that’s adopted ACP to use; you can find the source code here. Since the popular CodeCompanion plugin for Neovim has already adopted ACP, Claude Code will also be available in Neovim.
We want to thank GitHub user Xuanwo for all his work since the ACP launch in building an ACP implementation for Claude Code - your speed to solution inspired us to work hard to keep up! We appreciate you for your contribution to the protocol's adoption. Give him a follow on GitHub and Twitter/X.
Bring Any Agent to Zed
We want every agent usable in Zed. Gemini CLI and Claude Code are a great start, and we have more on the way, but there are new agents released every week and many great existing ones not yet speaking the protocol. ACP makes it simple to bring any agent into Zed's, Neovim's, or any other ACP-adapted editor's interface!
This beta delivers as much core Claude Code functionality as possible via the SDK. We're adding features like Plan mode in the coming days, and more advanced capabilities as Anthropic expands SDK support; for example, many built-in slash commands are not yet supported by the SDK. From here:

Building an agent? We want to help you integrate with Zed - reach out with questions.
Want more Claude Code features? Join us in asking Anthropic to bring the SDK to parity with Claude Code or adopt ACP directly.
Ready to contribute? Contribute to or discuss ACP and the Claude Code adapter repos.

We're always looking for feedback on ACP, and welcome contributions from other agent (and client) builders. The more agents that work in Zed, the more choice you have as a developer.Looking for a better editor?
You can try Zed today on macOS or Linux. Download now!We are hiring!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[September 2, 20252 min readMathematicians have unraveled a key conjecture about knot theoryBy Max Springer edited by Sarah Lewin FrasierIn a recent preprint paper, mathematicians connected two knots in a way that could be undone in a surprisingly small number of moves. Amanda MontañezScanning the crowd at a fancy soiree may reveal a wide array of neckties, each fastened with a highly complex mathematical object masquerading as fashion. An entire field of mathematics is devoted to understanding mathematical knots, which one can obtain from any traditional knot by gluing the loose ends together. Mathematicians long believed that if you attach cut ends of two different knots to each other, the new knot will be just as complex as the sum of the individual knots’ complexity. But researchers recently managed to find a knot that is simpler than the sum of its parts.Knot theory is a branch of topology that has surprisingly practical applications, such as understanding how proteins coil DNA and how molecular structures remain stable. The theory’s central question: How can we tell which knots are unique or which are the same as others? Mathematicians consider two knots the same if one can be manipulated to look like the other without being cut open—any knots you can produce with mere tugging and pulling are fundamentally the same. Only cutting and reconnecting to let two strands cross yields unique knots.Using these careful manipulations, mathematicians assign each knot an unknotting number, which is the minimum number of cutting and reconnecting “moves” it would take to unravel the knot into a simple loop. This computation is often deceptively difficult. Many mathematicians assumed that if we construct a larger knot by joining together smaller ones whose unknotting numbers are known, then the quickest way to untangle the larger knot will be by simply undoing each piece independently. This idea that two conjoined knots’ unknotting numbers can be added was first proposed as a conjecture by Hilmar Wendt in a 1937 paper and remained open for nearly a century. Until recently, “there was no clear way to prove this conjecture,” says Mark Brittenham, a mathematician at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, “and now we know why—because it’s false.”On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

The mathematicians connected one knot with an unknotting number of three to its mirror image to form a larger knot. Instead of six moves, this “complicated mess of a [knot]” ultimately can be undone with only five maneuvers and possibly even fewer, Hermiller says.“This is quite surprising,” says Rutgers University mathematician Kristen Hendricks, who was not involved in the study. “The result says that our notions of [knot] complexity could have problems.”So the next time you’re battling a necktie or complicated scarf, take some comfort in knowing that even the simplest-seeming structures can conceal a world of unexpected mathematical complexity.It’s Time to Stand Up for ScienceIf you enjoyed this article, I’d like to ask for your support.
