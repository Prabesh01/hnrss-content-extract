            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        Olympiads are international student intellectual competitions in which students from across the world go toe-to-toe answering questions in mathematics, physics, informatics, chemistry, and more. The best performers tend to be from countries like China, the United States, India, and Japan. But, somehow, the southeastern European country of Romania also frequently tops the list.
Since 2020, Romania’s performance in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) has been nothing short of amazing. In 2022, Romania came in fifth overall, fourth in 2023, and twelfth in 2024. In 2023, Romania placed fourth globally and first in Europe at the International Physics Olympiad, seventeenth globally and third in Europe at the International Olympiad in Informatics, sixth globally and second in Europe in the European Girls’ Mathematical Olympiad, first in the Balkan Mathematical Olympiad—which also included France, Italy, and the United Kingdom—and first in the Central European Olympiad in Informatics. Romania also performed well in the International Chemistry Olympiad and many others.
It’s an understatement to call Romania’s skill in Olympiads merely “overperformance”. Romania’s lackluster performance in international assessments and its relatively small population size of just over 19 million people makes the things they do in Olympiads downright miraculous.
Average Romanian educational performance is unimpressive. Romanian youth routinely perform below the average of OECD countries and near the bottom of the pack of European nations. Romania has a poor-to-mediocre showing whether you include or exclude migrants from the calculations, and its scores on assessments like the PISA aren’t low due to being tainted by bias in the examinations. Romania genuinely underperforms. But underperformance is not the impression you would get if you only knew of Romanian education from Olympiads.
One possibility is that Romanian students have more variable performance on international assessments than students in other countries. No dice: they aren’t much more variable than the student populations in other countries, and a handful of comparably-sized nations with worse Olympiad performance are more variable. Another possibility is that, for some reason, there’s a fat right tail in Romanian educational performance. If this is true, it just doesn’t show up in any existing data. Given the fact that international assessments indicate Romania’s sampling tends to be population-representative, we should have a strong prior against this possibility. Romanian test scores tend to be distributed along a symmetrical bell curve. 
Yet another possibility is that Romania has an undersampled ethnic group that overperforms, but whose schools aren’t tested very well. The only group this might be is Romanian Jews and using them as an explanation is problematic for two reasons. The first is that there are too few to realistically explain Romanian Olympiad performance. The second is that we know the identities of Olympiad participants from Romania, and they don’t seem to be Jewish.
Something else, something more mysterious, explains why Romania is such an outlier in international intellectual competitions. That thing is, in fact, the unique design of the Romanian educational system.
In the late 19th century, Romanian prince regnant Alexandru Ioan Cuza attempted to raise the status of the nation by instituting a mass literacy campaign centered around building free schools that children were compelled to attend. This effort was largely a failure, with literacy failing to break 50% by the 1930s. But World War II precipitated change. In 1948, Romania’s new governing communist party began to bring about serious educational reform at a breakneck pace.The Education Law of 1948 was passed to provoke a military-grade offensive against illiteracy, involving the mass participation of the literate from all walks of life in uplifting the poor, the abandoned, and those who simply shunned education. By the end of the 1950s, illiteracy was practically eradicated among Romania’s youth.
The education system that existed in Romania’s communist period was modeled on the system in place in the Soviet Union, and it included a fair helping of political propaganda in addition to physical labor. The system also overproduced schools, resulting in shoddy but widely available facilities dotting the country. Like the Soviet school system, Romania’s was marked by increasing lengths of compulsory education, poor availability of qualified teachers and educational supplies, high budgetary costs, and an extreme level of credential inflation.
After the fall of communism, the new democratic government went on to shutter many of these schools and to immediately lower compulsory schooling requirements to put an end to the bureaucratic nightmare that Soviet influence had saddled the country with. In the following years, how Romania wished to ration scarce governmental resources for education was a matter of intense debate, and out of that debate came a strong sentiment that, whatever the system, Romanian education would be structured competitively.
Nowadays, the most prestigious Romanian high schools are the National Colleges, or Colegiu Național. These schools are often international and frequently uphold old educational traditions sometimes dating back more than a century. Below these schools are the Liceu Teoretic, which are the norm, offering standard educations. Romania also has three military colleges—Colegiu Militar—managed directly by the Ministry of National Defense. There are also schools focused on service, technical schools, vocational schools, and apprenticeship programs. The brightest students get their pick among these schools after they take the national placement test, the Evaluarea Națională, when they are graduating the 8th grade around ages fourteen to fifteen.
The high school placement test is a standardized test covering Romanian language and literature as well as mathematics. Performance on the examination is reported publicly when students are issued a score on a one-to-ten scale with precision to two decimal places. A student who receives a high grade—say 9.65—would have their pick from most any school, whereas a student scoring 5.00 or below would usually be constrained to a less academically-focused form of education like a vocational program. Most students elect to go to the best school they are able to test into, and so the degree of sorting across schools is very high. To make this setup even more extreme, there is also often—but not universally—sorting within schools, as students select into educational tracks. This is done directly when applying to schools.
At the end of the Romanian high school experience, there is a graduation test, the Bacalaureat, or bac. This test is marked like the entrance examination and, to pass, students must obtain a score of at least five in the subjects they have elected to take. This testing includes written and oral examinations, assessments of foreign language and computer skills, and, for ethnic minorities, assessment of their skill with their maternal language other than Romanian. The need for a given score on this examination can range from requiring just passing to requiring a high score, depending on the university one intends to attend, if that is their goal.
The design of Romania’s educational system makes it perhaps the most stratified educational system in the world. The fact that they have a centralized repository containing all student and teacher educational data makes their system perfect for a high-powered evaluation of exactly what happens when a country opts to hyper-stratify education.
One of the cruel parts of the Romanian system is that, though sorting is nationally available, students do not have equal opportunities to sort. Students located in smaller towns have fewer high school options to select from unless they’re among the few who opt into a military academy, which means joining the military. The extent of sorting is far more intense in areas with larger numbers of schools. In a recent paper, the Romanian economist Andrei Munteanu provided an illustration of how this works: essentially, the fewer schools in a locale, the more each individual school contains students with a wider range of ability and, the more schools in a locale, the more each individual school will be stratified into low, middle, or high ability. 
This combined sorting between schools and tracks means that low-ability students get stuck with other low-ability students, and high-ability students are surrounded by other high-ability students. In effect, peer groups throughout high school are extremely homogeneous. This matters because then low-performing students drag down low-performing students, and high performers cause each other to rise. Romania’s educational system has causal peer impacts on student performance on the graduation test that are very large in both directions, but primarily where there are opportunities for sorting to take place.
Jordan Lasker/The more schools a town has the more intense the sorting of students is. Graduation scores are positively impacted for top performers and negatively for bottom performers with more intense sorting.
But peer effects are not everything to Romania’s exceptional Olympiad performance; they are just the fertile ground in which exceptional performance is fostered. The next part has to do with teachers. Like students, Romania’s teachers must take tests to be able to do what they want to do. Teachers naturally prefer to lecture smarter students, and the smartest teachers have their pick of the schools, and even of the tracks. In a paper with extremely robust results, researchers from the last decade described this as such:
[Teachers] with higher certification standards are more likely to work at better-ranked schools. This sorting persists even within schools as one moves from a weaker to a stronger track, and even within tracks as one moves from a weaker to a stronger class.
The best teachers also opt into towns with more schools. It’s apparent, then, that teachers prefer teaching in the highest-achieving places they can be, both within and between towns. The effect of teacher-student ability pairing is accentuated even more by incentives to compete. The government of Romania is not unique in providing monetary rewards for those who win Olympiads, those who teach winners of Olympiads, or those schools Olympiad winners attend, but they are unique in having all the previously-mentioned institutional characteristics on top of providing comprehensive monetary incentives for Olympiad achievement. 
Romania’s immense success in Olympiads and the widely recognized importance of Olympiad wins for signaling student human capital has also spawned a small number of private schools that advertise their prominence and tutoring capabilities. Many teachers also recommend to parents that they obtain additional tutoring for their brighter pupils, and tutoring services are commonplace. The commonality of tutoring for Olympiad winners is a global constant, whereas the things distinguishing Romania are not.
Two notable factors do not increase performance in the same direction. These are very slight decrements in funding allocated to the highest-ability schools, and when parents reduce the time they spend helping their students with homework, conditional on their kids matching into better schools. Another potential factor that militates against the synchrony of resource allocation in Romania is that children in more selective schools report feeling marginalized because they realize that they’re not as strong of students as they believed. The decrements in funding are likely to be unproblematic, because higher-scoring schools tend to be larger and more urban, lending them economies of scale. Due to this, they may have effectively more funding.
With all the pieces on the board, the key to Romania’s Olympiad success is three-fold: put the best students in the same classrooms, put the best teachers with the best students, and then incentivize schools, teachers, and students each to win Olympiads.
This system has proved amazingly fruitful. Given its underlying human capital, the poverty from its communist legacy, and its modest population size, Romania should not perform the way it does in academic Olympiads. And yet it does. The trade-off for Romania, however, is palpable.
Large portions of Romania’s Olympiad winners leave the country. Because Romania is a member state of the European Union, the people the country has put great effort into training and credentialing are easily able to leave the country and acquire jobs elsewhere.
Losing the right tail to brain drain is damaging for many countries, but it’s arguably worse for Romania because its educational system is so zero-sum: the top performers do better, while the low-performers do worse. This sorting does not “lift all boats,” as it were. In Romania, the system makes for an incredibly well-trained right tail and a neglected left tail, and that left tail might hurt more than the right tail is helped, if effects on test scores are any indication. On its own, Romania’s system might be a stellar boon to the country. But with free movement of talent between countries, Romania ends up subsidizing talent discovery for other countries with less apt educational systems. 
Most of the growth we see around us is due to the innovations of the right tail, and if they do better, we all do better. Though I doubt Romania’s schooling raises the intelligence of the right tail, even raising aptitude is worth something, because we must get capable people to the frontiers of their respective fields in order to innovate, and Romania has fostered a system that seems to do just that. Moreover, even if Olympiad training does not make those on the right tail more capable but instead simply prepares them better, then it can still have large, socially beneficial effects simply through providing Romania’s highly capable people with a means of having their talents recognized internationally. 
But these benefits are returned only very indirectly to Romania, if at all on net. Rather than changing Romania’s educational system or closing the borders, the right solution is for more nations to choose to be like Romania, getting a lot more juice out of their smart kids by designing a system just for them.

Before everything
CGI is neither a demon nor an angel. It is simply a tool. Just like a chef's
knife in the hands of a cook or a sword in the hands of a warrior, you won't use
a sword for cooking, nor you take a chef's knife to the battlefield. The same
goes for CGI, it has its appropriate scenarios, and it should not be misused or
demonized.
CGI is good for:

Low frequency applications, such as system management
Resource limited systems, such as embeding system
Low budget projects, such as personal websites
Prototyping, for fast iterate

CGI is bad for:

High QPS
High traffic
High concurrency

I created a discord channel. If:

You are also a fun of CGI
If you have any problem with nginx-cgi
If you want to get update of nginx-cgi
If you want to know more friends

Please join us: https://discord.gg/EJSfqHHmaR.
Quick start (with Debian 12+, Ubuntu 24.04+)
Build and install:
# checkout source code
git clone https://github.com/pjincz/nginx-cgi
cd nginx-cgi

# build deb package
./build-deb-package.sh

# install built package
dpkg -i ../libnginx-mod-http-cgi_*_amd64.deb 
Then enable cgi in nginx. If you have a newly installed nginx, you can find a
default site at /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default. The default one looks like
this:
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;

    root /var/www/html;

    index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

    server_name _;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}

The default root points to /var/www/html, keep it as it as, and add
following section after location / section.
    location /cgi-bin {
        cgi on;
    }

The newly added section means, for all request under /cgi-bin, turns on cgi
support. Now restart nginx:
systemctl restart nginx
Save following content to /var/www/html/cgi-bin/hello.sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "Content-Type: text/plain"
echo

echo Hello CGI
Add x perm to cgi script:
chmod +x /var/www/html/cgi-bin/hello.sh
Now, try it:
curl http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/hello.sh
If you nothing wrong, you will get an output of Hello CGI.
Build
If you are using latest deb based system, such as Debian and Ubuntu, and not
willing to debug the plugin, you can just following the Quick start to get a
usable deb package.
If you are using Angie, the cgi plugin has already in Angie's official repo.
Please have a look here:
https://en.angie.software/angie/docs/installation/oss_packages/#install-thirdpartymodules-oss
Manual build guide:


Checkout nginx and this plugin
cd <some-where-you-like>
git clone https://github.com/nginx/nginx
git clone https://github.com/pjincz/nginx-cgi


Generate Makefile in nginx dir
cd nginx
./auto/configure --add-dynamic-module=$PWD/../nginx-cgi [...other option...]
If you want to debug the plugin, you may also want --with-debug.
If you want to build a module compatible with system's nginx, you need run
nginx -V to checkout system nginx's build options first.


Make the binary
make


If everything is good, then you will find ngx_http_cgi_module.so under objs
directory.
Usage
Loading plugin
If this plugin is installed to nginx's default module path (such as
/usr/lib/nginx/modules), the plugin will be loaded automatically.
Otherwise, you need to manually load the plugin by load_module.
Add following statement to nginx's top level context to load the plugin:
load_module <dir-of-plugin>/ngx_http_cgi_module.so;

Enable cgi
After loading the plugin, you can add cgi on to location contexts to enable
cgi. Example:
location /cgi-bin {
    cgi on;
}

Once cgi turned on on a location, all nested locations will also have cgi turned
on. If you want to disable cgi for a child location, just use cgi off.
When the location is accessed, nginx-cgi will find the script under the document
root (it's specified by root statement). For example, if you have specify the
document root as /var/www/html, then when you access /cgi-bin/hello.sh,
/var/www/html/cgi-bin/hello.sh will be executed.
Nginx-cgi also support alias, it like root statement in nginx, the only
difference is the location prefix will be removed from uri. For example, if you
want /cgi/hello.sh also reference to the same script, you can do this:
location /cgi {
    alias /var/www/html/cgi-bin;
    cgi on;
}

Hello script
A cgi script can be wrotten by any language. Here's an exmaple with shell. You
can save it to /var/www/html/cgi-bin/hello.sh for testing (if you didn't
change the default document root):
#!/bin/sh

echo "Status: 200 OK"
echo "Content-Type: text/plain"
echo

echo "Hello world"
The first line of the script is a shebang. If you clearly set cgi_interpreter,
it's okay to remove this line, otherwise missing of shebang will causes a 500
error. Some shell allows script be executable even without shebang, but it's not
allowed here. If a script runable by shell, but return 500 error, check the
shebang.
The output of cgi script contains 2 sections: the header section and body
section. The first 2 echo statements output the header section, and the last
echo statement outputs the body section. The echo statement in middle
outputs the separator. Both header section and body section can be empty, but
the separator is mandatory. Missing of separator will causes an 500 error.
All lines in header section will be parsed as normal http response header line.
And then passed to the client side. There's one special header Status, it will
be passed in response status line. If cgi_strict is on, nginx-cgi will check
all cgi output headers, and 500 error will be responsed if invalid header found.
Otherwise, invalid headers will be forwarded to client side too. It's fully
recommanded to keep cgi_strict on.
After separator, all output will be sent to client as body as it is.
x permission
After all, you need to add the x permission to the file:
chmod +x /var/www/html/cgi-bin/hello.sh
Normally, you need x-permission to make script runable. Missing of x-permission
can cause 403 error. If can't do this for any reason, cgi_interpreter can
help.
Request header
Request headers will be parsed and then translated to environment variables and
then passed to cgi script.
For example, you can find the query string in QUERY_STRING environment var.
And access Http-Accept by HTTP_ACCPET.
Here's an example:
#!/bin/sh
echo ""

echo "query string: $QUERY_STRING"
echo "http accept: $HTTP_ACCEPT"
For full list of environment variables, see environment section.
Request body
The request body will be passed via stdin. Here's an example to read all request
body and echo it:
#!/bin/sh
echo ""

body=$(cat)

echo "request body: $body"
Streaming
Nginx-cgi has streaming support for both request and response body. For example,
we can implement a simplest online caculator by bc:
#!/bin/sh
echo ""

bc 2>&1
Then we can test our caculator by curl:
curl 127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/bc.sh --no-progress-meter -T .
The nginx-cgi plugin is smart enough to choose the correct way to return the
request body. If it got all output soon enough, it will output the body in once.
If the output is delayed, it will output the body chunkly(HTTP 1.1) or
streamingly (HTTP 1.0).
Hop-by-hop http headers
Hop-by-hop http headers are not allowed in cgi script output. If it appears
in response here, a 500 error will response to the client.
For more information:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers#hop-by-hop_headers
Tricks && FAQ
I want to list all environment variables
Put following script to your cgi directory, and curl it form your terminal:
#!/bin/sh

echo 'Content-Type: text/plain'
echo

printenv
I want root permission
Put a sudo file to /etc/sudoers.d and run sudo in your script or set
cgi_interpreter as /usr/bin/sudo.
Here's an example of sudo config file:
# allow wwww-data run /var/www/bin/my-danger-script with root account
www-data ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /var/www/bin/my-danger-script

# allow all CGI script be launched with sudo by nginx-cgi directly
www-data ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: SETENV: /var/www/html/cgi-bin/*

How can I run CGI scripts with chroot
It's highly not recommanded to run CGI script with chroot. Because chroot is not
designed for security purpose. It still shared a lot of kernel spaces with host
system. For example, run ps -ef in chrooted process, all processes in host
system will return. That sould not too aweful? No, that's really terrible,
because you can also do kill in chrooted script for the same reason. And
people normally run programs with root permission in chrooted environment.
That's terribly bad. It causes system on high risk than just run script with
www-data.
If you want a sandbox environment, lxc, docker and jails are much better
for this purpose.
If you still want chroot, okay let me show you how to do it.
In this example, I assume you're using /var/www/html as the document root.
Prepare a CGI script first:
mkdir -p /var/www/html/cgi-bin
cat > /var/www/html/cgi-bin/ls.sh <<EOF
#!/bin/sh
echo "Status: 200"
echo "Content-Type: text-plain"
echo
echo "files under /:"
ls /
EOF
chmod +x /var/www/html/cgi-bin/ls.sh

# try it
/var/www/html/cgi-bin/ls.sh
Step 1: prepare a chroot directory.
That're a lot of ways to do this step. debootstrap is a popular way on debian
based system. busybox is the most light way. docker is a modern way.
Let's make a lightest directory with busybox here:
# In this example, I put everything to /var/www/chroot
# Be careful, I download x86_64 busybox version here, you may need to change it
# You need root permission to run all following commands, I'm too lazy to
# prepend sudo to every commands here.

root_dir=/var/www/chroot

mkdir -p "$root_dir/bin" && cd "$root_dir/bin"
wget https://www.busybox.net/downloads/binaries/1.35.0-x86_64-linux-musl/busybox
chmod +x busybox

cd "$root_dir"
mkdir -p $(dirname $(./bin/busybox --list-full) | sort -u)
./bin/busybox --list-full | while read line; do ln -sf /bin/busybox $line; done

# try it
chroot "$root_dir" ls
Step 2: mount document root into chroot dir
mkdir -p /var/www/chroot/var/www/html
mount --bind /var/www/html /var/www/chroot/var/www/html

# try it
ls /var/www/chroot/var/www/html
Notice:


I use a trick here, after chroot, the document root is still the same. By this
we can same some time to do path mapping.


The mounting will not persist after a reboot. You may need to add an entry to
/etc/fstab. Or move /var/www/html into chroot, and make a symbolic link
outside.


Step 3: allow www-data to run chroot with root permission.
cat >/etc/sudoers.d/www-run-with-chroot <<EOF
# allow and only allow www-data run chroot with /var/www/chroot
www-data ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/chroot /var/www/chroot *
EOF
Now everything is ready, add following section to your nginx/angie:
location /cgi-bin {
    cgi on;
    cgi_interpreter /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/chroot /var/www/chroot;
}

try it:
curl 127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/ls.sh
How can I run CGI scripts with docker
In this example, I assume you're using /var/www/html as the document root.
Prepare a CGI script first:
mkdir -p /var/www/html/cgi-bin
cat > /var/www/html/cgi-bin/ls.sh <<EOF
#!/bin/sh
echo "Status: 200"
echo "Content-Type: text-plain"
echo
echo "files under /:"
ls /
EOF
chmod +x /var/www/html/cgi-bin/ls.sh

# try it
/var/www/html/cgi-bin/ls.sh
Create a container and keep running in the background:
# Change -v if necessary
# -d: runs background
# -i -t: keep a terminal
# --restart always: keep container alive
docker run -dit --restart always --name my_cgi_docker -v /var/www:/var/www busybox sh

# try it
docker exec my_cgi_docker /var/www/html/cgi-bin/ls.sh
Allow www-data to run docker commands:
sudo usermod -aG docker www-data

# try it
sudo -u www-data docker exec my_cgi_docker /var/www/html/cgi-bin/ls.sh
Now everything is ready, add following section to your nginx/angie:
location /cgi-bin {
    cgi on;
    cgi_interpreter /usr/bin/docker exec my_cgi_docker;
}

How can I run CGI scripts with jails
Okay, you're a fan of FreeBSD? Me too.
It's really similar to running scripts with chroot.
Here I assume you're using /var/www/html as the document root too.
Prepare a CGI script first:
mkdir -p /var/www/html/cgi-bin
cat > /var/www/html/cgi-bin/ls.sh <<EOF
#!/bin/sh
echo "Status: 200"
echo "Content-Type: text-plain"
echo
echo "files under /:"
ls /
EOF
chmod +x /var/www/html/cgi-bin/ls.sh

# try it
/var/www/html/cgi-bin/ls.sh
Step 1: create a jail
Let's put the jail to /var/www/jail.
mkdir -p /var/www/jail && cd /var/www/jail
fetch https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/$(uname -m)/$(uname -m)/$(uname -r)/base.txz
tar -xvf base.txz -C .

# create mount points
mkdir -p /var/www/jail/var/www/html
touch /var/www/jail/etc/resolv.conf
Put following config to /etc/jail.conf:
www-jail {
    path = "/var/www/jail";
    host.hostname = "www-jail.local";

    exec.clean;
    exec.start = "/bin/sh /etc/rc";
    exec.stop = "/bin/sh /etc/rc.shutdown";

    # mount /var/www/html => /var/www/jail/var/www/html
    exec.prestart += "mount_nullfs /var/www/html /var/www/jail/var/www/html || true";
    mount.devfs;

    # uncomment following lines, if you want to allow network access in jail
    # ip4 = inherit;
    # ip6 = inherit;
    # exec.prestart += "mount_nullfs /etc/resolv.conf /var/www/jail/etc/resolv.conf || true";

    # uncomment fowlling lines, if you also want `ping` available in jail
    # allow.raw_sockets = 1;

    persist; # keep jail if no process runs
}

And ensure that following line appears in /etc/rc.conf:
jail_enable="YES"

And start the jail:
service jail start www-jail

# try it
jexec www-jail ls /
jexec www-jail /var/www/html/cgi-bin/ls.sh
Step 2: allow www to run jexec with root permission.
I uses sudo here. I'm not familiar with doas, if you prefer doas you can
try it yourself. Anyhow, neither sudo nor doas preloaded with FreeBSD. You
need to manually install one of them.
cat >/usr/local/etc/sudoers.d/www-jexec <<EOF
# allow and only allow `www` run `jexec` with `www-jail`
www ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/jexec www-jail *
EOF

# try it
sudo -u www sudo jexec www-jail /var/www/html/cgi-bin/ls.sh
Now everything is ready, add following section to your nginx/angie:
location /cgi-bin {
    cgi on;
    cgi_interpreter /usr/local/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/jexec www-jail;
}

try it:
curl 127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/ls.sh
I want create a long-run background process
Just make sure not to inherit stdout when creating the process (ideally, avoid
inheriting stdin and stderr as well). Here's an example write in shell.
taskid=1234
logfile="/var/lib/my-project/$taskid"
./long-run-task.sh "$taskid" </dev/null >"$logfile" 2>&1 &
Or if you are familiar with pipe operation, just close stdout (also, it's
better to close stdin and stderr as well), http request will finished
immediently. And you can use the process as background process.
exec </dev/null >somewhere 2>&1

# now http response is done, do what every you like
sleep 9999
My http request hangs
As you see abvoing. In CGI world, http request's lifecycle depends on pipe's
(stdout's) lifecycle.
Each child process might inherit the CGI process's pipe. If any process that
inherited stdout remains alive, the HTTP request will never finish.
This may causes confiusing, when you want a long run background or killing
CGI process.
For creating long-run process, see aboving topic.
For killing CGI process, kill the whole process group rather than CGI process
itself.
cgi_pid=...

# don't do this
# kill "$cgi_pid"

# do this
kill -- "-$cgi_pid"
I want to kill my cgi script
See aboving topic.
I want to generate content dynamicaly
Traditionally, people use rewriting to archive this. But it's much easier here.
You can do it with cgi pass. Here's an example to render markdone dynamically:
{
    location ~ ^.*\.md$ {
        cgi_pass /var/www/bin/cgi/render-markdown.sh;
    }
}

#!/bin/sh

set -e

if [ ! -f "${DOCUMENT_ROOT}${PATH_INFO}" ]; then
    echo "Status: 404"
    echo
    exit
fi

echo "Status: 200"
echo "Content-Type: text/html"
echo

echo "<html><body>"
markdown "${DOCUMENT_ROOT}${PATH_INFO}"
echo "</body></html>"
I don't like suffixes in url
Way 1: Removing CGI script's suffix
Way 2: do rewriting
Way 3: cgi pass
How can I response status other than 200
#!/bin/sh

echo "Status: 404"
echo "Content-Type: text/plain"
echo

echo "Welcome to the void"
How can I response a redirection
#!/bin/sh

echo "Status: 302"
echo "Location: https://theuselessweb.com"
echo
How can I get http request body
You can read the request body from stdin. If you're using shell, cat can
quickly save request body to a file.
How can send file to the client
For small files, you can write file to stdout directly.
For large files, it's much better to send a 302 response. Because CGI response
is streaming, protocol cannot easily handle caching, chunked downloads, or
resume support.
I want to write CGI with python, ruby, perl, C, C++...
Go for it. Nginx-cgi don't care what language you use. Just grabs information
from environment var, and read request body from stdin, and write output to
stdout.
Manual
Options
cgi <on|off> or cgi pass <script_path> [script_args...]
Enable or disable cgi module on giving location block.
If you specify on here, the plugin will work in traditional mode. It parses
the request uri first, and then locate the script under document root directory
with request uri. After all it splits request uri to SCRIPT_NAME and
PATH_INFO. This is good if you have an old CGI project or you want to strictly
follow rfc3875.
I also provided a nginx style syntax here. If you specify cgi pass here, the
plugin will skip the step to locate the CGI script. It uses the the value you
provided directly. You can references nginx variables in the second argument,
eg: cgi pass $document_root$uri. The aboving example do something similar to
rfc3875, but not equal. In this form, request uri will be assigned to
PATH_INFO directly. And SCRIPT_NAME will be empty. This form is really good
for dynamic content generating. It gets around the complex and unnecessary uri
re-writing.
Additionally, the second form also provides you the ability to pass additional
args to script, eg: cgi pass my_script.sh $uri. With this, you can totally
avoid confusing rfc3875 environment variables.
If you specify off here, the plugin will be disabled.
Default: off
cgi_pass <script_path>
Alias of cgi pass <script_path>.
cgi_interpreter [interpreter] [args...]
Set interpreter and interpreter args for cgi script.
When this option is not empty, cgi script will be run with giving interpreter.
Otherwise, script will be executed directly.
This option can contains nginx variables, see
https://nginx.org/en/docs/varindex.html for more details.
This option is extremely useful in a lot of senarios, for example:

run CGI scripts missing x-perm
do sudo before executing CGI script
wrap general binary as CGI script
filter CGI script output
...

Default: empty
cgi_working_dir <dir>
Set the working directory of CGI script.
If this value is set to empty, CGI scripts will inherit nginx' working
directory.
If this value is set to an non-empty string, the CGI script will be launched
with giving working directory.
The action of changing working directory may failed. For example, giving
directory doesn't exist, no perm or name too long. In this case, script will
failed to execute.
This option doesn't change the way to find interpreter or script (if they are
specified with related path, they are always related to nginx' working
directory).
This option can contain nginx variable. Althrough I don't know what use this is.
Maybe you can setup different working dir for different server_name by this.
Default: empty
cgi_body_only <on|off>
A standard CGI script should output two parts: header and body. And an empty
line to split those two parts.
If you want to simply run a normal program as CGI program. You can turn this on.
Once this option is enabled, all outout will be treated as response body, and be
sent to the client.
Default: off
cgi_path <PATH>
Change cgi script PATH environment variable.
Default: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
cgi_strict <on|off>
Enable or disable strict mode.
When strict mode turns on, bad cgi header will cause 500 error. When strict mode
turns off, bad cgi header be forward as it is.
Default: on
cgi_set_var <name> <value>
Add and pass extra environment variables to CGI script. The first argument of
this command is the name of environment variable. It should contains only
alphabets, numbers and underscore, and doesn't start with number. The second
argument of this command is the value express of the var. It can contains nginx
variables, see https://nginx.org/en/docs/varindex.html for more details.
This option can appears more than 1 time to set multiple variables. If more than
one option set the same var, then the last one works. These directives are
inherited from the previous configuration level if and only if there's no
cgi_set_var directives defined on the current level.
This option can also be used to override standard CGI vars. This may be useful
in some case, for example hacking old CGI script or simulate standard vars that
are not supported by this plugin now (Such as PATH_TRANSLATED,
REMOTE_IDENT). But it's not recommanded, it may introduce confusing issues to
your system.
cgi_stderr <path>
Redirect cgi stderr to giving file.
By default, nginx-cgi grab cgi script's stderr output and dump it to nginx log.
But this action is somewhat expensive, because it need to create an extra
connection to listen stderr output. If you want to avoid this, you can use this
option to redirect cgi script's stderr output to a file. Or you can even discard
all stderr output by redirect to /dev/null. Also you can use this to redirect
all stderr output to nginx's stderr by set it as /dev/stderr.
cgi_rdns <on|off|double> [required]
Enable or disable reverse dns.
off: disable rdns feature.
on: Do reverse dns before launching cgi script, and pass rdns result to cgi
script via REMOTE_HOST environment variable.
double: After reverse dns, do a forward dns again to check the rdns result. if
result matches, pass result as REMOTE_HOST.
required: If rdns failed, 403, 503 or 500 returns to the client. Depends on
the failure reason of rdns.
If you turns this option on, you need to setup a resolver in nginx too.
Otherwise you will get an error of no resolver defined to resolve.
author notes: do not enable this option, it will makes every request slower.
this feature can be easily implemented by dig -x or nslookup in script. the
only reason I implement this is just to make the module fully compliant with the
rfc3875 standard.
cgi_timeout <t1> [t2]
Send TERM/KILL signals to the CGI process if it runs too long.
If both t1 and t2 equal to 0. Timeout feature is disabled.
If t1 or t2 doesn't equal to 0. A TERM or KILL signal will be sent to
the process after timeout.
If both t1 and t2 not zero. Send TERM at t1 timestamp first. And send
KILL again at t1+t2 timestamp (if process still alive at that timestamp).
If t2 doesn't present, it treated as 0.
Default: 0 0
Standard Environment Variables
Nginx-cgi implemented almost all rfc3875 standard variables. If they cannot
cover all of your usage, you can add your own variable by cgi_set_var. Also
those variables can be overrided by cgi_set_var if you really want to.

AUTH_TYPE, REMOTE_USER (rfc3875 standard)

If cgi script is behind an authorization module (such as
ngx_http_auth_basic_module), and the authorization is succeed, the value is
set to auth type (such as Basic) and authorized user.
If no authorization module enabled, no matter client passes autoriazation header
or not. Those 2 fields are not present.
Authorization header is not visible in cgi script for security reason. If you
really want to do authorization in CGI script, try cgi_set_var.

CONTENT_LENGTH, CONTENT_TYPE (rfc3875 standard)

Same to request header's Content-Length and Content-Type.

GATEWAY_INTERFACE (rfc3875 standard)

Always be CGI/1.1 in this plugin.

PATH_INFO (rfc3875 standard)

Let's say if you have a script under /cgi-bin/hello.sh, and you access
http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/hello.sh/somewhat.
Then PATH_INFO contains the string /somewhat.
Combination with url rewrite or cgi pass, this variable can be used for
dynamic content generating.

PATH_TRANSLATED (rfc3875 standard)

Note: this option is not implemented strictly compliant with rfc3875.
Please avoid this, if you are writing new CGI script.
This is related to PATH_INFO.
Let's say if you have a script under /cgi-bin/hello.sh, and you access
http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/hello.sh/somewhat.
The standard says, the server should try again with http://127.0.0.1/somewhat,
and found out where the uri should mapped to.
For technical reason, I just construct this variable by document root and
PATH_INFO.
The behaviour may be changed in future version.

QUERY_STRING (rfc3875 standard)

Contains the query string of the request. For example, if you are accessing
http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/hello.sh?a=1&b=2, QUERY_STRING will contains
a=1&b=2.

REMOTE_ADDR, (rfc3875 standard)

Client ip address.

REMOTE_HOST (rfc3875 standard)

Client host name. Only available if cgi_rdns is turns on.
If cgi_rdns is on, nginx-cgi will do a reverse DNS, and find a domain matches
REMOTE_ADDR. If any found, it will be set to REMOTE_HOST.
If cgi_rdns is double, after the RDNS, nginx-cgi will do a forward DNS again.
REMOTE_HOST will only be set if the forward DNS result matches the original
address.
See cgi_rdns for more information.

REMOTE_IDENT (rfc3875 standard)

Nginx-cgi plugin doesn't support this for security reason.

REQUEST_METHOD (rfc3875 standard)

Request method of the request, for example: GET, POST...

SCRIPT_NAME (rfc3875 standard)

Path to current script. Normally, you don't need this. It doesn't contains the
full path. See SCRIPT_FILENAME.
The only reason to use this is construct the URI after rewriting. You can use
SCRIPT_NAME + PATH_INFO to get the URI after rewriting.

SERVER_NAME (rfc3875 standard)

Server name, normally it equals to Host header without port part. If Host
header doesn't appear in the request (HTTP/1.0) or contains invalid value, then
this value is set to the reflect server ip address. If the ip address is an ipv6
address, it will be quoted with bracket like [::1].

SERVER_PORT (rfc3875 standard)

Server listening port, such as 80, 443...

SERVER_PROTOCOL (rfc3875 standard)

The protocol used between client and server. Such as HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1...

SERVER_SOFTWARE (rfc3875 standard)

Contains a string of nginx and version, such as nginx/1.27.4.

X_ (rfc3875 standard)

All X- prefixed http request header will be convert to X_ variables. For
example:
If X-a: 123 appears in header, X_A will be set to 123.

HTTP_ (rfc3875 standard)

All other http request header will be convert to HTTP_ variables, for example:
If Accept: */* appears in header, HTTP_ACCEPT will be set to */*.

DOCUMENT_ROOT (non-standard, impled by apache2)

Document root of current location block, see root stmt in nginx.

REMOTE_PORT (non-standard, impled by apache2)

Client port number.

REQUEST_SCHEME (non-standard, impled by apache2)

http or https.

REQUEST_URI (non-standard, impled by apache2)

The raw uri before rewriting. If you want the URL after rewriting, try
SCRIPT_NAME + PATH_INFO.
Note: this variable doesn't same to nginx varible $request_uri. You can find
the document at https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_rewrite.html.

SCRIPT_FILENAME (non-standard, impled by apache2)

The full path to the CGI script.

SERVER_ADDR (non-standard, impled by apache2)

Server ip address. If the server has multiple ip addresses. The value of this
variable can be different if requests came from different interfaces.
Known Issues
PATH_TRANSLATED impl not accurate
By rfc3875, PATH_TRANSLATED should point to the file that as if $PATH_INFO
accessed as uri. But that's really hard to impl on nginx, it need re-trigger
nginx's location process. And those functions are private, cannot access by
plugin directly. The another way to impl it is starting a sub-request, but it's
too expensive, and this var is really rearly used. It's really not worth to do
it. So I simply construct this var by document root and path_info vars.
RDNS impl doesn't access /etc/hosts
Nginx's resolver impl doesn't access /etc/hosts. I don't want to impl an extra
resolver in plugin. So I just ignore this problem.

            Abstract:Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval tasks over the years, with a nascent rise in using them for reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks push embeddings to work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While prior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings, there is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may encounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely simple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the number of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show that this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the test set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the simple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under the existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[When designing software systems, do the simplest thing that could possibly work.
It’s surprising how far you can take this piece of advice. I genuinely think you can do this all the time. You can follow this approach for fixing bugs, for maintaining existing systems, and for architecting new ones.
A lot of engineers design by trying to think of the “ideal” system: something well-factored, near-infinitely scalable, elegantly distributed, and so on. I think this is entirely the wrong way to go about software design. Instead, spend that time understanding the current system deeply, then do the simplest thing that could possibly work.
Simple can be underwhelming
System design requires competence with a lot of different tools: app servers, proxies, databases, caches, queues, and so on. As they gain familiarity with these tools, junior engineers naturally want to use them. It’s fun to construct systems out of many different components! And it feels very satisfying to draw boxes and arrows on a whiteboard - like you’re doing real engineering.
However, as with many skills, real mastery often involves learning when to do less, not more. The fight between an ambitious novice and an old master is a well-worn cliche in martial arts movies: the novice is a blur of motion, flipping and spinning. The master is mostly still. But somehow the novice’s attacks never seem to quite connect, and the master’s eventual attack is decisive.
In software, this means that great software design looks underwhelming. It doesn’t look like anything much is happening at all. You can tell you’re in the presence of great software design because you start having thoughts like “oh, I didn’t realise the problem was that easy” or “oh nice, you don’t actually have to do anything difficult”.
Unicorn is great software design, because it delivers all the most important guarantees in a web server (request isolation, horizontal scaling, crash recovery) by leaning on Unix primitives1. The industry-standard Rails REST API is great software design, because it gives you exactly what you need for a CRUD app in the most boring way possible. I don’t think any of these are impressive software. But they’re impressive feats of design, because they do the simplest thing that could possibly work.
You should do that too! Suppose you’ve got a Golang application that you want to add some kind of rate limiting to. What’s the simplest thing that could possibly work? Your first idea might be to add some kind of persistent storage (say, Redis) to track per-user request counts with a leaky-bucket algorithm. That would work! But do you need a whole new piece of infrastructure? What if instead you kept those per-user request counts in-memory? Sure, you’d lose some rate limiting data when the application is restarted, but does that matter? Actually, are you sure your edge proxy2 doesn’t support rate limiting already? Could you just write a couple of lines in a config file instead of implementing the feature at all?
Maybe your edge proxy doesn’t support rate limiting. Maybe you can’t track it in-memory because you have too many server instances running in parallel, so the tightest rate limit you could enforce that way is too wide. Maybe it’s a dealbreaker if you ever lose rate limiting data, because people are hammering your service that hard. In that case, the simplest thing that could possibly work is adding persistent storage, so you should go and do that. But if you could do one of the easier approaches, wouldn’t you want to?
You really can build a whole application from scratch this way: start with the absolute simplest thing, and then only extend it when you have new requirements that force you to. It sounds silly, but it works. Think of it as taking YAGNI as the ultimate design principle: above single-responsibility, above choosing the best tool for the job, and above “good design”.
What’s wrong with doing the simplest thing?
Of course, there are three big problems with always doing the simplest thing that could possibly work. The first is that, by not anticipating future requirements, you end up with an inflexible system or a big ball of mud. The second is that it’s not clear what “simplest” means, so at worst I’m saying “to design well, always do good design”. The third is that you ought to be building systems that can scale, not systems that just work right now. Let’s take those objections in order.
Big balls of mud
To some engineers, “do the simplest thing that could possibly work” sounds like I’m telling them to stop doing engineering. If the simplest thing is usually a quick kludge, does that mean this advice will inevitably lead to a complete mess? We’ve all seen codebases with hacks stacked on top of hacks, and they definitely don’t look like good design.
But are hacks simple? I actually don’t think so. The problem with a hack or a kludge is precisely that it isn’t simple: that it adds complexity to the codebase by introducing another thing you have to always remember. Hacks are just easier to think of. Figuring out the proper fix is hard because it requires having to understand the entire codebase (or large sections of it). In fact, the proper fix is almost always much simpler than the hack.
It is not easy to do the simplest thing that could possibly work. When you’re looking at a problem, the first few solutions that come to mind are unlikely to be the simplest ones. Figuring out the simplest solution requires considering many different approaches. In other words, it requires doing engineering.
What is simplicity?
Engineers disagree a lot about what constitutes simple code. If “simplest” already means “with good design”, is it just a tautology to say “you should do the simplest thing that could possibly work?” In other words, is Unicorn really simpler than Puma3? Is adding in-memory rate limiting really simpler than using Redis? Here’s a rough, intuitive definition of simplicity4:

Simple systems have fewer “moving pieces”: fewer things you have to think about when you’re working with them
Simple systems are less internally-connected. They are composed from components with clear, straightforward interfaces

Unix processes are simpler than threads (and thus Unicorn is simpler than Puma) because processes are less connected: they do not share memory. This makes a lot of sense to me! But I don’t think it gives you the tools to figure out what’s simpler in every case.
What about in-memory rate limiting vs Redis? On the one hand, in-memory is simpler because you don’t have to think about all the things involved in standing up a separate service with persistent memory. On the other hand, Redis is simpler because the rate limiting guarantees it offers are more straightforward - you don’t have to worry about the case where one server instance thinks a user is rate limited and another one doesn’t.
When I’m not sure what “seems” simpler to me, I like to use this tiebreaker: simple systems are stable. If you’re comparing two states of a software system, and one will require more ongoing work if no requirements change, the other one is simpler. Redis must be deployed and maintained, it can have its own incidents, it requires its own monitoring, it requires a separate deployment in any new environments the service finds itself in, and so on. Thus in-memory rate limiting is simpler than Redis5.
Why wouldn’t you want to be scalable?
A certain type of engineer is now screaming to themselves “but in-memory rate limiting won’t scale!” Doing the simplest thing that could possibly work will emphatically not deliver the most web-scale system. It will deliver a system that works well at the current scale. Is this irresponsible engineering?
No. In my view, the cardinal sin of big tech SaaS engineering is an obsession with scale. I’ve seen so much unavoidable pain caused by over-engineering systems to prepare for several orders of magnitude more than the current scale.
The main reason to not try this is that it doesn’t work. In my experience, for any non-trivial codebase, you can’t anticipate how it will behave at several orders of magnitude more traffic, because you don’t know ahead of time where all the bottlenecks are going to be. At most you can try to make sure you’re ready for 2x or 5x the current traffic, and then stand by to deal with problems as they come in.
The other reason not to try this is that it makes your codebase inflexible. It’s fun to decouple your service into two pieces so they can be scaled independently (I have seen this happen maybe ten times, and I have seen them actually be usefully scaled independently maybe once). But that makes certain features very hard to implement, because they now require coordination over the wire. In the worst case, they require transactions over the wire, which is a genuinely hard engineering problem. Most of the time you just don’t have to do any of this!
Final thoughts
The longer I spend working in tech, the less optimistic I become about our collective ability to predict where a system is going. It’s hard enough to get your head around where a system currently is. And in fact, that’s the main practical difficulty in doing good design: getting an accurate big-picture understanding of the system. Most design is done without that understanding, and most design is thus pretty bad.
There are, broadly speaking, two ways to develop software. The first is to predict what your requirements might look like six months or a year from now, and then design the best system for that purpose. The second is to design the best system for what your requirements actually look like right now: in other words, to do the simplest thing that could possibly work.
edit: this article has gotten some comments on Hacker News.
One interesting comment thread says that simplicity of architecture doesn’t matter at scale, because the complexity of “state space exploration in implementation” (I think that means something like what I wrote about here) dominates any other complexity. I disagree - the more complex your feature interactions become, the more important a simple architecture becomes, because your “complexity budget” is almost exhausted.
I also want to credit Ward Cunningham and Kent Beck for inventing the expression - I genuinely thought I’d just come up with the wording myself, but I almost certainly just remembered it. Oops! Thanks to the HN user ternaryoperator for pointing this out.




It’s just Unix sockets and forked processes! I love Unicorn.

Every tech company has some kind of edge proxy.
↩


I do like Puma and think it’s a good web server. There are definitely use cases where you’d pick it over Unicorn (though in those cases I would personally think hard about using a different language than Ruby).
↩


I’m influenced here by Rich Hickey’s great talk Simple Made Easy. I don’t agree with all of it (I think familiarity does in fact contribute to simplicity in practice) but it’s definitely worth watching.
↩


Of course, if the system has to scale horizontally more than a little bit, in-memory rate limiting won’t work and must be replaced with something like Redis. But in my experience a Golang service can scale a lot without having to scale horizontally to more than a handful of replicas.

            <description><![CDATA[Learn the 8 design principals behind MooseStack - an open source developer toolkit for building TypeScript or Python apps on ClickHouse and open-source data infrastructure.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
TL;DR: · If you’re an engineer building realtime analytics or AI-powered features, you need the right data infrastructure coupled with the right developer experience (DX). · A great DX for data infrastructure should empower both software devs and data engineers, while taking inspiration from the best of modern web development (git-native, local-first, everything as code, CI/CD friendly, etc). · MooseStack by 514 offers a fully open source implementation of a DX layer for ClickHouse.

Data engineering and software engineering are converging.
For years, data infrastructure was built for analysts. Warehouses, lakes, BI dashboards—all SQL-first, point-and-click workflows. But today, analytics isn’t just about reporting or data science. Real-time data is at the center of modern user experiences and AI-readiness. SaaS apps are surfacing analytics and AI directly in their UX to drive adoption, engagement, and retention. Enterprises are accelerating their business with AI-powered automations for faster insights, predictions, and operations.
Engineering teams are on the hook to ship data-backed functionality with the same discipline as any other application code. If you’re coming from the software engineering world, you probably start with a transactional database like Postgres, MySQL or Mongo. The tooling is great, and the developer experience is mature—but those systems are built for transactions, not analytics. As cardinality and scan sizes grow, queries bog down. Dashboards spin. AI chat slows to a crawl.
Alternatively, if you’re coming from the data engineering world, you’re probably on managed analytics platforms like Snowflake, BigQuery, or Databricks. These work well for batch ETL and reporting, but fall short when you need freshness, concurrency, or sub-second response times. They’re also full of rough edges for developers. You don’t get a real local environment. Iteration cycles are slow. They’re just not built for the modern software development lifecycle.
So we’re left with a gap—and it’s two-fold: user experience (UX) and developer experience (DX).

End users want sub-second analytics at application scale. Enter ClickHouse. ClickHouse offers best in class performance on analytical queries—orders of magnitude faster than transactional databases like Postgres, and many times faster and more cost efficient than cloud data warehouses like Snowflake or Databricks. That means snappy dashboards and conversation-speed AI chat for your UX.

Engineers need the same kind of safe, tight iteration loop that’s been taken for granted in web development for twenty years. Interestingly, ClickHouse can run efficiently at any scale, from megabytes to petabytes of data, and can adapt to any type of deployment—from serverless functions, to a container on your laptop, to a cluster of thousands of servers working together. This makes ClickHouse uniquely suited for both a local-first development workflow and massive production scale. But how to build on ClickHouse’s power and flexibility with a full-blown, modern, open source developer experience? Enter MooseStack.

A great data & analytics DX should serve both (1) data engineers leaning into software development best practices, and (2) software engineers leaning into data, analytics and AI. And it should take inspiration from the most innovative tools driving the modern web development experience—like Ruby on Rails, Next.js, TanStack, and Supabase.
In short, a great data & analytics DX should embrace the following core principles:

Git-based version control & governance
Local-first development
Native programming languages (not YAML)
Infrastructure boilerplate abstractions
Horizontal integration, with modularization
Open source native
AI copilot native
Transparent migrations & integrated CI/CD

The remainder of this post explores each of these principles in more detail, while also referencing how they are implemented with MooseStack by 514—an open source developer toolkit for building TypeScript or Python apps on ClickHouse and other open source data infrastructure.
1. Git-based version control and governance 
Version control systems like git are at the heart of the modern software development lifecycle. Make changes, track changes, collaborate on code, etc. This is the norm for any software developer, but not so much with many data & analytics platforms, with cloud-based GUIs and point and click interfaces. And if there is code, it’s not always easy to integrate with git—expecially with browser-based code editors, and heavy-handed cloud-to-local-to-cloud workflows.
A great developer experience should be grounded in a code base that is easily tracked and managed with git.
With MooseStack libraries and tools, you can build your entire user-facing analytics app, or even your data warehouse, in native Typescript or Python, with git integration natively supported - it’s just code.

git-based version control means audit trails for your data contracts

“Data engineering shouldn’t have to trail software development by a decade or more when it comes to developer experience. MooseStack brings the tools and abstractions that you expect from a modern developer framework.”
– Pardhu Gunnam, CEO/Creator of Metaphor Data

The best developer experience for you is in your IDE of choice, not in a browser tab.  Web development figured this out a long time ago. You don’t “yolo” changes directly into a live server. You spin up a dev environment on your laptop that mirrors production. You create a branch, make changes, and immediately see what broke in a live preview of your application. Your build logs tell you if you’ve stranded an import or introduced a syntax error. You have a safe environment to freely experiment and break things, knowing that the worst thing that can happen is your code gets into an error state and you just kill the branch and start a fresh one. By the time you merge, you’ve had multiple layers of validation and review. That workflow gives you confidence. You can see exactly how your changes impact the entire system before they ever hit production.
A great developer experience should provide an isolated, production-like environment to freely experiment and immediately see what breaks in a live preview of your application.
With MooseStack, local development is first-class. “Modern” data platforms tend to be large, distributed, and cloud native—Snowflake and BigQuery won’t run on your laptop. But ClickHouse and other next-gen data infrastructure (like Redpanda, for example) can run locally in a container. MooseStack’s local dev server runs your entire analytics stack in one CLI command: moose dev. Combine that with git-native development, and you’ve got a DX where you can create a branch off main, pull it down, run Moose dev, and all your models running in production are instantly materialized in a local ClickHouse instance for development. Seed it with sample data, and your dev server gives you the full loop—ingest, transform, aggregate, serve—hot-reloaded as you edit code. The same APIs your app calls in production are live in development, so your feature work is always exercising the real data paths and pipelines.

MooseStack’s dev server gives you a local mirror of your production data infrastructure with hot-swapped code changes for your application
In our previous post, we dug into the question, “Does OLAP need an ORM?”. Traditional ORMs can sometimes cause more harm than good, e.g., with leaky abstractions, or by hiding SQL performance implications. But the core idea is worth keeping: modeling tables as objects in application code. That pattern gives you type-safety, IDE auto-completion, and immediate visibility when a change in your schema layer breaks an API in your app layer (or the other way around). In web development, if you change a prop in a React component, your IDE and dev server immediately show you which pages are broken. Analytics deserves the same feedback loop.
For many teams, YAML-based DSLs are the first step toward treating data as code. That’s progress: your schema definitions are at least version-controlled and reviewable, instead of being declared directly into a live database. But YAML is a configuration file format, not a programming language. It can’t express complex business logic—no IF statements, no loops, no variables—so non-trivial transformations end up pushed into shell scripts, SQL fragments, or proprietary templating. The result is fragmentation: schemas live in one place, pipelines in another, and there’s no way to reason about them together at compile time.
A great developer experience should leverage the full capabilities of application programming languages, with schemas represented as native types in the same language where you write your application and pipeline logic.
interface DataModel {
columnName: Key<string>;
	secondColumnName: Date;
}

export const my_table = new OlapTable<DataModel>("table_name")

With MooseStack, everything lives in Typescript or Python: schemas, pipelines, transforms, APIs—all versioned in your repo alongside application logic. Yes, some transformations are still expressed in SQL, but the SQL isn’t floating around as raw strings. It’s written inside language-native templates that reference typed schema objects. Rename a column in your TypeScript interface or Python class, and Moose updates the underlying ClickHouse schema (Moose OLAP) and immediately flags every SQL fragment, stream (Moose Streaming), pipeline (Moose Workflows), or API (Moose APIs) that depends on it. You’re still writing real SQL—but with the safety net and ergonomics of a programming language.
const result = await client.query.execute(sql`
      SELECT 
        ${my_table.columnName} as my_column,
        COUNT(*) as total_records,
      FROM ${my_table} 
      GROUP BY ${my_table.columnName} 
`);

The payoff is that schemas and pipelines evolve together. Changes are surfaced instantly in your IDE and in your dev loop, not hours later in production. You keep SQL where it belongs—as the lingua franca of analytics—but ground it in the same typed codebase as the rest of your application.


“MooseStack abstracts away all the annoying boilerplate, and gives me simple, intuitive primitives to build with, and a local dev server to iterate on.”
– David Der, Chief AI officer, SingleStone

Boilerplate infrastructure code is the worst. You have to get it right, or everything breaks, but it’s hard to get right. And more often than not, there is a best practice way to do it that covers 90%+ of use cases. This is the perfect scenario for abstraction. In modern web development, you don’t configure your router from scratch—you use next.js’s router or TanStack Router, and you use their elegant abstractions. No need to reinvent the wheel every time.
A great developer experience should abstract away commonly used boilerplate code for infrastructure best practices.
Data infrastructure is full of examples like this. Buffering streaming events for batch writes to the database. Runtime data validation and dead letter queueing on data ingestion. Structuring tables for advanced materialized views. MooseStack provides simple abstractions in TypeScript/Python for each of these. So you can focus on the unique business logic of your application, instead of the data infrastructure glue and duct tape.
export const FooPipeline =
 new IngestPipeline<FooDataModel>("myFooPipeline", {
   table: true,
   stream: true,
   api: true,
 });

For example, MooseStack’s IngestPipeline object automatically wires up a complete ingest pipeline, typed to a particular data model. This includes:

An ingest API with runtime data validation, automatic OpenAPI documentation, and optional dead letter queuing
A Redpanda/Kafka streaming buffer with at least once delivery and optional streaming transformations
A ClickHouse table with writes automatically batched to maximize performance



“MooseStack brings together all the modules needed for building end-to-end data services into a simple unified dev framework.”
– Scott Haines, Distinguished Software Engineer, Fortune 100 Brand

Modern web frameworks like Next.js show the power of horizontal integration by bundling routing, rendering, APIs, and deployment into a seamless developer experience. At the same time, tools like TanStack highlight why modularization matters—providing composable, swappable pieces that work across frameworks without lock-in. Data infrastructure tends to be particularly piecemeal, with a sprawling landscape of services surrounding the core database, including streaming, orchestration, connectors, transformations, catalogues, etc.
A great developer experience should leverage integrated workflows for speed, and modular building blocks for long-term flexibility.
MooseStack offers a variety of modules with developer abstractions for all the core parts of a standard analytical backend. These modules can be used independently and swapped out for alternative solutions. For example, you could use the Moose OLAP module to manage your ClickHouse deployment, paired with ClickHouse Cloud’s ClickPipes to bring data in, and FastAPI to layer Python APIs on top. Or if you’ve got an existing ClickHouse cluster, and need to add data from a bespoke source, you could just use the Moose Workflows module to create a custom data connector and pipeline in Typescript. But as you adopt MooseStack across more of your analytical backend, you get the benefits of a unified end-to-end abstraction layer, shared data models and a consistent local development experience.

MooseStack modules and tooling can be used individually, or combined for an end-to-end experience
The modern web development experience is built on open source frameworks and technologies. Open source tooling reduces vendor lock-in, increases trust and security, encourages innovation, and keeps control in the hands of the developer. ClickHouse is, of course, open source. So why would you want to wrap it in a closed-source developer experience that locks you in to a particular vendor?
A great developer experience should be grounded in open source tooling, offering flexibility and transparency.
MooseStack is open source and MIT-licensed, and integrates with the rest of your open source software stack, including:

Data infrastructure: ClickHouse, Kafka, RedPanda, Temporal, Iceberg, Delta Lake, etc
Full stack frameworks: Next.js, Remix, TanStack, etc
Micro frameworks: Flask, fastAPI, Fastify, etc
API standards: OpenAPI, etc
Language Runtimes: Node and Python
Frontend Clients: React, TanStack Query, Streamlit, etc
Transactional ORMs: Prisma, Drizzle, etc
Typing and data validation: Typia, Pydantic, etc
Libraries: all your favorite TS and Python libraries can be imported



“Arming our full stack engineers with MooseStack and Sloan AI agents puts data engineering in the ‘full stack’.”
– C. Rodes Boyd, Bracket Real Estate

Whatever your client of choice, you probably have some kind of copilot helping write code, or even an agent creating entire applications. LLM-powered copilots and agents tend to be pretty good at creating web apps (not perfect of course, but moving quickly in the right direction). The performance here is powered by:

Tons of examples to learn from
Tons of frameworks and abstractions to reduce the complexity and the surface area of interaction
Great local dev experience to iterate quickly to functional output

It turns out, the same things that make a great developer experience for human developers, also make a great developer experience for LLMs and agentic developers.
MooseStack is designed from the ground up to be agentic coder friendly, including:

Following familiar patterns from the transactional world that LLMs are comfortable with
Offering abstractions and reduced surface area to constrain LLMs to viable solutions
Offering great local dev experience to quickly iterate in

And if you want to supercharge your coding co-pilot, Fiveonefour’s Sloan AI (from the creators of MooseStack) offers agents and tools trained specifically on MooseStack to boost your developer experience further.

Using Sloan’s MCP integration with Cursor to create (and immediately test locally!) a new API endpoint on ClickHouse
Of course, development doesn’t stop when you push a commit—you need to get to production. In web development, deployment has matured: innovations like automated governance and CI/CD pipelines in GitHub, and preview branches in Vercel and Supabase, give developers confidence that their production deployments won’t break. That confidence comes from transparency: you can see exactly what will happen before code hits prod, and you know you can safely roll it back if something goes wrong.
A great developer experience should bring confidence and transparency to production deployment for data systems.
With data backends, the stakes are even higher. Shipping a half-applied migration isn’t like breaking a web page—it can corrupt or orphan critical datasets. Analytical/OLAP systems are especially fragile here: schema changes are often non-transactional, meaning there’s no easy rollback. A failed ALTER can leave a table in limbo, requiring you to write and apply your own reverse mutations by hand. Plus, in systems where analysts or external pipelines can also mutate schemas, drift between your code and the live database is common.
MooseStack addresses this head-on with Moose Migrate. Before deploying to production, MooseStack diffs your code against the live schema and generates a migration plan to apply to your production database to update schemas and business logic. You can also generate the plan in advance, to review, edit, and version control your migration. Either way, when you go to deploy, if drift has crept in between your code and the live database state, the migration fails fast, rather than shipping a broken deployment. The result is your application code and schema changes always ship together, in sync.
If you want to go further, Fiveonefour’s Boreal (from the creators of MooseStack) can host and manage your ClickHouse cluster on top of ClickHouse Cloud, along with your data streaming, API endpoints, and pipeline orchestration. Boreal integrates natively with GitHub, so you get one-click deploys, deep integration with your CI/CD workflows, and automatic previews of your dev branches deployed to the cloud. You also get enterprise-grade security, compliance, and observability. Boreal is SOC 2 Type 2 certified and offers logs and metrics endpoints to collect your observability data into your monitoring/alerting tool of choice.

The performance and flexibility of ClickHouse unlocks new ways of approaching data engineering, and new ways of integrating analytics and AI into software applications. But taking full advantage requires a modern developer experience layer, not just a powerful engine. That’s our mission at Fiveonefour with open-source MooseStack: to build upon ClickHouse's powerful core, offering a developer experience that feels as productive and familiar as modern web development.
Give the repo a star if you think it's interesting.

“The developer experience is what really stands out with MooseStack. It’s my go-to now for every new project that needs an analytics backend.”

					Abstract
					Policymakers, public commentators, and researchers often cite the Nordic countries as examples of a socioeconomic model that combines low income inequality with prosperity and growth. This article critically assesses that claim by integrating theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence to explain how the Nordic model functions and why these countries experience low inequality. Our analysis suggests that income equality in the Nordics is largely driven by a significant compression of hourly wages, reducing returns to labor market skills and education. This appears to result from a wage bargaining system characterized by strong coordination within and across industries. This finding challenges other commonly cited explanations for Nordic income equality, such as redistribution through the tax transfer system, public spending on goods that complement employment, and public policies promoting equal skills and human capital. We consider broader lessons for economies aiming to reduce inequality and conclude by highlighting several under-explored or unresolved questions.

            <link>https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/sqlite_durability</link>
            <guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45066999</guid>
            <description><![CDATA[Is SQLite durable by default? What settings guarantee durability? The documentation and even comments from its creator give conflicting answers.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[



One of the most important properties of a database is durability.  Durability means that after a transaction commits, you
can be confident that, absent catastrophic hardware failure, the changes made by the commit won't be lost.  This should
remain true even if the operating system crashes or the system loses power soon after the commit.  On Linux, and most other Unix operating systems, durability is ensured by calling the fsync system call at the right time.



Durability comes at a performance cost, and sometimes applications don't need durability.  Some applications can tolerate
losing the last several seconds of commits in the event of a power failure, as long as the database doesn't end up
corrupted.  Thus, databases typically provide knobs to configure if and when they call fsync.  This is fine, but it's essential
that the database clearly documents what its default durability properties are, and what each configuration setting guarantees.



Unfortunately, SQLite's documentation about its durability properties is far from clear.  I cannot tell whether SQLite is durable
by default, and if not, what are the minimal settings you need to use to ensure durability.


The two relevant configuration
options are journal_mode and synchronous.  journal_mode has several possible values, but most people use either DELETE or WAL.  synchronous has four possible values: EXTRA, FULL, NORMAL, and OFF.



This is how I interpret SQLite's documentation after a careful reading:


The default value of journal_mode is DELETE:The DELETE journaling mode is the normal behavior (source; archived)The default value of synchronous is FULL:If not overridden at compile-time, the default setting is 2 (FULL) (source; archived)The default value of synchronous is FULL even in WAL mode:If not overridden at compile-time, this value is the same as SQLITE_DEFAULT_SYNCHRONOUS. (source; archived)When journal_mode is DELETE, you need to set synchronous to EXTRA to get durability:EXTRA synchronous is like FULL with the addition that the directory containing a rollback journal is synced after that journal is unlinked to commit a transaction in DELETE mode. EXTRA provides additional durability if the commit is followed closely by a power loss. (source; archived)

Edited to add: I confirmed this to be true through testing - see my Hacker News comment for the methodology.

When journal_mode is WAL, FULL is sufficient for durability:With synchronous=FULL in WAL mode, an additional sync operation of the WAL file happens after each transaction commit. The extra WAL sync following each transaction helps ensure that transactions are durable across a power loss (source; archived)Note that this is not mentioned under the definition of FULL, but rather further down in the documentation for synchronous.


Based on the above, I conclude that:


By default, SQLite is not durable, because the default value of journal_mode is DELETE, and the default value of synchronous is FULL, which doesn't provide durability in DELETE mode.If you change journal_mode to WAL, then SQLite is durable, because synchronous=FULL provides durability in WAL mode.




However, a recent Hacker News comment by a user who credibly claims to be Richard Hipp, the creator of SQLite, says:


"In its default configuration, SQLite is durable.""If you switch to WAL mode, the default behavior is that transactions ... are not necessarily durable across OS crashes or power failures"


That's literally the opposite of what the documentation seems to say!



A Hacker News commenter who agrees with my reading of the documentation asked Hipp how his comment is consistent with the documentation, but received no reply.



Hipp also says that WAL mode used to be durable by default, but it was changed after people complained about poor performance.
This surprised me, since I had the impression that SQLite cared deeply about backwards compatibility, and weakening the
default durability setting is a nasty breaking change for any application which needs durability.



There are a couple other pitfalls around SQLite durability that you should be aware of, though I don't necessarily
blame the SQLite project for these:


Libraries that wrap SQLite can override the default value of synchronous.  For example, the most popular Go driver for SQLite sets it to NORMAL when in WAL mode, which does not provide durability.On macOS, fsync is nerfed to make macOS appear faster.  If you want a real fsync, you have to make a different, macOS-specific system call.  SQLite can do this, but it's off by default.


My takeaway is that if you need durability, you'd better set the synchronous option explicitly because who knows what the default is, or what it will be in the future.  With WAL mode, FULL seems to suffice.  As for DELETE mode, who knows if FULL is enough, so you'd better go with EXTRA to be safe. And if your application might be used on macOS, enable fullfsync.



The SQLite project ought to clarify their documentation.  Since the meaning of synchronous depends on the value of journal_mode, I think it would be quite helpful to document the values of synchronous separately for each possible journal_mode, rather than mixing it all together.  A table with synchronous values on one axis and journal_mode on the other which tells you if the combination provides durability would do wonders.



By the way, there are definitely many applications for which losing a few seconds of data in exchange for better performance is a great tradeoff, which is why SQLite and macOS have made the choices they have made.  But programmers need to know what guarantees their tools provide, which is why unclear documentation and breaking previously-held assumptions is not cool.

            <description><![CDATA[Can AI truly collaborate with human coders? Researchers highlight the hurdles and potential solutions in AI-driven software engineering.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the coding sphere, with AI coding tools completing source code, correcting syntax errors, creating inline documentation, and understanding and answering questions about a codebase. As the technology advances beyond automating programming tasks, the idea of full autonomy looms large. Is AI ready to be a real coder?A new paper says not yet—and maps out exactly why. Researchers from Cornell University, MIT CSAIL, Stanford University, and UC Berkeley highlight key challenges that today’s AI models face and outline promising research directions to tackle them. They presented their work at the 2025 International Conference on Machine Learning.The study offers a clear-eyed reality check amid all the hype. “At some level, the technology is powerful and useful already, and it has gotten to the point where programming without these tools just feels primitive,” says Armando Solar-Lezama, a co-author of the paper and an associate director at MIT CSAIL, where he leads the computer-aided programming group. He argues, however, that AI-powered software development has yet to reach “the point where you can really collaborate with these tools the way you can with a human programmer.”Challenges With AI Coding ToolsAccording to the study, AI still struggles with several crucial facets of coding: sweeping scopes involving huge codebases, the extended context lengths of millions of lines of code, higher levels of logical complexity, and long-horizon or long-term planning about the structure and design of code to maintain code quality.Koushik Sen, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley and also a co-author of the paper, cites fixing a memory safety bug as an example. (Such bugs can cause crashes, corrupt data, and open security vulnerabilities.) Software engineers might approach debugging by first determining where the error originates, “which might be far away from where it’s crashing, especially in a large codebase,” Sen explains. They’ll also have to understand the semantics of the code and how it works, and make changes based on that understanding. “You might have to not only fix that bug but change the entire memory management,” he adds.These kinds of complex tasks can be difficult for AI development tools to navigate, resulting in hallucinations about where the bug is or its root cause, as well as irrelevant suggestions or code fixes with subtle problems. “There are many failure points, and I don’t think the current LLMs [large language models] are good at handling that,” says Sen.Among the various paths suggested by the researchers toward solving these AI coding challenges—such as training code LLMs to better collaborate with humans and ensuring human oversight for machine-generated code—the human element endures.“A big part of software development is building a shared vocabulary and a shared understanding of what the problem is and how we want to describe these features. It’s about coming up with the right metaphor for the architecture of our system,” Solar-Lezama says. “It’s something that can be difficult to replicate by a machine. Our interfaces with these tools are still quite narrow compared to all the things that we can do when interacting with real colleagues.”Enhancing AI-Human Collaboration in CodingCreating better interfaces, which today are driven by prompt engineering, is integral for developer productivity in the long run. “If it takes longer to explain to the system all the things you want to do and all the details of what you want to do, then all you have is just programming by another name,” says Solar-Lezama.Shreya Kumar, a software engineer and an associate teaching professor in computer science at the University of Notre Dame who was not involved in the research, echoes the sentiment. “The reason we have a programming language is because we need to be unambiguous. But right now, we’re trying to adjust the prompt [in a way] that the tool will be able to understand,” she says. “We’re adapting to the tool, so instead of the tool serving us, we’re serving the tool. And it is sometimes more work than just writing the code.”As the study notes, one way to address the dilemma of human-AI interaction is for AI systems to learn to quantify uncertainty and communicate proactively, asking for clarification or more information when faced with vague instructions or unclear scenarios. Sen adds that AI models might also be “missing context that I have in my mind as a developer—hidden concepts that are embedded in the code but hard to decipher from it. And if I give any hint to the LLM about what is happening, it might actually make better progress.”For Abhik Roychoudhury, a professor of computer science at the National University of Singapore who was also not involved in the research, a crucial aspect missing from the paper and from most AI-backed software development tools entails capturing user intent.“A software engineer is doing a lot of thinking in understanding the intent of the code. This intent inference—what the program is trying to do, what the program is supposed to do, and the deviation between the two—is what helps in a lot of software engineering tasks. If this outlook can be brought in future AI offerings for software engineering, then it will get closer to what the software engineer does.”Where Does AI Coding Go From Here? Roychoudhury also assumes that many of the challenges identified in the paper are either being worked on now or “would be solved relatively quickly” due to the rapid pace of progress in AI for software engineering. Additionally, he believes that an agentic AI approach can help, viewing significant promise in AI agents for processing requirements specifications and ensuring they can be enforced at the code level.“I feel the automation of software engineering via agents is probably irreversible. I would dare say that it is going to happen,” Roychoudhury says.Sen is of the same view but looks beyond agentic AI initiatives. He pinpoints ideas such as evolutionary algorithms to enhance AI coding skills and projects like AlphaEvolve that employ genetic algorithms “to shuffle the solutions, pick the best ones, and then continue improving those solutions. We need to adopt a similar technology for coding agents, where the code is continuously improving in the background.”However, Roychoudhury cautions that the bigger question lies in “whether you can trust the agent, and this issue of trust will be further exacerbated as more and more of the coding gets automated.”That’s why human supervision remains vital. “There should be a check and verify process. If you want a trustworthy system, you do need to have humans in the loop,” says Notre Dame’s Kumar.Solar-Lezama agrees. “I think it’s always going to be the case that we’re ultimately going to want to build software for people, and that means we have to figure out what it is we want to write,” he says. “In some ways, achieving full automation really means that we get to now work at a different level of abstraction.”So while AI may become a “real coder” in the near future, Roychoudhury acknowledges that it probably won’t gain software developers’ complete trust as a team member, and thus might not be allowed to do its tasks fully autonomously. “That team dynamics—when an AI agent can become a member of the team, what kind of tasks will it be doing, and how the rest of the team will be interacting with the agent—is essentially where the human-AI boundary lies,” he says.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[DeepSeek is a popular open-source large language model (LLM) praised for its strong performance. However, its large size and unique architecture, which uses Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture of Experts (MoE), require an advanced system for efficient serving at scale. In this blog, we explain how we match DeepSeek's inference system performance with SGLang.

Our implementation, shown in the figure above, runs on 12 nodes in the Atlas Cloud, each equipped with 8 H100 GPUs.
It uses prefill-decode disaggregation and large-scale expert parallelism (EP), achieving a speed of 52.3k input tokens per second and 22.3k output tokens per second per node for 2000-token input sequences.
To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first open-source implementation to nearly match the throughput reported in the official DeepSeek blog at large scale.
By deploying this implementation locally, it translates to a cost of $0.20/1M output tokens, which is about one-fifth the cost of the official DeepSeek Chat API.
Compared to vanilla tensor parallelism using the same resources, this optimized strategy improves the output throuhgput by up to 5x.
This blog dives into our parallelism design, optimization methods, and results. All components of our work are fully open-source, allowing others to explore and build on our efforts. The instructions for reproducing our experiments are fully available here.

Parallelism Design
Efficient parallelism is essential to manage the computational complexity and memory demands of DeepSeek's architecture. This section outlines our approach to optimizing key components: attention layers, dense feed-forward networks (FFNs), sparse FFNs, and the language model (LM) head. Each component leverages tailored parallelism strategies to enhance scalability, memory efficiency, and performance.
Attention Layers
DeepSeek employs Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) to effectively model complex dependencies within input sequences. To optimize this mechanism, we implement DP Attention, a data parallelism strategy that eliminates KV cache duplication across devices, significantly reducing memory overhead. Introduced in SGLang v0.4, this approach has been extended to support hybrid data and tensor parallelism, offering flexibility for processing small batch sizes efficiently.
Dense FFNs
Despite using only three dense FFN layers, DeepSeek-V3's computation can significantly increase peak memory usage, potentially leading to system crashes if not carefully managed. To address this, we adopt Data Parallelism (DP) over tensor parallelism (TP), leveraging the following advantages:

Enhanced Scalability: With an intermediate dimension of 18,432, high TP degrees (e.g., TP32) result in inefficient fragmentation into small-unit segments (e.g., 576 units), which are not divisible by 128—a common alignment boundary for modern GPUs such as H100. This misalignment hampers computational efficiency and memory utilization. DP provides a more scalable solution by avoiding fragmentation, ensuring balanced workload distribution across devices.
Optimized Memory Efficiency: Traditionally, TP reduces memory usage as worker size increases, but this advantage diminishes under DP attention. In a pure TP setup, memory demand for a single-layer Transformer model scales with DP size as: $$\text{Memory}=\frac{N_{\text{param}}}{\text{TP}}+(1+k)N_{\text{hidden_state}}\cdot \text{DP}\notag$$ Here, $N_{\text{hidden_state}}=n_\text{token}\times n_\text{hidden_size}$ is the size of the hidden state on each device (DP rank), $N_{\text{param}}=n_\text{intermediate_size}\times n_\text{hidden_size}$ is the number of model parameters, and $k$ is a coefficient representing extra memory overhead from CUDA Graph duplication. By assuming $\text{DP}=\text{TP}$, this memory usage function is minimized when $\text{TP}=\sqrt{\frac{N_{\text{param}}}{(1+k)N_{\text{hidden_state}}}}$. DeepSeek-V3 uses an intermediate size of 18,432. During the prefill phase, CUDA Graph is typically disabled, so $k = 0$. However, the token size per device can easily exceed 2,048, resulting in an optimal TP size of 3 or less. In the decode phase, a practical configuration might use 128 tokens per device and set $k = 3$. In this case, the memory-optimal TP size is 6. In both phases, a lower TP degree minimizes memory usage per device. As a result, DP may offer a more memory-efficient approach for scaling compared to relying solely on TP.
Minimized Communication Overhead: In pure TP, each FFN necessitates two all-reduce operations, resulting in substantial communication overhead. By leveraging DP, we optimize this process to a single reduce-scatter following the prior attention layer and an all-gather before the next, reducing communication costs by 50%. Furthermore, when attention is also computed under pure DP, inter-device communication is entirely eliminated, significantly enhancing overall efficiency.

The integration of DP dense FFN with DP attention is illustrated in the left figure below. Users can enable this feature by setting --moe-dense-tp-size=1.

Sparse FFNs
In DeepSeek-V3's Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, sparse FFNs require substantial expert weights, creating a significant memory bottleneck. To address this, we implement Expert Parallelism (EP), which distributes expert weights across multiple devices. This approach effectively scales memory capacity while maintaining high performance, though it does introduce challenges like irregular all-to-all communication and workload imbalance.
The figure in the right figure above illustrates our EP implementation using the DeepEP framework, with further details on our EP design and optimizations provided in the following sections.
LM Head
The LM head computes output probabilities over a large vocabulary, a resource-intensive operation traditionally handled with vocabulary parallelism to aggregate token logits from TP groups. To enhance scalability and efficiency, we adopt Data Parallelism (DP), mirroring our dense FFN strategy. This reduces memory overhead and simplifies communication across devices, delivering a more streamlined solution.
Prefill and Decode Disaggregation
LLM inference comprises two distinct phases: Prefill and Decode. The Prefill phase is computation-intensive, processing the entire input sequence, while the Decode phase is memory-intensive, managing the Key-Value (KV) cache for token generation. Traditionally, these phases are handled within a unified engine, where combined scheduling of prefill and decode batches introduces inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we introduce Prefill and Decode (PD) Disaggregation in SGLang.
Issues with Unified Scheduling
The conventional unified engine, which processes prefill and decode batches together, results in three significant problems:

Prefill Interruption: Incoming prefill batches frequently interrupt ongoing decode batches, causing substantial delays in token generation.
DP Attention Imbalance: In DP attention, one DP worker may process a prefill batch while another handles a decode batch simultaneously, leading to increased decode latency.
Incompatible with DeepEP: As we will discuss in a later section, DeepEP executes different dispatch modes for prefill and decode, making unified scheduling imcompatible with DeepEP.

PD Disaggregation resolves these by separating the two stages, enabling tailored optimizations for each.
Implementation Details
The PD Disaggregation design in SGLang, depicted in the diagram below, interleaves execution between a Prefill Server and a Decode Server:

Upon receiving an input request, the workflow proceeds as follows:

A Prefill Server and a Decode Server pair via a handshake, establishing a local sender and receiver, respectively.
The Decode Server pre-allocates the KV cache, signaling the Prefill Server to begin the model forward pass and compute the KV caches.
Once computed, the data transfers to the Decode Server, which handles iterative token generation.

This separation ensures each phase operates under optimal conditions, maximizing GPU resource utilization. To further enhance performance, our implementation incorporates:

Non-blocking Transfer: Data send and receive operations run in a background thread, keeping the scheduler’s event loop uninterrupted.
RDMA-Based Transfer: Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) leverages queue pairs for connections and scatter-gather elements (SGE) for efficient transfer of non-contiguous memory chunks.
Flexible API Integration: SGLang offers adaptable APIs that integrate high-performance RDMA libraries like Mooncake and NIXL, streamlining data transfers.

More details can be found in our design document.
Large-scale Expert Parallelism
Expert Parallelism with DeepEP
DeepEP, implemented by the DeepSeek team, is a communication library designed to streamline EP in MoE models. It tackles the challenge of efficiently routing tokens to specific experts across multiple GPUs. By providing optimized communication kernels, DeepEP reduces latency and boosts throughput, making it ideal for large-scale inference tasks.
DeepEP provides two specialized dispatch modes to address varying workload demands:

Normal Dispatch: Optimized for handling long input sequences, such as during the prefill phase, this mode prioritizes maximum computational throughput. However, it generates symbolic shapes that are incompatible with CUDA Graph, rendering it less effective for the decode phase, where kernel launch overhead becomes a significant bottleneck.
Low-Latency Dispatch: Tailored for generating output tokens during the decode phase, this mode prioritizes minimal delay to ensure real-time performance. It supports CUDA Graph but requires preallocating a fixed memory size. If the memory demand exceeds this preallocation, a runtime error occurs.

In SGLang, the integration of DeepEP provides auto mode that dynamically selects between these two dispatch modes based on the workload. However, without PD disaggregation, the auto mode faces a limitation: it cannot simultaneously support both normal dispatch (for prefill) and low-latency dispatch (for decode) within the same communication group. This restriction hinders its compatibility with DP attention, which is crucial for memory-efficient inference. The compatibility of each mode is outlined in the table below:

Long Output
DP Attention
CUDA Graph




Normal
✅
❌
✅
❌


Low-Latency

PD disaggregation addresses this by separating prefill and decode phases, allowing normal dispatch for the prefill phase and low-latency dispatch for the decode phase, both under DP attention. This integration optimizes resource utilization and enhances overall performance by aligning the dispatch mode with the specific needs of each phase.
DeepGEMM Integration
DeepGEMM is another high-efficient library developed by the DeepSeek team, specifically designed to optimize computations in MoE models. It provides two specialized functions for handling MoE-related matrix multiplications (Grouped GEMMs), each tailored to different phases of the inference process.

Grouped GEMMs (contiguous layout): This kernel is designed for dynamic input shapes, making it ideal for the prefill phase of MoE inference. It processes inputs where the data for different experts is concatenated contiguously, allowing for flexible handling of varying input sizes.
Grouped GEMMs (masked layout): This kernel assumes a fixed input shape and uses a mask tensor to compute only the valid portions of the input. It is compatible with CUDA Graph, which optimizes kernel launches, making it well-suited for the decode phase where reducing overhead is critical.

DeepGEMM integrates smoothly with the dispatch modes of DeepEP:

For the contiguous layout kernel, which is used with normal dispatch in the prefill phase, an additional step is required. Since normal dispatch outputs a symbolic shape, a permutation is needed to transform the output into the contiguous format expected by the kernel. We referred to the LightLLM project and implemented a custom Triton kernel for efficient permutation. This kernel ensures that the output from normal dispatch is correctly rearranged, enabling smooth integration with the contiguous GEMM kernel.
The masked layout kernel pairs seamlessly with DeepEP’s low-latency dispatch, as both are optimized for the decode phase and support CUDA Graph.

SGLang also integrates DeepGEMM for MoE computation under tensor parallelism. Additionally, DeepGEMM provides a highly efficient general GeMM kernel, which can be activated in SGLang by setting the environment variable SGL_ENABLE_JIT_DEEPGEMM to 1, offering even greater computational efficiency for non-MoE operations.
Two-batch Overlap
In multi-node environments, limited communication bandwidth can significantly increase overall latency. To tackle this challenge, we implemented Two-batch Overlap (TBO) following DeepSeek's system design. TBO splits a single batch into two micro-batches, allowing computation and communication to overlap, which also lowers peak memory usage by halving the effective batch size. However, putting TBO into practice introduces specific implementation difficulties.
Implementation Challenges
Although DeepSeek released the design framework of TBO, there are two slight implementation challenges.

Code Complexity: Directly coding TBO can lead to duplicated logic for managing multiple micro-batches. This increases the complexity of the codebase, making it harder to maintain and prone to errors, especially as the number of micro-batches or overlapping scenarios grows.
Synchronization Issues in the Prefill Phase: Achieving effective overlap between computation and communication needs consideration when the normal dispatch in DeepEP block the CPU. This blocking behavior can stall the pipeline, leaving the GPU idle and undermining the performance benefits of TBO.

Abstraction for Clean Implementation
To create a more maintainable and reusable codebase, we use an abstraction layer consisting of operations and yield points. This method simplifies development by allowing us to write code as if handling a single micro-batch, while strategically pausing execution by inserting yield points to let other micro-batches proceed. It eliminates code duplication, reduces the potential need for variable postfixes, and efficiently manages cases where some executions complete at a layer's end while others have not. Additionally, it supports easy adaptation to different overlapping region choices or future enhancements, like a three-batch overlap, with minimal code changes. Below is a concise demonstration of this approach:
operations = [
    self._forward_attn,
    YieldOperation(),  # Pause execution for other micro-batches
    self._forward_dispatch,
    self._forward_mlp,
    YieldOperation(),  # Another pause point
    self._forward_combine,
]

# Process a single micro-batch without duplicating code
def _forward_attn(self, state):
    state.hidden_states = self.self_attn(state.hidden_states, ...)

Prefill Overlapping Implementation
We refine the launch order during the prefill phase to avoid CPU-blocking via the dispatch operation in DeepEP, even though we are using its asynchronous mode. Specifically:

The dispatch operation blocks the CPU until the GPU receives metadata from other ranks to allocate correctly sized tensors.
An improper implementation would leave the computation stream idle during this period, as no computation tasks are submitted to the GPU.

To optimize, we prioritize submitting computation tasks to the GPU before launching CPU-blocking communication. This ensures the GPU remains active during communication. As illustrated in the figure below, TBO with a proper launch order, indicated by bolded borders, avoids bubble caused by a CPU-blocking operation (i.e., normal dispatch).

Expert Parallelism Load Balancer
In MoE models, EP often leads to uneven workload distribution across GPUs. This imbalance forces the system to wait for the slowest GPU computation or communication, wasting compute cycles and increasing memory usage due to expert activations. As the number of GPUs (EP size) increases, the imbalance issue gets more severe.
To address this, DeepSeek developed the Expert Parallelism Load Balancer (EPLB). EPLB takes expert distribution statistics as input and computes an optimal arrangement of experts to minimize imbalance. Users can allocate redundant experts (e.g., 32 additional experts), which, when combined with the original 256, create a pool of 288 experts. This pool allows EPLB to strategically place or replicate experts—for instance, duplicating the most frequently used expert multiple times or grouping a moderately used expert with rarely used ones on a single GPU.
Beyond balancing workloads, EPLB offers greater flexibility in parallelism design. With the original 256 experts, parallelism sizes are restricted to powers of two. EPLB’s use of 288 experts enables more diverse configurations, such as parallelism sizes of 12 or 72.
In the figure below, we demonstrate the effects of scale and EPLB algorithm to the imbalance issue via simulation. We compute GPU balancedness as the ratio between mean computation time and maximum computation time for a MoE layer among GPUs, and we use the number of tokens for a GPU to estimate the computation time for it. As can be seen, utilization rate decreases when the system scales with the number of nodes, and enabling EPLB significantly improves the utilization.

EPLB for Real-World Serving
For EPLB to be effective, the input distribution must closely match the actual serving workload. Two strategies enhance this alignment:

Increasing Batch Size: Larger batches reduce random fluctuations in expert usage, which improves balance, which can be achieved by scaling the cluster or using techniques like Multi-Token Prediction (MTP).
Periodic Rebalancing: Regularly updating the expert arrangement leverages temporal locality but requires efficient reloading of experts. This necessitates minimizing the cost of expert reloading operations.

Even with EPLB, some imbalance is inevitable, making further optimization a valuable future direction.
Implementation of Rebalancing
SGLang implements expert rebalancing in three stages to ensure efficiency and minimal disruption:

System Loading Stage: Weights are optionally preloaded from disk to main memory for faster rebalancing or kept on disk with memory mapping (mmap) for reduced memory usage.
Rebalance Preparation Stage: Required weights are asynchronously transferred to device memory in the background, utilizing free DMA hardware engines without interrupting ongoing GPU operations.
Rebalance Execution Stage: A device-to-device copy updates the weights. This step can be further optimized through physical memory rebinding techniques.

This staged approach ensures that rebalancing is both efficient and non-disruptive, maintaining system performance during updates.
Evaluation
End-to-end Performance
Experimental Setup
We evaluated the end-to-end performance of different configurations of SGLang using DeepSeek-V3 on a cluster of 12 nodes, connected via InfiniBand and each equipped with 8 H100 GPUs. This evaluation highlights the throughput improvements enabled by our advanced optimization techniques. We compared the following four settings:

SGLang with TP16 x 6: Every two nodes are paired with an independent group, running DeepSeek-V3 inference with a TP size of 16 and DP attention.
SGLang with PD Disaggregation: This version incorporates PD disaggregation and full EP optimization. For the EPLB, we adopt a distribution matching the input/output data, as real-time serving statistics are unavailable.
SGLang with PD Disaggregation and simulated MTP: To simulate MTP’s effects, we firstly double the batch size and halve the Key-Value KV cache length to maintain the same workload for GroupedGeMM computation and memory access. Moreover, we insert dummy kernels after the real attention computation to ensure the attention phase takes the same time as in DeepSeek’s profile, accurately reflecting the slowdown caused by MTP’s attention mechanism. We conservatively assume a 70% acceptance rate under MTP.
DeepSeek Profile Results: Throughput estimates are derived from DeepSeek’s official profiling data.

Performance Analysis of Prefill and Decode Phases
To accommodate varying workload demands, we independently evaluated the prefill (P) and decode (D) phases, assuming unlimited resources for the non-tested phase to isolate and maximize the load on the tested nodes—mirroring the setup used by DeepSeek. The results are summarized below:

Prefill Phase: On 4 nodes (4×8×H100, EP32), the system achieved per-node throughputs of 57,674, 54,543, and 50,302 tokens per second for prompt lengths of 1K, 2K, and 4K, respectively. As shown in the bar chart below, this represents up to a 3.3× improvement over the TP16 baseline, largely attributable to the optimized GroupedGeMM kernel (DeepGEMM) and two-batch overlap. Assuming a perfectly balanced workload, our system’s throughput is within 5.6% of DeepSeek's official profile.
Decode Phase: Evaluated on 9 nodes (9×8×H100, EP72; half the scale of DeepSeek), the system achieved 22,282 tokens/sec per node for 2K inputs—representing a 5.2× speedup over the TP16 baseline. Under simulated MTP conditions—with attention kernels intentionally slowed to reflect real-world latency—the system sustained a high throughput of 17,373 tokens/sec per node for 4K inputs, just 6.6% below DeepSeek’s official profile. As shown in the figure on the right, these performance gains are largely attributed to 4× larger batch sizes enabled by EP, which enhances scalability by significantly reducing per-GPU memory consumption of model weights.


Profile Results
This section compares SGLang’s performance with DeepSeek’s inference system, aligning our experimental setup as closely as possible to DeepSeek’s production environment. We analyze overall throughput and detailed kernel breakdowns, benchmarking against DeepSeek’s blog and public profile data.
Overall Throughput
For prefill, we tested a scenario with 16,384 tokens per device and an input length of 4,096. Due to uncertainty in DeepSeek’s expert distribution, we evaluated two cases: one with default expert distribution and another with simulated perfect EPLB (random expert selection following group-limited routing semantics) as a performance upper bound.
The results are presented below:

Using half the nodes of DeepSeek, SGLang with simulated MTP is only slightly slower than DeepSeek’s profile. In a higher batch size setting (256 sequences, 2,000 input length), SGLang achieves 22,282 tokens per second per node, demonstrating strong scalability.
Detail Breakdown
The figure below breaks down kernel execution times for prefill, including unit test results as a theoretical upper bound:


Default EPLB: Communication kernels exhibit longer execution times and higher variance compared to DeepSeek’s profile, likely due to greater expert imbalance. This leads to extended computation stream bubbles, slowing down overall performance.
Simulated Perfect EPLB: This setup aligns more closely with DeepSeek’s profile, though discrepancies remain, indicating potential areas for optimization.
Comparison with Unit Tests: Both DeepSeek and SGLang have a communication time slower than unit test results, while the latter is achievable when disabling TBO, revealing a potential optimization direction if communication is the bottleneck.

SGLang’s decode kernel breakdown aligns closely with DeepSeek’s, as shown below:

Key observations include:

Combine Time Discrepancy: SGLang’s combine operation appears 2x slower than DeepSeek’s due to shorter attention computation, causing communication kernels to busy-wait. In the simulated slow attention experiment, combine time matches DeepSeek’s, confirming this hypothesis.
MoE Performance: SGLang’s MoE kernels are 25% slower, possibly because DeepSeek’s 18 nodes (versus our 9) distribute experts more efficiently, reducing memory access overhead for GEMM operations.
Dispatch Optimization Potential: Both DeepSeek and SGLang show dispatch times of ~0.17ms per layer, but unit tests with DeepEP reveal a potential of 0.06ms occupying SMs. Currently, dispatch spends significant time busy-waiting for data. Inserting slow dummy kernels between send/receive operations reduces dispatch time to 0.09ms, and in-flight duration analysis using unit test data suggests further improvements are possible.

While minor enhancements remain—primarily in kernel fusion under "Other Kernels"—SGLang’s decode performance is largely aligned with DeepSeek’s, with prefill optimization as the next focus.
Ablation Study: Two-batch Overlap
Impact of Batch Size and Attention Time
This section investigates TBO performance across varying batch sizes and simulated MTP scenarios.

TBO delivers two significant benefits in the prefill phase, as evidenced by throughput comparisons and memory usage optimizations:

Support for Larger Batch Sizes: In the vanilla configuration, each device processes up to 8,192 tokens before encountering out-of-memory (OOM) errors at 16,384 tokens. TBO mitigates this by optimizing memory usage for input tokens, enabling inference with batches as large as 16,384 tokens per device. This further boosts performance to 40.5% increase when comparing the TBO flag with all other configurations made optimal.
Enhanced Throughput: By overlapping computation (e.g., attention and MLP phases) with communication (e.g., DeepEP Combine and Dispatch), TBO achieves a 27% to 35% throughput increase compared to the vanilla setup, even when processing the same token count per device.

TBO’s impact in the decode phase varies by scenario, with performance tied to batch size and attention processing time:

Real Test Cases: Speedup in practical scenarios is contingent on batch size exceeding a threshold between 64 and 128 tokens. Below this, TBO yields minimal or negative gains (e.g., -27% at 32 tokens/device), as small decode batch sizes hinder kernel efficiency. The speedup reaches 25.5% at 256 tokens with a performance of 22,310 tokens per second.
Simulated MTP Scenario: TBO provides the most substantial speedup in simulated MTP cases when processing 128 requests to generate 256 tokens per decode step. This is due to prolonged attention processing time, which aligns computation (e.g., DP Attention layers) with DeepEP communication overhead (e.g., combine and dispatch steps). The evaluation shows a 35% speedup at 128 sequences/device, with throughput 17,552 tokens per second compared to 12,929 without TBO.

Detail Breakdown
We evaluated three prefill scenarios: TBO with 16k tokens per batch, TBO with 8k tokens, and no-TBO with 8k tokens. The figure below reveals key insights:

TBO Efficiency: Comparing the 8k cases, TBO improves overall efficiency by overlapping computation and communication, as expected.
Batch Size Impact: Reducing the batch size from 16k to 8k with TBO results in a slight slowdown, reflecting diminished kernel efficiency with smaller batches.
Kernel Performance: Interestingly, the no-TBO 8k case outperforms the TBO 16k case in per-kernel speed, despite both having an effective batch size of 8k for kernels. This may stem from reduced streaming multiprocessors (SMs) with TBO, potential noisy neighbor effects during overlap, or kernel incompatibility between computation and communication. These findings suggest future optimization directions for SGLang.


For the decode phase, we analyzed three configurations: TBO with a batch size of 256, no-TBO with 256, and no-TBO with 128. The time breakdown is shown below:

TBO vs. No-TBO (Batch Size 256): Without TBO, communication time increases significantly due to the lack of overlap. However, computation kernels, particularly GEMM, benefit from a larger effective batch size, resulting in faster execution.
TBO (256) vs. No-TBO (128): Comparing cases with the same kernel batch size, only non-overlapped communication slows down in the no-TBO setup, while computation remains consistent. Unlike prefill, decode communication kernels either fully utilize SMs (during send/receive) or none (during inflight waiting), avoiding resource contention with computation kernels.


Ablation Study: EPLB
This section evaluates the impact of the EPLB on system performance through overall throughput analysis and detailed case studies. Given EPLB's sensitivity to workload distribution and distribution shifts in production environments, we focus on qualitative and generalizable insights rather than real-world performance, which requires production data.
Overall Results
The figure below illustrates EPLB's effect on throughput in large-scale settings. EPLB delivers a significant speedup of 1.49x (prefill) and 2.54x (decode), as expected, due to its ability to mitigate workload imbalances across GPUs. As the number of ranks scales, imbalances grow, and EPLB effectively addresses this in our large-scale experiments, leading to notable throughput improvements.

Case Study: Workload Imbalance Versus Overall Throughput
To explore the relationship between workload imbalance and throughput, we conducted a case study using a decode experiment with 1800 input tokens, 100 output tokens, and a batch size of 256. Throughput and balancedness (average token count divided by maximum token count across experts) were plotted against decoding steps:

The results reveal a strong correlation between balancedness and throughput, emphasizing the importance of maintaining high balancedness for optimal performance.
Case Study: Expert Distribution Statistics
The following figure presents expert distribution statistics for prefill and decode sample data:

Key observations include:

Imbalance in Expert Usage: Most experts are infrequently used, while a small subset is heavily utilized, underscoring the inherent imbalance in MoE models.
Prefill vs. Decode Differences: Although prefill and decode distributions share similarities, notable differences exist. This supports the use of PD disaggregation, which enables distinct expert placements for each phase, optimizing performance.

These findings highlight EPLB's role in addressing workload imbalances and the value of tailoring expert placement to phase-specific demands.
Toolkits
Disposable Tensor
Memory management in PyTorch can be challenging due to persistent object references, especially in GPU-intensive workflows where CUDA memory is a scarce resource. Consider the following example:
def ffn(hidden_state: torch.Tensor, linear1: nn.Linear, linear2: nn.Linear):
    intermediate_state = linear1(hidden_state)
    del hidden_state  # Attempt to free memory, but no effect due to external reference
    return linear2(nn.ReLU(intermediate_state))

hidden_state = ffn(hidden_state, linear1, linear2)

In this code, del hidden_state is intended to release the memory occupied by hidden_state after intermediate_state is computed. However, as hidden_state is still referenced outside the function, the del operation has no effect. This increases peak memory usage, risking performance slowdowns or out-of-memory errors.
SGLang addresses this with the DisposableTensor class, a subclass of torch.Tensor which introduces a dispose() method to explicitly and immediately release a tensor’s memory, circumventing Python’s reference counting limitations. Here’s how it works:
def ffn(hidden_state: torch.Tensor, linear1: nn.Linear, linear2: nn.Linear):
    intermediate_state = linear1(hidden_state)
    hidden_state.dispose()  # Immediately releases CUDA memory
    return linear2(nn.ReLU(intermediate_state))

# Wrap the tensor in DisposableTensor
hidden_state = DisposableTensor(hidden_state)
hidden_state = ffn(hidden_state, linear1, linear2)

By wrapping hidden_state in a DisposableTensor and calling dispose() when it’s no longer needed, the CUDA memory is freed right away. This ensures that memory is released as soon as the tensor’s role in the computation is complete, reducing peak memory usage and improving overall efficiency.
Expert Workload Extraction and Simulation
SGLang also includes a toolset for analyzing and simulating expert workload distribution in MoE models. This feature enables users to:

Dump Expert Workload Statistics: Extract either accumulated statistics or per-batch workload data. Accumulated stats support the EPLB manager for real-time optimization, while per-batch data provides granular insights for analysis and simulation.
Simulate Expert Utilization: Model expert balance across various configurations without requiring costly hardware or repeated trials. For instance, users can gather workload data from a modest setup (e.g., 2x8xH100 or 8xH200) and simulate the performance for a large-scale 22-node deployment.

This simulation capability allows users to evaluate how factors like rebalancing frequency, node count, or batch size impact system performance. It’s a cost-effective way to fine-tune configurations before scaling up.
Limitations and Future Work
While our implementation of SGLang for DeepSeek-V3 inference demonstrates significant throughput improvements, several limitations and areas for future enhancement remain:

Latency Optimization: The current focus on throughput leaves Time to First Token (TTFT) at 2–5 seconds and Inter-Token Latency (ITL) at approximately 100ms, requiring further optimizations for real-time use cases.
Sequence Length Constraints: Limited to shorter sequences due to the use of 96 GPUs. Expanding GPU resources would support longer sequences, essential for specific applications.
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) Integration: SGLang supports MTP but lacks full integration with DP attention, reducing efficiency in mixed parallelism configurations.
EPLB Distribution: The experiments in this blog utilizes in-distribution data for Expert Parallelism Load Balancer (EPLB), which may not reflect real-world variability. Future work should experiment performances when having distribution shifts.
Flexible Tensor Parallelism (TP) Sizes: For DeepSeek-V3, memory-optimal TP sizes for dense FFNs are small but larger than 1. Currently, SGLang only supports pure TP or DP, leading to suboptimal memory use. Flexible TP options are needed.
Blackwell Support: Currently, our implementation supports only the NVIDIA Hopper architecture. We are actively working to extend compatibility to the next-generation Blackwell architecture. If you are interested in supporting or sponsoring this development, welcome to contact lmsys.org@gmail.com.

Conclusion
By leveraging PD disaggregation, EP, and a carefully crafted parallelism design, we’ve reproduced DeepSeek’s inference framework in SGLang with exceptional performance. Our open-source efforts—achieving 52.3k input tokens per second and 22.3k output tokens per second—demonstrate SGLang’s power for large-scale LLM inference. We invite the community to explore, replicate, and extend this work to push the boundaries of efficient AI deployment.

Here's a vague overview of what just happened:

I recently applied for
Anthropic's Developer Relations role.
My friend who works there gave me a glowing recommendation (thanks again,
dude!).
I completed their secret take-home assignment.
On top of their secret take-home assignment, I independently published
diggit.dev and a companion blogpost
about my [sincerely] positive experiences with Claude. I was hoping that
some unsolicited "extra credit" would make me look like an
exceptional/ambitious candidate.
I
posted diggit.dev to HackerNews
and it hit the frontpage!
I submitted my take-home assignment and my unsolicited extra credit.
They sent me
the "unfortunately" email.

Anthropic obviously didn't do anything wrong. I'm just bummed.
Claude Code truly is one of my favorite dev tools ever, and if you've suffered
through my talks/interviews, you're probably sick of my
enthusiasm for software. I was particularly excited to interview with Anthropic
because I respect their approach to responsible AI adoption. This very blog
is too often a crazed celebration of humans, of software, of AI, of progress, of
sincerity -- I, I felt like I was a perfect fit.
The first time I flunked an Anthropic interview (ca. 2022), I accidentally
clicked a wrong button during their automated coding challenge. It was easy to
swallow that failure. I made an honest mistake; I expect companies to reject
candidates who make honest mistakes during interviews.
This is different. I didn't misclick any buttons. My best wasn't good enough.
I'm not good enough.
This essay started as a fantasy: some hero at Anthropic reads this on HackerNews
and vouches for me and I get the job and I help them guide humanity toward
post-scarity AI abundance, forever and ever, amen. I'm ashamed of these
thoughts. It's the same folly of explaining to an ex-girlfriend why she's wrong
about her own experience.
Dating was difficult for me. I don't mind feeling ugly or low-status or whatever
-- I know my place. But it hurts to feel seen, feel considered, but ultimately
rejected due to mysterious forces: "He's cute, but he's too weird."
Yes, I'm weird. My eccentric habits have been an overall boon for my career, for
my relationships, for my well-being. But it's moments like these when I just
want to turn all my weird off. I want to be a square peg for this square hole
and do honest work and feed my family and help humanity thrive.
I can't turn my weird off, so I think I defensively dial it up sometimes. I
exaggerate my eccentricities. It's easy to swallow criticism when it isn't the
real me, when it isn't my best, when it's honest mistakes -- what a load
of crap. This is me. This is my best. Hello, world.
Now it's all coming back in waves, in gasps -- I spent so much of my life being
an unlikable jerk. Becoming somebody else has been slow/painful and I'm so
deeply afraid of regressing. Over the past decade, I've been striving to spread
joy, to do good, to be better. I'm trying so hard.
And all this keyboard vomit is a promise to myself that I'm not giving up. I
hate this feeling, and I'm staring these nightmares straight in their stupid
eyeballs, and they're not blinking. I am still alive, and I have so much more to
do.
I'm okay. I mean it. I don't need (or deserve) your sympathy. I'm so lucky to be
alive, at this time, at this place, in this body, with these people. My life is
great, and it will get even better if I keep putting in this effort.
Spewing my insides like this onto The Internet is terrifying, but I suspect many
strangers are facing similar feelings. It's rough out there. Whatever it is,
wherever you are, I hope this helps. You've got this. You're not alone, and
we're only human.]]></content:encoded>
