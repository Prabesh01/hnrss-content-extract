        Some people like to spend $3 on a cup of coffee. While that sounds like a gamble I probably wouldn’t take, I’ll always like to gamble– especially as little as three bucks– on what I might be able to dig up on Buffalo and Western New York, our collective past, and what it means for our future.
I recently came across a big pile of Buffalo News front sections from 1991, every day for the first three months of the year… collected as the First Gulf War unfolded. $3. I probably could have chiseled the guy down a buck, but I happily paid to see what else was in those papers.
There’s plenty about a run up to the first Superbowl appearance ever for the Bills, and mixed in with the disappointment is an air of hope and expectation for what is to come. Harumph. There are also some great local ads commemorating and/or coat-tailing on the Bills success.
We’ll get to those someday, but today, something much simpler. The back page of the front section on Saturday, February 16, 1991 was 4/5ths covered with a Radio Shack ad.
There are 15 electronic gimzo type items on this page, being sold from America’s Technology Store. 13 of the 15 you now always have in your pocket.



So here’s the list of what I’ve replaced with my iPhone.

All weather personal stereo, $11.88. I now use my iPhone with an Otter Box
AM/FM clock radio, $13.88. iPhone.
In-Ear Stereo Phones, $7.88. Came with iPhone.
Microthin calculator, $4.88. Swipe up on iPhone.
Tandy 1000 TL/3, $1599. I actually owned a Tandy 1000, and I used it for games and word processing. I now do most of both of those things on my phone.
VHS Camcorder, $799. iPhone.
Mobile Cellular Telephone, $199. Obvs.
Mobile CB, $49.95. Ad says “You’ll never drive ‘alone’ again!” iPhone.
20-Memory Speed-Dial phone, $29.95.
Deluxe Portable CD Player, $159.95. 80 minutes of music, or 80 hours of music? iPhone.
10-Channel Desktop Scanner, $99.55. I still have a scanner, but I have a scanner app, too. iPhone.
Easiest-to-Use Phone Answerer, $49.95. iPhone voicemail.
Handheld Cassette Tape Recorder, $29.95. I use the Voice Memo app almost daily.
BONUS REPLACEMENT: It’s not an item for sale, but at the bottom of the ad, you’re instructed to ‘check your phone book for the Radio Shack Store nearest you.’  Do you even know how to use a phone book?

You’d have spent $3054.82 in 1991 to buy all the stuff in this ad that you can now do with your phone. That amount is roughly equivalent to about $5100 in 2012 dollars.
The only two items on the page that my phone really can’t replace:

Tiny Dual-Superhet Radar Detector, $79.95. But when is the last time you heard the term “fuzzbuster” anyway?
3-Way speaker with massive 15″ Woofer, $149.95.

It’s nothing new, but it’s a great example of the technology of only two decades ago now replaced by the 3.95 ounce bundle of plastic, glass, and processors in our pockets.
Buffalo story teller  and Historian Steve Cichon brings us along as he explores the nooks and crannies of Buffalo’s past present and future, which can mean  just about anything– twice a week on Trending Buffalo. 
As he collects WNY’s pop culture history, Steve looks for Buffalo’s good stories and creative ways to tell them as the President and founder of Buffalo Stories LLC. He’d love to help your business tell its story. For a decade, he’s also collected and shared Buffalo’s pop culture history at staffannouncer.com.  His latest book, Gimme Jimmy! The James D. Griffin Story, is available now at  www.mayorgriffin.com.

    Key points
    
        Swinburne and CSIRO researchers are investigating ways to produce native metals using materials found on Mars.
              Martian settlements will require large amounts of metal that are difficult to ship from Earth.
              The team have successfully produced iron using regolith simulant that mimics what is available on the Red Planet.
    
  


The idea of building settlements on Mars is a popular goal of billionaires, space agencies and interplanetary enthusiasts.
But construction demands materials, and we can't ship it all from Earth: it cost US$243 million just to send NASA's one tonne Perseverance Rover to the Red Planet.
Unless we're building a settlement for ants, we'll need much, much more stuff. So how do we get it there?
CSIRO Postdoctoral Fellow and Swinburne alum Dr Deddy Nababan has been pondering this question for years. His answer lies in the Martian dirt, known as regolith.
"Sending metals to Mars from Earth might be feasible, but it's not economical. Can you imagine bringing tonnes of metals to Mars? It's just not practical," Dr Nababan says.
"Instead, we can use what's available on Mars. It's called in-situ resource utilisation, or ISRU."

More specifically, Dr Nababan is looking at astrometallurgy — making metals in space.
Building an off-world foundry
As it turns out, Mars has all the ingredients needed to make native metals. This includes iron-rich oxides in regolith and carbon from its thin atmosphere, which acts as a reducing agent.
Swinburne University of Technology astrometallurgist, Professor Akbar Rhamdhani, is working with Dr Nababan to test this process with regolith simulant - an artificial recreation of the stuff found of Mars.
"We picked a simulant with very similar properties to that found at Gale Crater on Mars and processed them on Earth with simulated Mars conditions. This gives us a good idea of how the process would perform off-world," he says.

The simulant is placed inside a chamber at Mars surface pressure and heated at increasing temperatures. The experiments showed pure iron metal formation around 1000°C, with liquid silicon-iron alloys produced around 1400°C.
"At high enough temperatures, all of the metals coalesced into one large droplet. This could then be separated from liquid slag the same way it is on Earth," Professor Rhamdhani says.
Along with Dr Nababan, Prof Rhamdhani is collaborating with CSIRO's Dr Mark Pownceby to further advance the process. They're particularly focused on making metals with zero waste, where the byproducts of the process are used to make useful items.
If you can't ship it, make it
ISRU is a growing area of space science because in rocket launches, every kilogram counts. While the cost of launches is going down, the demands of human exploration are immense.
But huge developments are already happening, including the first demonstration of ISRU off-world. The MOXIE experiment on board the Mars Perseverance rover produced breathable oxygen using only the carbon dioxide in the planet's atmosphere.
Metal production is the next giant leap. Prof Rhamdhani hopes Mars-made alloys could be used as shells for housing or research facilities, and in machinery for excavation.

"There are certainly challenges. We need to better understand how these alloys would perform over time, and of course whether this process can be recreated on the real Martian surface," Prof Rhamdhani says.
But in the meantime, Swinburne and its partners are doubling down. Prof Rhamdhani together with Dr Nababan and Dr Matt Shaw, another CSIRO researcher and Swinburne alum, recently delivered a 4-day bespoke workshop on astrometallurgy in South Korea. The feedback was promising.
"We're starting to see increased interest in this field globally as the world gets serious about Mars exploration," he says.
"To make it happen, we're going to need experts from many fields — mining, engineering, geology, and much more."
For Dr Nababan, the benefits go beyond exploration. He hopes their research will also drive more efficient metallurgy here on Earth.
"By doing this, I wish that I can help the development of space exploration, and at the end it will bring good to human life here on Earth."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[tl;dr:
There's no silver bullet, but if we put some "lead" bullets in the right
places, we have a good shot at keeping sensitive data out of logs."This is the blog version of a talk I gave at LocoMocoSec 2024. It’s
mostly a lightly edited transcript with some screenshots, so if you’d prefer,
you can watch the
video or just
flip through the slides."This post is about how to keep secrets out of logs, and my claim is that (like
many things in security) there isn’t a singular action or silver bullet that
lets you do this. I would go so far as to say that there’s not even an 80/20
rule, where one action fixes 80% of the problem. It’s not like preventing SQL
injection with prepared statements or preventing buffer overflows by using
memory-safe languages.What I will offer instead, are lead bullets, of which there are many. I’m going
to talk about 10 of them. They are imperfect and sometimes unreliable things
that, if put in the right places and with defense-in-depth, can still give us a
real good chance at succeeding. My hope is that by the end, you’ll
have a slightly better framework for how to reason about this problem and some
new ideas to add to your kit.Table of contents:The ProblemCauses🤦 Direct logging🚰 Kitchen sinks🔧 Configuration changes🥧 Embedded secrets📡 Telemetry🕺🏻 User inputFixes (lead bullets)📐 Data architecture🍞 Data transformations🪨 Domain primitivesCompile-timeRun-timeRun-time: part deux🎁 Read-once objects🔎 Taint checkingAwesomeNot awesome🗃️ Log formatters🧪 Unit tests🕵️ Sensitive data scannersSampling🤖 Log pre-processors🦸 PeopleRecapStrategy0. Lay the foundation1. Understand the data flow2. Protect at chokepoints3. Apply defense-in-depth4. Plan for response and recoveryConclusionThe ProblemWith that, let’s dive in and set the table by talking about the problem with
secrets in logs.So, there are some problems that are annoying. And there are some problems that
are difficult.This is both. I’m gonna level with you: I absolutely hate this problem. But I’m
not going to gaslight you and tell you that this is the most important thing to
work on worry about, because it probably isn’t!You have somewhere between 5 and 50 other problems in your backlog that seem
more important, 1 of which you found out about this morning. But I think it’s
likely that none of those problems are nearly as annoying. While researching
this topic, I interviewed about a dozen other engineers and, on this point, they
unanimously agreed! Nobody likes dealing with secrets in logs because it is
extraordinarily annoying.This is a problem that’s also difficult, but not even in the fun sense, like
being technically complex or interesting. Once you catch sensitive data in logs,
it’s usually pretty straightforward (at least in retrospect) to determine how
they got there. But, it’s also surprisingly elusive to prevent, and it crops up
in incredibly unexpected places and ways.Secrets could mean lots of different things to lots of different teams, but I’ll
use it interchangeably with “sensitive data”: stuff that you want to keep
confidential. What’s so frustrating when breaching confidentiality in logs is
the full spectrum of potential impact.In the best case (left), you might log an isolated, internal credential, like
an API key, which (kudos!) you rotate right after fixing the source of leak.
The impact is minimal, and you just move on. Of course, all the way on the other
end of the spectrum (right), you might log something that an attacker or
inside threat could use to do some real harm.And then somewhere in-between, where I suspect most of the incidents lie. You
might log secrets that you unfortunately, can’t rotate yourself. Things like PII
or your customer’s passwords, which are reused on other sites, because of course
they are. And, depending on your policies, threat model, or regulations, you
might choose to issue a disclosure or notification.And it is painful.You could be doing so many good data security practices, like
secure-by-design frameworks, database and field-level encryption, zero-touch
production, access control… but logging bypasses all of that… and ultimately
degrades trust, in your systems and in your company. It feels unfair because
it’s only a fraction of your security story.And this is a problem that happens to companies of all sizes:Something about “plaintext” just kinda stings, especially as a security
practitioner. It’s like… the most profane insult you can hurl at a security
engineer. Imagine retorting with, “Oh yea? Well, you store your passwords in
plaintext!”But logging passwords and storing them in plaintext are… kinda the same thing.Because while logs are rarely or purposefully public, they’re typically afforded
broader access than direct access to your databases.Everyone knows by now that storing plaintext secrets in your database is a
terrible idea. Logs, however, are still data-at-rest, and we should treat them
with the same level of scrutiny.I cherry picked those examples because they are established companies with very
mature security programs. I’m not trying to throw shade; in fact, I deeply
respect them for being public and transparent about this. I think this also
hints that preventing secrets in logs is a deceptively difficult and frustrating
problem.If we can understand some causes, we might gain a deeper appreciation for these
past occurrences, and stand a better chance at avoiding new incidents in the
future.CausesThis is certainly not comprehensive, but from my interviews and personal
experience, here are six of the most common causes.🤦 Direct logging🚰 Kitchen sinks🔧 Configuration changes🥧 Embedded secrets📡 Telemetry🕺🏻 User input🤦 Direct loggingconst temp = res.cookie["session"];

// TODO: remove after testing is done
Logger.info("session HERE", { temp });
Narrator: it was not removed after testing was doneThe first group is perhaps the most obvious and facepalm one: when sensitive
data is directly logged. Sometimes it’s purely accidental, like the example
above: someone wants to debug session cookies in their local environment and
then… accidentally commits the code. Sometimes it comes from an uninformed
position where the developer just doesn’t know any better.These tend to be fairly easy to trace down the exact line of code or commit that
introduces it. With this example, you can just grep the codebase for session here and you’ll find it instantly.🚰 Kitchen sinksconst client = googleSdk.admin(...);
try {
  const res = client.tokens.list(...);
} catch (e) {
  Logger.error("failed fetch", { e });
}
I’m sure you’ve seen or written code like this before. Here we have an API
client or SDK that is used to fetch some data. Exceptions are caught, kind of,
and then promptly logged so that on-call engineers can debug the errors.What happens?That error is decorated with a config object stuffed with secrets and the full
response object, which is also stuffed with secrets, and now they’re both in
your logs!{
  e: {
    status: 400,
    ...
    config: { 💥☠️🪦 },
    response: { 💣😭😱 },
  }
}
I call these “kitchen sinks,” objects that contain or hold secrets, often in
opaque or unexpected ways. Think of an actual kitchen sink that’s filled to the
brim with dirty dishes and you can’t easily tell what’s at the bottom without
reaching into it. Maybe it’s a spoon, or maybe it’s knife and now you have to
go to the hospital. What tends to happen is that the whole kitchen sink gets
logged, and the logging library happily serializes it, including parts that were
actually sensitive.This seems to happen with code that attaches additional data onto errors, or
code that logs full request and response objects. It’s typically a bit hard to
catch in code review unless you know to look for them. If you are blessed with
static types, seeing an any type flow into logs can be a good hint that you’re
logging too much.🔧 Configuration changesNarrator: it was not okayNext example: someone needs additional observability and changes a setting like
the global log level. You know exactly what happens, here. This dev is about to
have a bad time and find out that hope, in fact, is not a valid strategy.We started with an observability problem. Now we also have security problem: brand
new secrets are getting emitted into logs.In that example (that totally never happened to me ever), developers built
production around log levels set to WARN and above, but once you flip it to
DEBUG, all this new stuff comes out of the woodwork.These type of configuration changes tend to involve a system that was built with
one set of assumptions, but some kind of modification moves that system from a
known state into a unknown state, introducing a new set of problems.These often involve low-level or global utilities like logging config, HTTP
middleware, or some central piece of infra like a load balancer. They tend to be
singletons that are difficult or costly to test, or they crop up only at
runtime. On the positive side, it’s usually loud and quick to patch, but cleanup
can be kinda painful.🥧 Embedded secretsapp.get("/login/:slug", async (req, res) => {
  const magicLink = req.params["slug"];
  await login({ magicLink });
});
I completely made up this phrase, but the idea is that secrets are coupled to,
embedded into, and baked into more general formats like URLs or remote
procedure calls. The central idea is that it’s designed into the format and the
system, and can’t easily be separated.Say you have a magic login link handler (see above) where a user can click a
link and sign into a web app. There’s nothing in that code that logs the link,
but if you look at HTTP logs, it’s right there in plain view:47.29.201.179 - - [17/Jul/2024:13:17:10 +0000] "GET /login/Uj79z1pe01...
These types of leaks arise from fundamental designs that don’t take logging into
consideration or incorrectly assume some end-to-end flow. The sensitivity gets lost out of context, and ends up getting logged in another layer,
system, or service.📡 Telemetrytry:
    db_name = os.getenv("DB_NAME")
    db_pass = os.getenv("DB_PASS") # 🤫 Secret!
    conn = db.connect(db_name, db_pass)
    ...
except Error as e:
    # Don't log e! Not today!!11
    Logger.error("failed to connect")
finally:
    conn.close()
Next example: we have some Python code that’s connecting to a database, we’re
specifically NOT logging the error object, and we want to ensure we always close
out the connection.How can db_pass possibly make it into logs? Telemetry!"Oops, that's a log, too!"It turns out that things like error monitoring and analytics can totally be
logs, too. I kind of cheated in the code example, because there’s no mention of
telemetry in it at all, but it turns out that if you hook it up to error
monitoring like Sentry (above), run-time errors send the
local variable context right to the dashboard, and you can see the database
password in plaintext.These causes tend to bypass the central logging pipeline and become Yet Another
Place to have to worry about secrets.🕺🏻 User inputAlright, last example. Say there’s a sign in form and the entire dev team made
super duper sure that the password field is totally locked down from logging,
they read this super awesome post, and took care of all the causes we discussed.What happens?Users end up jamming passwords into the username field!So if you ever looked at login alerts for AWS and saw usernames replaced with
HIDDEN_DUE_TO_SECURITY_REASONS, this is precisely why!Everything that’s within proximity to sensitive user input tends to be
radioactive. It could be a UI issue, but users are surprisingly determined to
volunteer secrets in ways that you haven’t prepared for.We’ve touched on a half dozen causes, and the list of things goes on. We didn’t
even talk about the wonder that is crashdumps. But, I think it’s important to
zoom out and note that these are proximate causes.I stand by my claim that there’s no silver bullet to take these all out. If we
want to avoid playing whack-a-mole, we must bring out our lead bullets that
address these issues at a deeper level, and prevent these kinds of things from
happening.Fixes (lead bullets)So let’s dive in! We will survey 10 fixes, and the order we’ll go in is
somewhere between “a dependency graph of things that build on each other” and
“following the lifecycle of a secret.” Some of these are obvious or perhaps
things you’re already doing, so I’ll focus more on fixes that I think might be a
bit newer. That said, it is worth starting with the basics.📐 Data architecture🍞 Data transformations🪨 Domain primitives🎁 Read-once objects🗃️ Log formatters🧪 Unit tests🕵️ Sensitive data scanners🤖 Log pre-processors🔎 Taint checking🦸 People📐 Data architectureLead bullet #1 is the most basic and high-level: data architecture and
understanding that this is primarily a data flow problem. And part of the
solution is reducing the number of data flows and shrinking the problem space so
you simply have less things to worry about and protect.Instead of stray print statements or components that write directly to
filesystem, you instead centralize all your data flows through a single stream.
Make it so that there’s one and only one way to log something. If you can
understand and control the data structures that enter that funnel, you can
prohibit secrets from exiting it.This has the allure of being a silver bullet, because of course if you can get
to 100% of all the things we mentioned here, you’re golden! But in practice (and
as we’ve seen previously), that’s difficult because secrets find a way to sneak
in or new outflows and side channels are created.🍞 Data transformationsThe previous bullet was about controlling how data flows through your system,
this is about transforming, slicing, and disarming that data into safer forms
that can be logged. These are the data security fundamentals that you’re already
familiar with and likely already doing. This is your bread and butter, so I’m
not going to dive into every one. From top to bottom, this is generally arranged
from awesome to meh… basically, by how much information is retained.TransformationResultMinimization☁ (nothing)Redaction[redacted]Tokenization2706a40d-3d1d…Hashingdaadfab322b59…EncryptionAzKt7vBE7qEuf…Masking··········5309On the top, we have data minimization. The best way to not log secrets, is to
not have secrets to begin with! This is everything from going passwordless to
fetching only the data you need.Redaction is the next best thing. Blanking out the secret parts and before you pass
objects around in memory.Tokenization, hashing, encryption: these all have their pros, cons, and caveats.
Like… are you even doing it correctly?Dead last is masking. You leave parts of the secret intact. Maybe this works for you.
Maybe it doesn’t. Maybe you go straight to jail 🤷When these techniques work, they generally work well. But very often what
happens is that they aren’t used or are used too late, after something is
already logged. These have their places in our toolbox, but my claim again is
one bullet isn’t enough.🪨 Domain primitivesLet’s introduce lead bullet #3: domain primitives. Almost all the secrets you
run across in codebases are encoded in-memory as string primitives, and I think
that makes our jobs harder. Strings can be almost anything.Strings: any sequence of bytes from "" to "c̴̞̑ť̸͈̘̌ h̸͝ ̭̘̊ü̶̜̫̦̠͋̆͠ ļ̵̮̤̟̉̀͂ṹ̴̝̂🤷867-53-0999"const secret = "..."
There’s very little about them——at compile time or run-time——that lets you
know that it’s sensitive, dangerous to log, or somehow different than any other
vanilla string.The alternative is a concept I learned from the book Secure by
Design, and I think it’s one of
the most powerful concepts you can add to your codebase, for logs or anything
else where you want to layer in security at a fundamental level.Domain primitives: “combines secure constructs and value objects to define the
smallest building block of a domain”const secret = new Secret("...")
You use them as basic building blocks that hold secret values, and they provide
security invariants and guarantees that basic string primitives simply cannot.It’s one of the easiest things you can do. If you shift from “any string can be
a secret” to “secrets are secrets”, it makes things a lot easier to reason about
and protect.Compile-time"Check out a previous blog post on branded types, which are fantastic domain primitives with strong
compile-time guardrails."You can use these to great advantage at compile-time, giving developers
immediate feedback right in their editors.We can type a logging function (log()) so that it never accepts secrets.
Then, we use some fetching function that returns secrets, typed as secrets (and
not as strings). If we try to log that secret, it will not compile. The type
system will not let you log this secret.// Types
declare const brand: unique symbol;
type Secret = string & { [brand]: string }; // Branded type that extends string
type NotSecret<T> = T extends Secret ? never : T; // Type that excludes secrets

// Logging function
function log<T extends string>(message: NotSecret<T>) { ... };
const message: string = "this is fine"; // 🧵 string primitive
const secretz: Secret = getSecret();    // 👈 domain primitive

log(message); // 👌 compiles!
log(secretz); // 💥 error!
See this example in the TypeScript Playground.I’m omitting and glossing over a ton of details here, because I don’t want you
to focus on the implementation or even TypeScript, for that matter. The salient
point here is that instead of tossing secret strings around, you brand them as
secret types, providing useful context to both compiler and developer.Run-timeIt’s really easy to get started, even with code that is functionally a no-op.
This is basically the simplest form I can think of—an almost empty
class:class OpenAIToken extends String { /* that could be it! */ }

const token = new OpenAIToken(...);
It’s supposed to represent OpenAI credentials, but it’s just using and extending
basic language primitives. You can introduce these objects where secrets
originate, like password fields or anytime you decrypt sensitive data fetched
from the database. And then layer in behaviors and invariants for where they
tend to end up. You progressively start introducing these at both sources and
sinks, allowing you to control where secrets should or shouldn’t go. You can
embed these into data structures so you know what contains secrets. And along
the way, you increase the clarity and safety of your codebase: not only can you
prevent these tokens from going into logs, you can make sure you’re sending them
only to OpenAI and not to some other API by accident.I think in the long run, domain primitives are the most powerful control we have
because it makes our code secure by design, but it does take some time to get
there. These can easily address the direct logging cause we discussed earlier,
and with some modifications can help with many more.Run-time: part deuxWe can extend this and make it so that the default serialization behavior is
redaction.class Secret extends String {
    toString() { return "[redacted]" } // Override!
}
const secret = new Secret("shhh!");
console.log(secret);
Secret: "[redacted]"
If you try to stuff this into logs, into JSON, into kitchen sinks, into error
monitoring, wherever, it’ll always spit out the word “redacted”. You have to
intentionally reach for the value.Let’s take it further. We can create a custom class with an explicit unwrap()
function:class Secret<T> {
    constructor(private readonly value: T) {}
    toString() { return "[redacted]" } // Override serialization
    unwrap() { return this.value }     // Explicit getter function
}
There’s so many things you can do here, like maybe you want to encrypt or zero it out
in memory, because that’s in your threat model. You can take this as far as you need
to or are comfortable with. We’ll take it just one step further.🎁 Read-once objectsThere’s a bit to unpack here, but these build off domain primitives in a very
powerful way.class Secret<T> {
    private locked = false;
    constructor(private readonly value: T) {}
    toString() { return "[redacted]" }

    /* @returns the sensitive value (once and only once) */
    unwrap() {
        if (this.locked) { throw new Error("already read") }
        this.locked = true;
        return this.value;
    }
}
These objects wrap and keep the secret safe, until you actually
need it. The code in the unwrap() function is the crux: there’s a latch or
lock that activates after the secret is retrieved the first time. It goes into a
“locked” state, and any following reads result in an error that fails loudly.const secret = getSecret();
const res = await authenticate(secret.unwrap()); // Proper usage

Logger.info(secret);          // [redacted]
Logger.info(secret.unwrap()); // 💥 Error!
Once you get a secret (from user input, database, decryption, etc.) you wrap
it in a read-once object immediately and keep it wrapped for as long as you can.
And for its single, intended purpose, like using it for some kind of API
authentication, you unwrap the value, use it, and then the object stays locked
for good. This is surprisingly effective at preventing and detecting
unintentional use. It addresses and disarms many of the proximate causes that we
discussed earlier.This object pairs extremely well with static analysis. Tools like CodeQL or
Semgrep can help ensure that developers aren’t bypassing any safety guarantees.These are generally high signal, especially when you have good unit test
coverage. One drawback is that read-once objects, if handled incorrectly but not
necessarily unsafely, could cause errors at run-time. But I think the tradeoffs
are usually worth it, especially if you complement it with testing, static
analysis, and taint-checking. Speaking of which…🔎 Taint checkingI like to think of taint checking as static analysis with superpowers. I
absolutely love it and the first time I used it, it was like someone just handed
me a lightsaber. Quick review for the uninitiated: the general idea here is that
you add taint to various sources (like database objects), and yell loudly if the
data flows into certain sinks (like logs).The red data flow trace on the right detects the secret flowing into logs. But
the green path is fine, because the secret is tokenized. Let’s walk through a
quick example:
semgrep.dev/playground/s/4bq5LOn the left, we’ve marked a couple sources like decrypt and a database fetcher.
We’ve also marked our logger as a sink, and the tokenize() function as a
sanitizer.On the right in red, we can see that taint was created from the decrypt
function, propagated through the getSSN() function, and then flagged for
going into the logs on line 18.In blue, there’s a much shorter path where the user model from the database is
tainted and then flagged for going into logs.And then lastly, in green, we’re tokenizing the decrypted SSN, so it’s not
flagging that it’s logged.The idea that this is checking millions or more different data flows is the
real magic part for me.AwesomeSome of the strengths of taint analysis: obviously automation. Tracing these
data flows is 100% a job for a machine. This can really help with domain
primitives but also can be used standalone and can even key in on heuristics
like variable names: for example, all variables containing “password”. You can
tie this into all of your critical tools, from code review to CI/CD.This is especially potent against kitchen sinks and embedded secrets, because
those data structures can be tainted by secret values and checked accordingly.Not awesomeSome personal opinions on drawbacks: I do feel like taint checking rules tend to
be a bit difficult to write. I really, really like Semgrep, but I’m also not the
biggest fan of YAML.It also turns out that data flow analysis is an NP-hard problem so for large
codebases and monorepos, you likely can’t run full taint analysis on every pull
request or commit. Because it runs in CI/CD and as part of change management,
when it works, it can prevent the introduction of insecure logging into the
codebase.But, like all of the lead bullets we’ve discussed and will discuss, they can
miss. How can we handle that?🗃️ Log formattersLet’s say we made the mistake of logging too much data with our email service:{
  tenantId: "52902156-7fb6-4ab0-b659-6b07b80cf89a",
  email: {
    subject: "Log in to your account",
    html: '<a href="https://acme.com/login/98fPm...">Click here</a> to log in!',
    from: "AcmeCorp <[email protected]>",
    to: "Darth Plagueis (The Wise) <[email protected]>",
    ...
  },
  response: {
    status: 200,
    originalRequest: {
      headers: {
        Authorization: "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIi..."
      },
      body: '{"html": "<a href=\\"https://acme.com/login/98fP...\\">Click..."}',
      ...
    }
    ....
  },
  ...
}
We have a couple of our usual suspects here. Because we’re logging email
contents, magic links show up in logs… twice! We’re also logging some kitchen
sinks, like email metadata and the original request, so we have PII and
authorization headers also in logs. But because this data is structured, if we
can traverse these objects, it turns out that we can zero in on these leaks
quite effectively.{
  tenantId: "52902156-7fb6-4ab0-b659-6b07b80cf89a",
  email: {
    subject: "Log in to your account",
    html: '<a href="https://acme.com/login/REDACTED">Click here</a> to log in!',
    from: "AcmeCorp <[email protected]>",
    to: "REDACTED",
    ...
  },
  response: {
    status: 200,
    originalRequest: {
      headers: "REDACTED",
      body: '{"html": "<a href=\\"https://acme.com/login/REDACTED\\">..."}',
      ...
    }
    ....
  },
  ...
}
If we can introspect these objects, we can scan for dangerous substrings like our
login links, and then drop or redact them. Or we can drop whole values, if we
know that certain paths like email.to are particularly dangerous. Fields like
request or headers tend to be risky objects that we can also remove. We can
even drop the whole log object if it doesn’t meet some admission criteria,
or—we can simply error out.So, how and where do we deploy something like this? Most application loggers
should have some type of middleware stack or pipeline, kinda like here on the
right. These are typically configured for operations like converting objects
into JSON, turning error objects into readable formats, or enriching logs by
inserting useful context like network information. We can invert that, and
instead of enriching with useful data, we can remove or redact sensitive data.export const logger = createLogger({
  format: format.combine(
    transform(),
    handleErrors(),
    enrich(),

      redact(), // 👈 insert here!

    truncate(),
    jsonify(),
    ...
  ),
  ...
});
This is a type of guardrail that helps catch many of the common problems we
described previously, like request headers or config objects. I’ve used this
with decent success and found that it works best as a rifle instead of a
shotgun. Because it’s at the application tier, you can customize it for the type
of data or context that each application handles. For example, we can make it so
that any of our domain primitives that reach this layer are quickly detected and
removed.This is extremely cheap to introduce, but there are some trade-offs. It’s
certainly more of a safety net than hard control, and a developer determined to
bypass it, can and will. Steady state, I measured this at less than 1% of clock
time, but there are some deeply unfortunate ways this can go wrong such as
poorly written regexes and self-ReDoS.More or less, these risks can be mitigated with solid unit-testing. Which leads
us to…🧪 Unit testsLead bullet #7: hooking into and using the existing test suite—that’s already
there—to our advantage. We can use several of the tools we discussed, but
instead of simply detecting or redacting secrets, we can ramp up the sensitivity
in our test environment to fail or error loudly.TechniqueProdTest🪨 Domain primitivesRedactError🎁 Read-once objectsErrorError🗃️ Log formattersRedactError🕵️ Sensitive data scannersDetectErrorI’ll cover sensitive data scanners next, but many test suites are already set up
to capture stdout and stderr, and so you can even point your scanners to
these capture buffers.The takeaway here is that you can reap the same benefits of CI/CD and change
management by catching unsafe code before it’s merged or deployed, but of
course, you’re also dependent on coverage and if the right code and data paths
are exercised.🕵️ Sensitive data scannersThese are fairly blunt but effective tools that can discover and remove
sensitive data. I’m actively going to avoid diving deep here, because it does
seem like many teams and vendors focus on this as the solution. So instead, I’d
like to pose a few questions that might help you reason about trade-offs:Where and when in your logging pipeline is it most effective?Is it a gate, in-line of the critical path, or does it scan asynchronously?Do you simply want to detect or do you bias towards masking and
redaction? How will your team handle and deal with false positives?How far do the general, out-of-box rules take you? Can you tailor it
specifically to your usage patterns?Can you verify the credentials? Can that even keep up with log throughput?And then perhaps what tends to be the long pole in the tent: what are the
costs, and can you sample instead?I think these tools tend to be better suited for defense-in-depth, because
they presume that secrets made it into logs to begin with. They can help catch the
more elusive causes we discussed like configuration changes or user input.SamplingA very brief segue into sampling. Logs tend to have a kind of power law
distribution, where certain types of logs vastly outnumber others. And typically
what you see is that log sources have static points in code, generally with the
same type of data running through them. And so within each log type, scanning
and finding a single true positive might be highly representative of that group.And so you might run into a scenario where, given some global sample rate,
you’re wasting a lot of work for high frequency logs and not even scanning lower
frequency logs. I think a better alternative to a global sample rate is to
aggregate logs by some heuristic like type or origin, and to ensure you hit some
minimum threshold.In practice, I’ve found this difficult or impossible to configure with
out-of-box solutions. I’ve had to introduce additional infrastructure to help.
And that’s our next lead bullet.🤖 Log pre-processorsSecond to last lead bullet, #9: log pre-processors. These sit between apps that
emit logs, and the final data stores.In the above example, something like Vector can receive
and process logs from our microservices before dispatching them to DataDog or
wherever logs end up. We can configure it to drop sensitive data in-place using
many of the techniques we discussed before. And we can sample some subset of
them and store them onto an S3 bucket, using a more powerful tool like
Trufflehog or an LLM to catch
and verify secrets.The idea here is to process logs streams before they’re persisted. It doesn’t
need to be Vector, chances are, you already have this existing infrastructure
that’s used for deduping, aggregation, and dropping noisy debug logs. We can
re-use it to prevent and detect secrets in logs. This pairs very well with
sensitive data scanners that we discussed earlier, and might even unlock new
ones you thought were out of reach.🦸 People“Human practitioners are the adaptable element of complex systems.
Practitioners and first line management actively adapt the system to maximize
production and minimize accidents.”-Richard Cook, https://how.complexsystems.fail/#12Our last stop is people. Modern software is a complex system. And while people
will write the code that accidentally introduces sensitive data into logs,
they’re also the ones that will report, respond, and fix them. They’ll build out
the systems and infrastructure that will keep these complex systems safe. And
early on in your maturity story and before you’re able to build out
secure-by-design frameworks, this is the lead bullet you’ll most likely use the
most.The most important message I want to convey here is that your security team isn’t
alone, especially if you:educate your teammates on secure logging designempower them to report and address these issuesand equip them with tools that get out of their way and helps them succeed.RecapAlright, so we’ve covered lead bullets that protect code, protect data, and
protect logs:📐 Data architecture🍞 Data transformations🪨 Domain primitives🎁 Read-once objects🗃️ Log formatters🧪 Unit tests🕵️ Sensitive data scanners🤖 Log pre-processors🔎 Taint checking🦸 PeopleSome of these might work for you, some of these won’t, and some that we haven’t
even mentioned could be a homerun for you. Maybe you have super tight control
over your log schemas or maybe you’re using LLMs in a really neat and effective
way. Or maybe you’re building or using a language that has first class support
for controlling secrets.These worked for me. I have some personal opinions on ones which are
foundational, some that are powerful in the long-run, and some that are really
easy to get started. But your story is different, so I’d like to zoom
out and close out with a high-level, methodical strategy that you can apply for
your security programs, and that we’ll apply and walk through with an example.StrategyHere’s a general strategy:Lay the foundationUnderstand the data ﬂowProtect at chokepointsApply defense-in-depthPlan for response and recoveryI’m not shooting for a Nobel, here. You’re probably doing some of these already,
and chances are, you have some type of playbook or process that looks just like
this. The key idea here is to not miss the forest for the trees, and use these
explicit steps to place our efforts where they’ll matter most. I’ll walk you
through a hypothetical system and we’ll apply these in order.0. Lay the foundationStep zero is the foundation. Table stakes. This is like the base tier of
Maslow’s hierarchy, and we need these before we try anything else.Developing expectations, culture, and support is a must-have. They’re easy to
ignore or forget about, but can make or break success. If you work at place that
hasn’t addressed these in the past, it can be quite jarring or difficult to
shift that mentality.I don’t have a ton of advice here other than making sure your org is aligned on
this. It’ll probably feel like it’s getting worse before it’s getting better,
but that is a sign of progress. A great litmus test for a solid foundation is if
developers will (or already have) come to you to report secrets they found in
logs.The second thing we’ll need is to decide is what we consider a secret to begin
with. I, admittedly, used secrets and sensitive data interchangeably. This may
not be the case for you. It doesn’t need to be perfect or comprehensive, and
maybe it’s just a framework. But employees, especially the security team, need
common understanding.The third item is technical. If our logs aren’t structured or aren’t JSON, it’ll
make this endeavor a lot more difficult. A lot of the techniques we discussed
just won’t work. If we don’t have that central pipeline or there isn’t One and
Only One Way to both dispatch and view logs, we’ll have to do a lot more
lifting. We’ve seen a few ways that logs bypass this, but having a central
pipeline should cover most of the bases.1. Understand the data flowWith the foundation laid, the next best thing to do is to understand and chart
out how secrets flow through your system. This is basically a Data Flow Diagram,
and we’ll go through a fairly modest example.On the left, we have users that visit some type of single-page web app. Requests
and data flow through an application load balancer to several web application
services running in containers. This is our core compute and where all the
application code runs. Let’s assume that these are disparate microservices
processing all types of data, some of which are considered secret. For the most
sensitive data, they use KMS to encrypt and then store the ciphertext blobs in
their respective database.And then, applications use a standard logging library to emit to stdout, which
gets shipped to CloudWatch and then forwarded to Datadog. That’s the final stop,
and that’s where employees, devs, support staff, etc. can view them.I highly recommend going through an exercise like this, because not only does it
force you to understand the flows and boundaries of the system, if you spend
time at each node and threat model it, you end up finding a bunch of unexpected
ways and places that secrets make it into logs. For example…Front-end analytics! It turns out that secrets from things like form contents
to session replays could end up getting sent to your user analytics platform.And then what about our application load balancers? These ship their HTTP logs
directly to CloudWatch, so we could be logging embedded secrets in URLs, and
it’s totally bypassing our application tiers.Last surprise: error monitoring! Let’s just say that some team wired up Sentry
instead of DataDog for error monitoring, because of course they did, and now
you have another stream of secrets in logs.We could go further, and we haven’t even drilled into application architecture,
but I think this is a good time to move from discovery to action.2. Protect at chokepointsThe next step we want to take is to protect the chokepoints. And if some flow
isn’t going through that chokepoint, like our rogue team that yeeted Sentry
into prod, we fix it! We can get rid of Sentry and get that team onto the paved
path of our logging pipeline.We have a very clear chokepoint; a narrow path that most logs eventually flow
through. Here’s where most of our lead bullets should go.Here’s that chokepoint splayed out. I also added an upstream node to represent
CI/CD, because that’s how code get into our apps. We can then put the bulk of
our protective controls here on the critical path.We can re-architect the app to use a single logging library and
secure-by-default domain primitives. Then we could use those to build out and
augment our static analysis, taint-checking, and unit tests. These give us a
decent front-line defense for our logging pipeline.3. Apply defense-in-depth“Every preventative control should have a detective control at the same level
and/or one level downstream in the architecture.”
-Phil Venables, https://www.philvenables.com/post/defense-in-depthThe third step is about adding depth to that defense, a concept we’re all
familiar with. I really like how Phil Venables crystallizes what
defense-in-depth means and I think he generally gives great advice. The idea is
that our controls are not simply overlapping, but mutually supportive.
Something’s always got your back.Along this chokepoint we add our downstream components, in depth. Some are
preventative, while some are detective.We can add additional protections like tokenization and read-once objects. We
can add the downstream tools like our custom log formatters, and employ various
sensitive data scanners at different points. And then finally, we can educate
and equip our team.This is what defense-in-depth looks like to me, and I think this maximizes
chances of success.4. Plan for response and recoveryDetermine the scopeRestrict accessStop the bleeding / ﬁx the sourceClean up all the places, e.g. indexesRestore accessDo a post-mortemMake it ~impossible to happen againBut, of course, if we do miss or if we manage to only detect vs. prevent, we
should be prepared for response and recovery. You already know how to respond to
incidents like this, so I won’t add much here, other than making sure you’re
sticking to a playbook in the right order, pulling levers to restrict and
restore access while you’re responding, as well as thinking about all the weird
places secrets might persist in logs, like indexes.ConclusionAnd that’s it. This is the culmination of our strategy, our work, and about 30
some minutes of blabber.With a solid foundation and understanding of our data
flows, we protected our chokepoints in-depth and kept secrets out of logs. We’ve
also introduced a lot of other strong primitives that materially improve our
security program. So is that it? Is the job done?Well, no, because the data team wired up some ETL jobs that are now spewing
secrets into data lake logs, because of course they did.Like most things in security, the job often isn’t ever done. But we have the
understanding, the tools, and a strategy to fight the next fight. Keeping
secrets out of logs is in your hands.*meIf you liked what you heard, or if you hated it, I’d love to hear your story.

1.0 Introduction


SQLite is a TCL extension that has escaped into the wild.



The design of SQLite was inspired by the design of TCL, both in
the way it handles datatypes and in the formatting of its source
code.
The index use case for SQLite was in a Tcl/Tk application for an
industrial company.
From its inception, SQLite has always depended heavily on TCL.
These days, SQLite no longer uses TCL internally and can be run
separately from any TCL interpreter, and yet the SQLite development
process still depends heavily on TCL.


1.1 About SQLite


SQLite is an SQL database engine, and 
the most widely used database engine in the world.
SQLite is built into all cellphones as a core component and is the
primary means of data persistence on phones.  SQLite is also an
integral part of most web browsers.  SQLite is built into MacOS and
is used by most of the default applications on that platform.
Windows10 requires the C:\Windows\System32\winsqlite3.dll file in
order to boot.  Countless other popular applications like Skype 
and WhatsApp and iTunes depend on SQLite.


Because SQLite is open source and can be freely downloaded and
duplicated, exact usage numbers are unavailable.  But reasonable
estimates are that there are more SQLite instances in operation
today than there are people on earth.  Most devices that
use the SQLite database engine contain hundreds of separate databases,
and there are billions of such devices.  Hence, there are likely
around one trillion SQLite databases in active use.


There are more copies of SQLite in use than there are copies of Linux.
We know this because SQLite is used on almost all Linux systems, but
SQLite is also used on many other non-linux systems such as Macs, iPhones,
and Windows computers.
By similar arguments, there are more copies of SQLite in use than
there are Macs, or Windows PCs.
There are probably more copies of SQLite in use than all other database
engines combined.
It seems likely that SQLite is the most widely used and deployed
software component of any kind, with the possible exception of the
zLib compression library.

1.2 SQLite Is A TCL Extension, Not A TCL Application


SQLite is not written in TCL.  Rather, SQLite is intended to be used
by TCL.  Like the TCL interpreter, SQLite is written in ANSI C.


The fact that SQLite was primarily intended to be used from TCL
is evident in an number of ways.


All programming languages, other than C/C++, require some kind of
adaptor in order to interface with the SQLite C implementation.  Language
adaptors for SQLite are widely available from third party programmers.
The adaptors for PHP and Python are built into those languages, for
example.  A Java adaptor is baked into Android.  And so forth.  Only
the TCL adaptor is included as part of the SQLite core.  The source code
file that implements the TCL adaptor for SQLite, "tclsqlite.c",
was part of the very first check-in on the SQLite source repository
on 2000-05-29.  (See 
https://sqlite.org/src/ci/6f3655f79f9b6fc9.)


All modern SQL implementations provide a means to do late binding of
parameter values to the SQL statements.  Usually a naked "?" character,
or a "?" followed by an integer is used.  For example:

SELECT passwd, photo FROM user WHERE uid=?1



The "?1" token in the SQL above would be assigned a value at run-time
in order to look up the password and photograph of a particular user.


SQLite supports this syntax.  But because of its TCL heritage, SQLite
also allows the parameter to take the form of a TCL variable.  Hence:

SELECT passwd, photo FROM user WHERE uid=$uid



When a statement such as the above is run, the TCL language adaptor
automatically binds the value of the $uid TCL variable to the SQL statement
before it is evaluated, providing an intuitive and seamless interface
between TCL and SQL.  SQLite is the only database engine that behaves
this way.


The TCL heritage of SQLite is visible in the type system of
SQLite.  Early versions of SQLite (prior to 2004) operated on the classic
TCL principal that "everything is a string".  Beginning with SQLite3
(2004-06-18), SQLite also supports binary data.  However, types are still
very flexible in SQLite, just as they are in TCL.  SQLite treats the datatypes
on column names in a CREATE TABLE statement as suggestions rather than
hard requirements.  SQLite is happy to store a 100KB string value in a
column that is declared "SHORT INT", just as TCL is happy to store either
a large string or a small integer in the same variable.  There are some
differences in how SQLite deals with datatypes, in comparison to TCL, due
to the different nature of the SQL language.  SQLite has the concept of
"type affinity".  If a column is declared "INT" and one inserts a string
into that column that looks like an integer and can be safely converted into
an integer without loss of information, then that conversion occurs
automatically.  This provides a measure of compatibility with the rigid
type systems of other SQL database engines.


The flexible type system of SQLite seems natural and intuitive to programmers
with prior experience programming in TCL.  Curiously, though, it is a source
of frustration and frequent complaining from programmers accustomed to the
rigid and unforgiving type systems of languages like Java.


The similarities in the type systems of TCL and SQLite extends to more than
just the interface.  An important part of the C/C++ interface for SQLite
is the "sqlite3_value" object
(https://sqlite.org/c3ref/value.html) which is analogous to the
Tcl_Obj object in TCL.  Both TCL and SQLite use a dual-representation approach,
where each value can be represented simultaneously as both a string and
some other type.

2.0 How SQLite Depends On Tcl


SQLite began as a TCL extension, though these days most uses of SQLite
are in applications written in languages other than TCL.  Many programmers
who use SQLite in their applications have no knowledge or awareness of TCL.
The SQLite source code used by most developers is a single file of pure
C code named "sqlite3.c" that contains no TCL code.  
This is what we mean when we
say that SQLite as "escaped" into the wild.  Deployed instances of SQLite
no longer depends on TCL.


Nevertheless, SQLite is still heavily dependent upon TCL and the ongoing
support, maintenance, and enhancement of SQLite would not be possible without
TCL, and would be seriously inconvenienced without Tk.


2.1 SQLite Source Code Is Mostly TCL


The deliverable source code for SQLite is a single file named
"sqlite3.c" and its companion header "sqlite3.h".
Both files are 100% ANSI-C code.  But developers do not edit these
files directly.  The sqlite3.c and sqlite3.h source files are build
products, and the source tree used to build those files is over 50%
TCL code.  Figure 1 nearby shows the exact ratios.



Figure 1: Breakdown Of SQLite Source Code By Language



Figure 1 is for the main SQLite source repository.  Many of the test
cases and much of the documentation is held in separate repositories,
not included in Figure 1.  The separate repositories also contain a great
deal of TCL code.


Much of the TCL code in the main SQLite repository consists of test scripts.
At this writing, the core repository contains 1153 separate test scripts
totally about 389 KB of space.
But this is not the only use of TCL in SQLite.

2.2 Machine Generated C Code


A non-trivial amount of the deliverable C code for SQLite is machine
generated.  Some of the machine generated code is created by C programs,
such as LEMON which translates the SQL language grammar into C code to
implement a push-down automaton to parse the SQL language.  But much of
the automatically generated code is created using TCL scripts.  TCL is
well suited for scanning source files to extract information to be
merged with other files and for making mechanized edits.  For example,
the byte-code engine used to evaluate SQL statements inside of SQLite
is implemented as a large "switch" statement inside a "for" loop, with a
separate "case" for each opcode, all in the "vdbe.c" source file.
At build-time, TCL scripts scan the vdbe.c source file looking for the
appropriate "case" statements and then build header files that assign
consecutive integers to each symbolic opcode name.  (The opcodes used by
the SQLite byte-code engine are not an API as they are in TCL and thus
can change from one build to the next.)  This mapping of symbolic opcode
names into integers is not a simple as one might suppose.  For reasons
of optimization, there are many constraints on the specific values that
are assigned to opcodes.  For example, many opcodes such as OP_Add must
have the same numeric value as the corresponding "+" token in the SQL
language parser.  Sometimes a group of related opcodes, such as the
comparison operators OP_Eq, OP_Ne, OP_Lt, OP_Le, OP_Ge, and OP_Gt, need
to be assigned consecutive integers in a specific order.  These constraints
are all handled effortlessly in TCL.  Accomplishing the
same with AWK would be rather more difficult.


Perhaps the most important task for TCL during the SQLite build process
is constructing the SQLite amalgamation source code file.
Recall that most developers use SQLite in the form of a single big file
of C code named "sqlite3.c" and referred to as "the amalgamation".
A TCL script named "mksqlite3c.tcl" runs in order to construct the
amalgamation from over one hundred separate input files.  Each of these
inputs files must be added to the amalgamation in just the right order.
Furthermore, the source files are edited as part of the amalgamation building
process.  When mksqlite3c.tcl encounters a "#include" for an SQLite header,
it replaces the "#include" with a copy of that header file, taking care
to make sure each header file is only included once.  The mksqlite3.tcl
script automatically adds the "static" keyword to internal SQLite APIs
to give them file linkage, and makes other similar edits.

2.3 The sqlite3_analyzer.exe Utility


In addition to the core SQLite library, the SQLite source tree also contains
code for several analysis and control programs.  One of these programs
is called "sqlite3_analyzer" (or "sqlite3_analyzer.exe" on Windows).
The sqlite3_analyzer program examines an SQLite database and generates
a detailed report on the disk usage by the various tables and indexes
within that database.  The sqlite3_analyzer program is very useful in
understanding how an application is using disk space.


It turns out that sqlite3_analyzer, though disguised as an ordinary
executable, is really a TCL application.  The main source code file for
this application is
tool/spaceanal.tcl.
During the build process, this script is converted into a C-language
string constant (using another TCL script) and added to a very simple
C-language wrapper than starts a TCL interpreter and then passes the
application script to that interpreter.


The sqlite3_analyzer program could be rewritten in pure C.  But that
would be a lot of code.  The TCL script that implements sqlite3_analyzer is
less than 1000 lines long.  The equivalent C program would surely be at
least ten times larger.


Note that the sqlite3_analyzer utility program statically links a TCL
interpreter and so does not require a TCL installation on the target
computer to use.  The sqlite3_analyzer utility program is used by
tens of thousands of developers, most of whom do not realize that they
are really running a TCL application.

2.4 TCL Used For Testing SQLite


One of the key features of SQLite is that it uses aviation-grade testing.
The tests of SQLite, at a minimum, provide 100% modified condition/decision
coverage (MC/DC) of the SQLite code, with independence.  100% MC/DC roughly
means that every branch instruction at the machine code level is exercised
at least once in each direction.  The precise definition of
MC/DC is slightly stricter than this, for example when comparing boolean
vectors, but the 100% branch tests coverage definition is very close
approximation.  The "with independence" term means that SQLite is tested
in multiple ways with test code being written and maintained by different
individuals.


The amount of testing done on SQLite is fanatical.  On the other hand,
that level of testing is necessary for a fundamental low-level component,
such as a database engine, that is used by billions of devices.  If an
ordinary application encounters an obscure bug, it can normally be rebooted 
to clear the problem.  But the job of a database engine is to remember things,
and so databases tend to remember their mistakes across reboots.  For these
reasons, it is important that SQLite have a very low bug density.


TCL is used in every aspect of SQLite testing.
The test cases that are part of the primary SQLite source code
repository are written in TCL.
Other test cases such as 
TH3 and
SQLLogicTest are written
in C but still depend on TCL for operation.


The TH3 test suite is a set of proprietary tests for SQLite that form the
primary means of achieving 100% MC/DC.  TH3 is designed to
run on embedded hardware without the support of a desktop operating system.
TH3 consists of over 1350 test modules together with over 100 control files.
The test modules are written in either C or SQL or a combination of both.
The control files are text formatted in a way that easily parsed by TCL.
To build a TH3 test, a TCL script is run that combines some subset of the
test modules and control files into a single large C program that will
automatically run the required tests.  This C program is then linked against
the "sqlite3.c" amalgamation and the resulting binary is moved to the target
computer and executed.  TCL scripts automate this entire process on
all major host platforms.


To verify that the TH3 tests really do provide 100% MC/DC, special options
are added to the TCL scripts that run the tests, causing the GCC coverage
analysis tools to be invoked.  The output of gcov is then postprocessed to
reveal and report any branch instructions that were missed by the tests.
The TH3 tests themselves are all implemented in C and SQL, but the operation
and management of those tests is all done with TCL.

2.5 TCL Generated Documentation


The extensive documentation for SQLite available on the SQLite website
(https://sqlite.org/) is all generated
by TCL.  Many of the documents, such as the API reference documentation and
the descriptions of the byte-code engine opcodes, are created by TCL scripts
that scan C source code and extract the necessary information from the code
and comments.  Thus, the API documentation is largely derived from
comments in the source code.  Keeping the official documentation (in
comments) and the source code close together helps ensure that they are
in agreement.


Other whitepaper documents are generated from source files that look 
mostly like
HTML but which contain additional TCL code embedded inside of
<tcl>...</tcl> markup.  The added TCL code is used for
advanced formatting techniques, for automatically creating cross-references
and cross-links, and for constructing complex displays such as the
popular "rail-road" syntax diagrams for SQL.

2.6 Tcl/Tk Used During Development Of SQLite


The text editor used by the primary author of SQLite is a custom editor
with emacs-style key bindings that is built on top of the Tk Text widget.
The "e" editor, as it is called, is cross-platform, which helps in the
development of a cross-platform software library like SQLite.  The "e"
editor has been used for the entire 17-year history of SQLite.  It has
been enhanced over the years with various customizations created especially
to help manage the SQLite source code.


The Fossil version control system used for the SQLite source code
(and written specifically for that purpose) uses Tcl/Tk to show graphical
side-by-side diffs in a separate window.  When the "fossil diff --tk"
command is run, Fossil generates a script to show the diff graphically
and then kicks off a separate "wish" process to run that script and
display the diff in a separate window.  This graphical diff window has
a "Save" button which will cause the Tcl/Tk code needed to reproduce itself
to be written to a file.  This file can be, in turn, sent to a collaborator
for display.  Passing around graphical diffs as ordinary text files is
much simpler and easier than passing around JPEG images or text "context"
diffs.


No two SQLite developers work in the same office.  The team is
geographically distributed.  To help the team stay in touch, a custom
chatroom has been created using a Tcl/Tk script.  The same script works
as both client and server.  The chatroom is private and uses a proprietary
protocol, so that developers are free to discuss sensitive matters without
fear of eavesdropping.  The chatroom is implemented as just over
1000 lines of Tk code, and is thus accessible and easy to customize.
Among the customizations is the ability to send saved "fossil diff --tk"
graphical diffs to collaborators and have the diff pop automatically on
the collaborators screen.  Small features like this seem trivial
by themselves, but together than help the developers
to work much more efficiently.  These kinds of productivity-enhancing
features are unavailable to users of commercial business collaboration 
packages such as HipChat.

3.0 Summary


SQLite is an indispensable element of most modern computer systems, and
TCL is an indispensable tool used in the production and maintenance of
SQLite.  Thus, the computing infrastructure we enjoy today would not exist
except for TCL.


As deployed, SQLite contains no TCL code.
However, the design of SQLite is inspired by TCL.
And TCL is used extensively in the code generation, testing,
analysis, documentation, and development of SQLite.  Without
TCL, SQLite would not exist.


Every developer and every team has a finite number of "brain cycles"
available to do their job.  The fewer cycles spent messing with tools,
the more cycles are available to devote towards solving the problem.
So for maximum productivity, it is important to use tools that get
the job done with a minimum of fuss and bother.
Our 17-year experience using TCL in the SQLite project has convinced
us that TCL is just such a tool.  Tcl provides the most help per
brain cycle of any similar technology.

						From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
					

Gustave Doré's illustration of La Fontaine's fable, c. 1868
Belling the Cat is a fable also known under the titles The Bell and the Cat and The Mice in Council. In the story, a group of mice agree to attach a bell to a cat's neck to warn of its approach in the future, but they fail to find a volunteer to perform the job. The term has become an idiom describing a group of persons, each agreeing to perform an impossibly difficult task under the misapprehension that someone else will be chosen to run the risks and endure the hardship of actual accomplishment.[1]
Although often attributed to Aesop, it was not recorded before the Middle Ages and has been confused with the quite different fable of Classical origin titled The Cat and the Mice. In the classificatory system established for the fables by Ben Edwin Perry, it is numbered 613, which is reserved for Mediaeval attributions outside the Aesopic canon.[2]


Synopsis and idiomatic use[edit]
The fable concerns a group of mice who debate plans to nullify the threat of a marauding cat. One of them proposes placing a bell around its neck, so that they are warned of its approach. The plan is applauded by the others, until one mouse asks who will volunteer to place the bell on the cat. All of them make excuses. The story is used to teach the wisdom of evaluating a plan on not only how desirable the outcome would be but also how it can be executed. It provides a moral lesson about the fundamental difference between ideas and their feasibility, and how this affects the value of a given plan.[3]
The fable gives rise to the idiom to bell the cat, which means to attempt, or agree to perform, an impossibly difficult task.[4] Historically 'Bell the Cat' is frequently claimed to have been a nickname given to fifteenth-century Scottish nobleman Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus in recognition of his part in the arrest and execution of James III's alleged favourite, Thomas (often misnamed as Robert) Cochrane. In fact the earliest evidence for this use is from Hume of Godscroft's history of the Douglases published in 1644,[5] and therefore is more reflective of perception of the idiom in the seventeenth century than the fifteenth.[6] In the 21st century the idiom was adopted by the investigative journalism group Bellingcat.[7] 
The first English collection to attribute the fable to Aesop was John Ogilby's of 1687; in this there is a woodcut (by Francis Barlow), followed by a 10-line verse synopsis by Aphra Behn with the punning conclusion:


Good Councell's easily given, but the effect
Oft renders it uneasy to transact.[8]


Early versions and later interpretations[edit]
"Belling the cat" is one of the proverbs illustrated in Pieter Bruegel I's painting Netherlandish Proverbs (1559).
One of the earliest versions of the story appears as a parable critical of the clergy in Odo of Cheriton's Parabolae.[9] Written around 1200, it was afterwards translated into Welsh, French and Spanish. Sometime later, the story is found in the work now referred to as Ysopet-Avionnet, which is largely made up of Latin poems by the 12th century Walter of England, followed by a French version dating from as much as two centuries later. It also includes four poems not found in Walter's Esopus; among them is the tale of "The Council of the Mice" (De muribus consilium facientibus contra catum). The author concludes with the scornful comment that laws are of no effect without the means of adequately enforcing them and that such parliamentary assemblies as he describes are like the proverbial mountain in labour that gives birth to a mouse.[10]
The fable also appeared as a cautionary tale in Nicholas Bozon's Anglo-Norman Contes Moralisés (1320), referring to the difficulty of curbing the outrages of superior lords.[11] It was in this context too that the story of a parliament of rats and mice was retold in William Langland's allegorical poem Piers Plowman.[12] The episode is said to refer to the Parliament of 1376 which attempted unsuccessfully to remedy popular dissatisfaction over the exactions made by nobles acting in the royal name.[13]
Langland's French contemporary, the satirical Eustache Deschamps, also includes the story among his other moral ballades based on fables as "Les souris et les chats".[14] It has been suggested that in this case too there is a political subtext. The poem was written as a response to the aborted invasion of England in 1386 and contrasts French dithering in the face of English aggression.[15]  The refrain of Deschamps' ballade, Qui pendra la sonnette au chat (who will bell the cat) was to become proverbial in France if, indeed, it does not record one already existing.
In the following century, the Italian author Laurentius Abstemius made of the fable a Latin cautionary tale titled De muribus tintinnabulum feli appendere volentibus (The mice who wanted to bell the cat)[16] in 1499. A more popular version in Latin verse was written by Gabriele Faerno and printed posthumously in his Fabulae centum ex antiquis auctoribus delectae (100 delightful fables from ancient authors, Rome 1564), a work that was to be many times reprinted and translated up to start of the 19th century. Titled simply "The Council of the Mice", it comes to rest on the drily stated moral that 'a risky plan can have no good result'. The story was evidently known in Flanders too, since 'belling the cat' was included among the forty Netherlandish Proverbs in the composite painting of Pieter Bruegel the Elder (1559). In this case a man in armour is performing the task in the lower left foreground.[17] A century later, La Fontaine's Fables made the tale even better known under the title Conseil tenu par les rats (II.2).[18]

A Japanese woodblock illustration by Kawanabe Kyōsai of La Fontaine's fable, 1894.
In mediaeval times the fable was applied to political situations and British commentaries on it were sharply critical of the limited democratic processes of the day and their ability to resolve social conflict when class interests were at stake. This applies equally to the plot against the king's favourite in 15th century Scotland and the direct means that Archibald Douglas chose to resolve the issue. While none of the authors who used the fable actually incited revolution, the 1376 Parliament that Langland satirised was followed by Wat Tyler's revolt five years later, while Archibald Douglas went on to lead a rebellion against King James. During the Renaissance the fangs of the fable were being drawn by European authors, who restricted their criticism to pusillanimous conduct in the face of rashly proposed solutions. A later exception was the Russian fabulist Ivan Krylov, whose adaptation of the story satirises croneyism. In his account only those with perfect tails are to be allowed into the assembly; nevertheless, a tailless rat is admitted because of a family connection with one of the lawmakers.[19]
There still remains the perception of a fundamental opposition between consensus and individualism. This is addressed in the lyrics of "Bell the Cat",[20] a performance put out on DVD by the Japanese rock band LM.C in 2007.[21] This is the monologue of a house cat that wants to walk alone since "Society is by nature evil". It therefore refuses to conform and is impatient of restriction: "your hands hold on to everything – bell the cat". While the lyric is sung in Japanese, the final phrase is in English. Another modernised adaptation based on this fable, that updates the moral, has been published by Patricia McKissack in her Who Will Bell the Cat? (illustrated by Christopher Cyr).[22][23]
There is a Tibetan proverb that is very similar, "Putting a bell on the cat's neck after the mother of mice was consulted"[24]


Several French artists depicted the fable during the 19th century, generally choosing one of two approaches. Gustave Doré and the genre painter Aurélie Léontine Malbet (fl. 1868–1906)[25] pictured the rats realistically acting out their debate. The illustrator Grandville,[26] along with the contemporaries Philibert Léon Couturier [fr] (1823–1901)[27] and Auguste Delierre (1829–1890),[28] caricature the backward practice and pomposity of provincial legislatures, making much the same point as did the Mediaeval authors who first recorded the tale. At the end of the century a publishing curiosity reverts to the first approach. This was in the woodblock print by Kawanabe Kyōsui that appeared in the collection of La Fontaine's fables that was commissioned and printed in Tokyo in 1894 and then exported to France.[29] In the upper left-hand corner a cat is seen through a warehouse window as it approaches across the roofs while inside the rats swarm up the straw-wrapped bales of goods. At its summit the chief rat holds the bell aloft. An earlier Japanese woodblock formed part of Kawanabe Kyōsai's Isoho Monogotari series (1870–80). This shows an assembly of mice in Japanese dress with the proposer in the foreground, brandishing the belled collar.[30]


In the 18th century the fable was one among many set by Louis-Nicolas Clérambault in the fables section of Nouvelles poésies spirituelles et morales sur les plus beaux airs (1730–37).[31] In the following century the text of La Fontaine's fable was set for male voices by Louis Lacombe[32] and by the Catalan composer Isaac Albéniz for medium voice and piano in 1889.[33] In 1950 it was set for four male voices by Florent Schmitt.[34] But while La Fontaine's humorously named cat Rodilardus, and antiquated words like discomfiture (déconfiture), may fit an art song, there have also been faithful interpretations in the field of light music. A popular composer of the day, Prosper Massé, published such a setting in 1846.[35] More recently there has been Pierre Perret's interpretation as part of his 20 Fables inspirées de Jean de la Fontaine (1995),[36] and a jazz arrangement on Daniel Roca's 10 Fables de La Fontaine (2005).[37]

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ Algebraic effects are not just a research concept anymore. You can use them in real software, today. Here’s why you’d want to do that, in order of importance:


Effects make your code testable
One of the central goals of enterprise software development. Dependency injection, mocking, architecture patterns like clean, hexagonal, DDD are all meant to tackle this. Effects solve this elegantly by separating the “what” from the “how”.


Effects give immediate visibility into what your own and 3rd-party code is doing
Supply chain attacks are real. And they will get worse with more AI slop entering our codebases. Tools like Go’s Capslock fix this by following the whole chain of calls to stdlib functions. Effects provide this by design, as all effects are tracked by the type and effect system.


Effects enable user-defined control flow abstractions
Solving the “what color is your function” problem1. You can also leverage effects to implement Async/await, coroutines, backtracking search and other control flow patterns as user libraries without hard-coding these features into the language.


Algebraic effects come from the pure functional world, serving a purpose similar to monads — keeping track of and having control over side effects. Like monads, they enable us to write our core logic with pure functions and push side effects like IO outwards, closer to application boundaries.
Unlike monads, effects are easy to grasp for a regular developer and give immediate benefits when starting out. For me personally they’re a more natural abstraction for managing side effects — after all, effects are in the name.
Starting out as an academic concept, algebraic effects were introduced to the world by research languages like Eff, Koka, Effekt, Frank, Links, and more recently Ante.
People have also applied effects in practice, so far usually via a monad-based approach, by making libraries in established languages like Scala Kyo / Cats Effect / ZIO; Typescript Effect and Effector, C# language-ext, C libhandler and libmprompt, C++ cpp-effects, various Haskell libraries, etc.
In addition to forcing you into a monadic way of thinking, libraries implementing effects are limited by their host languages.
In this article, I will walk you through applying algebraic effects on a real world example using Flix, a new programming language that is built with effects from the ground up, and supports functional, logic and imperative paradigms.

Currently only few languages support effects out of the box. The only one that I know of besides Flix is Unison. OCaml has a language extension, but there is no support yet in the type system. Haskell has added support for delimited continuations, but effects are still only available via libraries.
In addition to having a “type and effect system” that improves function signatures and makes sure all effects are handled, Flix supports traits, local mutability via regions, working with immutable or mutable data, and Go/Rust-like structured concurrency. It also has a first-class Datalog integration. But I will only focus on effects here. Let’s start.
Type and Effect System: A Motivating Example 🔗
Imagine a function called calculateSalary:
def calculateSalary(base_salary, bonus_percent):

Based on the function name and the signature, one can assume it’s just a pure function that does some calculations. In a statically typed language you are also guaranteed that the function arguments and outputs will be of a certain type.
But even if the types are correct, nothing stops our little calculateSalary() from, say, sending an offensive email to your grandma2:
def calculateSalary(base_salary, bonus_percent):
    server.sendmail("grandma@family.com", "Your cookies are terrible!")
    return base_salary * (1 + bonus_percent/100)

If, on the other hand, you extend your type system with effects, you will see immediately in the signature that this function may do something fishy:
def calculateSalary(salary: Float64, percent: Float64): 
    Float64 \ {Email} = {
//            ^^^^^^^ Notice the Email effect!

Of course, in real life the issue it’s not usually about the grandma. Instead, this function could throw an exception — still quite dangerous. If you forget to handle the exception, your app will crash. Or another very realistic scenario is that calculateSalary() calls a database to get some employee details for calculations, and you forgot to provide a database connection string. That can also result in an exception or a panic.
Effect Handlers: Building Intuition 🔗
The job of the type and effect system is not just to improve our function signatures. It’s also making sure all the effects are handled somewhere. This is where effect handlers come in.
Usually when people talk about algebraic effects what they’re actually talking about is effect handlers. If you know exceptions, effect handlers are super easy to understand. Here’s a Jenga analogy:
Imagine the call stack is a Jenga tower. New blocks are carefully added each time you call a function.
Saurav S, Unsplash
When an exception is thrown, your whole nice Jenga tower gets destroyed, all the way up to the catch() block. The catch block can safely handle the error, but the stack is unwinded, meaning you lose all of the state you had in your program before throwing the exception. You have to build your tower again, from scratch.
When using effect handlers you can actually go back to your original computation after the handler is done handling the effect. The handler can also return some values back to your program, and it can even resume multiple times with different return values. You also still have the option of not resuming at all and aborting the program — that would be the effect equivalent of exceptions.
Back to the Jenga analogy: if your tower is about to fall down, with effects you can freeze it mid-collapse. You then call someone for help (handler), and they decide whether to let the tower fall, magically restore it to the previous statlte. Or even hand you different blocks to try the same move (call the continuation) again, possibly multiple times with different inputs. Your Jenga tower ends up looking more like a fork or a tree, with multiple different copies of your blocks branching out at some point from the base.
To make this more concrete, let’s start by reproducing exceptions with effects. Here’s how a try/catch looks like in Python:
def divide(x, y):
    try:
        return x / y
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Division by zero!")
        return None

Here’s the equivalent code in Flix. We first define an Exception effect and a divide() function:
eff Exception {
    def throw(msg: String): Void
}

def divide(x: Int32, y: Int32): Int32 \ Exception = 
    if (y == 0) {
        Exception.throw("Division by zero!")
    } else {
        x / y
    }

And then provide a handler for this effect somewhere, preferably close to main():
def main(): Unit \ IO = 
    run {
        println(divide(10, 0))
    } with handler Exception {
        def throw(msg, _resume) = println("Error: ${msg}")
    }

What this does is registers an effect called Exception with a method throw(). We then perform this effect in our function when there’s an error, similar to throwing an exception in the Python version. Control is transferred to the effect handler, which then decides how to handle the exception, similar to a catch() block in Python.
Notice we never call resume() from the handler. This results in the program being aborted, just like with exceptions. Graphically, this can be represented as follows:
block-beta
    columns 2
    
    A["Statement 1"] space:1
    B["Statement 2"] space:1
    C["Statement 3"] space:1
    D["Perform Effect"] space:1
    space:1 E["Handle Effect"]
    space:1 F["Process & Exit"]
    space:1 space:1

    style D fill:#ffcccc,color:#000
    style E fill:#ccffcc,color:#000
    style F fill:#ccffcc,color:#000
So far so good, but this is not much different from Python. To really take full advantage of effect handlers, we can use resume() to return to the original computation and proceed from the line after the effect was performed:
eff ResumableException {
    def askForInput(): Int32
}

def divide(x: Int32, y: Int32): Int32 \ ResumableException = 
    if (y == 0) {
        let newY = ResumableException.askForInput();
        x / newY
    } else {
        x / y
    }

def main(): Unit \ IO = 
    run {
        println(divide(10, 0))
    } with handler ResumableException {
        def askForInput(_, resume) = {
            println("Enter a new divisor:");
            resume(5) // Or get from user input
        }
    }

block-beta
    columns 2
    
    A["Statement 1"] space:1
    B["Statement 2"] space:1
    C["Statement 3"] space:1
    D["Perform Effect"] space:1
    space:1 E["Handle Effect"]
    space:1 F["Resume"]
    space:1 space:1
    G["Statement 4"] space:1
    H["Statement 5"] space:1
    I["Complete"] space:1
    
    D --> E
    F --> G
    
    style D fill:#ffcccc,color:#000
    style E fill:#ccffcc,color:#000
    style F fill:#ffffcc,color:#000
I called the effect ResumableException here, but it’s not really an exception anymore, because the program continues normally.
At this point we can use this power bestowed on us by effects and handlers to roll our own Async/await:
eff Async {
    def await(url: String): String
}

def fetchData(): String \ Async = 
    Async.await("https://api.example.com/data")

def processData(): String \ Async = {
    let data = fetchData();
    "processed: ${data}"
}

def main(): Unit \ IO = 
    run {
        let result = processData();
        println(result)
    } with handler Async {
        def await(url, resume) = {
            // Simulate async HTTP request
            let result = "data from ${url}";
            resume(result)
        }
    }

See how easy that was? This approach also avoids function coloring, since we didn’t need to use special keywords anywhere. Here’s a graphic version:

That’s cool, but we can do more. Effect handlers allow you to resume multiple times:
eff Choose {
    def choose(): Int32
}

def explore(): String \ Choose = {
    let x = Choose.choose();
    let y = Choose.choose();
    "${x}, ${y}"
}

def main(): Unit \ IO = 
    run {
        println(explore())
    } with handler Choose {
        def choose(_, resume) = {
            resume(1);
            resume(2);
            resume(3)
        }

Hopefully this gives you a taste of how effect handlers work. This is just a sketch though — you can read more on this and see examples in the Flix docs.

Defining our own control flow abstractions is great, but most of the time regular async/await and/or coroutines are enough for the job.
What is extremely useful for daily programming is that effects let you separate the declaration of the effect (the operation, or the effect “constructor”) from it’s implementation, defined by the effect handler.
Add some effect definitions:
eff Database {
    def getUser(id: Int32): Option[User],
    def saveUser(user: User): Unit
}

Then use these definitions to perform effects in your code:
def updateUserEmail(userId: Int32, newEmail: String): Result[String, User] \ {Database} = {
    match Database.getUser(userId) {
        case Some(user) => {
            let updatedUser = {user | email = newEmail};
            Database.saveUser(updatedUser);
            Ok(updatedUser)
        }
        case None => {
            Err("User not found")
        }
    }
}

This replaces the need for dependency injection, since you can provide different handlers for these database operations in production vs testing:
def main(): Unit \\ IO = { // production handler, uses a real database
    run {
        updateUserEmail(123, "new@example.com")
    } with handler Database {
        def getUser(id, resume) = {
		        // real db query
            resume(user)
        }
        def saveUser(user, resume) = {
		        // real db query
            resume()
        }
    }
}

def testUpdateUserEmail(): Unit = { // test handler, just stubs
    let testUser = {id = 123, email = "old@example.com"};
    run {
        let result = updateUserEmail(123, "new@example.com");
        assert(result == Ok({testUser | email = "new@example.com"}))
    } with handler Database {
        def getUser(id, resume) = resume(Some(testUser))
        def saveUser(user, resume) = {
            assert(user.email == "new@example.com");
            resume()
        }
    
}

In my opinion, the biggest advantage that effect handlers give is that they abstract away the patterns associated with DDD, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal architecture, etc. commonly found in enterprise code.
All these architectures give you some sort of way to isolate your core logic, which should be pure, from infrastructure and app logic, with deals with external dependencies. But you have to commit to an architecture and the whole team has to be disciplined enough to stick to for this to work.
Using effects encourages separating the definition of effect operations from implementation by default, meaning you don’t really need these architecture patterns anymore.
This is great, since relying on team discipline exclusively rarely works. It also saves a bunch of time otherwise spent on bike shedding.
Effect handlers also allow you to easily install stubs, which you can use to create quick test cases without boilerplate, just by swapping handlers:
def testErrorConditions(): Unit = {
    run {
        let result = updateUserEmail(123, "new@example.com");
        assert(result == Err("User not found"))
    } with handler Database {
        def getUser(_, resume) = resume(None) // Stub: always return None
        def saveUser(_, resume) = resume()             // Won't be called
    }
}

def testSlowDatabase(): Unit = {
    run {
        let result = updateUserEmail(123, "new@example.com");
        assert(result.isOk())
    } with handler Database {
        def getUser(id, resume) = {
            Thread.sleep(100);  // Simulate slow query
            resume(Some({id = id, email = "old@example.com"}))
        }
        def saveUser(user, resume) = {
            Thread.sleep(50);   // Simulate slow save
            resume()
        }
    }
}

You can even make a handler that records all interactions instead of executing them. There are many possibilities here.
Real-World App: AI movie recommendations 🔗
To bring this all together, let’s make a real application using effects.
Our app will fetch some movie data from TheMovieDB, and then use an LLM to recommend some movies based on user preferences provided from the console.
Flix interoperates with the JVM, meaning we can call code from Java, Kotlin, Scala, etc.
First, let’s define the two custom effects we will need: MovieAPI and LLM:
eff MovieAPI {
    def getPopularMovies(): String
}

eff LLM {
    def recommend(movies: String, preferences: String): String
}

We can then perform the effects in main like so, providing some basic handlers that use the Flix’s stdlib HTTP client:
def getRecommendation(preferences: String): String \ {MovieAPI, LLM} = {
    let movies = MovieAPI.getPopularMovies();
    LLM.recommend(movies, preferences)
}

def main(): Unit \ {Net, IO} = 
    run {
        let suggestion = getRecommendation("action movies");
        println(suggestion)
    } with handler MovieAPI {
        def getPopularMovies(_, resume) = {
            let response = HttpWithResult.get("https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/popular", Map.empty());
            match response {
                case Result.Ok(resp) => resume(Http.Response.body(resp))
                case Result.Err(_) => resume("[]")
            }
        }
    } with handler LLM {
        def recommend(movies, prefs, resume) = {
            let prompt = "Movies: ${movies}. User likes: ${prefs}. Recommend one movie.";
            let response = HttpWithResult.post("https://api.openai.com/v1/completions", Map.empty(), prompt);
            match response {
                case Result.Ok(resp) => resume(Http.Response.body(resp))
                case Result.Err(_) => resume("Try watching a classic!")
            }
        }
    } with HttpWithResult.runWithIO

Notice that both effects are quite generic. So we can easily swap either the movie API or the LLM provider without touching anything in the core logic:
// Switch to different movie provider
with handler MovieAPI {
    def getPopularMovies(_, resume) = {
        let response = HttpWithResult.get("https://api.imdb.com/popular", Map.empty());
        // ... handle IMDB response format
    }
}

// Switch to different LLM provider  
with handler LLM {
    def recommend(movies, prefs, resume) = {
        let response = HttpWithResult.post("https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages", Map.empty(), prompt);
        // ... handle Claude response format
    }
}

To get the user input we will need to include the standard Console effect:
def main(): Unit \ {Net, IO} = 
    run {
        Console.println("What movie genres do you enjoy?");
        let preferences = Console.readln();
        let suggestion = getRecommendation(preferences);
        Console.println("Recommendation: ${suggestion}")
    } with handler MovieAPI { /* ... */ }
      with handler LLM { /* ... */ }
      with Console.runWithIO
      with HttpWithResult.runWithIO

We can also add some basic logs using the standard Logger effect:
def getRecommendation(preferences: String): String \ {MovieAPI, LLM, Logger} = {
    Logger.info("Fetching popular movies...");
    let movies = MovieAPI.getPopularMovies();
    Logger.info("Getting LLM recommendation...");
    LLM.recommend(movies, preferences)
}

def main(): Unit \ {Net, IO} = 
    run {
        /* ... console interaction ... */
    } with handler MovieAPI { /* ... */ }
      with handler LLM { /* ... */ }
      with Console.runWithIO
      with Logger.runWithIO
      with HttpWithResult.runWithIO

That’s it! Let’s run the app and test it manually like so:
 flix run Main.flix
What movie genres do you enjoy?
> sci-fi horror
[INFO] Fetching popular movies...
[INFO] Getting LLM recommendation...
Recommendation: Based on your interest in sci-fi horror, I recommend "Alien" - a perfect blend of both genres!

We can also easily write tests for the core logic by providing test handlers for our movie and LLM effects:
def testRecommendation(): String = 
    run {
        getRecommendation("comedy")
    } with handler MovieAPI {
        def getPopularMovies(_, resume) = {
            resume("""[{"title": "The Grand Budapest Hotel", "genre": "comedy"}]""")
        }
    } with handler LLM {
        def recommend(movies, prefs, resume) = {
            resume("I recommend The Grand Budapest Hotel - perfect for comedy lovers!")
        }
    } with handler Logger {
        def log(_, _, resume) = resume()  // Silent in tests
    }

def runTests(): Unit \ IO = {
    let result = testRecommendation();
    println("Test result: ${result}")
}

Where to Go From Here 🔗
Read the Flix docs
Especially on cool features like effect polymorphism, effect exclusion etc. Check out code examples in the repo
Join the community and contribute with libraries
The Flix compiler and stdlib are quite feature-rich at this point, and having JVM interop means you have all the essentials you need to write practical code. But there are still very few pure Flix libraries. So it’s very valuable to contribute some. The ideas I can think of are, for example, rebuilding standard things like Web frameworks in an effect oriented way,. Or taking advantage of the unique feature set in Flix to build something entirely new.
Explore effect-oriented programming
While I personally like Flix and can recommend it to others, there are other ways you can use effects for real-world software. If you’re in Typescript or Scala, try out Effect or ZIO/Kyo/Cats. If you’re looking for other languages that support effects natively, and you’re not afraid of Haskell-like syntax, check out Unison. They have a bunch of other concepts I find cool, like a better distributed computing model and the code being content-addressed.

Extra: Why Algebraic Effects are Algebraic and how they relate to monads 🔗
Okay, practical people have left the room. Following sections are nerds-only.
For some reason, all the content I’ve been reading on algebraic effects uses this term a lot, but no one explains why specifically they’re called “algebraic”. So I did some digging.
Turns out, algebraic effects are “algebraic” because they can be described with laws and equations, like in algebra — the kind we learn at school. Which is I guess why they’re easier to grasp than monads — unlike algebra, you usually don’t study category theory in high school.
But the algebraic part only applies to the effect “constructors”, i.e the operations themselves like get() or put() for the state effect.
Effect handlers, on the other hand, are not algebraic at all, which can be a bit confusing. But it makes sense if you think about it — the purpose of handlers is to act as “deconstructors”, interpreting our algebraic effect operations by means of things that cannot be described by algebraic equations alone, such as continuations .
In fact, effect handlers are often (but not always) implemented via delimited continuations. There are also other, static/lexically scoped and maybe more performant approaches being explored, such as this one
“Real” algebraic effects don’t require monads. Monads and algebraic effects are two different concepts tackling similar problems. One is expressible in terms of the other, but algebraic effects are arguably more flexible.
You could actually implement algebraic effects using a continuation monad. If we don’t care about types, effects are perfectly expressible with monads and vice versa
The problems appear when we introduce types into the picture. In a properly typed world, you can’t actually reproduce the same expressiveness you get with effects using monads. You’ll end up breaking the type system or reducing expressiveness at some point.
Effects are, in this sense, more “powerful” than monads with their natural type system: you can express infinitely many computations with them. E.g if you use a tick() effect and you do a bunch of sequential tick() s, the result will be a distinct computation each time. With monads and their natural type system the set of computations you could express is finite.
Additionally, with monads you commit to a specific interpretation of an effect in advance, while effects completely decouple effect definition from it’s implementation.
Finally, effects are easier to compose than monads. With monad transformers you quickly hit the wall having to define a bunch of different combinations that each have distinct semantics. Effects compose naturally.
So while effect libraries in languages like Typescript and Scala are able to express effects using monads3, and the behavior could be identical at runtime, this cannot replace having an actual type and effect system, with effects being properly typed.

“What color is your function” is a problem explored in this article. In languages which have Async baked in via special keywords (e.g JavaScript async/await) it becomes a pain to refactor and to combine synchronous and asynchronous code. If you make one function deep in the call stack async, all the callers will have to be made Async as well, or await() the results. With effects you don’t have this issue as there are no keywords and no special behavior. Async is simply done with effect handlers. ↩


I like the grandma example more than the “launch missiles” popular in the Haskell world. Took it from this article by Kevin Mahoney. It’s somehow more offensive ↩


See some examples in this article. This also shows how Haskell’s new delimited continuation support can be used to implement algebraic effects and handlers ↩

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ck - Semantic Grep by Embedding
ck (seek) finds code by meaning, not just keywords. It's a drop-in replacement for grep that understands what you're looking for — search for "error handling" and find try/catch blocks, error returns, and exception handling code even when those exact words aren't present.
Quick start
cargo install ck-search
# Find error handling patterns (finds try/catch, Result types, etc.)
ck --sem "error handling" src/

# Traditional grep-compatible search still works  
ck -n "TODO" *.rs

# Combine both: semantic relevance + keyword filtering
ck --hybrid "connection timeout" src/
Why ck?
For Developers: Stop hunting through thousands of regex false positives. Find the code you actually need by describing what it does.
For AI Agents: Get structured, semantic search results in JSON format. Perfect for code analysis, documentation generation, and automated refactoring.
For Teams: Works exactly like grep with the same flags and behavior, but adds semantic intelligence when you need it.
Quick Start
# Build from source
cargo build --release

# Index your project for semantic search
./target/debug/ck --index src/

# Search by meaning
./target/debug/ck --sem "authentication logic" src/
./target/debug/ck --sem "database connection pooling" src/
./target/debug/ck --sem "retry mechanisms" src/

# Use all the grep features you know
./target/debug/ck -n -C 3 "error" src/
./target/debug/ck -R "TODO|FIXME" .
Core Features
🔍 Semantic Search
Find code by concept, not keywords. Searches understand synonyms, related terms, and conceptual similarity.
# These find related code even without exact keywords:
ck --sem "retry logic"           # finds backoff, circuit breakers
ck --sem "user authentication"   # finds login, auth, credentials  
ck --sem "data validation"       # finds sanitization, type checking

# Get complete functions/classes containing matches (NEW!)
ck --sem --full-section "error handling"  # returns entire functions
ck --full-section "async def" src/        # works with regex too
⚡ Drop-in grep Compatibility
All your muscle memory works. Same flags, same behavior, same output format.
ck -i "warning" *.log              # Case-insensitive  
ck -n -A 3 -B 1 "error" src/       # Line numbers + context
ck --no-filename "TODO" src/        # Suppress filenames (grep -h equivalent)
ck -l "error" src/                  # List files with matches only (NEW!)
ck -L "TODO" src/                   # List files without matches (NEW!)
ck -R --exclude "*.test.js" "bug"  # Recursive with exclusions
ck "pattern" file1.txt file2.txt   # Multiple files
🎯 Hybrid Search
Combine keyword precision with semantic understanding using Reciprocal Rank Fusion.
ck --hybrid "async timeout" src/    # Best of both worlds
ck --hybrid --scores "cache" src/   # Show relevance scores with color highlighting
ck --hybrid --threshold 0.02 query  # Filter by minimum relevance
ck -l --hybrid "database" src/      # List files using hybrid search
🤖 Agent-Friendly Output
Perfect JSON output for LLMs, scripts, and automation.
ck --json --sem "error handling" src/ | jq '.file'
ck --json --topk 5 "TODO" . | jq -r '.preview'
ck --json --full-section --sem "database" . | jq -r '.preview'  # Complete functions
📁 Smart File Filtering
Automatically excludes cache directories, build artifacts, and system files.
# These are excluded by default:
# .git, node_modules, target/, .fastembed_cache, __pycache__

# Override defaults:
ck --no-default-excludes "pattern" .     # Search everything
ck --exclude "dist" --exclude "logs" .   # Add custom exclusions
How It Works
1. Index Once, Search Many
# Create semantic index (one-time setup)
ck --index /path/to/project

# Now search instantly by meaning
ck --sem "database queries" .
ck --sem "error handling" .
ck --sem "authentication" .
2. Three Search Modes

--regex (default): Classic grep behavior, no indexing required
--sem: Pure semantic search using embeddings (requires index)
--hybrid: Combines regex + semantic with intelligent ranking

3. Relevance Scoring
ck --sem --scores "machine learning" docs/
# [0.847] ./ai_guide.txt: Machine learning introduction...
# [0.732] ./statistics.txt: Statistical learning methods...
# [0.681] ./algorithms.txt: Classification algorithms...
Advanced Usage
Search Specific Files
# Glob patterns work
ck --sem "authentication" *.py *.js *.rs

# Multiple files
ck --sem "error handling" src/auth.rs src/db.rs

# Quoted patterns prevent shell expansion  
ck --sem "auth" "src/**/*.ts"
Threshold Filtering
# Only high-confidence semantic matches
ck --sem --threshold 0.7 "query"

# Low-confidence hybrid matches (good for exploration)
ck --hybrid --threshold 0.01 "concept"

# Get complete code sections instead of snippets (NEW!)
ck --sem --full-section "database queries"
ck --full-section "class.*Error" src/     # Complete classes
Top-K Results
# Limit results for focused analysis
ck --sem --topk 5 "authentication patterns"

# Great for AI agent consumption
ck --json --topk 10 "error handling" | process_results.py
Directory Management
# Check index status
ck --status .

# Clean up and rebuild
ck --clean .
ck --index .

# Add single file to index
ck --add new_file.rs

Architecture
ck uses a modular Rust workspace:

ck-cli - Command-line interface and argument parsing
ck-core - Shared types, configuration, and utilities
ck-search - Search engine implementations (regex, BM25, semantic)
ck-index - File indexing, hashing, and sidecar management
ck-embed - Text embedding providers (FastEmbed, API backends)
ck-ann - Approximate nearest neighbor search indices
ck-chunk - Text segmentation and language-aware parsing
ck-models - Model registry and configuration management

Index Storage
Indexes are stored in .ck/ directories alongside your code:
project/
├── src/
├── docs/  
└── .ck/           # Semantic index (can be safely deleted)
    ├── embeddings.json
    ├── ann_index.bin
    └── tantivy_index/

The .ck/ directory is a cache — safe to delete and rebuild anytime.

FAQ
Q: How is this different from grep/ripgrep/silver-searcher?
A: ck includes all the features of traditional search tools, but adds semantic understanding. Search for "error handling" and find relevant code even when those exact words aren't used.
Q: Does it work offline?
A: Yes, completely offline. The embedding model runs locally with no network calls.
Q: How big are the indexes?
A: Typically 1-3x the size of your source code, depending on content. The .ck/ directory can be safely deleted to reclaim space.
Q: Is it fast enough for large codebases?
A: Yes. Indexing is a one-time cost, and searches are sub-second even on large projects. Regex searches require no indexing and are as fast as grep.
Q: Can I use it in scripts/automation?
A: Absolutely. The --json flag provides structured output perfect for automated processing. Use --full-section to get complete functions for AI analysis.
Q: What about privacy/security?
A: Everything runs locally. No code or queries are sent to external services. The embedding model is downloaded once and cached locally.

                The craft of programming is almost universally concerned with different types of
data and operations/algorithms that act on this data [1]. Therefore, it's
hardly surprising that designing abstractions for data types and operations has
been on the mind of software engineers and programming-language designers
since... forever.
Yet I've only recently encountered a name for a software design problem which I
ran into multiple times in my career. It's a problem so fundamental that I was
quite surprised that I haven't seen it named before. Here is a quick problem
statement.
Imagine that we have a set of data types and a set of operations that act on
these types. Sometimes we need to add more operations and make sure they work
properly on all types; sometimes we need to add more types and make sure all
operations work properly on them. Sometimes, however, we need to add both - and
herein lies the problem. Most of the mainstream programming languages don't
provide good tools to add both new types and new operations to an existing
system without having to change existing code. This is called the "expression
problem". Studying the problem and its possible solutions gives great insight
into the fundamental differences between object-oriented and functional
programming and well as concepts like interfaces and multiple dispatch.

A motivating example
As is my wont, my example comes from the world of compilers and interpreters.
To my defense, this is also the example used in some of the seminal historic
sources on the expression problem, as the historical perspective section below
details.
Imagine we're designing a simple expression evaluator. Following the standard
interpreter design pattern, we have
a tree structure consisting of expressions, with some operations we can do on
such trees. In C++ we'd have an interface every node in the expression tree
would have to implement:
class Expr {
public:
  virtual std::string ToString() const = 0;
  virtual double Eval() const = 0;
};

This interface shows that we currently have two operations we can do on
expression trees - evaluate them and query for their string representations.
A typical leaf node expression:
class Constant : public Expr {
public:
  Constant(double value) : value_(value) {}

  std::string ToString() const {
    std::ostringstream ss;
    ss << value_;
    return ss.str();
  }

  double Eval() const {
    return value_;
  }

private:
  double value_;
};

And a typical composite expression:
class BinaryPlus : public Expr {
public:
  BinaryPlus(const Expr& lhs, const Expr& rhs) : lhs_(lhs), rhs_(rhs) {}

  std::string ToString() const {
    return lhs_.ToString() + " + " + rhs_.ToString();
  }

  double Eval() const {
    return lhs_.Eval() + rhs_.Eval();
  }

private:
  const Expr& lhs_;
  const Expr& rhs_;
};

Until now, it's all fairly basic stuff. How extensible is this design? Let's
see... if we want to add new expression types ("variable reference", "function
call" etc.), that's pretty easy. We just define additional classes inheriting
from Expr and implement the Expr interface (ToString and Eval).
However, what happens if we want to add new operations that can be applied to
expression trees? Right now we have Eval and ToString, but we may want
additional operations like "type check" or "serialize" or "compile to
machine code" or whatever.
It turns out that adding new operations isn't as easy as adding new types. We'd
have to change the Expr interface, and consequently change every existing
expression type to support the new method(s). If we don't control the original
code or it's hard to change it for other reasons, we're in trouble.
In other words, we'd have to violate the venerable open-closed principle,
one of the main principles of object-oriented design, defined
as:

software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for
extension, but closed for modification
The problem we're hitting here is called the expression problem, and the
example above shows how it applies to object-oriented programming.
Interestingly, the expression problem bites functional programming languages as
well. Let's see how.


The expression problem in functional programming
Update 2018-02-05: a new post
discusses the problem and its solutions in Haskell in more depth.
Object-oriented approaches tend to collect functionality in objects (types).
Functional languages cut the cake from a different angle, usually preferring
types as thin data containers, collecting most functionality in functions
(operations) that act upon them. Functional languages don't escape the
expression problem - it just manifests there in a different way.
To demonstrate this, let's see how the expression evaluator / stringifier looks
in Haskell. Haskell is a good poster child for functional programming since its
pattern matching on types makes such code especially succinct:
module Expressions where

data Expr = Constant Double
          | BinaryPlus Expr Expr

stringify :: Expr -> String
stringify (Constant c) = show c
stringify (BinaryPlus lhs rhs) = stringify lhs
                                ++ " + "
                                ++ stringify rhs

evaluate :: Expr -> Double
evaluate (Constant c) = c
evaluate (BinaryPlus lhs rhs) = evaluate lhs + evaluate rhs

Now let's say we want to add a new operation - type checking. We simply have
to add a new function typecheck and define how it behaves for all known
kinds of expressions. No need to modify existing code.
On the other hand, if we want to add a new type (like "function call"), we get
into trouble. We now have to modify all existing functions to handle this new
type. So we hit exactly the same problem, albeit from a different angle.



A visual representation of the expression problem can be helpful to appreciate
how it applies to OOP and FP in different ways, and how a potential solution
would look.
The following 2-D table (a "matrix") has types in its rows and operations in its
columns. A matrix cell row, col is checked when the operation col is
implemented for type row:
In object-oriented languages, it's easy to add new types but difficult to add
new operations:
Whereas in functional languages, it's easy to add new operations but difficult
to add new types:



A historical perspective
The expression problem isn't new, and has likely been with us since the early
days; it pops its head as soon as programs reach some not-too-high level of
complexity.
It's fairly certain that the name expression problem comes from an email sent
by Philip Wadler to a mailing
list deailing with adding generics to Java (this was back in the 1990s).
In that email, Wadler points to the paper "Synthesizing Object-Oriented and
Functional Design to Promote Re-Use" by
Krishnamurthi, Felleisen and Friedman as an earlier work describing the problem
and proposed solutions. This is a great paper and I highly recommend reading it.
Krishnamurthi et.al., in their references, point to papers from as early as 1975
describing variations of the problem in Algol.


Flipping the matrix with the visitor pattern
So far the article has focused on the expression problem, and I hope it's
clear by now. However, the title also has the word solution in it, so let's
turn to that.
It's possible to kinda solve (read on to understand why I say "kinda") the
expression problem in object-oriented languages; first, we have to look at how
we can flip the problem on its side using the visitor pattern. The visitor
pattern is very common for this kind of problems, and for a good reason. It lets
us reformulate our code in a way that makes it easier to change in some
dimensions (though harder in others).
For the C++ sample shown above, rewriting it using the visitor pattern means
adding a new "visitor" interface:
class ExprVisitor {
public:
  virtual void VisitConstant(const Constant& c) = 0;
  virtual void VisitBinaryPlus(const BinaryPlus& bp) = 0;
};

And changing the Expr interface to be:
class Expr {
public:
  virtual void Accept(ExprVisitor* visitor) const = 0;
};

Now expression types defer the actual computation to the visitor, as
follows:
class Constant : public Expr {
public:
  Constant(double value) : value_(value) {}

  void Accept(ExprVisitor* visitor) const {
    visitor->VisitConstant(*this);
  }

  double GetValue() const {
    return value_;
  }

private:
  double value_;
};

// ... similarly, BinaryPlus would have
//
//    void Accept(ExprVisitor* visitor) const {
//      visitor->VisitBinaryPlus(*this);
//    }
//
// ... etc.

A sample visitor for evaluation would be [2]:
class Evaluator : public ExprVisitor {
public:
  double GetValueForExpr(const Expr& e) {
    return value_map_[&e];
  }

  void VisitConstant(const Constant& c) {
    value_map_[&c] = c.GetValue();
  }

  void VisitBinaryPlus(const BinaryPlus& bp) {
    bp.GetLhs().Accept(this);
    bp.GetRhs().Accept(this);
    value_map_[&bp] = value_map_[&(bp.GetLhs())] + value_map_[&(bp.GetRhs())];
  }

private:
  std::map<const Expr*, double> value_map_;
};

It should be obvious that for a given set of data types, adding new visitors is
easy and doesn't require modifying any other code. On the other hand, adding new
types is problematic since it means we have to update the ExprVisitor
interface with a new abstract method, and consequently update all the visitors
to implement it.
So it seems that we've just turned the expression problem on its side: we're
using an OOP language, but now it's hard to add types and easy to add ops, just
like in the functional approach. I find it extremely interesting that we can do
this. In my eyes this highlights the power of different abstractions and
paradigms, and how they enable us to rethink a problem in a completely different
light.
So we haven't solved anything yet; we've just changed the nature of the problem
we're facing. Worry not - this is just a stepping stone to an actual solution.


Extending the visitor pattern
The following is code excerpts from a C++ solution that follows the extended
visitor pattern proposed by Krishnamurthi et. al. in their paper; I strongly
suggest reading the paper (particularly section 3) if you want to understand
this code on a deep level. A complete code sample in C++ that compiles and runs
is available here.
Adding new visitors (ops) with the visitor pattern is easy. Our challenge is to
add a new type without upheaving too much existing code. Let's see how it's
done.
One small design change that we should make to the original visitor pattern is
use virtual inheritance for Evaluator, for reasons that will soon become
obvious:
class Evaluator : virtual public ExprVisitor {
  // .. the rest is the same
};

Now we're going to add a new type - FunctionCall:
// This is the new ("extended") expression we're adding.
class FunctionCall : public Expr {
public:
  FunctionCall(const std::string& name, const Expr& argument)
      : name_(name), argument_(argument) {}

  void Accept(ExprVisitor* visitor) const {
    ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall* v =
        dynamic_cast<ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall*>(visitor);
    if (v == nullptr) {
      std::cerr << "Fatal: visitor is not ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall\n";
      exit(1);
    }
    v->VisitFunctionCall(*this);
  }

private:
  std::string name_;
  const Expr& argument_;
};

Since we don't want to modify the existing visitors, we create a new one,
extending Evaluator for function calls. But first, we need to extend the
ExprVisitor interface to support the new type:
class ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall : virtual public ExprVisitor {
public:
  virtual void VisitFunctionCall(const FunctionCall& fc) = 0;
};

Finally, we write the new evaluator, which extends Evaluator and supports
the new type:
class EvaluatorWithFunctionCall : public ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall,
                                  public Evaluator {
public:
  void VisitFunctionCall(const FunctionCall& fc) {
    std::cout << "Visiting FunctionCall!!\n";
  }
};

Multiple inheritance, virtual inheritance, dynamic type checking... that's
pretty hard-core C++ we have to use here, but there's no choice. Unfortunately,
multiple inheritance is the only way C++ lets us express the idea that a class
implements some interface while at the same time deriving functionality from
another class. What we want to have here is an evaluator
(EvaluatorWithFunctionCall) that inherits all functionality from
Evaluator, and also implements the ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall
interface. In Java, we could say something like:
class EvaluatorWithFunctionCall extends Evaluator implements ExprVisitor {
  // ...
}

But in C++ virtual multiple inheritance is the tool we have. The virtual part of
the inheritance is essential here for the compiler to figure out that the
ExprVisitor base underlying both Evaluator and
ExprVisitorWithFunctionCall is the same and should only appear once in
EvaluatorWithFunctionCall. Without virtual, the compiler would complain that
EvaluatorWithFunctionCall doesn't implement the ExprVisitor interface.
This is a solution, alright. We kinda added a new type FunctionCall and can
now visit it without changing existing code (assuming the virtual inheritance
was built into the design from the start to anticipate this approach). Here I
am using this "kinda" word again... it's time to explain why.
This approach has multiple flaws, in my opinion:

Note the dynamic_cast in FunctionCall::Accept. It's fairly ugly that
we're forced to mix in dynamic checks into this code, which should supposedly
rely on static typing and the compiler. But it's just a sign of a larger
problem.
If we have an instance of an Evaluator, it will no longer work on the
whole extended expression tree since it has no understanding of
FunctionCall. It's easy to say that all new evaluators should rather be
EvaluatorWithFunctionCall, but we don't always control this. What about
code that was already written? What about Evaluators created in
third-party or library code which we have no control of?
The virtual inheritance is not the only provision we have to build into the
design to support this pattern. Some visitors would need to create new,
recursive visitors to process complex expressions. But we can't anticipate
in advance which dynamic type of visitor needs to be created. Therefore,
the visitor interface should also accept a "visitor factory" which extended
visitors will supply. I know this sounds complicated, and I don't want to
spend more time on this here - but the Krishnamurthi paper addresses this
issue extensively in section 3.4
Finally, the solution is unwieldy for realistic applications. Adding one
new type looks manageable; what about adding 15 new types, gradually over
time? Imagine the horrible zoo of ExprVisitor extensions and dynamic
checks this would lead to.

Yeah, programming is hard. I could go on and on about the limitations of
classical OOP and how they surface in this example [3]. Instead, I'll just
present how the expression problem can be solved in a language that supports
multiple dispatch and separates the defintion of methods from the bodies of
types they act upon.


Solving the expression problem in Clojure
There are a number of ways the expression problem as displayed in this article
can be solved in Clojure using the language's built-in features. Let's start
with the simplest one - multi-methods.
First we'll define the types as records:
(defrecord Constant [value])
(defrecord BinaryPlus [lhs rhs])

Then, we'll define evaluate as a multimethod that dispatches upon the type
of its argument, and add method implementations for Constant and
BinaryPlus:
(defmulti evaluate class)

(defmethod evaluate Constant
  [c] (:value c))

(defmethod evaluate BinaryPlus
  [bp] (+ (evaluate (:lhs bp)) (evaluate (:rhs bp))))

Now we can already evaluate expressions:
user=> (use 'expression.multimethod)
nil
user=> (evaluate (->BinaryPlus (->Constant 1.1) (->Constant 2.2)))
3.3000000000000003

Adding a new operation is easy. Let's add stringify:
(defmulti stringify class)

(defmethod stringify Constant
  [c] (str (:value c)))

(defmethod stringify BinaryPlus
  [bp]
  (clojure.string/join " + " [(stringify (:lhs bp))
                              (stringify (:rhs bp))]))

Testing it:
user=> (stringify (->BinaryPlus (->Constant 1.1) (->Constant 2.2)))
"1.1 + 2.2"

How about adding new types? Suppose we want to add FunctionCall. First,
we'll define the new type. For simplicity, the func field of
FunctionCall is just a Clojure function. In real code it could be some sort
of function object in the language we're interpreting:
(defrecord FunctionCall [func argument])

And define how evaluate and stringify work for FunctionCall:
(defmethod evaluate FunctionCall
  [fc] ((:func fc) (evaluate (:argument fc))))

(defmethod stringify FunctionCall
  [fc] (str (clojure.repl/demunge (str (:func fc)))
            "("
            (stringify (:argument fc))
            ")"))

Let's take it for a spin (the full code is here):
user=> (def callexpr (->FunctionCall twice (->BinaryPlus (->Constant 1.1)
                                                         (->Constant 2.2))))
#'user/callexpr
user=> (evaluate callexpr)
6.6000000000000005
user=> (stringify callexpr)
"expression.multimethod/twice@52e29c38(1.1 + 2.2)"

It should be evident that the expression problem matrix for Clojure is:
We can add new ops without touching any existing code. We can also add new types
without touching any existing code. The code we're adding is only the new code
to handle the ops/types in question. The existing ops and types could come from
a third-party library to which we don't have source access. We could still
extend them for our new ops and types, without ever having to touch (or even
see) the original source code [4].


Is multiple dispatch necessary to cleanly solve the expression problem?
I've written about multiple dispatch in Clojure
before, and in the previous section we see another example of how to use the
language's defmulti/defmethod constructs. But is it multiple dispatch at
all? No! It's just single dispatch, really. Our ops (evaluate and
stringify) dispatch on a single argument - the expression type) [5].
If we're not really using multiple dispatch, what is the secret sauce that
lets us solve the expression problem so elegantly in Clojure? The answer is -
open methods. Note a crucial difference between how methods are defined in
C++/Java and in Clojure. In C++/Java, methods have to be part of a class and
defined (or at least declared) in its body. You cannot add a method to a class
without changing the class's source code.
In Clojure, you can. In fact, since data types and multimethods are orthogonal
entities, this is by design. Methods simply live outside types - they are first
class citizens, rather than properties of types. We don't add methods to a
type, we add new methods that act upon the type. This doesn't require
modifying the type's code in any way (or even having access to its code).
Some of the other popular programming languages take a middle way. In languages
like Python, Ruby and JavaScript methods belong to types, but we can dynamically
add, remove and replace methods in a class even after it was created. This
technique is lovingly called monkey patching. While initially enticing, it
can lead to big maintainability headaches in code unless we're very careful.
Therefore, if I had to face the expression problem in Python I'd prefer to roll
out some sort of multiple dispatch mechanism
for my program rather than rely on monkey patching.


Another Clojure solution - using protocols
Clojure's multimethods are very general and powerful. So general, in fact, that
their performance may not be optimal for the most common case - which is single
dispatch based on the type of the sole method argument; note that this is
exactly the kind of dispatch I'm using in this article. Therefore, starting with
Clojure 1.2, user code gained the ability to define and use protocols - a
language feature that was previously restricted only to built-in types.
Protocols leverage the host platform's (which in Clojure's case is mostly Java)
ability to provide quick virtual dispatch, so using them is a very efficient way
to implement runtime polymorphism. In addition, protocols retain enough of
the flexibility of multimethods to elegantly solve the expression problem.
Curiously, this was on the mind of Clojure's designers right from the start. The
Clojure documentation page about protocols lists this as one of their
capabilities:

[...] Avoid the 'expression problem' by allowing independent extension of the
set of types, protocols, and implementations of protocols on types, by
different parties. [...] do so without wrappers/adapters
Clojure protocols are an interesting topic, and while I'd like to spend some
more time on them, this article is becoming too long as it is. So I'll leave
a more thorough treatment for some later time and for now will just show how
protocols can also be used to solve the expression problem we're discussing.
The type definitions remain the same:
(defrecord Constant [value])
(defrecord BinaryPlus [lhs rhs])

However, instead of defining a multimethod for each operation, we now define
a protocol. A protocol can be thought of as an interface in a language like
Java, C++ or Go - a type implements an interface when it defines the set of
methods declared by the interface. In this respect, Clojure's protocols are more
like Go's interfaces than Java's, as we don't have to say a-priori which
interfaces a type implements when we define it.
Let's start with the Evaluatable protocol, that consists of a single method
- evaluate:
(defprotocol Evaluatable
  (evaluate [this]))

Another protocol we'll define is Stringable:
(defprotocol Stringable
  (stringify [this]))

Now we can make sure our types implement these protocols:
(extend-type Constant
  Evaluatable
    (evaluate [this] (:value this))
  Stringable
    (stringify [this] (str (:value this))))

(extend-type BinaryPlus
  Evaluatable
    (evaluate [this] (+ (evaluate (:lhs this)) (evaluate (:rhs this))))
  Stringable
    (stringify [this]
      (clojure.string/join " + " [(stringify (:lhs this))
                                  (stringify (:rhs this))])))

The extend-type macro is a convenience wrapper around the more general
extend - it lets us implement multiple protocols for a given type.
A sibling macro named extend-protocol lets us implement the same protocol
for multiple types in the same invocation [6].
It's fairly obvious that adding new data types is easy - just as we did above,
we simply use extend-type for each new data type to implement our current
protocols. But how do we add a new protocol and make sure all existing data
types implement it? Once again, it's easy because we don't have to modify any
existing code. Here's a new protocol:
(defprotocol Serializable
  (serialize [this]))

And this is its implementation for the currently supported data types:
(extend-protocol Serializable
  Constant
    (serialize [this] [(type this) (:value this)])
  BinaryPlus
    (serialize [this] [(type this)
                       (serialize (:lhs this))
                       (serialize (:rhs this))]))

This time, extending a single protocol for multiple data types -
extend-protocol is the more convenient macro to use.


Small interfaces are extensibility-friendly
You may have noted that the protocols (interfaces) defined in the Clojure
solution are very small - consisting of a single method. Since adding methods to
an existing protocol is much more problematic (I'm not aware of a way to do this
in Clojure), keeping protocols small is a good idea. This guideline comes up in
other contexts as well; for example, it's good practice to keep interfaces in Go
very minimal.
In our C++ solution, splitting the Expr interface could also be a good idea,
but it wouldn't help us with the expression problem, since we can't modify which
interfaces a class implements after we've defined it; in Clojure we can.




[1]"Types of data" and "operations" are two terms that should be fairly
obvious to modern-day programmers. Philip Wadler, in his discussion of
the expression problem (see the "historical perspective" section of the
article) calls them "datatypes" and "functions". A famous quote from Fred
Brooks's The Mythical Man Month (1975) is "Show me your flowcharts and
conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your
tables, and I won’t usually need your flowcharts; they’ll be obvious."





[2]Note the peculiar way in which data is passed between Visit* methods
in a Expr* -> Value map kept in the visitor. This is due to our
inability to make Visit* methods return different types in different
visitors. For example, in Evaluator we'd want them to return
double, but in Stringifier they'd probably return
std::string. Unfortunately C++ won't let us easily mix templates and
virtual functions, so we have to resort to either returning void* the
C way or the method I'm using here.
Curiously, in their paper Krishnamurthi et.al. run into the same issue in
the dialect of Java they're using, and propose some language extensions
to solve it. Philip Wadler uses proposed Java generics in his approach.






[3]I can't resist, so just in brief: IMHO inheritance is only good for a
very narrow spectrum of uses, but languages like C++ hail it as the main
extension mechanism of types. But inheritance is deeply
flawed for many other use cases, such as implementations of
interfaces. Java is a bit better in this regard, but in the end the
primacy of classes and their "closed-ness" make a lot of tasks - like the
expression problem - very difficult to express in a clean way.





[4]In fact, there are plenty of examples in which the Clojure implementation
and the standard library provide protocols that can be extended by the
user for user-defined types. Extending user-written protocols and
multimethods for built-in types is trivial. As an exercise, add an
evaluate implementation for java.lang.Long, so that built-in
integers could participate in our expression trees without requiring
wrapping in a Constant.





[5]FWIW, we can formulate a multiple dispatch solution to the expression
problem in Clojure. The key idea is to dispatch on two things: type and
operation. Just for fun, I coded a prototype that does this which you can
see here.
I think the approach presented in the article - each operation being its
own multimethod - is preferable, though.





[6]The sharp-eyed reader will notice a cool connection to the expression
problem matrix. extend-type can add a whole new row to the matrix,
while extend-protocol adds a column. extend adds just a single
cell.

The Microdot
web framework is quite small, as its name would imply; it supports both
standard CPython and MicroPython,
so it can be used on systems ranging from internet-of-things (IoT) devices
all the way up to large, cloudy servers.  It was developed by Miguel
Grinberg, who gave a presentation about it at EuroPython 2025.  His name
may sound familiar from his well-known Flask
Mega-Tutorial, which has introduced many to the Flask lightweight Python-based
web framework.  It should come as no surprise, then, that Microdot is
inspired by its rather larger cousin, so Flask enthusiasts will find much
to like in Microdot—and will come up to speed quickly should their needs turn
toward smaller systems.



We have looked at various pieces of this software stack along the way: Microdot itself in January 2024, MicroPython in 2023, and Flask as part of a look at Python microframeworks in
2019.



Grinberg began his talk with an introduction.  He has been living in
Ireland for a few years and "I make stuff".  That includes open-source projects, blog posts (on a
Flask-based blog platform that he wrote), and "a bunch of books".
He works for Elastic and is one of the maintainers of the Elasticsearch
Python client, "so maybe you have used some of the things that I
made for money".


Why?


With a chuckle, he asked: "Why do we need another web framework?  We
have so many already."  The story starts with a move that he made to
Ireland from the US in 2018; he rented a house with a "smart" heating
controller and was excited to use it.  There were two thermostats, one for
each level of the house, and he was "really looking forward to the
winter" to see the system in action.



As might be guessed, he could set target temperatures in each thermostat;
they would communicate with the controller that would turn the heating on
and off as needed.  In addition, the system had a web server that could be
used to query various parameters or to start and stop the heaters.  You
could even send commands via SMS text messages; "there's a SIM card
somewhere in that box [...] very exciting stuff".



When winter rolled around, it did not work that well, however; sometimes
the house was too chilly or warm and he had to start and stop the heaters
himself. He did some debugging and found that the thermostats were
reporting temperatures that were off by ±3°C, "which is too much for
trying to keep the house at 20°".  The owner of the house thought that
he was too used to the US where things just work; "at least she thinks that in America everything is super-efficient,
everything works, and she thought 'this is the way things work in
Ireland'".  So he did not make any progress with the owner.



At that point, most people would probably just give up and live with the
problem; "I hacked my heating controller instead".  He set the
temperatures in both thermostats to zero, which effectively disabled their
ability to affect the heaters at all, and built two small boards running
MicroPython, each connected to a temperature and humidity sensor device.
He wrote code that would check the temperature every five minutes and send
the appropriate commands to start or stop the heaters based on what it
found.



So the second half of his first winter in Ireland went great.  The sensors
are accurate to ±0.5°C, so "problem solved".  But, that led to a new
problem for him.  "I wanted to know things: What's the temperature right
now?  Is the heating running right now or not?  How many hours did it run
today compared to yesterday?"  And so on.



He added a small LCD screen to display some information, but he had to
actually go to the device and look at it; what he really wanted was to be
able to talk to the device over WiFi and get information from the couch
while he was watching TV. "I wanted to host a web server [...]  that
will show me a little dashboard".



So he searched for web frameworks
for MicroPython; in the winter of 2018-2019, "there were none".
Neither Flask nor Bottle,
which is a good bit smaller, would run on MicroPython; both are too large
for the devices,
but, in addition, the standard library for MicroPython is a subset of that of
CPython, so many things that they need are missing. A "normal
person" would likely have just accepted that and moved on; "I
created a web framework instead."


Demo


He brought one of his thermostat devices to Prague for the conference and
did a small demonstration of it operating during the talk.  The device was
connected to his laptop using USB, which provided power, but also a serial
connection to the board.  On the laptop, he used the rshell
remote MicroPython shell to talk to the board, effectively using the laptop
as a terminal.





He started the MicroPython read-eval-print loop (REPL) on the board in
order to simulate the normal operation of the board.  When it is plugged
into the wall, rather than a laptop, it will boot to the web server, so he
made that happen with a soft-reboot command.  The device then connected to
the conference WiFi and gave him the IP address (and port) where the server
was running.



He switched over to Firefox on his laptop and visited the site, which showed a
dashboard that had the current temperature (24.4°) and relative humidity
(56.9%) of the room.  He also used curl from the laptop to contact the
api endpoint of the web application, which returned JSON with the
two values and the time.  There is no persistent clock on the board, so the
application contacts an NTP server to pick up the time when it boots; that
allows it to report the last time a measurement was taken.



Grinberg said that he wanted to set the expectations at the right level by
looking at the capabilities of the microcontrollers he often uses with
Microdot.  For example, the ESP8266 in his thermostat device has 64KB of
RAM and up to 4MB of flash.  The ESP8266 is the smallest and least expensive (around €5)
device with WiFi that
he has found; there are many even smaller devices, but they lack
the networking required for running a web server.  The other devices
he uses are the Raspberry Pi Pico W with 2MB of flash and 256KB of RAM and
the ESP32 with up to 8MB of flash and 512KB of RAM.  He contrasted those
with his laptop, which has 32GB of RAM, so "you need 500,000
ESP8266s" to have the same amount of memory.


Features


The core framework of Microdot is in a single microdot.py
file.  It is fully asynchronous, using the MicroPython
subset of the CPython
asyncio module, so it can run on both interpreters.  It uses
asyncio because that is the only way to do concurrency on the
microcontrollers; there is no support for processes or threads on those devices.



Microdot has Flask-style route
decorators to define URLs for the application.  It has Request
and Response
classes, as well as hooks
to run before and after requests, he said.  Handling query strings,
form data, and JSON are all available in Microdot via normal Python
dictionaries.  Importantly, it can handle streaming requests and responses;
because of the limited memory of these devices, it may be necessary to split
up the handling of larger requests or responses.



It supports setting
cookies and sending static
files.  Web applications can be constructed from a set of modules, using sub-applications,
which are similar to Flask
blueprints.  It also has its own web
server with TLS support.  "I'm very proud of all the stuff I was
able to fit in the core Microdot framework", Grinberg said.



He hoped that attendees would have to think for a minute to come up with
things that are missing from Microdot, but they definitely do exist.  There
are some officially
maintained extensions, each in its own single .py file, to
fill some of those holes.  They encompass functionality that is important,
but he did not want to add to the core because that would make it too large
to fit on the low-end ESP8266 that he is using.



There is an extension for multipart
forms, which includes file uploads; "this is extremely complicated
to parse, it didn't make sense to add it into the core because most people
don't do this".  There is support for WebSocket
and server-sent
events (SSE).  Templates
are supported using utemplate
for both Python implementations or Jinja, which only
works on CPython.  There are extensions for basic
and token-based authentication and for secure
user logins with session data; the latter required a replacement for
the CPython-only PyJWT, which Grinberg
wrote and contributed to MicroPython as jwt.py.
There is a small handful of other extensions that he quickly mentioned as well.



"I consider the documentation as part of the framework"; he is
"kind of fanatical" about documenting everything.  If there is
something missing or not explained well, "it's a bug that I need to
fix".  He writes books, so the documentation is organized similarly;
it comes in at 9,267 words, which equates to around 47 minutes of reading
time.  There is 100% test coverage, he said, and there are around 30
examples, with more coming.



A design principle that he follows is "no dark magic".  An example
of dark magic to him is the Flask
application context, "which very few people understand".  In
Microdot, the request object is explicitly passed to each route function.
Another example is the dependency
injection that is used by the FastAPI framework to add
components; Microdot uses explicit decorators instead.



He used the cloc
utility to count lines of code, while ignoring comments and blank
lines.  Using that, Django
comes in at 110,000 lines, Flask plus its essential Werkzeug library
is 15,500 lines, FastAPI with Starlette is 14,900 lines, Bottle is
around 3,000 lines, while the Microdot core has 765 lines ("believe it
or not") and a full
install with all the extensions on MicroPython comes in at just shy of 1,700
lines of code.



He ended with an example of how Microdot can be so small by comparing the
URL matching in Flask with Microdot.  The Flask version does lots more than
Microdot, with more supported types of arguments in a URL and multiple classes
in the werkzeug.routing
module; it has 1,362 lines of code.  For Microdot, there is a more
limited set of URL arguments, though there is still the ability to define
custom types, and a single
URLPattern class; all of that is done in 63 lines of
code. "I don't intend to support everything that Flask supports, in
terms of routing, but I intend to support the 20% that covers 80% of the
use cases."  That is the overall mechanism that he has used to get to
something that is so small.



An audience member asked about whether the Microdot code was minified in
order to get it to fit.  Grinberg said that doing so was not all that
useful for MicroPython, but the code is smaller on the board because it is
precompiled on another system; that results in a
microdot.mpy file, which is bytecode for MicroPython.  For
example, on the
low-end device he is using for his thermostats, Microdot would not be able
to be compiled on the device itself.  There are some other tricks that can
also be used for reducing the RAM requirements, like putting the code into
the firmware as part of the MicroPython binary.



The final question was about performance, and how many requests per second
could be handled. Grinberg said that he did not
have any real numbers, but that the device he demonstrated is "really
really slow".  That question led to a blog
post in late July where Grinberg tried to more fully answer it.

        Smalltalk MVC is defined in Design Pattern as:


  MVC Consists of three kinds of objects. The Model is the application object, the View is its screen presentation, and the Controller defines the way the user interface reacts to user input.1


However this definition has been abused over the years - Back in 2003 I gave a talk citing how bad Apple’s definition was. At the time it stated:


  A view object knows how to display and possibly edit data from the application’s model… A controller object acts as the intermediary between the application’s view objects and its model objects… Controllers are often the least reusable objects in an application, but that’s acceptable…2


Of course it isn’t acceptable and, over the years, Apple has refined their definition and now acknowledge the distinction between the traditional Smalltalk version of MVC and the Cocoa version.3 But the Cocoa version is still defined much as it was before:


  A view object knows how to display, and might allow users to edit, the data from the application’s model… A controller object acts as the intermediary between the application’s view objects and its model objects…3


In looking at how iOS applications are written the sentiment that controllers (and now view-controllers) are often the least reusable components in an application still flourishes, even if it is now unstated.

MVC (I’ll always use that term to refer to the Smalltalk form) has the following structure:















figure: Smalltalk MVC4


Here the solid lines imply a direct association. And the dashed lines an indirect association by an observer. So what we see is that the model is unaware of the view and controller, except indirectly through notifications, and hence the code in the Model is reusable. The controller and view bind to the model, not the other way around.

Often the function of the Controller and View are tightly coupled into a “widget” or “control”. When Apple talks about a View-Controller in their model they are talking about a grab-bag of an uber-widget that is a composite of UIView widgets and multiple models. From what I’ve seen, including in Apple’s example code, it is usually a pretty big mess.

The key to getting MVC correct is understanding what models are. A model is simply an object5 which can be observed (a requirement for attaching views). For example, in ObjC an int is an object, but it is not observable. However, an ObjC object with an int property is observable using Key-Value Observing6.  A model may encapsulate complex relationships between the model’s properties. A trivial model is one where each property is completely independent (think C struct vs. C++ class). From a notification the view should be able to determine, at a minimum:


  What changed. It may be as simple as “the model bound to the view”.
  The new value to display.


For example, let’s say our model is a trivial observable boolean (I can’t imagine a simpler model). What we want is a checkbox that binds to the observable boolean. When the controller requests a change in value, the boolean is updated, and the view is notified of the new state of the model. The model is unaware of what UI is attached to it, and in fact there could be multiple UIs, including something like a scripting system, attached to the same instance of the model. This is a form of data binding - though most data binding systems replicate the problems of their underlying widget set by treating the model as if it were observing the view, not the other way around.

Contrast this with most UI frameworks where you have a checkbox widget from which you can query the value and you receive a notification when the value has changed. This is pushing a model into the widget. With MVC you never ask a question like “what is the default state of this checkbox?” - the default state of the view is always the current state of the model. You would also never get the state of the checkbox - the state of the checkbox is simply a reflection of the state of the model. In a system where you get the state of a checkbox you are binding two models together by treating one as a view/controller of the other. Such a pattern doesn’t scale beyond trivial models, and even for those it introduces some ambiguity.

I conjecture that one of the reasons why MVC has been so screwed up is because, unlike in Smalltalk, writing something as simple as an observable boolean is a bit of a pain in a language like Pascal or C. You quickly get into object ownership and lifetime issues and how to write bind expressions. If one also assumes that you have a 1:1 mapping from UI to model then there is some inherent inefficiency in the generalization. The Lisa team made some major compromises and the rest of the industry followed along.7

To support more complex views, the notification may need to specify what parts of the model changed and how those parts changed. For example, “image 58 was removed from the sequence”. A complete model is one that can support any view of that model type efficiently (related to the notion of a complete type and a type’s efficient basis).

One additional attribute of MVC is that it is a composite pattern. This is hinted at by the direct connection between the Controller and the View. As I said early, the view may contain state, this state is itself an object, and because this state is also displayed within the view it is observable. It is another model. I refers to this as the view’s model. This model may include things such as the visibility of a window, the tab the user was last looking at, and the portion of the model being viewed.

Identifying what the models are in your system is important. We usually do pretty good at identifying the major models. Such as “this is an image” - but often fall short of identifying the complete model, i.e. “this is an image with a collection of settings.” We end up with our model spread out within the code (an incidental type) and it makes it more difficult to deal with it.

A common model that is often completely overlooked is the model for function arguments. When you have a command, button, gesture, or menu item in your application, these are bound to a function. The function itself is not typically a zeroary function but rather has a set of arguments that are constructed through other parts of the UI. For example, if I have a list of images in my application, I might have a button to delete the selected images. Here the current selection is the argument to my delete command. To create a UI for the selection I must create a model of the arguments to my function. A precondition of delete is that the selection is not empty. This precondition must be observable in the argument model so it can be reflected in the view by disabling or hiding the button and in the controller be disallowing the user to click the button and issue the command. The same argument model can be shared for multiple commands within an application.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
The noted Diné (Navajo) weaver Marilou Schultz recently completed an intricate weaving
composed of
thick white lines on a black background, punctuated with reddish-orange diamonds.
Although this striking rug may appear abstract, it shows the internal circuitry of a tiny silicon chip known
as the 555 timer.
This chip has hundreds of applications in
everything from a sound generator to a windshield wiper controller.
At one point, the 555 was the world's best-selling integrated circuit with billions sold.
But how did the chip get turned into a rug?

The 555 chip is constructed from a tiny flake of silicon with a layer of metallic wiring on top.
In the rug, this wiring is visible as the thick white lines, while the silicon forms the black background.
One conspicuous feature of the rug is the reddish-orange diamonds around the perimeter.
These correspond to the connections between the silicon chip and its eight pins. Tiny golden bond wires—thinner than a human hair—are attached to the square bond pads to provide these connections.
The circuitry of the 555 chip contains 25 transistors, silicon devices that can switch
on and off.
The rug is dominated by three large transistors, the filled squares with a 王 pattern inside, while the remaining transistors are represented by small dots.
The weaving was inspired by a photo of the 555 timer die taken by
Antoine Bercovici
(Siliconinsider); I suggested this photo to Schultz as a possible subject
for a rug.  The diagram below compares the 
weaving (left) with the die photo (right).
As you can see, the weaving closely follows the actual chip, but there are a few artistic differences.
For instance, two of the bond pads have been removed, the circuitry at the top has been simplified,
and the part number at the bottom has been removed.
A comparison of the rug (left) and the original photograph (right).
Dark-field image of the 555 timer is courtesy of Antoine Bercovici.
Antoine took the die photo with a dark field microscope, a special type of microscope that
produces an image on a black background.
This image emphasizes the metal layer on the top of the die.
In comparison, a standard bright-field microscope produced the image below.
When a chip is manufactured, regions of silicon are "doped" with impurities to create transistors
and resistors.
These regions are visible in the image below as subtle changes in the color of the silicon.

In the weaving, the chip's design appears almost monumental, making it easy to forget that the
actual chip is microscopic.
For the photo below,
I obtained a version of the chip packaged in a metal can, rather than the typical rectangle of
black plastic.
Cutting the top off the metal can reveals the tiny chip inside, with eight gold bond wires connecting the
die to the pins of the package.
If you zoom in on the photo, you may recognize the three large transistors that dominate the rug.

The artist, Marilou Schultz, has been creating chip rugs since 1994, when Intel commissioned a
rug based on the Pentium as a gift to AISES (American Indian Science & Engineering Society).
Although Schultz learned weaving as a child, the Pentium rug was a challenge due to its complex pattern
and lack of symmetry; a day's work might add just an inch to the rug.
This dramatic weaving was created with wool from the long-horned Navajo-Churro sheep, colored with
traditional plant dyes.
"Replica of a Chip", created by Marilou Schultz, 1994. Wool. Photo taken at the National Gallery of Art, 2024.
For the 555 timer weaving, Schultz experimented with different materials. Silver and gold metallic threads
represent the aluminum and copper in the chip.
The artist explains that "it took a lot more time to incorporate the metallic threads," but it was
worth the effort because "it is spectacular to see the rug with the metallics in the dark with a little light hitting it."
Aniline dyes provided the black and lavender colors.
Although natural logwood dye
produces a beautiful purple, it fades over time, so Schultz used an aniline dye instead.
The lavender colors are dedicated to the weaver's mother, who passed away in February;
purple was her favorite color.
Inside the chip
How does the 555 chip produce a particular time delay?
You add external components—resistors and a capacitor—to select the time.
The capacitor is filled (charged) at a speed controlled by the resistor. When the capacitor get "full",
the 555 chip switches operation and starts emptying (discharging) the capacitor.
It's like filling a sink: if you have a large sink (capacitor) and a trickle of water (large resistor),
the sink fills slowly. But if you have a smal sink (capacitor) and a lot of water (small resistor),
the sink fills quickly.
By using different resistors and capacitors, the 555 timer can provide time intervals from microseconds
to hours.
I've constructed an interactive chip browser that shows how the regions of the rug correspond to specific
electronic components in the physical chip. Click on any part of the rug to learn the function of
the corresponding component in the chip.


Click the die or schematic for details...











For instance, two of the large square transistors turn the chip's output on or off, while the third
large transistor discharges the capacitor when it is full. (To be precise, the capacitor goes between 1/3 full
and 2/3 full to avoid issues near "empty" and "full".)
The chip has circuits called comparators that detect when the capacitor's voltage reaches 1/3 or 2/3,
switching between emptying and filling at those points.
If you want more technical details about the 555 chip, see my previous articles:
an early 555 chip,
a 555 timer similar to the rug,
and a more modern CMOS version of the 555.
Conclusions
The similarities between Navajo weavings and the patterns in integrated circuits have long been recognized.
Marilou Schultz's weavings of integrated circuits make these visual metaphors into concrete works of art.
This connection is not just metaphorical, however; in the 1960s, the semiconductor company Fairchild employed numerous Navajo workers to assemble chips in Shiprock, New Mexico.
I wrote about this complicated history in The Pentium as a Navajo Weaving.


This work is being shown at SITE Santa Fe's Once Within a Time exhibition (running until January 2026).
I haven't seen the exhibition in person, so let me know if you visit it.
