            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
					

	

The EV battery giant is unlocking more driving range and faster charging, but without the hefty price tag. CATL launched its new Shenxing Pro on Monday, the world’s first LFP battery with over 470 miles (558 km) WLTP driving range and ultra-fast charging in 10 minutes.



CATL launches world’s first LFP battery with more range



At the Munich Motor Show, the global leader in electric vehicle batteries made its presence known. CATL introduced its new Shenxing Pro, deeming it “the world’s first LFP battery to deliver a 758 km WLTP range.”



The extended driving range is only a piece of it, however. CATL’s new battery is safer and features a record-breaking 12-year, 1,000,000 km lifespan, all while promising to lower costs.



It’s also now the fastest-charging battery in Europe, with 12C peak charging speeds. In just 10 minutes, the new battery can add nearly 300 miles (478 km) WLTP range. 	
	



Even in frigid temperatures of –20°C (–4°F), CATL said its new battery can add over 250 miles (410 km) of driving range. When the battery is at a 20% state of charge (SOC), the Shenxing battery will deliver up to 830 kW, good for a 0 to 100 km/h sprint in just 2.5 secs.







	CATL’s new LFP battery is built to last. After driving 200,000 km (125,000 miles), it only loses about 9% of its capacity. Plus, it’s covered by a 10-year/ 240,000 km warranty.



The new Shenxing battery is the first to use CATL’s new NP 3.0 (No Propagation) technology, which offers “the world’s best-in-class safety performance.” Featuring its new Wave Cells tech, CATL claims it’s also the world’s first LFP battery that allows cooling systems from any direction.

“With uncompromised range, charging, and durability, Shenxing Pro is the ultimate solution for electric mobility in Europe,” Dr. Lingbo Zhu, CTO of CATL’s International Business Unit, said at the event.



The new battery is part of CATL’s aggressive push into Europe. It’s already partnered with over 200 carmakers globally and more than 1,000 European suppliers, but it’s looking to play a bigger role. From simply exporting batteries, CATL aims to build them “in Europe, for Europe” in the early days, and eventually “of Europe,” it said, in the near future.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[A former top cybersecurity executive at WhatsApp filed a lawsuit on Monday alleging that parent company Meta disregarded internal flaws in the app’s digital defenses and exposed billions of its users. He says the company systematically violated cybersecurity regulations and retaliated against him for reporting the failures.Attaullah Baig, who served as head of security for WhatsApp from 2021 to 2025, claims that approximately 1,500 engineers had unrestricted access to user data without proper oversight, potentially violating a US government order that imposed a $5bn penalty on the company in 2020.He also claimed the company failed to remedy the hacking and takeover of more than 100,000 accounts each day, ignoring his pleas and proposed fixes and choosing instead to prioritize user growth. The lawsuit, filed in US federal court in San Francisco, alleges Facebook-owner Meta failed to implement basic cybersecurity measures, including adequate data handling and breach detection capabilities.According to the 115-page complaint, Baig discovered through internal security testing that WhatsApp engineers could “move or steal user data” including contact information, IP addresses and profile photos “without detection or audit trail”.The filing claims Baig repeatedly raised concerns with senior executives, including the WhatsApp head, Will Cathcart, and Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. Meta acquired Whatsapp for $19bn in 2014. The app now boasts three billion users, according to Meta.WhatsApp’s vice president of communications Carl Woog wrote in a statement, “Sadly this is a familiar playbook in which a former employee is dismissed for poor performance and then goes public with distorted claims that misrepresent the ongoing hard work of our team.”Baig alleges he faced escalating retaliation after his initial reports in 2021, including negative performance reviews, verbal warnings and ultimately termination in February 2025 for apparent “poor performance”.The company emphasized that Baig left due to poor performance, with multiple senior engineers independently validating that his work was below expectations. Meta noted in a statement that the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration dismissed Baig’s initial complaint, finding that it had not retaliated against him.Before joining Meta, Baig worked in cybersecurity roles at PayPal, Capital One and other major financial institutions.He filed complaints with federal regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission before pursuing the current litigation.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThe case adds to ongoing scrutiny of Meta’s data protection practices across its platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, serving billions of users globally.Meta agreed to the 2020 government settlement following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which involved improper harvesting of data from 50 million Facebook users. The consent order remains in effect until 2040.In his whistleblower complaint, Baig is requesting reinstatement, back pay and compensatory damages, along with potential regulatory enforcement action against the company.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[



If you've heard of Chat Control already, bad news: it's back. If you haven't, this is a pressing issue you should urgently learn more about if you value privacy, democracy, and human rights. This is happening this week, and we must act to stop it right now.
Take a minute to visualize this: Every morning you wake up with a police officer entering your home to inspect it, and staying with you all day long.
The agent checks your bathroom, your medicine cabinet, your bedroom, your closets, your drawers, your fridge, and takes photos and notes to document everything. Then, this report is uploaded to the police's cloud. It's "for a good cause" you know, it's to make sure you aren't hiding any child sexual abuse material under your bed.
Every morning. Even if you're naked in bed. Even while you're having a call with your doctor or your lover. Even when you're on a date. Even while you're working and discussing your client's confidential information with their attorney. This police officer is there, listening to you and reporting on everything you do.
This is the in-person equivalent of Chat Control.
Act now!
This is happening this week. European governments will be finalizing their positions on the regulation proposal on Friday, September 12th, 2025.


If you are not located in Europe: Keep reading, this will affect you too.


If you are still unconvinced: Keep reading, we discuss Chat Control in more details below.


If you are located in Europe: You must act now to stop it.



How to stop this? Contact your MEPs before September 12th
Use this website to easily contact your government representatives before September 12th, and tell them they should oppose Chat Control. Even if your country already opposes Chat Control, contact your representatives to tell them you are relieved they oppose, and support them in this decision to protect human rights. This will help reinforce their position.
But if your country supports Chat Control, or is undecided, it is vital that you contact your representatives before this deadline. To support your point, you can share this article with them or one of the many great resources listed at the end.

What is Chat Control?
The push for Chat Control started in 2021 with the approval of a derogation to the ePrivacy Directive by the European Parliament. This derogation escalated to a second proposal for mandatory scanning a year later, which was rejected in 2023. Nevertheless, lawmakers and lobbyists determined to undermine our safety and civil liberties are bringing it back again two years later, literally trying to wear you down.
We cannot let authoritarians wear us down until we lose all our privacy rights. Our privacy rights are fundamental to so many other human rights, to civil liberties, to public safety, and to functioning democracies.
Chat Control undermines all of this.
Cryptography professor and cybersecurity expert Matthew Green described the 2022 proposal document for Chat Control as "the most terrifying thing I've ever seen".
And terrifying, it is.
The most recent proposal for Chat Control comes from the EU Council Danish presidency pushing for the regulation misleadingly called the Child Sexual Abuse Regulation (CSAR). Despite its seemingly caring name, this regulation will not help fight child abuse, and will even likely worsen it, impacting negatively what is already being done to fight child abuse (more on this in the next section).
The CSAR proposal (Chat Control) could be implemented as early as next month, if we do not stop it. Chat Control would make it mandatory for all service providers (text messaging, email, social media, cloud storage, hosting services, etc.) to scan all communications and all files (including end-to-end encrypted ones), in order to supposedly detect whatever the government deems "abusive material."
The problem is this: Chat Control will not work, it is unreliable, it will escalate in scope, and it will endanger everyone (including the children).
Even if you are not in Europe, know that Chat Control will affect everyone inside and outside of Europe one way or another. Regardless of where you are, you should be concerned and pay attention, and there are things you can do to fight back. This is important.


Why is this bad?
The idea that it's possible to somehow magically protect information properly while giving access to unquestionably well-intended law enforcement comes from either extreme naivety, lack of information, and plain dishonesty.
This proposal would effectively break any end-to-end encryption protections, and potentially expose all your files and communications to not only law enforcement, but eventually also to criminals of all sorts (with the data breaches, data leaks, and corruption that will inevitably follow).
Here's a summary of some dangers this regulation would create if approved:


Breaking end-to-end encryption: Removing crucial protections for all sensitive files and communications of vulnerable populations, victims, whistleblowers, journalists, activists, and everyone else.


Mission creep: Once this mass surveillance system is in place, authorities can decide to add more criteria such as searching all communications for references to drug use, protest attendances, political dissidence, or even negative comments about a leader. Europol (the EU law enforcement agency) has already called for expanding the program.






Criminal attacks: Each time a backdoor exists, it doesn't take long for criminals to find access and steal our information. This could include criminals finding access to each service independently or to the entire database authorities would keep. A database that would be filled with material tagged as sexually explicit text or photos of children. This could even create new Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) for criminals. For example, consenting teenagers innocently sexting together could have their photos collected in this database, after being wrongly flagged by the automated system. Then, criminals could steal their intimate photos from the governments.


False positives: With a mass surveillance system this large, moreover a system with no transparency and little oversight, false positives are inevitable. Despite marketing promises from the organizations lobbying government officials, we all know AI technologies regularly misfire and cannot be reliable for anything of such importance. Loving parents could get flagged as pedophiles just for innocently uploading a photo of their child in the bathtub on their private cloud. Teenagers exploring their sexuality consensually with each other could get tagged as sexual predators (a label that might stick on them decades later). The police could receive reports for breastfeeding mothers. The list is infinite.






Overwhelming resources: The inevitable false positives will completely overwhelm the agencies responsible for investigating flagged material. This will cost them precious time they will not have to investigate actual abuse cases. Organizations fighting child sexual abuse are already overwhelmed and lack resources to prosecute real criminals.


Hurting victims: Such system of mass surveillance could prevent victims of child sexual abuse (and other crimes) to reach out for help. Knowing that all their communications would be scanned, they would lose all confidentiality while reporting crimes. The evidences they share could even be tagged by Chat Control, as if they were the perpetrator rather than the victim. Sadly, many will likely decide it's safer not to report at all.


Self-censorship: With Chat Control in place, not only victims might censor themselves and stop reaching out for help, but everyone else as well. When people know they are being observed, they feel less free to be themselves and to share openly. This is doubly true for anyone who is part of a marginalized group, such as LGBTQ+ people, or anyone who is being victimized or at risk of victimization.






Undermining democracy: This surveillance system would allow governments to spy on opposition. Chat logs from opposing candidates, activists, and journalists could all be accessed by authorities in order to silence opponents or blackmail candidates. Even if you trust your government to not do this now, this doesn't mean it could not be used in this way by the next government. We have all seen how fast the political landscape can change.


Violating the GDPR (and other laws): The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) offers wonderful protections to Europeans. Sadly, Chat Control would make a complete farce of it. The Right to Erasure (right to delete) could be reduced to ashes by Chat Control, including for any highly sensitive information wrongly caught in the CSAR net. Moreover, it would violate Article 7 and Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.


Protecting the children is only the excuse used in hope of convincing a misinformed public. Chat Control is authoritarian mass surveillance.
Authorities understand well how important protecting communication and information is. This is why they included an exemption to protect their own communications, but not yours.
Would this protect the children?
No.
This cannot be stressed enough: This regulation would not protect the children, it would harm the children, and everyone else too, worldwide. Claiming otherwise is either naivety, or misinformation.
Last year, the civil and human rights association European Digital Rights (EDRi) put together a joint statement from 48 organizations for children's protection, digital rights, and human rights, demanding that the European Parliament invest instead in proven strategies to fight child abuse. This appeal to reason does not seem to have been heard by most EU Member States.
There are many things we can do as a society to increase protections for children and fight abusers and criminals, but Chat Control is far from it all. Protection of the children is clearly only an excuse here, and a very misleading one.


Mislabelling children as criminals
First, this automated system is flawed in many ways, and the false-positive rate would likely be high. But let's imagine that, magically, the system could flag CSAM at an accuracy rate of 99%. This still means 1% of reports would be false. Expanded to the size of Europe Union's population of approximately 450 million people, exchanging likely billions of messages and files every day, this still means millions could be falsely tagged as sexual predators, with all the consequences this implies.
Worse, the Swiss federal police reported that currently about 80% of all automated reports received were false-positives. This means in reality, the error rate is likely far higher than 1%, and actually closer to an 80% error rate. Of the approximate 20% of positive reports, in Germany, over 40% of investigations initiated targeted children themselves.
Sometimes, flagged content is simply teenagers innocently sexting each other consensually. Not only would they be wrongly tagged as criminals under Chat Control, but they'd be triggering an investigation that would expose their intimate photos to others.
Even in a magical world where Chat Control AI is 99% accurate, it would still wrongly tag and expose sensitive data from millions of children. In reality, no AI system is even remotely close to this accuracy level, and proprietary algorithms are usually opaque black boxes impossible to audit transparently. The number of children Chat Control would harm, and likely traumatize for life, would be disastrous.
Exposing children's sensitive and sexual information
Any content that could be deemed suspicious or explicit by the system, accurately or not, would be flagged and reported.
When this content is reported, it will likely be uploaded to a database for human review. This means that if a teenager was sending an intimate photo of themselves to another consenting teenager, they could be flagged as sharing CSAM, even if it's their own photo. Then, their photo would be sent to the police for review. Information that should very much have stayed protected and private between these two teenagers is now exposed to strangers. This is wrong, and dangerous.
Even innocuous communications such as daily conversations, teenagers chatting with each other, parents reporting information about their child to a doctor, and therapists talking with their patients, could all inadvertently expose children sensitive information. This is information that should have remained private, and would now be uploaded to a police database, likely stored there forever with few recourses to remove it.
The more we collect sensitive information about children (photos, faces, locations, identifications, medical information, private chats, experiences, etc.), the more we risk exposing children to harm. This includes systems used by authorities and governments. Even if everyone with legitimate access to this data is miraculously 100% exemplary and incorruptible citizens, the databases and scanning systems will still be vulnerable to attacks from criminals and hostile governments alike.
The only way to protect children's information properly is to 1) not collect it, and 2) use end-to-end encryption to protect it when we cannot avoid collecting it. Spying on everyone and every child is the opposite of that.
Authorities' databases will be attacked
It's impossible to perfectly secure information online. There is a lot we can do to improve security (much more than is done now), but data breaches will happen.
If governments mandate a backdoor to have access to all our online communication and stored files, it's inevitable that at least some criminals will eventually get access to it as well. This is even truer if this system is closed-source, privatized, and isn't subjected to frequent independent audits with strong accountability.
Once a vulnerability is found by criminals, they will have the same access as authorities have to our data. With Chat Control, this means pretty much all our data.
In addition, Chat Control could facilitate the proliferation of even more spyware and stalkerware on the market, thriving on the vulnerabilities found in the powerful system. This would allow anyone to purchase access to spy on anyone, including databases of identified children. It could give a direct backdoor-access to pedophiles. How could this be helping to protect the children?
The danger is inside
Even if the idea of online strangers accessing children's sensitive data is terrifying, the worse danger in often much closer.
Sadly, we already know that the vast majority of child sexual abuse is perpetrated by adults close to the child, not strangers, and that two-thirds of CSAM images appear to have been produced at home. Chat Control would do nothing to fight this. In fact, it could facilitate it.
Child abuse is an incredibly important topic to discuss and to fight against as a society. Utilizing this issue as an excuse to pass a surveillance law that would endanger everyone, including the victims, is despicable.
When children are living with the abuser, the only escape is outside the home, and sometimes this means online. Abusers often use spying technologies to control and restrict access to help for their victims. If we make mass surveillance mandatory and normalized, this risks aggravating the stalkerware problem by obligating providers to implement backdoors in their systems. We would effectively be helping abusers at home to restrict access to help for their victims, including victims of CSAM. This is completely unacceptable.
How to actually help the children
Despite the politicization of this issue to manipulate the public opinion in accepting mass surveillance, there are actually proven solutions to help to protect the children, online and offline.
First, governments should listen to organizations already doing the work. Most are understaffed and under-resourced to properly support the victims and prosecute the criminals. Thousands of more reports every day would not help them do any effective work. More capacity to conduct targeted investigation and arrest criminals, and more capacity to create safe spaces to support the victims and witnesses will help.
Privacy should be the default, for everyone.
If all our services were using end-to-end encryption when possible, and implemented proper security and privacy features and practices, this would effectively help to protect the children as well. Abusers and criminals are looking for leaked and stolen data all the time. When a cloud photo storage gets hacked, your photos are up for grabs online, including the photos of your children. When parents upload photos of their children and their address online, and this data gets exposed (leaked, breached, AI-scraped, etc.), this data then becomes accessible to criminals.
Better privacy protections also means better protections for the children.
Children themselves should receive better education on how their data is used online and how to protect it. Additionally, it is vital to provide better education on what behaviors aren't normal coming from an adult, and how to reach out for help when it happens. Children should have access to safe and confidential resources to report abuse, whether it's happening outside or inside their home.
Parents should be careful when sharing information about their children. And when they have to, they should benefit from complete confidentiality, knowing their communication is fully end-to-end encrypted and not shared with anyone else.
There is so much we can do to help to protect better the children online, surveillance is the opposite of it all.
How would this affect me?
If this regulation is approved on October 14th, 2025 (the date for the final vote), the consequences would be devastating for everyone, even outside the European Union.
We have seen how platforms implemented better privacy practices and features after the GDPR became effective in 2018, features that often benefited people worldwide. This could have the same effect in reverse.
Every platform potentially handling data of people located in the EU would be subjected to the law. Platforms would be obligated to scan all communications and all files of (at least) data subjects located in the EU, even data currently protected with end-to-end encryption. This would affect popular apps and services like Signal, Tuta, Proton, WhatsApp, Telegram, and much more.
Outside of Europe
This would not only affect Europeans' data, but also the data of anyone outside communicating with someone located in the European Union. Because end-to-end encryption can only work if both ends are protected.
If Chat Control gets approved and applied, it will become very difficult to communicate with anyone located in the EU while keeping strong protections for your data. Many people might just accept the surveillance passively, and as a result lose their rights, their protections, and compromise their democratic processes. Overtime, this will likely lead to a slippery slope towards dystopian authoritarianism.
Outside of Europe, you could expect to see services removing some privacy-protective features, downgrading encryption, blocking European countries that are subjected to the law, or moving outside of Europe entirely. If localization-based scanning is too complicated to handle for an application, some companies might just decide it's simpler to scan communications for all users, worldwide.
Additionally, Five Eyes countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States) have already expressed support for Chat Control, and might be keen to try the same at home, if this gets approved and tested in Europe first.
Inside of Europe
Without using tools that would be now deemed illegal, you would lose any protections currently granted by end-to-end encryption. It would become impossible for you to send an email, a text message, or a photo without being observed by your government, and potentially also by criminals and foreign governments, following the inevitable data breaches.
You would have to constantly self-censor to avoid triggering the system and getting reported to the authorities. At first, you would probably just have to stop sending nudes, sexting, or sending photos of naked children in the bathtub or playing at the beach. Then, this would escalate to never mentioning drug or anything that could sound like drug, even as a joke. Later, you might have to stop texting about going to a protest, and stop organizing protests online. Further down the line, you might even have to self-censor to make sure you are not saying anything negative about a leader, or a foreign politician even. This isn't that hypothetical, this sort of oppressive surveillance already exists in some countries.
Many services you currently rely on right now would simply shut down, or move away from Europe entirely. Businesses might also move outside of Europe if they worry about protecting their proprietary information. This could cause massive layoffs, while organizations move to jurisdictions where they are allowed to keep their data protected and unobserved.
Finally, even if this doesn't affect you personally, or you don't believe it will, this isn't just about you.
The data of vulnerable people would be exposed and their safety put at risk. Victims might decide to stop reaching out for help or reporting crimes. Sources requiring anonymity might decide the risk isn't worth reporting valuable information to journalists. Opponents of governments in power could be silenced. Every democracy in the European Union would suffer greatly from it.
Chat Control is completely antithetical to the values the European Union has been presenting to the world in recent years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[I used Apple Configurator to turn my iPhone into a dumb phone. I can only access the apps and websites I want to use, and it’s feeling great!
Compared to when I started I’m saving about 2 hours of screen time a day. If I kept this up for a month I promised to write a post about this setup. It’s now two months so here’s my post. What follows is a backstory, observations, and a how-to-guide.
To get straight to the how-to-guide, click here.
Motivation
It’s common to rack up 4 hours or more of screen time a day on your phone. Here’s one way to see the cost of that: every 20 years, you lose 5 years of your waking time looking at your phone.
This is what had me dreaming about the 2000s and old Nokia phones. But I couldn’t just go back to Nokia. My iPhone gave me Google Maps, Spotify, Uber and Waymo, Kindle and Audible, ChatGPT and Claude, Whatsapp, Wallet.
There’s real utility to iPhones. If only access to utilities didn’t mean I’d also have access to social media.
I often regretted my time on Twitter and Instagram. It would interrupt my flow states at work and detract from quality time with the people I loved. Even alone time suffered: instead of solitude I found myself checking for notifications. [1]
Failed Attempts
I tried and failed to fix this problem three times. Let me enumerate:
I tried self-control but I found myself outmatched. On the surface the solution feels simple: why not just stop using distracting apps? For me using self-control here was like a hunter-gatherer using a club in open battle with a nuclear society. Social media companies spent centuries of human effort figuring out ways to get me to check my phone. If I wanted to win, I would need to use guerrilla methods.
I tried Screen Time but it was too easy to ignore. Apple comes with Screen Time. You can set limits, but I found them useless. Once a limit runs out all you need to unlock your distracting app is to press a button. Do this a few times and you no longer notice the button.
I tried switching phones, but couldn’t let go of the long-tail of iPhone apps. There are lots of interesting dumb phones out there. There’s some with e-ink screens that are really cool. But they only have a few apps. There was always some app that I missed. Even with recent Android-based dumbphones, there were still apps that were only available on the iPhone (I am looking at you Things 3).
If only I could keep my iPhone, but choose just the apps and the websites that I wanted.
Apple Configurator to the rescue
That’s where I discovered Apple Configurator. Apple Configurator lets organizations deploy specific restrictions onto iPhones. This is what lets Apple Stores restrict the iPhones on display, so you can’t change their wallpaper to something humorous.
Configurator is meant for businesses, but nothing stops us from using it personally. And it’s free too!
The Pros of Apple Configurator
I found three advantages to using Configurator.
The first is that there is real friction to making changes. In order to adjust restrictions, you have to physically connect your iPhone to your laptop and open up a kludgy piece of software. This is cumbersome enough that if you have enough willpower to go through with it, you’ll be level-headed enough to not want too. [2]
The second is that you can actually disable the App Store! This is a marvelous win. Having an App Store in your home screen is like being dieter with a pastry shop in your kitchen. It’s not a good idea. So no more App Store. And combine that with content filters for websites, and you can really lock down your phone. When you are at your weakest, there’s effectively no way to hack around the restrictions.
And the final win, it’s still an iPhone. This means you can make a dumbphone that fits your needs exactly. There are some apps that sound distracting on the surface, that I just needed plain and simple. For example, my startup uses Discord to talk to users; I want to have it. I want the GitHub app. I want Things3 and Waymo. I want to access specific websites. I can set it all up so my phone is exactly the utility I need it to be.
The Cons of Apple Configurator
If you’re getting excited, let me prepare you with two cons.
The first is that you have to factory reset your iPhone. You can only set up Apple Configurator with a completely reset phone. This means the initial setup is annoying and will take you a few hours. But perhaps this a good thing too. If you go through this trouble, you’ll be even more motivated to stick with your choices.
The second is that getting the right setup takes a few weeks, and you may need to rely on others. When you start out you may forget an app or two (or a lot more). For example, I went to my gym the day after I set my restrictions, only to remember that they have a special iPhone to check in. You’ll have lots of little frictions like this. As you do, you’ll improve your configuration so this happens less. It’ll get better but there will still be a long-tail. Maybe you’re at a restaurant and they need you to open a website for example. You may end up having to bug some people around you for their phone. It can be annoying but I haven’t found this to be too troublesome.
Observations so far
So, it’s 2 months in. Here’s my experience so far:
The Good
It feels great. My phone feels like a utility. I think this is the same kind of change in feeling I would have had if I shifted from eating junk food to healthy food. My phone used to have this gravity: like invariably my attention would shift towards it. Now it just feels like a very useful rock.
I found ChatGPT and Claude critically useful. Whenever I need some information, I can just ask my LLM, and it can give me a distraction free summary. It helps the long-tail of weird situations too: for example if someone asks me to take a look at a website, I can ask my LLM to scrape it and summarize the details for me. It’s pretty hard to get distracted this way.
And in the the last 2 months I have not felt the desire to remove the restrictions. This wasn’t the case with any previous setup I tried. I think it’s because the friction feels just right. I feel like I can control exactly how my phone should work; there’s just a day or two delay. The delay keeps me level-headed.
The remaining issues
So far the only real unsolved issue I have are related to “semi-important” apps. Consider email. I still need to have access to email, and I want to have notifications enabled so I don’t miss something truly important. But 90% of the emails I get aren’t important.
I am not sure what the solution is to these kind of apps. Maybe I can find a special mail app, that only shows you important emails. If I had something like this I think I would just be over the moon with this setup. [3]
The Overall
I used to spend about 4 hours a day on my phone. I’m now down to about 2 hours a day. Looking at the stats, it’s 1 hour of reasonably productive apps, mixed with communication apps (my family lives in a different country, so I make long calls). Overall I don’t regret this time.

The How-To Guide
If you want to do this yourself, it’s going to take a 2-hour initial commitment, and about 2 weeks of tweaks to get everything set up just right.
In the first 2 hours, you will factory reset your phone, and set up Apple Configurator. As those two weeks progress, you’ll tweak your restrictions so you have just the apps and the websites you actually need.
Okay, let’s get into those first 2 hours!
1. Factory reset your iPhone
Time to reset your iPhone. Go to Settings → General → Transfer or Reset iPhone → Erase all content and settings.

This is the first, and the scariest step. Do it, and you are on the journey 🫡
2. Install Apple Configurator
Now head on over to the Apple and install Apple Configurator. Open the app and click ‘Get Started’

3. ‘Prepare’ your iPhone
We can then prepare your device for configurator. Connect your iPhone to your laptop. You should see it show up in Configurator. Once you do, Right click and click “Prepare”:

Select “Manual Configuration”, with “Supervise devices” like so:

You can skip “Sign in to Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager”. Just press Next.

Now enter an “Organization”. Since this is just for yourself, you are an organization of one : ). I use my name:

In “Configure iOS Setup Assistant”, select “Don’t show any of these steps”

Click “Prepare”

Aand you’re ready to go!

Your phone is now ready for Configurator.
4. Set up your iPhone
Before we start adding restrictions, let’s set your phone up. Go through Apple’s setup, and make sure you do not restore your iPhone from an iCloud backup. This will undo the supervision stuff we just did.
Once you set things up, go ahead and install all the apps that you’ll need. As a way to jog your memory, here are the apps that I ended up installing:
## Reading/Learning

- Audible
- Kindle

## Convenience

- Doordash
- Uber
- Lyft
- Waymo
- Turo

## Health

- (Your Gym App)
- Whoop

## Auth

- LastPass
- Authenticator

## Communication

- Messenger
- WhatsApp
- Signal
- Slack
- Discord

## AI

- ChatGPT
- Claude

## Google

- Gmail
- Google Calendar
- Google Maps
- Google Photos

## Dev

- Expo Go
- GitHub
- TestFlight

## Home

- Ring

## Music

- Spotify

## Producitvity

- Things5. Create your ‘Profile’
Now it’s time to set up your restrictions! You’ll create a new Configurator ‘Profile’.
Click ‘File’ → ‘New Profile’.
You’ll make three changes
General
Under ‘General’: For ‘Security’ and ‘Automatically Remove Profile’, set ‘Never’:

Content Filter
Head on over to ‘Content Filter’, and click ‘Configure’. For ‘Filter Type’, select “Specific Websites only”:

Enter some of the sites you want to use. To jog your memory, here are some sites I added:
## Google Auth

- https://accounts.google.com

## Docs

- https://dropbox.com

## Modern databases with real-time sync

- https://instantdb.comRestrictions
‘Restrictions’ are where we will disable the App Store. Click on ‘Restrictions’ → ‘Configure’.
Keep everything as it is, just uncheck ‘Allow Installing Apps’

With that, save your profile. Once we install this profile on your phone…you’re done.
6. Add your profile!
So let’s install this profile to your iPhone.
Right click your phone on Configurator, hit ‘Add’ → ‘Profiles’, pick your profile, and you’re ready to go!

When you load your phone, you should no longer see an App Store!
An on/off switch
After a while you may realize you need to install some new apps. When you want to do that, connect your phone, ‘Right click’ → ‘Remove’ → ‘Profile’

Once you remove your profile, you’re back to a restrictionless world. Make all the changes you need, and then add it back.
Fin
And with that, you have an iPhone dumbphone! I hope it’s as useful for you as it has been for me.
If you follow the instructions and have any issues or changes to make, please send me an email.

Thanks to Ilia Parunashvili for trying the original instructions I wrote out and providing screenshots.
Thanks to Alex Kotliarskyi, Alex Reichert, Daniel Woelfel, Jacky Wang, Nicole Garcia Fischer, for reviewing drafts of this essay.
[1] Let the record show I don’t think these apps are useless. I made friends on Twitter, heck I worked at Facebook for 4 years. I just think these are tools better used in moderation. But it’s hard to use them in moderation on your phone.
[2] And if you already have your laptop handy, there’s an easier fix for your distraction: just use your laptop to check Twitter.
[3] My friend Alex Kotliarskyi mentioned I could try using Google’s App Script to talk to an LLM and filter emails. This could be cool!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In the past, if you broke or lost your phone, your Signal message history was gone. This has been a challenge for people whose most important conversations happen on Signal. Think family photos, sweet messages, important documents, or anything else you don’t want to lose forever. This explains why the most common feature request has been backups; a way for people to get Signal messages back even if their phone is lost or damaged.After careful design and development, we are now starting to roll out secure backups, an opt-in feature. This first phase is available in the latest beta release for Android. This will let us further test this feature in a limited setting, before it rolls out to iOS and Desktop in the near future.Here, we’ll outline the basics of secure backups and provide a high-level overview about how they work and how we built a system that allows you to recover your Signal conversations while maintaining the highest bar for privacy and security.Secure Backups 101Secure backups let you save an archive of your Signal conversations in a privacy-preserving form, refreshed every day; giving you the ability to restore your chats even if you lose access to your phone. Signal’s secure backups are opt-in and, of course, end-to-end encrypted. So if you don’t want to create a secure backup archive of your Signal messages and media, you never have to use the feature.1If you do decide to opt in to secure backups, you’ll be able to securely back up all of your text messages2 and the last 45 days’ worth of media3 for free.If you want to back up your media history beyond 45 days4, as well as your message history, we also offer a paid subscription plan for US$1.99 per month.5This is the first time we’ve offered a paid feature. The reason we’re doing this is simple: media requires a lot of storage, and storing and transferring large amounts of data is expensive. As a nonprofit that refuses to collect or sell your data, Signal needs to cover those costs differently than other tech organizations that offer similar products but support themselves by selling ads and monetizing data.Anatomy of Secure Backups: Privacy First, AlwaysAt Signal, our commitment to privacy informs which features we build and the ways that we build them.Using the same zero-knowledge technology that enables Signal groups to work without revealing intimate metadata, backup archives are stored without a direct link to a specific backup payment or Signal user account.At the core of secure backups is a 64-character recovery key that is generated on your device. This key is yours and yours alone; it is never shared with Signal’s servers.6 Your recovery key is the only way to “unlock” your backup when you need to restore access to your messages. Losing it means losing access to your backup permanently, and Signal cannot help you recover it. You can generate a new key if you choose. We recommend storing this key securely (writing it down in a notebook or a secure password manager, for example).These choices are part and parcel of Signal’s guiding mission to collect as close to no data as possible, and to make sure that any information that is required to make Signal robust and usable cannot be tied back to the people who depend on Signal.7 This is why wherever there’s a choice between security and any other objective, we’ve prioritized security.8Enabling Secure BackupsIf you want to opt in to secure backups, you can do so from your Signal Settings menu. For now, only people running the latest beta version of Signal on Android will be able to opt in. But soon, we’ll be rolling this feature out across all platforms.Once you’ve enabled secure backups, your device will automatically create a fresh secure backup archive every day, replacing the previous day’s archive.9 Only you can decrypt your backup archive, which will allow you to restore your message database (excluding view-once messages and messages scheduled to disappear within the next 24 hours). Because your secure backup archive is refreshed daily, anything you deleted in the past 24 hours, or any messages set to disappear are removed from the latest daily secure backup archive, as you intended.Backing up, moving forwardWe’re excited to introduce secure backups, making sure you can retain access to your Signal messages even when your phone is lost or destroyed. But secure backups aren’t the end of the road.The technology that underpins this initial version of secure backups will also serve as the foundation for more secure backup options in the near future. Our future plans include letting you save a secure backup archive to the location of your choosing, alongside features that let you transfer your encrypted message history between Android, iOS, and Desktop devices.Secure backups are available in today’s Android beta release. A full public release, along with iOS and Desktop support, is coming soon.Someone you’re chatting with could choose to back up your conversation even if you haven’t activated the feature. These chats will continue to be protected in ways that we explain in this post, ensuring that your Signal conversations are only accessible to you and the people you are communicating with. ↩The free tier includes 100 MiB of message storage. Messages are compressed and stored in a secure backup archive, and we think 100 MiB will be large enough for even heavy Signal users to back up the text of all of their messages. ↩Media comprises things like photos, videos, GIFs, files, and any attachments. ↩The storage size limit for paid backups is 100 GB. ↩Please note that prices are subject to change in the future. ↩This key is different from your Signal PIN, which serves different purposes. ↩Another example: We have also taken extra steps to protect media by encrypting the already-encrypted files a second time with a key unique to your backup and adding padding to obscure their true size. This prevents malicious actors from comparing encrypted files to identify users who are in the same groups, in the unlikely instance that they gain access to the backup files. ↩For instance, a catastrophic failure could render the most recent daily backup archive unrecoverable until the next backup cycle completes (which should occur within one day). While we believe such data loss is highly unlikely, this approach ensures that your message history remains protected against even the most sophisticated threats while smoothly recovering within 24 hours. ↩Our open-source storage management software is available at https://github.com/signalapp/storage-manager. ↩]]></content:encoded>

        So Long
        
        Hi everyone,
        
        I'm the founder and original developer of Nova Launcher. I've been the only one working on Nova for the past year. I needed to let you know that I have left Branch and am no longer involved with Nova Launcher.
        
        For the past several months I have been preparing the Open Source release of Nova Launcher. This work included cleaning up the codebase, reviewing licenses, removing or replacing proprietary code, and coordinating with legal to ensure a proper release. When Branch acquired Nova in 2022, Branch then-CEO and founder Alex Austin made several public commitments to the community about Nova's future, including statements about open sourcing:

        
            "Thanks for the suggestion! I'll bring it up with Kevin but ultimately [releasing the source code] is his call."
            
        



        
            "If Kevin were to ever leave, it's contracted that the code will be open sourced and put in the hands of the community."
            
        

        However I was ultimately asked to stop working on Nova Launcher and the open sourcing effort.
        
        Nova Launcher has been an incredible project and has an incredible community. I'm grateful for the years of support, feedback, and enthusiasm.
        
        Kevin Barry

    Working Paper 34215
    
  

        
    DOI 10.3386/w34215
    
  

        
    Issue Date September 2025

    
  

          
    
How does being over- or underqualified at the beginning of a worker's career affect skill acquisition, retention, and promotion? Despite the importance of mismatch for the labor market, self-selection into jobs has made estimating these effects difficult. We overcome endogeneity concerns in the context of the US Air Force, which allocates new enlistees to over 130 different jobs based, in part, on test scores. Using these test scores, we create simulated job assignments based on factors outside of an individual's control: the available slots in upcoming training programs and the quality of other recruits entering at the same time. These factors create quasi-random variation in job assignment and hence how cognitively demanding an individual's job is relative to their own ability. We find that being overqualified for a job causes higher attrition, both during technical training and afterward when individuals are working in their assigned jobs. It also results in more behavioral problems, worse performance evaluations, and lower scores on general knowledge tests about the military taken by all workers. On the other hand, overqualification results in better performance relative to others in the same job: job-specific test scores rise both during technical training and while on the job, and these individuals are more likely to be promoted. Combined, these patterns suggest that overqualified individuals are less motivated, but still outperform others in their same job. Underqualification results in a polar opposite set of findings, suggesting these individuals are motivated to put forth more effort, but still struggle to compete when judged relative to others. Consistent with differential incentives, individuals who are overqualified are in jobs which are less valuable in terms of outside earnings potential, while the reverse is true for those who are underqualified.

The packages were updated to contain a piece of code that would be executed on the client of a website, which silently intercepts crypto and web3 activity in the browser, manipulates wallet interactions, and rewrites payment destinations so that funds and approvals are redirected to attacker-controlled accounts without any obvious signs to the user.To avoid being compromised by packages like this, check out Aikido safe-chain!What happened?The above packages all started having new versions released, an example here being is-arrayish:We can see that the index.js file is modified, and contains obfuscated code:‍After applying a bit of deobfuscation to it, we get a fairly complex piece of code still:var neth = 0;

}‍This malware is essentially a browser-based interceptor that hijacks both network traffic and application APIs. It injects itself into functions like fetch, XMLHttpRequest, and common wallet interfaces, then silently rewrites values in requests and responses. That means any sensitive identifiers, such as payment destinations or approval targets, can be swapped out for attacker, controlled ones before the user even sees or signs them. To make the changes harder to notice, it uses string-matching logic that replaces targets with look-alike values.What makes it dangerous is that it operates at multiple layers: altering content shown on websites, tampering with API calls, and manipulating what users’ apps believe they are signing. Even if the interface looks correct, the underlying transaction can be redirected in the background. 🛠 How the Malware Works (Step by Step)Injects itself into the browserHooks core functions like fetch, XMLHttpRequest, and wallet APIs (window.ethereum, Solana, etc.).Ensures it can intercept both web traffic and wallet activity.Watches for sensitive dataScans network responses and transaction payloads for anything that looks like a wallet address or transfer.Recognizes multiple formats across Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Tron, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.Rewrites the targetsReplaces the legitimate destination with an attacker-controlled address.Uses “lookalike” addresses (via string-matching) to make swaps less obvious.Hijacks transactions before they’re signedAlters Ethereum and Solana transaction parameters (e.g., recipients, approvals, allowances).Even if the UI looks correct, the signed transaction routes funds to the attacker.Stays stealthyIf a crypto wallet is detected, it avoids obvious swaps in the UI to reduce suspicion.Keeps silent hooks running in the background to capture and alter real transactions.‍The phishing emailThe maintainer shared that he was compromised by the use of phishing, using this email coming from support [at] npmjs [dot] help :The domain was registered just three days ago on September 5th, 2025:‍Maintainer responseAfter Aikido notified the maintainer on Bluesky, he replied at 15:15 UTC that he was aware of being compromised, and starting to clean up the compromised packages.‍The author also shared that the phishing email was sent from support [at] npmjs [dot] help .The author appears to have deleted most of the compromised package before losing access to his account.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[September 08, 2025 · 9 minutes to read
So, this blog post will be about LLMs, and everyone has opinions about that. To be upfront about it, I’m a skeptic (bordering on hater), yet I like experimenting with stuff so I download and run them locally on my Mac. And I’ll teach you how to do it too, if you’d like!

      
    
  
  
    
Some call them fancy autocomplete, some argue that they are sentient and should have rights. The truth is somewhere in between. Yes, they perform next word prediction, but it’s so complex that there’s nontrivial emergent behavior. No, they don’t have creativity or a mind. I believe one day we can create sentient machines, but not in this current iteration, maybe not before we go extinct.
Now that we’re out of the science fiction territory, let’s talk about their strengths. Laurie has a great post about it, which I highly recommend, but in summary they are generally good at summarizing text, regurgitating home maintenance advice from reddit, or telling you that you have cancer.
I also use them for brain-dumping. I find it hard to keep a journal, because I find it boring, but when you’re pretending to be writing to someone, it’s easier. If you have friends, that’s much better, but some topics are too personal and a friend may not be available at 4 AM.
I mostly ignore its responses, because it’s for me to unload, not to listen to a machine spew slop. I suggest you do the same, because we’re anthropomorphization machines and I’d rather not experience AI psychosis. It’s better if you don’t give it a chance to convince you it’s real. I could use a system prompt so it doesn’t follow up with dumb questions (or “YoU’Re AbSoLuTeLy CoRrEcT”s), but I never bothered as I already don’t read it.
Lastly, I’m interested in them because it’s tech and I like tech. I don’t believe they make you that much productive, and I never let them write for me. When I ask it something, I always fact-check, they are known to hallucinate (or bullshit, if you prefer) and I’ve experienced this too many times to trust it. Most importantly, just avoid asking questions that can’t be easily verified, there’s enough fake news around anyway.
You may be asking, “Well I can do everything you said with ChatGPT free tier, why bother running them locally?” There are a few reasons, and I’ve already mentioned them briefly:


I like experimenting with things. It’s marvelous that you can download this 12 GB file and your computer talks to you marginally better than ELIZA! Joking aside, we accepted the concept of LLMs too quickly, when the truth is that we never expected computers to figure out human speech before robots were walking among us. So it feels a bit magical when my computer has better grammar than I do, and I can summon one whenever I want without a supercomputer.


People have secrets and some secrets shouldn’t leave your computer. Companies are not well equipped to keep your sensitive data, and current trends show that they can retain your data or use it for training. I feel like a local LLM is a better choice for these use cases.


I don’t feel comfortable giving money to the AI companies. Every single one of them has done some kind of unethical thing, and the way the AI race is going, a hypothetical ethical one will be left behind. They intentionally hype AI, destroy the environment, and plagiarize people’s hard work. I’m thankful for the open-weight models they provide and will keep using them, luckily they can’t take that away from me.


If you still want to run an LLM on your macOS1, let’s get started. There are two options that I recommend, one is open-source and the other is easier to use, as all things are. I only cover macOS because that’s what I have; if that’s not your platform, you can still follow this guide with platform-specific tweaks, or find another guide.
Llama.cpp
It’s created by Georgi Gerganov and works really well with a ton of configuration options. It supports a lot of platforms, can download models, and has a basic web UI for convenience. You can install it with Nix using the following command: nix profile install nixpkgs#llama-cpp. For other installation methods, check their instructions.
To download and run a small and good enough model for experimentation, I recommend Gemma 3 4B QAT, which you can do with the following command:
$ llama-server -hf ggml-org/gemma-3-4b-it-qat-GGUF
If you open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080, you’ll see a very bare bones web UI that’s eerily similar to ChatGPT, but that should be enough. You can experiment with it and exit the server once you’re done.
LM Studio
This is the closed-source but easier to use one. It has a superb UI that lets you browse models, manage downloads, organize chats, and even tells you if a model can run on your machine. It has guardrails so you don’t crash your system by loading a model that’s too large. I like using it a lot, but enshittification is always a risk with closed-source for-profit software.
You can download a DMG from its website and install it as usual. LM Studio has two runtimes on macOS, llama.cpp which we covered earlier, and MLX, which is an ML engine developed by Apple and runs a bit faster, but offers less configuration in the UI. (I didn’t try running MLX directly, maybe it’s configurable but not exposed.)
I will not provide a walkthrough because this is not a product tour and the UI is pretty user-friendly anyway. I can give you some tips and tricks though.

You can switch the model mid-conversation, it won’t have any problem
You can branch off the current conversation, which is good for experimentation
You can regenerate the assistant message, like ChatGPT
You can edit your own messages, also like ChatGPT, but you can also edit assistant messages, which allows you to put words into its mouth
You can create presets for system prompts and reuse them for different personas
There are a lot of model settings you can configure; for example, you can customize the context overflow behavior when the context grows larger than the context window (the default is to truncate the middle, so first and last messages are kept, which is a good default)

How to choose a good LLM for your use case
Right now there are a lot of open-weight models around, almost all AI companies have released one. There are a few things you need to pay attention to when choosing a model. These things take a lot of disk space so be mindful of filling your disk!
Model size
You may have plenty of free space on your drive, but for the LLM to work you need to load it into memory. So your RAM is the bottleneck. Since the operating system also needs memory to work, if you have 16 GB RAM, like me, then models should be less than 12 GB. Loading larger models may cause you to run out of memory, your system will be unresponsive, and you’ll have to perform a hard reboot. Larger models will also run slower.2
Runtime
If you’re using llama.cpp directly, or as the runtime in LM Studio, you need GGUF models. If you’re using the MLX runtime in LM Studio, you need MLX models. As mentioned before, MLX models run slightly faster, but GGUF models provide more configuration, and since they can run on many platforms they are ubiquitous and better tested.
Quantization
Most LLMs are trained at 16-bit precision, but you can downcast (or quantize) the weights to lower precision and they still perform well up to some point. The sweet point is around 4 bits, which is noted as Q4. LM Studio defaults to this.
Quantization is a rabbit hole; different kernels are used for quantization, which is included in the notation, such as Q4_K_M, which is a bit too much for me and I decided against learning it. Just download the default and be done with it.
Vision models
Some models can tokenize image inputs and can “see” what’s inside them. This feels pretty magical; they can read text, recognize objects, and determine the mood or art style. You can use them as basic OCRs but in my experience dedicated OCRs perform better at serious tasks, LLMs tend to make shit up when they can’t read.
Reasoning
Some models can “think” before generating an answer, which is sometimes called “inference time scaling”3. The general wisdom is that smaller reasoning models can compete with larger non-reasoning models, which is reflected in benchmarks. The downside is that it takes longer to get an answer. So you need to decide if you want a larger but smarter model, or a smaller one that reasons. Keep in mind that reasoning sometimes takes minutes, and fills up the context pretty quickly.
Tool use
Some models are taught to emit special tokens that can call tools specified in the system prompt with the correct arguments. LM Studio has a UI for adding MCP servers and managing the capabilities provided by them.
By default, LM Studio asks you to confirm each tool call request, which is great for security. Tool calls are commonly used for data exfiltration attacks, which is as bad as it sounds.
LM Studio by default comes with a JavaScript MCP, powered by Deno, which provides the LLM the ability to execute code in a sandbox. This is really powerful, you can make it perform hard calculations, analyze data, even generate random numbers. I created a number guessing game, which works better than expected.
You can also plug in a web search MCP to give it up-to-date knowledge retrieval capabilities. Since small models have limited world knowledge, this makes them work remarkably well for applicable use cases. I have used Exa’s free tier for this, which worked well.
Lastly, if you want a model to have long-term memory, there are a ton of MCPs that can do that. But keeping with the theme of keeping things local, I found MCP server for Obsidian to be a good candidate.
One thing to keep in mind regarding MCPs is that since they have to teach the model about themselves, they pollute the context pretty quickly, so be sure to only enable those you need.
Aside: Agents
“Agents are models using tools in a loop.” So a model that has both reasoning and tool use capabilities hits a sweet spot, and is commonly called an “agent”. These can call tools repeatedly while reasoning, and provide a complete answer. The truth is far from perfect, in my experience, but it’s still a cool concept.
Finding a good model
LM Studio has a built-in UI for finding models, which shows runtime, quantization, model capabilities, and size in a user-friendly way. For llama.cpp, you can check Hugging Face for GGUF models.
You may not find a model that hits all the capability boxes, so it’s better to download a variety of models and experiment with them. Here are some of my favorites, in no particular order:

Gemma 3 12B QAT: for visual intelligence and it’s generally a good non-reasoning model that’s fast and produces good text
Qwen3 4B 2507 Thinking: This is the updated version of Qwen3 4B, which also has a non-reasoning variant; it’s really small, fast, and good quality for its size
GPT-OSS 20B: The largest and most capable model that can run on my machine, has three levels of reasoning; it’s rather slow but very capable, smartest of all
Phi-4 (14B): It was my favorite before GPT-OSS, now has reasoning and reasoning plus variants, but I haven’t used it lately

Final words
Small models may not replace frontier models in terms of speed or quality, but I still see utility in them. Running them locally is also a good test bed for understanding how they work and learning to work around their weaknesses.
Let me part with a final tip: LM Studio shows you how much of the context window is being used. So you may find it useful to ask for it to summarize the conversation so far, when the context window gets close to being filled. This way you can help it remember important information that it would otherwise forget.4
Have fun with your brand new genie in your computer!
Thanks to Jull for reviewing an early draft, and my girlfriend for the leekspin hero image.



With an M-series, Apple Silicon chipset, Intel chips are pretty old at this point and wouldn’t run LLMs well↩
You may be wondering about performance and if it will be usable. When you generate a model response, two things happen in sequence; prompt processing and token generation. Prompt processing is tokenizing the entire chat history, is done in parallel, and compute bound. Token generation is sequential, and is memory bandwidth bound. Both of these things get slower as the context size increases.

Also, counterintuitively, these models don’t run on the Neural Engine. Both llama.cpp and MLX run on the GPU, using Metal shaders. I’m not entirely sure why though.↩
It’s called that because the common wisdom is that models reason with tokens, and a smaller model can generate a higher quality response if it generates more tokens. To protect the user from the burden of reading through more slop, these reasoning tokens are usually hidden from the user.↩
This is called compaction and, coding tools such as Claude Code can do this automatically, or provide a command for you to trigger it manually.↩

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[During the IFA 2025 in Berlin, AMD hosted a media discussion, where one of the topics was the ongoing x86 vs. Arm debate. AMD has argued that x86 processors, both their own and Intel's SKUs, can offer competitively long battery life in the notebook form factor while maintaining the decades-old x86 software ecosystem. In a now-deleted article from ComputerBase, AMD claimed that the value of the overall package drives power efficiency and battery life, not the instruction set behind the CPU cores. As seen with designs like Intel's "Lunar Lake" and AMD's "Strix Point," x86 designs can deliver significant performance in a power-efficient package, including the GPU and even memory. Below is AMD's quote for ComputerBase, machine translated to English.AMDSpeaking of efficiency, the topic of Arm vs. x86 came up here, as it does every year. AMD, almost like Intel recently, declared that the myth that x86 can't be efficient was refuted last year. Both AMD Ryzen and Intel Core can offer extremely long runtimes in notebooks, while accessing the entire x86 ecosystem. Ultimately, the overall package doesn't offer an advantage for Arm. AMD evaluated using the Arm ISA with K12, but ultimately decided to pursue the x86 route due to the numerous advantages of software. Arm has been carving out a dedicated market share in the PC space slowly with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X and NVIDIA's soon-to-be N1/N1x. However, these are insignificant compared to the number of PCs running x86 today, as well as the volume of notebooks being shipped with an x86 CPU. These notebooks and handheld consoles mostly run on x86, which has disproven the old argument that Arm ISA is more efficient.]]></content:encoded>

                    Last week, I wrote about how Joshua Aaron's ICEBlock app, which allows people to anonymously report ICE sightings within a 5-mile radius, is – unfortunately, and despite apparent good intentions – activism theater. This was based on Joshua's talk at HOPE where he made it clear that he isn't taking the advice of local community groups, that ICE sightings aren't verified in any way, and that he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to security and privacy.In that post, in the section about his "HIGHLY secure" server that he kept mentioning, I wrote:Without providing more details, I also discovered that his server is running outdated software with known vulnerabilities.I was intentionally vague because I knew that his server was vulnerable at the time of writing, and I didn't want anyone to exploit one of these vulnerabilities before he had a chance to fix it.ICEBlock has been downloaded over one million times from the App Store. I don't know whether Joshua's server stores data related to these users or the reports they submit, but it might, and he certainly bragged about the security of it in his HOPE talk.I'm publishing this because it's important for people who are trusting ICEBlock to know that the developer is careless about computer security, even when people specifically point out security issues and give him time to fix them. Hopefully his server doesn't have any user data. Hopefully no one will hack his server despite the fact that he's making it easy for them to. And hopefully this blog post will compel him to finally fix the issue.UPDATE: It worked! Hours after I published this, Joshua has updated Apache in his server, fixing the issue.Joshua runs two Bluesky accounts: @iceblock.app, the account of the ICEBlock app, and @joshua.stealingheather.com‬, Joshua's personal account. His personal account had DMs closed, but the ICEBlock account had DMs open, so I sent him DMs there.On September 1, I wrote:Hey Joshua, I'm one of the people who saw your HOPE talk and asked some of the questions. I'm giving you a heads up that I'm preparing to publish a blog post about the app and your talk that isn't very flattering. But also, I wanted to give you notice that you're running a vulnerable version of Apache on your linode server. I'm not mentioning this specifically, but you should install updatesYou seem to be running Apache httpd 2.4.57. See https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html for more details, but this version of Apache has multiple critical CVEs which could take over your server. Like for example, this one https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38476Then, an hour and a half later, I published my blog and sent him my Bluesky post about it:I wrote about @iceblock.app, the developer's infuriating HOPE talk, and how it's unfortunately basically activism theater micahflee.com/unfortunatel...— Micah Lee (@micahflee.com) 2025-09-01T22:56:27.196ZHe didn't respond from the @iceblock.app account other than blocking me. (Which, honestly, isn't very fair, since I'm not ICE.)Screenshot from Bluesky of @iceblock.app blocking me after my responsible disclosureHe did, however, send me a DM from his @joshua.stealingheather.com account, saying:It would be so great if you could stop lying about me and ICEBlock. You are doing nothing to help. You don’t know me, my history, my knowledge, or anything more than hearing me at Hope.Don’t bother responding because this will be my last and only communication with you. Do better.To which I replied:If I got anything wrong in my blog post, please let me know and I’d be happy to post a correctionHere's a screenshot of the exchange.Screenshot from Bluesky DMs with @joshua.stealingheather.com telling me I'm lying about him and his appA few days later, on September 3, I decided to check again. His server was still running Apache 2.4.57, which has multiple vulnerabilities. He ignored my report and didn't fix it.And just so you know, fixing this problem is extremely easy. He just needs to SSH in and run something like sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade, wait for the Apache updated package to install, and his server would no longer be vulnerable.Seeing that he wasn't taking this seriously, I decided to give him a deadline to patch his server before I publicly disclosed the vulnerability. I sent his @joshua.stealingheather.com account these messages:Hey Joshua, I noticed that you still haven't updated Apache on your server. I disclosed that you're running Apache 2.4.57, which has known critical vulnerabilities, on September 1. I don't know what data (if any) related to [ICEBlock] and its users that you store on your server. But until you update Apache, it might be trivial for anyone to hack your server and steal all of it. So, please install updates.I'm giving you a week from when I first disclosed this before I write about it (so, September 8), which should give you more than enough time to update a package.Just so you're aware, I determined the version of Apache using nmap's version detection feature. You can run nmap -p443 -sV iceblock.app to test the version yourself, and it should show you this:PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION443/tcp open ssl/http Apache httpd 2.4.57 ((Unix) OpenSSL/3.0.9)As a reminder, you can find the known vulnerabilities for this version of Apache here: https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.htmlAnd, as I showed you before, just one of the vulns is CVE-2024-38476, which you can read about here: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38476. This is a "critical" vulnerability that could potentially be used to execute scripts on your server. Please get back to me.He didn't get back to me. And an hour and a half later, he blocked me from this account too.Screenshot from Bluesky DMs with @joshua.stealingheather.com, where I disclose his vulnerability again, and he blocks meIt's now been a week, and I checked again: Joshua's "HIGHLY secure" server is still running a version of Apache with multiple known critical vulnerabilities. And even with plenty of time to fix the issue, he still hasn't.I hope he isn't storing any ICEBlock-related data on there.

Writing code is easy. Once you have a solution in mind, and have mastered the syntax of your favorite programming language, writing code is easy. Having an LLM write entire functions for you? Even easier. But the hard part isn’t the writing. It’s the reading. It’s the time it takes to load the mental model of the system into your head. That’s where all the cost really is.

A mental model is the thing you build when you read code. It’s your internal map of how the system works, where the tricky parts are, what depends on what. Without it, you’re just staring at lines of text.

When I worked as a contractor, most of my jobs started the same way. I’d get a task to fix a bug or add a new feature in an application I’d never seen before. My mental model was clean and empty at first. To start filling it, I’d check the homepage to see what it looked like. I’d look at the page source: is this React? jQuery? A third-party plugin? I’d scan the codebase to see if the carousel they are requesting on the front page was used elsewhere. I’d check their build process, their testing setup, the tools they leaned on. Every little detail I discovered got appended to the model in my head.

It was like moving into a new city. You start at the foot of your apartment, wander a few streets, notice which roads lead to the freeway, where the grocery store is, and slowly you start to orient yourself. That’s what reading code feels like: you’re building a mental map so you don’t get lost every time you move around.

Say you need to understand a simple function like getUserPreferences(userId). To build your mental model, you need to trace:


Where is this function defined?
What does it return? Is it a Promise? What's the shape of the data?
Does it hit a database directly or go through an API?
Are there caching layers involved?
What happens if the user doesn't exist?
Who else calls this function and in what contexts?
Are there side effects?


Understanding that one function means jumping between database schemas, API definitions, error handling middleware, and multiple call sites. Only after building this web of relationships do you have enough context to safely modify anything.

And it’s slow. Reading code is harder than writing it. Much harder. Writing code is forward motion: you’re laying down fresh pavement. Reading code means retracing someone else’s steps, which usually means jumping between files, chasing function calls, inferring side effects, and deciphering intentions that aren’t written down. Understanding one function often means looking at five other files. Only after all that do you have enough of a map to even begin.

It’s the same reason debugging is harder than coding. On Stack Overflow, one of the most common comments you’ll see under a bad question is: “Can you show us what you did?” Without seeing the steps, no one can load the right model in their head to help. It’s also why the XY problem keeps coming up. People ask about a symptom without giving the context that would let others reconstruct the whole picture.

I'm still fascinated by the lawyer who used ChatGPT in court. He filed a brief that cited six cases which turned out not to exist. Everyone asked: why didn’t he read them? The answer is the same: it takes time and effort to build the model. He would have had to chase down each case, read them, and slot them into a broader understanding of legal precedent. Reading is the hard part. Generating is easy.

Reading isn't just about going through the code and examining it line by line. It's also about going through the documentation, code reviews, and peer programming. In fact, these are solutions for accelerating the process of building our mental model. But with that in mind, you still have to, well, read and understand. You'll notice that programmers often want to rewrite things from scratch, because "the old code sucks". What sucks is taking the time to read and understand it.

And this is what makes LLMs both powerful and dangerous in programming. Whether the AI generates perfect code or complete hallucinations, you still have to read it. You still have to trace through what it’s supposed to do, how it interacts with the rest of the system, and what the side effects are. The longer the generated code, the longer it takes to build your mental model. And only once you’ve done that can you spot the issues, the places where the generated code doesn’t quite fit, or quietly breaks something else.

When an LLM can produce an infinite amount of code or text, it tempts us to skip the reading. But you can’t skip the model. You wouldn’t want to load someone else’s saved game and be dropped in the middle of a boss fight. That’s what it feels like to inherit or generate code you don’t understand.

This is why the real bottleneck in software development isn’t writing, it’s understanding.



For now, we don't have the LLM equivalent for understanding. Something that could instantly transfer a complete mental model from the system to your head. Until we do, the bottleneck hasn't moved. We've solved the "typing speed" problem. We can generate more code than we could ever hope to read. But until we solve the "understanding" problem, the cost of software development remains the same: the time it takes for someone to make sense of it all.

This has real implications for how we use AI tools. Instead of asking AI to generate large blocks of code, we might be better off asking it to help us understand existing code. Instead of measuring productivity by lines of code written, we should measure it by how quickly teams can build accurate mental models of their systems.

The future of programming might not be about generating more code faster. It might be about generating understanding faster. And that's a much harder problem to solve.
