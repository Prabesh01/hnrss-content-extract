            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi HN! – We’re Pranjali, Dhruv and Harsha, building Slashy (https://www.slashy.ai). We’re building a general agent that connects to apps and can read data across them and perform actions via custom tools, semantic search, and personalized memory. Here’s a demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeApHMHhccA.While working on a previous startup, we realized we were spending more time doing busywork in apps than actually building product. We lost hundreds of hours scraping LinkedIn profiles, updating spreadsheets, updating investor reports, and communicating across multiple Slack channels. Our breaking point happened after I checked my screen time and realized I spent 4 hours a day in Gmail. We decided that we could create more value solving this than by working on the original startup (a code generation agent similar to Lovable).Slashy is an AI agent that uses direct tool calls to services such as Gmail, Calendar, Notion, Sheets and more. We built all of our tools in-house since we found that most MCPs are low quality and add an unnecessary layer of abstraction. Through these tools, the agent is able to semantically search across your apps, get relevant information, and perform actions (e.g. send emails, create calendar events, etc). This solves the problem of context-switching and copy-pasting information from an app back and forth into ChatGPT.Slashy integrates to 15 different services so far (G-Suite, Slack, Notion, Dropbox, Airtable, Outlook, Phone, Linear, Hubspot, and more). We use a single agent architecture (as we found this reduces hallucinations), and use our own custom tools—doing so allows the model to have higher quality as we can design them to work in a general agent structure, for example we use markdown for Slack/Notion instead of their native text structure.So what makes Slashy different from the 100 other general agents?- It Actually Takes Action: Unlike ChatGPT or Claude that just give you information, Slashy researches companies, creates Google Docs with findings, adds contacts to your CRM, schedules follow-ups, and sends personalized emails – all in one workflow.- Cross-Tool Context: Most automation tools work in silos (one of the biggest problems with MCP). Slashy understands your data across platforms. It can read your previous Slack conversations about a prospect, check your calendar for availability, research their company online, and draft a personalized email. What powers this is our own semantic search functionality.- User Action Graphs: Our agent over time has memory not just of past conversations, but also forms user actions graphs to know what actions are expected based on previous user conversations.- No Technical Setup Required: While Zapier requires building complex flows and fails silently, Slashy works through natural language. Just describe what you want automated.- Custom UI: For our tool calls we design custom UI for each of them to make the UX more natural.Here are some examples of workflows people use us for:▪ "Every day look at my calendar and send me a notion doc with in-depth backgrounds on everyone I’m meeting"▪ "Find the emails of everyone who reacted to my latest LinkedIn post and send personalized outreach"▪ "Can you make me an investor pitch deck with market research, competitive analysis, and financial projections"▪ "Doing a full Nvidia Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis"Slashy.ai is live with a free tier (100 daily credits) along with 500 credits for any new account. You can immediately try out workflows like the ones above and we have a special code for HN (HACKERNEWS at checkout).Hope you all enjoy Slashy as much as we do :)]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Five years ago, Google’s climate action ambitions were the gold standard for Big Tech. Then, with power demand spikes from AI data centres, in July it scrubbed its sustainability website of its 2030 net zero pledge.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai stood smiling in a leafy-green California garden in September 2020 and declared that the IT behemoth was entering the “most ambitious decade yet” in its climate action.“Today, I’m proud to announce that we intend to be the first major company to operate carbon free — 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year,” he said, in a video announcement.Pichai added that he knew the “road ahead would not be easy,” but Google “aimed to prove that a carbon-free future is both possible and achievable fast enough to prevent the most dangerous impacts of climate change.”Five years on, just how hard Google’s “energy journey” would become is clear. In June, Google’s Sustainability website proudly boasted a headline pledge to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030. By July, that had all changed. An investigation by Canada’s National Observer has found that Google’s net-zero pledge has quietly been scrubbed, demoted from having its own section on the site to an entry in the appendices of the company's sustainability report.Genna Schnurbach, an external spokesperson for Google, referring to the report, told us: “As you can see from the document, Google is still committed to their ambition of net zero by 2030.” By tracing back through the history of Google’s Sustainability website, we found that the company edited it in late June, removing almost all mention of its lauded net-zero goals. (A separate website referring to data centres specifically has maintained its existing language around net-zero commitments.)   Five years ago, Google’s climate action ambitions were the gold standard for Big Tech. Then, with power demand spikes from AI data centres, in July it scrubbed its sustainability website of its 2030 net zero pledge.  The page on Operating Sustainably has been rebranded to Operations, and the section on net-zero carbon was deleted. In its place is a new priority area: Energy. “Running the global infrastructure behind our products and services, including AI, takes considerable energy,” said Google in its Environment 2025 report, which explained that it will be almost impossible to meet its erstwhile net-zero ambitions, partly due to its expansion in AI.These significant removals come as Big Tech is racing to build new, power-devouring, hyperscale data centres to capitalize on the global boom in artificial intelligence. They are also coming at a time when the Trump administration has targeted institutions that have environmental ambitions.“While we remain committed to our climate moonshots, it’s become clear that achieving them is now more complex and challenging across every level — from local to global,” the Google report authors state. In the same report last year, Net Zero Carbon was a key priority. First in Big Tech to make net-zero pledgeGoogle, which has data centres in Toronto, Ont., and Montreal, Que., was one of the first tech giants to set sweeping sustainability goals — and it appears to be one of the first to be considering sweeping them out of sight. The latest sustainability reports from Big Tech peers, Microsoft and Amazon, by contrast, still present net-zero emissions as a headline priority area.                                                                                                 Canada's National Observer used the online tool Wayback Archive to examine the history of Google's operating sustainability page, discovering that it no longer lists net-zero as a headline priority area.Google’s yearly electricity consumption increased by 26 per cent in 2024 to 32.2 terrawatt-hours, which is almost as much as the consumption of Ireland. Last month, it released a technical report which revealed that a single chat message to its Gemini AI model consumes 0.24 watt-hours of energy, equivalent to 2.4 minutes of running a small LED bulb. A recent report from McKinsey & Co calculates that by 2030, it will cost $6.7 trillion worldwide in new investment to keep pace with the exploding demand for computing power. Data centres equipped to handle AI processing loads will need $5.2 trillion in investment, the consultancy predicted. The stratospheric rise in forecasted AI workloads could drive about 70 per cent of new electricity demand, McKinsey found, with the estimated global data centre capacity demand in its “mid-range” scenario expected to rise 3.5-fold to close to 250 gigawatts by 2030. In the US, this means the sector would account for almost 12 per cent of total national energy demand, up from just over five per cent today.                                                                                                McKinsey & Co“The pressure to get any possible source of electricity is rather overwhelming right now, especially in the developed world, which hasn't touched its grid for 40 years,” Michael Barnard, a prominent clean energy technology analyst and self-styled climate futurist, told Canada’s National Observer. This pressure was explored in a recent report from the New Climate Institute, a think-tank, which found that the tech sector is facing a "climate strategy crisis," where emissions targets have “lost their meaning amid soaring energy demand.”AI power demand growth slows climate actionFor some in the sector, the power demand growth linked to AI expansion has become incompatible with their existing environmental commitments. And this inconvenient truth has coincided with the reelection of Donald Trump, whose administration has signalled it will roll back climate policies, and whose allies have disparaged corporate sustainability efforts as part of a “woke agenda.” Barnard noted “there's a lot of pandering to Trump going on," referring to Google chief investment officer Ruth Porat championing expansion of the use of “incredibly clean” coal plants and other fossil fuels for its future power data centres. Pichai himself attended Trump’s inauguration, to which Google donated $1 million. But Barnard pointed to the fact that Google continues to sign corporate power purchase deals for various renewable energy sources, including hydropower, offshore wind and even advanced geothermal.“Bit of a tight rope for Google,” he said, adding: “Watch what everyone actually does as opposed to what they say when dealing with Trump.”                                                                                                 Still image from Google's original video where Sundar Pichai presents the tech giant's 2030 net-zero pledgeJohn Lang, co-founder of the Net Zero Tracker, a data analysis firm that focuses on fact-checking net zero in every nation and the largest cities and companies around the globe, told Canada's National Observer that he believes the world is temporarily in what he dubs a "net-zero recession"– but it hasn’t caused companies to abandon climate action.“What we're seeing is we are seeing some backtracking, but it's highly concentrated in two sectors: finance and fossil fuels,” Lang said.In other sectors, Lang said corporations are now recalibrating their early sustainability goals to be more realistic and reduce reliance on carbon credits. This, he added, is “a really, really good thing.”Google, whose parent company Alphabet has a market cap of US$2.79 trillion, has taken a more ambiguous approach. Despite removing its net-zero headline from its Sustainability website, the company insists that it remains committed to its 2030 goal — which relies heavily on carbon offsetting. An external PR representative for Google declined to reply to Canada’s National Observer’s challenge of her claim that it was “still committed” to net zero by 2030, despite the pledge being demoted to an appendix.The UN’s High Level Expert Group on the Net Zero Emissions Commitments of Non-State Entities released a report in 2022, which found that unrealistic sustainability pledges “erode confidence in net zero pledges overall” and “undermine sovereign state commitments.”Lang is more sympathetic to “stretch goals,” like Google’s climate moonshots, as long as the deadlines are set close in the future, as they can motivate urgency. “It still needs to be realistic. You still need to be able to deliver it,” he added. He praised Google’s decision to invest $200 million in durable carbon removals as setting a positive precedent for other companies.It is unclear whether Google’s decision to delete its net-zero pledges from its Sustainability website sets a more worrying precedent.Lang is convinced the setbacks are only temporary and rapid emissions reductions will soon be reprioritized. “It's our one and only solution to climate change. It's as simple as that. There's no other option.”]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Even if you can’t stop Flock’s use entirely, you can still help protect civil liberties in your community.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
	  From Pasadena, California to Lexington, Kentucky to Menasha, Wisconsin, to Newark, New Jersey, the surveillance company Flock Safety is blanketing American cities with dangerously powerful and unregulated automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) cameras. While license plate readers have been around for some time, Flock is the first to create a nationwide mass-surveillance system out of its customers’ cameras.
Working with police departments, neighborhood watches, and other private customers, Flock not only allows private camera owners to create their own “hot lists” that will generate alarms when listed plates are spotted, but also runs all plates against state police watchlists and the FBI’s primary criminal database, the National Crime Information Center (NCIC). Flock’s goal is to expand to “every city in the United States,” and its cameras are already in use in over 2,000 cities in at least 42 states.
Unlike a targeted ALPR camera system that is designed to take pictures of license plates, check the plates against local hot lists, and then flush the data if there’s no hit, Flock is building a giant camera network that records people’s comings and goings across the nation, and then makes that data available for search by any of its law enforcement customers. Such a system provides even small-town sheriffs access to a sweeping and powerful mass-surveillance tool, and allows big actors like federal agencies and large urban police departments to access the comings and goings of vehicles in even the smallest of towns. And every new customer that buys and installs the company’s cameras extends Flock’s network, contributing to the creation of a centralized mass surveillance system of Orwellian scope. Motorola Solutions, a competitor to Flock, is pursuing a similar business model.
If the police or government leaders are pushing for Flock or another centralized mass-surveillance ALPR system in your community, we urge you to oppose it, full stop. You can do this by urging your local councilperson or other elected representatives to adopt our recommendations into law, attending public meetings and hearings, and raising the profile of the issue by writing letters to the editor and op-eds. You can also use social media to highlight the issues — be sure to tag your elected officials — including by sharing this blog post. If you’re an elected official or community leader, you may also be able to engage directly with your police department — we have found that some departments are willing to do so.
In a few places, residents concerned about privacy and over-policing have successfully blocked their police departments’ acquisition of Flock or other ALPR systems. But, in many other cities, those efforts have been thwarted. In communities where such systems can’t be stopped entirely, we can still help protect our and our neighbors’ civil liberties by working with our local police department and elected officials to ensure that local ALPR cameras do not feed into a mass surveillance system that lets potentially every law enforcement department in the world spy on the residents and visitors of any city in America.
We don’t find every use of ALPRs objectionable. For example, we do not generally object to using them to check license plates against lists of stolen cars, for AMBER Alerts, or for toll collection, provided they are deployed and used fairly and subject to proper checks and balances, such as ensuring devices are not disproportionately deployed in low-income communities and communities of color, and that the “hot lists” they are run against are legitimate and up to date. But there’s no reason the technology should be used to create comprehensive records of everybody’s comings and goings — and that is precisely what ALPR databases like Flock’s are doing. In our country, the government should not be tracking us unless it has individualized suspicion that we’re engaged in wrongdoing. We more fully lay out our concerns with this technology in a March 2022 white paper on Flock, and in a 2013 report on law enforcement use.
  
	  Many police departments neither understand nor endorse Flock’s nationwide, mass surveillance-driven approach to ALPR use, but are adopting the company’s cameras simply because other police departments in their region are doing so. As such, they may be amenable to compromise. That might even include using another vendor that does not tie its cameras into a mass-surveillance system. In other cases, you may be able to get your police department or local legislators to add addendums to Flock’s standard contract that limit its ALPR system’s mass surveillance capabilities and highly permissive data sharing.
In those situations, the three most important areas for regulation and negotiation are how long the data is retained, who the data is shared with, and how that data is used by law enforcement. We obtained samples of Flock’s Government Agency Customer Agreements with the Greensboro, North Carolina Police Department and other Flock contracts with local police. Below is suggested contract language across these three areas, based on these agreements, that you can use in your local advocacy efforts.
  
	  Whether ALPRs are being used for Amber Alerts, toll collection, or to identify stolen vehicles, a license plate can be run against a watchlist in seconds. The police do not need records of every person’s coming and goings, including trips to doctor’s offices, religious institutions, and political gatherings.
New Hampshire state law, which requires law enforcement to delete non-hit license plate capture data within three minutes, is a good model. But you should get the shortest retention period you can in your community. From worst to best, here are three approaches that can be taken to the retention of ALPR data:
  
	  One of the most important privacy-protective steps you can take is to restrict your community’s ALPR system to local use, meaning local ALPR scans are only checked against locally developed watch lists. Allowing local ALPR data to be used by outside law enforcement creates significant risks. Your local ALPR data could be used to enforce anti-abortion or anti-immigrant laws from other jurisdictions, or even to assist foreign, authoritarian regimes in hunting down political opponents and refugees living in America (Flock’s default provisions give the company a “worldwide” license to use its customers’ APLR data).
These risks are simply not worth taking, especially since there are many other companies that sell locally focused systems. From worst to best, here are three data sharing and use approaches:
  As much as we might hope that all police watchlists were 100 percent reliable, we know they are not. In fact, the largest and most commonly used national watch list — the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database — does not even comply with the 1974 United States Privacy Act’s basic accuracy, reliability, and completeness requirements. That means allowing your ALPR data to be run against such databases will subject anyone living in or visiting your town to unjustified arrest and detention, which is an especially dangerous proposition for members of vulnerable, already overpoliced communities. Again, from worst to best, here are three database use approaches:In the end, neither local police departments, nor government officials, nor residents should blindly accept Flock’s model simply because it advances Flock’s bottom line, or because other jurisdictions have unwisely chosen to do so. We continue to believe that using Flock cameras should be opposed outright. But where that battle can’t be won, then any system should at least be confined to the community itself and not made part of a national and international mass-surveillance system.]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[The Cache interface provides a persistent storage mechanism for Request / Response object pairs that are cached in long lived memory. How long a Cache object lives is browser dependent, but a single origin's scripts can typically rely on the presence of a previously populated Cache object.

    Instance methods
    
Cache.match()

Returns a Promise that resolves to the response associated with the first matching request in the Cache object.

Cache.matchAll()

Returns a Promise that resolves to an array of all matching responses in the Cache object.

Cache.add()

Takes a URL, retrieves it and adds the resulting response object to the given cache. This is functionally equivalent to calling fetch(), then using put() to add the results to the cache.

Cache.addAll()

Takes an array of URLs, retrieves them, and adds the resulting response objects to the given cache.

Cache.put()

Takes both a request and its response and adds it to the given cache.

Cache.delete()

Finds the Cache entry whose key is the request, returning a Promise that resolves to true if a matching Cache entry is found and deleted. If no Cache entry is found, the promise resolves to false.

Cache.keys()

Returns a Promise that resolves to an array of Cache keys.


  
    Examples
    This code snippet is from the service worker selective caching sample. (see selective caching live) The code uses CacheStorage.open() to open any Cache objects with a Content-Type header that starts with font/.
The code then uses Cache.match() to see if there's already a matching font in the cache, and if so, returns it. If there isn't a matching font, the code fetches the font from the network and uses Cache.put() to cache the fetched resource.
The code handles exceptions thrown from the fetch() operation. Note that an HTTP error response (e.g., 404) will not trigger an exception. It will return a normal response object that has the appropriate error code.
The code snippet also shows a best practice for versioning caches used by the service worker. Though there's only one cache in this example, the same approach can be used for multiple caches. It maps a shorthand identifier for a cache to a specific, versioned cache name. The code also deletes all caches that aren't named in CURRENT_CACHES.
In the code example, caches is a property of the ServiceWorkerGlobalScope. It holds the CacheStorage object, by which it can access the CacheStorage interface.

    Cookies and Cache objects
    The Fetch API requires Set-Cookie headers to be stripped before returning a Response object from fetch(). So a Response stored in a Cache won't contain Set-Cookie headers, and therefore won't cause any cookies to be stored.

            <description><![CDATA[How the world’s largest encyclopedia became the factual foundation of the web, but now it’s under attack from the right wing, tech billionaires, and AI.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[When armies invade, hurricanes form, or governments fall, a Wikipedia editor will typically update the relevant articles seconds after the news breaks. So quick are editors to change “is” to “was” in cases of notable deaths that they are said to have the fastest past tense in the West. So it was unusual, according to one longtime editor who was watching the page, that on the afternoon of January 20th, 2025, hours after Elon Musk made a gesture resembling a Nazi salute at a rally following President Donald Trump’s inauguration and well into the ensuing public outcry, no one had added the incident to the encyclopedia.Then, just before 4PM, an editor by the name of PickleG13 added a single sentence to Musk’s 8,600-word biography: “Musk appeared to perform a Nazi salute,” citing an article in The Jerusalem Post. In a note explaining the change, the editor wrote, “This controversy will be debated, but it does appear and is being reported that Musk may have performed a Hitler salute.” Two minutes later, another editor deleted the line for violating Wikipedia’s stricter standards for unflattering information in biographies of living people.But PickleG13 was correct. That evening, as the controversy over the gesture became a vortex of global attention, another editor called for an official discussion about whether it deserved to be recorded in Wikipedia. At first, the debate on the article’s “talk page,” where editors discuss changes, was much the same as the one playing out across social media and press: it was obviously a Nazi salute vs. it was an awkward wave vs. it couldn’t have been a wave, just look at the touch to his shoulder, the angle of his palm vs. he’s autistic vs. no, he’s antisemitic vs. I don’t see the biased media calling out Obama for doing a Nazi salute in this photo I found on Twitter vs. that’s just a still photo, stop gaslighting people about what they obviously saw. But slowly, through the barbs and rebuttals and corrections, the trajectory shifted.Wikipedia is the largest compendium of human knowledge ever assembled, with more than 7 million articles in its English version, the largest and most developed of 343 language projects. Started nearly 25 years ago, the site was long mocked as a byword for the unreliability of information on the internet, yet today it is, without exaggeration, the digital world’s factual foundation. It’s what Google puts at the top of search results otherwise awash in ads and spam, what social platforms cite when they deign to correct conspiracy theories, and what AI companies scrape in their ongoing quest to get their models to stop regurgitating info-slurry — and consult with such frequency that they are straining the encyclopedia’s servers. Each day, it’s where approximately 70 million people turn for reliable information on everything from particle physics to rare Scottish sheep to the Erfurt latrine disaster of 1184, a testament both to Wikipedia’s success and to the total degradation of the rest of the internet as an information resource. “It’s basically the only place on the internet that doesn’t function as a confirmation bias machine.”But as impressive as this archive is, it is the byproduct of something that today looks almost equally remarkable: strangers on the internet disagreeing on matters of existential gravity and breathtaking pettiness and, through deliberation and debate, building a common ground of consensus reality.“One of the things I really love about Wikipedia is it forces you to have measured, emotionless conversations with people you disagree with in the name of trying to construct the accurate narrative,” said DF Lovett, a Minnesota-based writer and marketer who mostly edits articles about local landmarks and favorite authors but later joined the salute debate to argue that “Elon Musk straight-arm gesture controversy” was a needlessly awkward description. “It’s basically the only place on the internet that doesn’t function as a confirmation bias machine,” he said, which is also why he thinks people sometimes get mad at it. Wikipedia is one of the few platforms online where tremendous computing power isn’t being deployed in the service of telling you exactly what you want to hear.Whether Musk had made a Nazi salute or was merely awkward, the editors decided, was not for them to say, even if they had their opinions. What was a fact, they agreed, was that on January 20th, Musk had “twice extended his right arm toward the crowd in an upward angle,” that many observers compared the gesture to a Nazi salute, and that Musk denied any meaning behind the motion. Consensus was reached. The lines were added back. Approximately 7,000 words of deliberation to settle, for a time, three sentences. This was Wikipedia’s process working as intended.It was at this point that Musk himself cannonballed into the discourse, tweeting that the encyclopedia was “legacy media propaganda!”This was not Musk’s first time attacking the site — that appears to have been in 2019, when he complained that it accurately described him as an early investor in Tesla rather than its founder. But recently he has taken to accusing the encyclopedia of a liberal bias, mocking it as “wokepedia,” and calling for it to be defunded. In so doing, he has joined a growing number of powerful people, groups, and governments that have made the site a target. In August, Republicans on the US House Oversight Committee sent a letter to the Wikimedia Foundation requesting information on attempts to “inject bias” into the encyclopedia and data about editors suspected of doing so.Musk repeating the salute before saying: “My heart goes out to you. It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured.”Hannah Arendt was a German and American historian and philosopher. She was one of the most influential political theorists of the twentieth century.Members of the Hitler Youth in Berlin performing the Nazi salute at a rally in 1933.Pyramidology refers to various religious or pseudoscientific speculations regarding pyramids, most often the Giza pyramid complex and the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion ... draws all things else to support and agree with it. And though there be a greater number and weight of instances to be found on the other side, yet these it either neglects or despises, or else by some distinction sets aside or rejects[.] - Francis BaconAn MRI scanner allowed researchers to examine how the human brain deals with dissonant information.Mock trials allow researchers to examine confirmation biases in a realistic setting.When governments have cowed the press and flooded social platforms with viral propaganda, Wikipedia has become the next target, and a more stubborn one. Because it is edited by thousands of mostly pseudonymous volunteers around the world — and in theory, by anyone who feels like it — its contributors are difficult for any particular state to persecute. Since it’s supported by donations, there is no government funding to cut off or advertisers to boycott. And it is so popular and useful that even highly repressive governments have been hesitant to block it.Instead, they have developed an array of more sophisticated strategies. In Hong Kong, Russia, India, and elsewhere, government officials and state-aligned media have accused the site of ideological bias while online vigilantes harass editors. In several cases, editors have been sued, arrested, or threatened with violence.When several dozen editors gathered in San Francisco this February, many were concerned that the US could be next. The US, with its strong protections for online speech, has historically been a refuge when the encyclopedia has faced attacks elsewhere in the world. It is where the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that supports the project, is based. But the site has become a popular target for conservative media and influencers, some of whom now have positions in the Trump administration. In January, the Forward published slides from the Heritage Foundation, the think tank responsible for Project 2025, outlining a plan to reveal the identities of editors deemed antisemitic for adding information critical of Israel, a cudgel that the administration has wielded against academia. “It’s about creating doubt, confusion, attacking sources of trust,” an editor told the assembled group. “It came for the media and now it’s coming for Wikipedia and we need to be ready.”In 1967, Hannah Arendt published an essay in The New Yorker about what she saw as an inherent conflict between politics and facts. As varieties of truth go, she wrote, facts are fragile. Unlike axioms and mathematical proofs that can be derived by anyone at any time, there is nothing necessary about the fact, to use Arendt’s example, that German troops crossed the border with Belgium on the night of August 4th, 1914, and not some other border at some other time. Like all facts, this one is established through witnesses, testimony, documents, and collective agreement about what counts as evidence — it is political, and as the propaganda machines of the 20th century showed, political power is perfectly capable of destroying it. Furthermore, they will always be tempted to, because facts represent a sort of rival power, a constraint and limit “hated by tyrants who rightly fear the competition of a coercive force they cannot monopolize,” and at risk in democracies, where they are suspiciously impervious to public opinion. Facts, in other words, don’t care about your feelings. “Unwelcome facts possess an infuriating stubbornness,” Arendt wrote.This infuriating stubbornness turns out to be important, though. A lie might be more plausible or useful than a fact, but it lacks a fact’s dumb arbitrary quality of being the case for no particular reason and no matter your opinion or influence. History once rewritten can be rewritten again and becomes insubstantial. Rather than believe the lie, people stop believing anything at all, and even those in power lose their bearings. This gives facts “great resiliency” that is “oddly combined” with their fragility. Having a stubborn common ground of shared reality turns out to be a basic precondition of collective human life — of politics. Even political power seems to recognize this, Arendt wrote, when it establishes ideally impartial institutions insulated from its own influence, like the judiciary, the press, and academia, charged with producing facts according to methods other than the pure exercise of power.Leonardo DiCaprio is an American actor and film producer.Outside Wikipedia, original research is a key part of scholarly work. However, Wikipedia editors must base their contributions on reliable, published sources, not their own original research.On the floor of the US Senate, Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe displayed a snowball — on February 26th, 2015, in winter — as evidence the globe was not warming, in a year that was found to be Earth’s warmest on record at the time.Grouvellinus leonardodicaprioi is a species of riffle beetle in the superfamily Byrrhoidea.The species was named after actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio to acknowledge his work in “promoting environmental awareness and bringing the problems of climate change and biodiversity loss into the spotlight.”Wikipedia has come to play a similar role of factual ballast to an increasingly unmoored internet, but without the same institutional authority and with its own methods developed piecemeal over the last two decades for arriving at consensus fact. How to defend it from political attacks is not straightforward. At the conference, many editors felt both that attacks from the Trump administration were a genuine threat and that being cast as “the resistance” risked jeopardizing the encyclopedia’s position of trusted neutrality.“I would really argue not to take the attack approach, to really take the passive approach,” said one editor when someone broached the idea of actively debunking some of the false information swamping the rest of the internet. “People see us as credible because we don’t attack, because we are just providing information to everyone all the time in a boring way. Sometimes boring is good. Boring is credible.”Even the editor at the summit who had been most directly affected by the Trump administration urged against a direct response. Jamie Flood had been a librarian and outreach specialist at the National Agricultural Library, where among other duties she led group trainings and uploaded research on topics like germplasm and childhood nutrition to Wikipedia. Museums and libraries around the world employ such “Wikipedians in residence” to act as liaisons with the encyclopedia’s community for the same reason that the World Health Organization partnered with Wikipedia during the covid-19 pandemic to make the latest information available: if you want research to reach the public, there is no better place.Along with several other Wikipedians employed by the federal government, Flood had just been laid off by DOGE, collateral damage in a general dismantling of research and archival institutions. “I’m a casualty of this administration’s war on information,” Flood said.“‘Imagine a world where all knowledge is freely available to everyone.’”Still, Wikipedia absolutely should not counterattack, Flood said. “Wikipedia is always in the background. They’re not making a big statement, and I don’t think they should. I’ve been training people for a long time and I still go back to this early quote of Jimmy Wales, one of the founders: ‘Imagine a world where all knowledge is freely available to everyone.’ That’s enough. That’s a statement in and of itself. In a time of misinformation, in a time of suppression, having this place where people can come and bring knowledge and share knowledge, that is a statement.”Wikipedia should be, in other words, as stubborn as a fact. But then, facts are fragile things. A common refrain among Wikipedians is that the site works in practice but not in theory. It seems to flout everything we’ve learned about human behavior online: anonymous strangers discussing divisive topics and somehow, instead of dissolving into factions and acrimony, working together to build something of value.The project’s origins go back to 1999. Wales, a former options trader who had founded a laddish web portal called Bomis, wanted to start a free online encyclopedia. He hired an acquaintance from an Ayn Rand listserv that Wales previously ran, a philosophy PhD student named Larry Sanger. Their first attempt, called Nupedia, was not so different from encyclopedias as they have existed since Diderot’s Encyclopédie in 1751. Experts would write articles that went through seven stages of editorial review. It was slow going. After a year, Nupedia had just over 20 articles.In an attempt to speed things along, they decided to experiment with wikis, a web format gaining popularity among open-source software developers that allowed multiple people to collaboratively edit a project. (Wiki is the Hawaiian word for “quick.”) The wiki was intended to be a forum where the general public could contribute draft articles that would then be fed into Nupedia’s peer-review pipeline, but the experts objected and the crowdsourced site was given its own domain, Wikipedia.com. It went live on January 15th, 2001. Within days, it had more articles than all of Nupedia, albeit of varying quality. After a year, Wikipedia had more than 20,000 articles.“...write about what people believe, rather than what is so”There were few rules at first, but one that Wales said was “non-negotiable” was that Wikipedia should be written from a “neutral point of view.” The policy, abbreviated as NPOV, was imported from the “nonbias policy” Sanger had written for Nupedia. But on Wikipedia, Wales considered it as much a “social concept of cooperation” as an editorial standard. If this site was going to be open to anyone to edit, the only way to avoid endless flame wars over who is right was, provocatively speaking, to set questions of truth aside. “We could talk about that and get nowhere,” Wales wrote to the Wikipedia email list. “Perhaps the easiest way to make your writing more encyclopedic is to write about what people believe, rather than what is so,” he explained.Ideally, the neutrality principle would allow people of different views to agree, if not on the matter at hand, then at least on what it was they were disagreeing about. “If you’ve got a kind and thoughtful Catholic priest and a kind and thoughtful Planned Parenthood activist, they’re never going to agree about abortion, but they can probably work together on an article,” Wales would later say.This view faced an immediate challenge, which is that people believe all sorts of things: that the Earth is 6,000 years old, that climate change is a scam, that the Holocaust was a hoax, that the Irish potato famine was overblown, that chiropractors are all charlatans, that they have discovered a new geometry, and that Mother Teresa was a jerk.Lawrence Mark Sanger is an American Internet project developer and philosopher who cofounded Wikipedia along with Jimmy Wales. Anti-denialist banner at the 2017 Climate March in Washington, DC.Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu was an Albanian Indian Catholic nun, founded the Missionaries of Charity, and is a Catholic saint.Young Earth creationism (YEC) is a form of creationism that holds as a central tenet that the Earth and its lifeforms were created by supernatural acts of the Abrahamic God between about 10,000 and 6,000 years ago, contradicting established scientific data that puts the age of Earth around 4.54 billion years.In response, the early volunteers added another rule. You can’t just say things; any factual claim needs a citation that readers can check for themselves. When people started emailing Wales their proofs that Einstein was wrong about relativity, he clarified that the cited source could not be your own “original research.” Sorry, Wales wrote to an Einstein debunker, it doesn’t matter whether your theory is true. When it is published in a physics journal, you can cite that.Instead of trying to ascertain the truth, editors assessed the credibility of sources, looking to signals like whether a publication had a fact-checking department, got cited by other reputable sources, and issued corrections when it got things wrong. At their best, these ground rules ensured debates followed a productive dialectic. An editor might write that human-caused climate change was a fact; another might change the line to say there was ongoing debate; a third editor would add the line back, backed up by surveys of climate scientists, and demand peer-reviewed studies supporting alternate theories. The outcome was a more accurate description of the state of knowledge than many journalists were promoting at the time by giving “both sides” equal weight, and also a lot of work to arrive at. A 2019 study published in Nature found that Wikipedia’s most polarizing articles — eugenics, global warming, Leonardo DiCaprio — are the highest quality, because each side keeps adding citations in support of their views. Wikipedia: a machine for turning conflict into bibliographies. Coupled with some technical features of wikis, like the ability for anyone to edit anyone else’s writing, and some early administrative rules, like not being allowed to undo someone else’s edit more than three times per day, users were practically forced to talk through disagreements and arrive at “consensus.” This became Wikipedia’s governing principle.This may make the process sound more peaceful than it is. Disputes were constant. Early on, Sanger, who had remained partial to a more hierarchical, expert-driven model, clashed repeatedly with editors he decried as “anarchists” and demanded greater authority for himself, which the editors rejected. When revenue from Bomis dried up after the dot-com crash, Wales laid Sanger off and took over management of the project.Wales governed from a greater remove, appearing only occasionally to broker peace between warring editors, resolve an impasse, or reassure people that they didn’t need to spend time devising procedures to screen out a sudden influx of neo-Nazis that were planning to overwhelm discussion, because if they showed up, “I will personally ban them all if necessary, and that’s that.” Editors sometimes ironically referred to him as their “God King” or “benevolent dictator,” but he described his role as a sort of constitutional monarch safeguarding the community as it developed the processes to fully govern itself. Because Wikipedia was under a Creative Commons license, anyone who didn’t like the way the project was run could copy it and start their own, as a group of Spanish users did when the possibility of running ads was raised in 2002. The next year Wales established a nonprofit, the Wikimedia Foundation, to raise funds and handle the technical and legal work required to keep the project running. The encyclopedia itself, however, would be entirely edited and managed by volunteers.In early 2004, Wales delegated his moderating powers to a group of elected editors, called the Arbitration Committee. From that point onward, he was essentially another editor, screenname Jimbo Wales, liable to have his edits undone like anyone else. He attempted several times to update his own birthdate to reflect the fact that his mother says he was born slightly before midnight on August 7th, 1966, not on August 8th, as his birth certificate read, only to be reprimanded for editing his own page and trying to cite his own “original research.” (After several years of debates and citable coverage from reliable sources, August 7th eventually won, with a note explaining the discrepancy.)Over the ensuing two decades, editors amended policies to cope with conspiracy theorists, revisionist historians, militant fandoms, and other perennial goblins of the open web. There were the three core content guidelines of Neutral Point of View, Verifiability, and No Original Research; the five pillars of Wikipedia; and a host of rules around editor conduct, like the injunction to avoid ad hominem attacks and assume good faith of others, defined and refined in interlinked articles and essays. There are specialized forums and noticeboards where editors can turn for help making an article more neutral, figuring out whether a source was reliable, or deciding whether a certain view was fringe or mainstream. By 2005, the pages where editors stipulated policy and debated articles were found to be growing faster than the articles themselves. Today, this administrative backend is at least five times the size of the encyclopedia it supports.The most important thing to know about this system is that, like the neutrality principle from which it arose, it largely ignores content to focus on process. If editors disagree about, for example, whether the article for the uninhabited islands claimed by both Japan and China should be titled “Senkaku Islands,” “Diaoyu Islands,” or “Pinnacle Islands,” they first try to reach an agreement on the article’s Talk page, not by arguing who is correct, but by arguing which side’s position better accords with specific Wikipedia policies. If they can’t agree, they can summon an uninvolved editor to weigh in, or file a “request for comment” and open the issue to wider debate for 30 days.If this fails and editors begin to quarrel, they might get called before the Arbitration Committee, but this elected panel of editors will also not decide who is right. Instead, they will examine the reams of material generated by the debate and rule only on who has violated Wikipedia process. They might ban an editor for 30 days for conspiring off-Wiki to sway debate, or forbid another editor from working on articles about Pacific islands over repeated ad hominem attacks, or in extreme cases ban someone for life. Everyone else can go back to debating, following the process this time.As a result, explosive political controversies and ethnic conflicts are reduced to questions of formatting consistency. But because process decides all, process itself can be a source of intense strife. The topics of “gun control” and “the Balkans” are officially designated as “contentious” due to recurring edit wars, where people keep reverting each other’s edits without attempting to build consensus; so, too, are the Wikipedia manual of style and the question of what information belongs in sidebars. In one infamous battle, debate over whether to capitalize “into” in the film title Star Trek Into Darkness raged for more than 40,000 words.Because disputes on Wikipedia are won or lost based on who has better followed Wikipedia process, every dispute becomes an opportunity to reiterate the project’s rules and principlesIn 2009, law professors David A. Hoffman and Salil K. Mehra published a paper analyzing conflicts like these on Wikipedia and noted something unusual. Wikipedia’s dispute resolution system does not actually resolve disputes. In fact, it seems to facilitate them continuing forever.These disputes may be crucial to Wikipedia’s success, the researchers wrote. Online communities are in perpetual danger of dissolving into anarchy. But because disputes on Wikipedia are won or lost based on who has better followed Wikipedia process, every dispute becomes an opportunity to reiterate the project’s rules and principles.Trolls who repeatedly refuse to follow the process eventually get banned, but initial infractions are often met with explanations of how Wikipedia works. Several of the editors I spoke with began as vandals only to be won over by someone explaining to them how they could contribute productively. Editors will often restrict who can work on controversial topics to people who have logged a certain number of edits, ensuring that only those bought into the ethos of the project can participate.In 2016, researchers published a study of 10 years of Wikipedia edits about US politics. They found that articles became more neutral over time — and so, too, did the editors themselves. When editors arrived, they often proposed extreme edits, received pushback, and either left the project or made increasingly moderate contributions.This is obviously not the reigning dynamic of the rest of the internet. The social platforms where culture and politics increasingly play out are governed by algorithms that have the opposite effect of Wikipedia’s bureaucracy in nearly every respect. Optimized to capture attention, they boost the novel, extreme, and sensational rather than subjecting them to increased scrutiny, and by sending content to users most likely to engage with it, they sort people into clusters of mutual agreement. This phenomenon has many names. Filter bubbles, epistemological fragmentation, bespoke realities, the sense that everyone has lost their minds. On Wikipedia, it’s called a “point of view split,” and editors banned it early. You are simply not allowed to make a new article on the same topic. Instead, you must make the case for a given perspective’s place amid all the others while staying, literally, on the same page.In February, the conservative organization Media Research Center released a report claiming that “Wikipedia Effectively Blacklists ALL Right-Leaning Media.” It was essentially a summary of a publicly available policy page on Wikipedia that lists discussions about the reliability of sources and color codes them according to the latest consensus — green for generally reliable, yellow for lack of clear consensus, and red for generally unreliable. ProPublica is green because it has an “excellent reputation for fact-checking and accuracy, is widely cited by reliable sources, and has received multiple Pulitzer Prizes.” Newsweek is yellow after a decline in editorial standards following its 2013 acquisition and recent use of AI to write articles. Newsmax, the One America News Network, and several other popular right-leaning sources are red due to repeatedly publishing stories that were proven wrong. (As are some left-leaning sources, like Occupy Democrats.) The New York Post (generally unreliable, but marginally reliable on entertainment) used the report as the basis for an editorial titled “Big Tech must block Wikipedia until it stops censoring and pushing disinformation.”The page is called Reliable sources/Perennial sources, as in sources that are perennially discussed. Editors made the page in 2018 as a repository for past discussions that they could refer to instead of having to repeatedly debate the reliability of the Daily Mail — the first publication to be deprecated, the year before — every time someone tried to cite it. It is not a list of preapproved or banned sources, the page reads. Context matters, and consensus can change.But to Wikipedia’s critics, the page has become a symbol of the encyclopedia’s biases. Sanger, the briefly tenured cofounder, has found a receptive audience in right-wing activist Christopher Rufo and other conservatives by claiming Wikipedia has strayed from its neutrality principle by making judgments about the reliability of sources. Instead, he argues, it should present all views equally, including things “many Republicans believe,” like the existence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election and the FBI playing a role in the January 6th Capitol attack.Last spring, the reliable source page collided with one of the most intense political flashpoints on Wikipedia, the Israel-Palestine conflict. In April, an editor asked whether it was time to reevaluate the reliability of the Anti-Defamation League in light of changes to the way it categorizes antisemitic incidents to include protests of Israel, among other recent controversies. About 120 editors debated the topic for two months, producing text equal to 1.9 The Old Man and the Seas, or “tomats,” a standard unit of Wikipedia discourse. The consensus was that the ADL was reliable on antisemitism generally but not when the Israel-Palestine conflict was involved.Unusually for a Wikipedia administrative process, the decision received enormous attention. The Times of Israel called it a “staggering blow” for the ADL, which mustered Jewish groups to petition the foundation to overrule the editors. The foundation responded with a fairly technical explanation of how Wikipedia’s self-governing reliability determinations work.In the year since, conservative and pro-Israel organizations have published a series of reports examining the edit histories of articles to make a case that Wikipedia is biased against Israel. In March, the ADL itself issued one such report, called “Editing for Hate,” claiming that a group of 30 “malicious editors” slanted articles to be critical of Israel and favorable to Palestine. As evidence, the report highlights examples like the removal of the phrase “Palestinian terrorism” from the introduction of the article on Palestinian political violence.Yet the edit histories show that these examples are often plucked from long editing exchanges, the outcome of which goes unmentioned. The “terrorism” line that the ADL cited was indeed removed — it had also only just been added, was added back shortly after being cut, then was removed again, added back, and revised repeatedly before editors brokered a compromise on the talk page.Breitbart, Pirate Wires, and other right-leaning publications now regularly mine Wikipedia’s lengthy debates for headlines like “How Wikipedia Launders Regime Propaganda,” accusing the site of being a mouthpiece for the Democratic Party, or “Cover Up: Wikipedia Editors Propose Deleting Page on Iran Advocating for Israel’s Destruction,” despite the article having just been created and the outcome being to merge the contents into the article on Iran-Israel relations. These reports are a dependable source of viral outrage on X. The strategy also appears effective at convincing lawmakers. In May, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) and 22 other members wrote to the Wikimedia Foundation citing the ADL report and demanding Wikimedia “rein in antisemitism, uphold neutrality.”The term filter bubble was coined by internet activist Eli Pariser, circa 2010.Alice O’Connor, better known by her pen name Ayn Rand, was a Russian-born American writer and philosopher. She is known for her fiction and for developing a philosophical system that she named Objectivism. Here are two black swans, but even with no black swans to possibly falsify it, “All swans are white” would still be shown falsifiable by “Here is a black swan” — it would still be a valid observation statement in the empirical language, even if empirically false.The August letter from House Republicans requesting information on attempts to influence the encyclopedia, data on editors who had been disciplined by Arbcom, and other records also cited the ADL report. While some search for bias in the minutiae of edit histories, others try to encompass all of Wikipedia. Last year, a researcher at the conservative Manhattan Institute scraped Wikipedia for mentions of political terms and public officials and used a GPT language model to analyze them for bias. The report found “a mild to moderate” tendency to associate figures on the political right with more negative sentiment than those on the left. The study, which was not peer reviewed, has become a regular fixture in claims of liberal bias on Wikipedia.The report still illustrates the challenges of evaluating the neutrality of a text as vast and stripped of subjective opinion as Wikipedia. An examination of the datasets shows that the passages GPT classified as non-neutral are often anodyne factual statements: that a lawmaker won or lost an election, represented a certain district, or died. It also conflated unrelated people of the same name, so, for example, most of the non-neutral statements about Mike Johnson concern not Mike Johnson the current Republican House Majority Speaker but a robber in a 1923 silent film, a prog-rock guitarist, multiple football players, and a famous yodeler. But the more fundamental question is whether balanced sentiment or balanced anything across the contemporary political spectrum is the correct expectation for a project that operates by a different standard, one based on measures of reliability. Supposing the sentiment readings do reflect a real imbalance, is that due to the biases of editors, biases in their sources, or some other external imbalance, like a tendency by right-leaning politicians to express negative sentiments of fear or anger (a possibility the report raises, then dismisses).Wikipedia has a long history of attempting to disentangle and correct its various biases. The site’s editor community has been overwhelmingly white, male, and based in the United States and Europe since the site began. In 2018, 90 percent of editors were men, and only 18 percent of biographies in the encyclopedia were of women. That year, the Canadian physicist Donna Strickland won a Nobel Prize, and people turning to Wikipedia to learn about her discovered she lacked an article.Women have been historically excluded from the sciences, underrepresented in coverage of the sciences, and therefore underrepresented in the sources Wikipedia editors can citeBut the causal connection between these facts was not straightforward. Women have been historically excluded from the sciences, underrepresented in coverage of the sciences, and therefore underrepresented in the sources Wikipedia editors can cite. An editor had tried to make an article on Strickland several months before the Nobel but was overruled due to a lack of coverage in reliable sources. “Wikipedia is a mirror of the world’s biases, not the source of them. We can’t write articles about what you don’t cover,” tweeted then-executive director Katherine Maher.Wikipedia’s sourcing guidelines are conservative in their deference to traditional institutions of knowledge production, like established newsrooms and academic peer review, and this means that it is sometimes late to ideas in the process of moving from fringe to mainstream. The possibility that covid-19 emerged from a lab was relegated to a section on conspiracy theories and is only now, after reporting by reliable sources, gaining a toehold on the covid pandemic article. Similarly, as awareness grew of the ways Western academic and journalistic institutions have excluded the perspectives of colonized people, critics argued that Wikipedia’s reliance on these same institutions made it impossible for the encyclopedia to be truly comprehensive.Not all the bias comes from the project’s sources, though. A study that attempted to control for offline inequalities by examining only contemporary sociologists of similar achievement found that male academics were still more likely to have articles. As volunteers, editors work on topics they think are important, and the encyclopedia’s emphases and omissions reflect their demographics. Minor skirmishes in World War II and every episode of The Simpsons have an article, some of which are longer than the articles on the Ethiopian civil war or climate change in the Maldives. In an effort to fill in these gaps, the foundation has for several years funded editor recruitment and training initiatives under the banner of “knowledge equity.”“Most editors on Wikipedia are English-speaking men, and our coverage is of things that are of interest to English-speaking men,” said a retired market analyst in Cincinnati who has been editing for over 20 years. “Our sports coverage is second to none. Video games, we got it covered. Wars, the history of warfare, my god. Trains, radio stations... But our coverage of foods from other countries is very low, and there is an absolute systemic bias against coverage of women and people of color.” For her part, she tries to fill gaps around food, creating new articles whenever she encounters a Peruvian chili sauce or African fufu that lacks one.Yet these initiatives have come under attack as “DEI” by conservative influencers and Musk, who called for Wikipedia to be defunded until “they restore balance.”If you think something is wrong on Wikipedia, you can fix it yourselfThese accusations of bias, familiar from attacks on the media and social platforms, encounter some unique challenges when leveled against Wikipedia. Crucially, if you think something is wrong on Wikipedia, you can fix it yourself, though it will require making a case based on verifiability rather than ideological “balance.”Over the years, Wikipedia has developed an immune response to outside grievances. When people on X start complaining about Wikipedia’s suppression of UFO sightings or refusal to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America, an editor often restricts the page to people who are logged in and puts up a notice directing newcomers to read the latest debate. If anything important was missed, they are welcome to suggest it, the notice reads, provided their suggestion meets Wikipedia’s rules, which can be read about on the following pages. That is, Wikipedia’s first and best line of defense is to explain how Wikipedia works. Occasionally, people stick around and learn to edit. More often, they get bored and leave.It was not unusual for skirmishes to break out over the Wikipedia page for Asian News International, or ANI. It is the largest newswire service in India, and as its Wikipedia article explains, it has a history of promoting false anti-Muslim and pro-government propaganda. It was these facts that various anonymous editors — not logged into Wikipedia accounts, so appearing only as IP addresses — attempted to remove last spring. As typically happens, an experienced editor quickly reinstated the deleted sentences, noting that they had been removed without explanation. Then came another drive-by edit: actually, ANI is not propaganda and very credible, someone wrote, citing a YouTube video. Reverted: YouTube commentary is not a reliable source. Then another IP address, deleting a sentence about ANI promoting a false viral story about necrophilia in Pakistan. Reverted again. Another IP address, deleting the mention of propaganda with the explanation that the sources were “leftist dogs and swine.”As the edit battle escalated, an editor locked the page so that only people who were logged in and had made a certain number of edits could make changes, ending the barrage of IP addresses.Two months later, ANI sued. The lawsuit revealed that several of the IP addresses had belonged to representatives of ANI attempting to remove unflattering information about the company. Blocked from doing so, ANI sued for defamation under a recent amendment to India’s equivalent of Section 230 that places stricter requirements on platforms to moderate content. When the Wikimedia Foundation declined to reveal the identities of three editors who had defended the page, the presiding judge said he would ask the government to block the site, threatening to cut off the country with the highest number of English Wikipedia readers after the US and the UK. “If you don’t like India,” the judge said, “please don’t work in India.”During the appeal, Wikimedia’s lawyer argued that disclosing the identities of editors would destroy the encyclopedia’s self-regulating system and expose contributors to reprisals. Also, he noted, the sentences in question, like every assertion on Wikipedia, were only summarizing other sources, and those sources — the publications The Caravan and The Ken — had not been sued for defamation. (As with editors, the foundation’s first response to external threats is often to explain how Wikipedia works.) The judge dismissed the argument, saying that journalism might be “read by a hundred people, you don’t bother about it… it does not have the gravitas.” Wikipedia, however, is read by millions.By this point the case had garnered enough coverage to warrant its own Wikipedia page. This seemed to enrage the judge, particularly the line noting that the judge’s demand to reveal the identities of editors had been described as “censorship and a threat to the flow of information.” This “borders on contempt,” the judge said, demanding that the foundation take the page down within 36 hours. In a rare move, the foundation complied.The case alarmed editors around the world. An open letter calling on the Wikimedia Foundation to protect the anonymity of the editors garnered more than 1,300 signatures, the most of any letter directed at the foundation. Nevertheless, last December, the foundation disclosed the editors’ identities to the judge under seal. Responding to outrage on Wikipedia’s editor forum, Wales asked for calm and urged people not to jump to conclusions.The Wikimedia Foundation has historically taken a hard line against attempts to influence the project. In 2017, when the Turkish government demanded several articles be deleted, Wikipedia refused and was blocked for nearly three years as it fought to the country’s Constitutional Court and won. For the second half of 2024, the most recent data available, the foundation complied with about 8 percent of requests for user data, compared to Google’s 82 percent and Meta’s 77 percent. And the data provided was sparse, because Wikipedia retains almost none.Instead of brute censorship, what has emerged is a sort of gray-zone information warfareBut attempts to influence the site have grown more sophisticated. The change is likely due to multiple factors: a global rise of political movements that wish to control independent media, the increased centrality of Wikipedia, and a technical change to the website itself. In 2015, Wikipedia switched to the encrypted HTTPS extension by default, making it impossible to see what pages users visited, only that they were visiting the Wikipedia domain. This meant that governments that had previously been censoring specific articles on opposition figures or historic protests had to choose between blocking all of Wikipedia or none of it. Almost every country save China (and Russia, for several hours) chose to not to block it. This was a victory for open knowledge, but it also meant governments had a greater interest in controlling what was written in the encyclopedia.Instead of brute censorship, what has emerged is a sort of gray-zone information warfare. After mainland China quashed protests against the Hong Kong national security law in 2019, a battle began over how the protests would be remembered. Editors in mainland China — which can edit using VPNs — argued for the inclusion of state-friendly media that described the protests as “riots” or “terrorist attacks” while removing citations to independent media for unreliability and bias. In one case, an editor attempted to strip all citations to one of Hong Kong’s premier papers, Apple Daily, hours before it was shut down by the government. By conspiring offline and using fake accounts, they won elections to admin positions and with them the power to see other editors’ IP addresses, which they discussed using to reveal their opponents’ identities to the police. Shortly afterward, the Wikimedia Foundation banned or restricted more than a dozen editors operating from mainland China, saying that the project had been “infiltrated” and that “some users have been physically harmed as a result.”Russia employed similar tactics after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. State media and government officials attacked Wikipedia in the press with accusations of anti-Russian bias, promulgation of fake news, and foreign manipulation. The site remained accessible, but Russian search engines put a banner above it saying it was in violation of the law. Meanwhile, the government harassed the foundation with a series of fines for publishing “false” information about the military, which the foundation has refused to pay. Finally, on the encyclopedia, state-aligned editors pushed the government’s view while vigilantes doxxed and threatened their opposition. Last year, the head of Wikimedia Russia was declared a “foreign agent” and forced to resign from his job as a professor at Moscow State University.In neighboring Belarus, editor Mark Bernstein was doxxed by a pro-Russian group in 2022, arrested, and sentenced to three years of home confinement. As many as five other editors have been detained by Belarusian authorities in recent months, according to media reports and editors.As these battles continued, the Russian government supported the creation of a more compliant alternative, called Ruwiki, which launched early last year with the copying of 1.9 million articles from the originals, edited to reflect the government view. On Ruwiki, edits must comply with Russian laws and are subject to approval from outside experts. There, the map of Ukraine does not include Donetsk or Kherson, the war is a “special operation” in response to NATO aggression, and accounts of torture in Bucha are fake news.The first large-scale anti-Zionist demonstrations in Palestine, March 1920, during the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration.

Pareidolia is the tendency for perception to impose a meaningful interpretation on a nebulous stimulus, usually visual, so that one detects an object, pattern, or meaning where there is none.The Old Man and the Sea is a 1952 novella by the American author Ernest Hemingway. Wikipedia remains online in Russia, but with Ruwiki, the government may now feel emboldened to block it. In May, at a hearing on media safety for children, the head of the Russian Duma Committee on the Protection of the Family said that the encyclopedia’s “interpretation of our historical events feels so hostile that we need to raise the issue of blocking this information resource,” and that the encyclopedia’s depiction of history is opposed to Russian “traditional, spiritual values.”The goal of these campaigns is what the Wikimedia Foundation calls “project capture.” The term originates in an independent report the foundation commissioned in response to the takeover of the Croatian-language Wikipedia by a cabal of far-right editors.In 2010, a group of editors won election to admin positions and began citing far-right alternative media to rewrite history. On Croatian Wikipedia, the Nazis invaded Poland to stop a genocide against the German people, Croatia’s role in the Holocaust is foreign propaganda, and Ratko Mladić was a decorated military leader whose conviction by the UN for genocide (briefly noted quite far down) was the result of an international conspiracy. When other editors attempted to correct the articles, the admins banned them for violating rules against hate speech or harassment.The encyclopedia became so warped that it began receiving press coverage. The Croatian Minister of Education warned students not to use it. In an interview with a Croatian paper, Wales confirmed the foundation was aware of the problem and looking into it. Yet the foundation has a policy of allowing Wikipedia projects to self-govern, and interfering with Croatian Wikipedia risked opening a door to the many governments and companies that want things on Wikipedia changed.Editors mounted a resistance and attempted to vote the admins out, but the admins defeated the attempt using votes from what were later revealed to be dozens of fake accounts. But because the admins were the only ones with the technical ability to trace IP addresses, the opposition had no way to prove this. The cabal now controlled all the levers of power. By 2019, nearly all of the editors who opposed them had been banned or harassed off the project.In 2020, one of the few remaining dissident editors compiled a comprehensive textual and statistical analysis of editing patterns of dozens of accounts and filed a request for an admin to run IP traces to see if they were sock puppets. The admin stalled, then attempted to fudge the traces, but did so in such a transparent way that it was clear the accounts were indeed fakes.This was the evidence required to procedurally break the cabal. High-ranking admins called “stewards” from other-language Wikipedias administered a new vote on banning the Croatian admins. This time, the admins lost. Their ringleader, username Kubura, was banned from all Wikipedia projects forever, a punishment that had been leveled against less than a dozen others in Wikipedia history. A local daily covered the incident with the headline “Kubura’s Downfall: Banned Globally, His Followers Retreat, Leaderless.”Wikipedia’s processes are only effective if they are administered by people who believe in the spirit of the projectThe foundation’s postmortem analysis compared the takeover to “state capture, one of the most pressing issues of today’s worldwide democratic backsliding.” The clique still cited the reliability of sources and invoked rules of debate, but it bent these processes to serve their nationalist purpose. As many governments have discovered, it is extremely difficult to insert propaganda into Wikipedia without running afoul of some rule or another. But what the Croatia capture showed is that Wikipedia’s processes are only effective if they are administered by people who believe in the spirit of the project. If they can be silenced or replaced, it becomes possible to steer the encyclopedia in a different direction.

One day he received a call from a member of the intelligence service inviting him to lunch. He cried for hours — everyone knew what this meant. The meeting was cordial but clear. They didn’t want him to stop editing Wikipedia. They wanted his help. They knew the encyclopedia has rules and you can’t just insert flagrant propaganda, but as a respected member of the community, maybe he could edit in ways that were a little friendlier to the government, maybe decide in its favor when certain topics came up for debate. In exchange, maybe the service could help him if he ever got in trouble with the police, for example, over his sexuality; he was gay in a country where that was illegal. He fled the country weeks later. He now edits from abroad, but he knows of five to 10 others who have faced arrest or intimidation over their editing. They must do constant battle with editors he believes to be government agents who push the state’s perspective, debating tirelessly for hours because it is literally their job. It’s a rare person who is able to uproot their life in the service of a volunteer side project. Understandably, many others faced with such threats become more cautious in their editing or stop altogether. Multiple editors based in India said that they now avoid editing topics related to their country. The ANI case had a chilling effect, as have recurring harassment campaigns. The far-right online publication OpIndia regularly accuses Wikipedia of “anti-Hindu and anti-India bias,” in ways that parallel attacks from the US right, down to citations of Manhattan Institute research and quotes from the disgruntled cofounder, Sanger. The organization has published the real names and employers of editors it accuses of being “leftists” or “Islamists,” leading at least one veteran editor to delete their account.Even ancient history can be cause for reprisals. In February, after the release of a Bollywood action film about Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, a 17th-century king who fought the Mughals, accounts on X began whipping up outrage over several facts on Sambhaji’s Wikipedia page that they deemed to be anti-Hindu. When editors reversed attempts to delete the offending lines, another X user posted their usernames and called on government officials to investigate them. Days later, local press reported that the Maharashtra cyber police opened cases against at least four editors.“If you issue cases and file complaints against editors, they tend not to edit those pages anymore”“Various editors have left Wikipedia over this persecution, fearing their own safety,” said an Indian Wikipedia editor who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation. “I believe this is completely useful for the right wing, if you issue cases and file complaints against editors, they tend not to edit those pages anymore, fearing for their safety in real life.”He still edits, but mostly sticks to the safer ground of the Roman Empire.In April, the Trump administration’s interim US attorney for DC, Edward Martin Jr., sent a letter to the Wikimedia Foundation accusing the organization of disseminating “propaganda” and intimating that it had violated its duties as a tax-exempt nonprofit.From a legal perspective, it was an odd document. The tax status of nonprofits is not generally the jurisdiction of the US attorney for DC, and many of the supposed violations, like having foreign nationals on its board or permitting “the rewriting of key, historical events and biographical information of current and previous American leaders,” are not against the law. Sanger is quoted, criticizing editor anonymity. In several cases, the rules Martin accuses Wikipedia of violating are Wikipedia’s own, like a commitment to neutrality. But the implied threat was clear.“We’ve been anticipating something like this letter happening for some time,” a longtime editor, Lane Rasberry, said. It fits the pattern seen in India and elsewhere. He has been hearing more reports of threats against editors who work on pages related to trans issues and has been conducting security trainings to prevent their identities being revealed. Several US-based editors told me they now avoid politically contentious topics out of fear that they could be doxxed and face professional or legal retaliation. “There are more Wikipedia editors getting threats, more people getting scared,” Rasberry said.The “little green men” were Russian soldiers who were masked and wore unmarked uniforms upon the outbreak of the Russo–Ukrainian War in 2014.The 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests (also known by other names) were a series of demonstrations against the Hong Kong government’s introduction of a bill to amend the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance in regard to extradition.

The site has sloughed off more than two decades of attacks, and so far the latest round is no different. The Heritage Foundation plan to dox editors has yet to materialize. Musk’s calls for his followers to stop donating have resulted in surges in donations, according to publicly available data.In India, the High Court struck down the order to take down the article about ANI’s defamation case, though the case itself is ongoing. Wikipedia’s critics on the right and in the Silicon Valley elite often propose generative AI as the solution to Wikipedia’s perceived biases, for each user a bespoke source of ideologically agreeable information. Yet all these projects remain wholly reliant on Wikipedia, and so far the most aggressive such initiative, Musk’s Grok, has spent much of its existence flailing between fact-checking Musk’s own conspiracy theories and proclaiming itself MechaHitler.But new threats continue to appear. In August, the foundation lost its case arguing for an exemption from the UK’s Online Safety Act, which would force Wikipedia to verify the identities of its editors, though it is continuing to appeal. In Portugal the foundation received a court order arising from a defamation case brought by Portuguese American businessman Cesar DePaço, who objected to information on his page about past criminal allegations and links to the far-right Portuguese party Chega. Complying with the ruling, the foundation struck several facts from his biography and disclosed “a small amount of user data” about eight editors. The foundation is now bringing the case before the European Court of Human Rights. And in the US, there is the recent House Oversight letter.No matter the outcome, these cases contribute to a general increase in pressure on the project’s already strained editors. English Wikipedia has fewer than 40,000 active editors, defined as users who have made five or more edits in the last month. The number of active administrators, crucial to maintaining the site and enforcing policy, peaked in 2008 and now stands at around 450. AI threatens to squeeze the editor pipeline further. The more people who get information from AI summaries of Wikipedia rather than the site itself, the fewer people who will wander down a rabbit hole, encounter an error that needs correcting, and become editors themselves. “Wikipedia should not be taken for granted.”At the same time, people are using AI to add plausible-looking but false or biased information to the encyclopedia, increasing the workload for editors. Harassment, ideological editing campaigns, government investigations, targeted lawsuits — even if they lead nowhere, they will make the prospect of editing more daunting and increase the odds that current editors burn out. “Wikipedia should not be taken for granted,” Rasberry said. “This is an existential threat.” The first reactions to the Martin letter on the Wikipedia editor forums were radical: the foundation should leave the US, maybe for France, or Iceland, or Germany. This would not be unprecedented, an editor pointed out. The Encyclopédistes fled to Switzerland when the ancien régime attempted to censor them. Maybe the site should go dark in protest. But moderation soon prevailed. “The community needs to chill on the blackout talk,” wrote an editor by the name of Tazerdadog. “We’re not there yet.” Right now, the best response to these threats is to double down on Wikipedia’s policies, particularly the refusal to be censored and its dedication to neutral point of view, they wrote. “I 100% agree with you, Tazerdadog,” replied “Jimbo Wales.” “Emphasizing to the WMF that NPOV is non-negotiable is not really the issue.” In fact, Wales wrote, he is chairing a working group on strengthening the policy. The initiative was announced in March, framed as a response to the global rise in threats to sources of neutral information, and to a fragmentation of the public’s understanding of the very concepts of neutrality and facts. Wikipedia’s response, it seemed, would be to neutral harder. In May, I met Wales for coffee at a members club in Chelsea where he had been granted an honorary membership after giving a talk. (Wikipedia, as journalists have noted for years, did not make Wales a tech billionaire.) Extravagant bouquets of pastel flowers were arranged in an arch above the doorway and festooned the tables of the interior. Wales, dressed to meet his wife at the Chelsea Flower Show, matched the decor in a green linen suit and floral shirt. He does not, he said, normally dress like a leprechaun. He was not particularly concerned about the attacks on Wikipedia, he said, though he warned that he is “pathologically optimistic.” Wikipedia has been attacked since it began. It fought Turkey’s ban to the Constitutional Court and won. Even Russian Wikipedia has proven resilient. In the US, the government lacks much of the leverage it has deployed against other institutions. Wikipedia doesn’t rely on government funding, and protections for online speech are strong. In the last fiscal year, the foundation took in $170 million in donations, with an average size of about $10.As for the accusations of bias, why not investigate? Whether the attacks are in good faith or bad, it doesn’t really matter, Wales said. The foundation had already decided that it was a good time, given the fragmented and polarizing world, to examine and bolster Wikipedia’s neutrality processes. Wales, leaning over the coffee table, seemed excited at the prospect. “If somebody turns up on a talk page and says, ‘Hey, this article is a mess, it’s wrong. It’s really biased,’ the right answer is to not scream at them and run and hide. The right answer is go, ‘Oh, tell me more. Let’s dig in. Where is it biased? How do we think about how do we fix that?’”Let’s figure out the best methodologies for studying neutrality, Wales said. Let’s look at how editors evaluate the reliability of sources. Maybe Wikipedia does use the label “far-right” more than “far-left,” Wales said, a criticism that has been leveled at the site. Is that because the media uses the term more, and does Wikipedia use the term more or less than the media does, and does the media use the term more because there are more far-right movements in the world today? “You have to chew on these things. There’s no simple answers.”But there are answers. If the social platforms and language models that increasingly shape our understanding of the world are inscrutable black boxes, Wikipedia is the opposite, maybe the most legible, endlessly explainable information management system ever made. For any sentence, there is a source, and a reason that that source was used, and a reason for that reason. “Let’s dig in,” Wales repeated. “Let’s assess the evidence. Let’s talk to a lot of different people. Let’s really try and understand.” Come, be part of the process. His working group is starting to discuss the best approach. The meetings, Wales acknowledged, have been very tedious so far.As for the letter from the interim DC attorney, Trump withdrew Martin’s nomination in May, though he still has a position leading the Justice Department’s retribution-oriented “task force on weaponization.” In any case, the Wikimedia Foundation responded promptly. “The foundation staff spent a lot of passion writing it,” Wales said of the reply. “Then they ran it by me for review, and I was ready to jump in, but I was like, actually, it’s perfect.” “It’s very calm,” Wales said. “Here are the answers to your questions, here is what we do.” It explains how Wikipedia works.An edit-a-thon is an event where some editors of online communities such as Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap (also known as a “mapathon”), and LocalWiki edit and improve a specific topic or type of content. The Quaker business method or Quaker decision-making is a form of group decision-making and discernment, as well as of direct democracy, used by Quakers, or members of the Religious Society of Friends, to organise their religious affairs. Wikipedia’s goal is to create a well-written, reliable encyclopedia like the Encyclopædia Britannica, except Wikipedia is much, much bigger: Britannica has about 120,000 articles, while the English Wikipedia has over 7 million articles.The Wikipedia globe.The Wikipedia Monument, located in Słubice, Poland, is a statue designed by Armenian sculptor Mihran Hakobyan honoring Wikipedia contributors.Socrates was known to steadfastly assume others around him were acting in good faith.Jimmy Donal Wales (born August 7th, 1966), also known as Jimbo Wales, is an American internet entrepreneur and former financial trader.

            <description><![CDATA[Engineers prove their technique is effective even with the lowest-cost WiFi devices]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[











Key takeaways




The Pulse-Fi system is highly accurate, achieving clinical-level heart rate monitoring with ultra low-cost WiFi devices, making it useful for low resource settings. 



The system works with the person in a variety of different positions and from up to 10 feet away.





Heart rate is one of the most basic and important indicators of health, providing a snapshot into a person’s physical activity, stress and anxiety, hydration level, and more.



Traditionally, measuring heart rate requires some sort of wearable device, whether that be a smart watch or hospital-grade machinery. But new research from engineers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, shows how the signal from a household WiFi device can be used for this crucial health monitoring with state-of-the-art accuracy—without the need for a wearable.



Their proof of concept work demonstrates that one day, anyone could take advantage of this non-intrusive WiFi-based health monitoring technology in their homes. The team proved their technique works with low-cost WiFi devices, demonstrating its usefulness for low resource settings.



A study demonstrating the technology, which the researchers have coined “Pulse-Fi,” was published in the proceedings of the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT).



Measuring with WiFi



Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Katia Obraczka and Ph.D. student Nayan Bhatia in the lab.



A team of researchers at UC Santa Cruz’s Baskin School of Engineering that included Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Katia Obraczka, Ph.D. student Nayan Bhatia, and high school student and visiting researcher Pranay Kocheta designed a system for accurately measuring heart rate that combines low-cost WiFi devices with a machine learning algorithm.



WiFi devices push out radio frequency waves into physical space around them and toward a receiving device, typically a computer or phone. As the waves pass through objects in space, some of the wave is absorbed into those objects, causing mathematically detectable changes in the wave.



Pulse-Fi uses a WiFi transmitter and receiver, which runs Pulse-Fi’s signal processing and machine learning algorithm. They trained the algorithm to distinguish even the faintest variations in signal caused by a human heart beat by filtering out all other changes to the signal in the environment or caused by activity like movement.



“The signal is very sensitive to the environment, so we have to select the right filters to remove all the unnecessary noise,” Bhatia said.




High school student Pranay Kocheta joined the Pulse-Fi project as a researcher through UC Santa Cruz’s Science Internship Program.




 Dynamic results



The team ran experiments with 118 participants and found that after only five seconds of signal processing, they could measure heart rate with clinical-level accuracy. At five seconds of monitoring, they saw only half a beat-per-minute of error, with longer periods of monitoring time increasing the accuracy.



The team found that the Pulse-Fi system worked regardless of the position of the equipment in the room or the person whose heart rate was being measured—no matter if they were sitting, standing, lying down, or walking, the system still performed. For each of the 118 participants, they tested 17 different body positions with accurate results



These results were found using ultra-low-cost ESP32 chips, which retail between $5 and $10 and Raspberry Pi chips, which cost closer to $30. Results from the Raspberry Pi experiments show even better performance. More expensive WiFi devices like those found in commercial routers would likely further improve the accuracy of their system.



They also found that their system had accurate performance with a person three meters, or nearly 10 feet, away from the hardware. Further testing beyond what is published in the current study shows promising results for longer distances.



“What we found was that because of the machine learning model, that distance apart basically had no effect on performance, which was a very big struggle for past models,” Kocheta said. “The other thing was position—all the different things you encounter in day to day life, we wanted to make sure we were robust to however a person is living.”



Creating the dataset




The researchers proved their heart rate monitoring technique works with ultra-low-cost, WiFi-emitting ESP32 chips, which retail between $5 and $10.




To make their heart rate detection system work, the researchers needed to train their machine learning algorithm to distinguish the faint detections in WiFi signals caused by a human heartbeat. They found that there was no existing data for these patterns using an ESP32 device, so they set out to create their own dataset.



In the UC Santa Cruz Science and Engineering library, they set up their ESP32 system along with a standard oximeter to gather “ground truth” data. By combining the data from the Pulse-Fi setup with the ground truth data, they could teach a neural network which changes in signals corresponded with heart rate.



In addition to the ESP32 dataset they collected, they also tested Pulse-Fi using a dataset produced by a team of researchers in Brazil using a Raspberry Pi device, which created the most extensive existing dataset on WiFi for heart monitoring, as far as the researchers are aware.



Beyond heart rate



Now, the researchers are working on further research to extend their technique to detect breathing rate in addition to heart rate, which can be useful for the detection of conditions like sleep apnea. Unpublished results show high promise for accurate breathing rate and apnea detection.

            A little game by the name of Hollow Knight: Silksong just released, and it has thrown platforms into chaos.
As you can see from images captured by the Eurogamer team, the likes of Steam was brought to a grinding halt as many flocked to get their hands on the highly-anticipated sequel.
Meanwhile, several of us have been unable to add the game to our carts across Xbox, PlayStation and Switch. The PS store, for example, is stuck on Wishlisted at the time of writing.

In the words of our Connor: "Steam it looks like every step has issues, trying to pay with Paypal is leading to error messages."
Are you having more luck than us?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Mike Cannon-Brookes, co-founder and CEO of Atlassian, speaks at the National Electrical Vehicle Summit in Canberra, Australia, on Aug. 19, 2022. Cannon-Brookes is urging Australia to show more ambition on climate action, even as the new government legislates plans to strengthen the country's carbon emissions cuts.Hilary Wardhaugh | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAtlassian said it has agreed to acquire The Browser Co., a startup that offers a web browser with artificial intelligence features, for $610 million in cash.The companies aim to close the deal in Atlassian's fiscal second quarter, which ends in December.Established in 2019, The Browser Co. has gone up against some of the world's largest companies, including Google, with Chrome, and Apple, which includes Safari on its computers running MacOS.The startup debuted Arc, a customizable browser with a built-in whiteboard and the ability to share groups of tabs, in 2022. The Dia browser, a simpler option that allows people to chat with an AI assistant about multiple browser tabs at once, became available in beta in June.Atlassian co-founder and CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes said he sees shortcomings in the most popular browsers for those who do much of their work on computers."Whatever it is that you're actually doing in your browser is not particularly well served by a browser that was built in the name to browse," he said in an interview. "It's not built to work, it's not built to act, it's not built to do."Cannon-Brookes said Arc has helped him feel like he can manage his work, with its ability to organize tabs and automatically archive old ones.But only a small percentage of people who used The Browser Co.'s Arc adopted the program's special features."Our metrics were more like a highly specialized professional tool (like a video editor) than a mass-market consumer product, which we aspired to be closer to," Josh Miller, The Browser Co.'s co-founder and CEO, said in a newsletter update. The startup stopped building new features for Arc, leading to questions of whether it would release the browser under an open-source license.Read more CNBC tech newsHuawei launches second trifold smartphone at $2,500 as it looks to cement comebackC3 AI reports declining revenue, announces new CEO to replace SiebelOpenAI boosts size of secondary share sale to $10.3 billionApple has survived Trump's tariffs so far.

OpenAI also held deal talks with The Browser Co., according to the report.Cannon-Brookes wouldn't specify whether Atlassian considered buying Google's browser. Last year, the U.S. Justice Department proposed a divestiture after a federal judge ruled that the company enjoyed an internet search monopoly."I'm not even sure if there is a bidding competition for Chrome," Cannon-Brookes said. "I didn't see Google putting up an auction just yet. Look, I think we focus on actually getting acquisitions done and actually making those products a part of a coherent whole and delivering value for our customers. I'm not sure that stunt PR acquisition offers are really our thing, but we'll leave that for them to do."Perplexity has been providing early access to its own AI browser, which is named Comet.The Browser Co. was valued at $550 million last year. Investors include Atlassian Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, Figma co-founder Dylan Field and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.The browser is central for those using Atlassian products, such as the Jira project management software, which shows existing support requests on the web. But the plan isn't simply to make it nicer to work with Atlassian products online."It's really about taking Arc's SaaS application experience and power user features, and Dia's AI and elegance and speed and sort of svelte nature, and Atlassian's enterprise know-how, and working out how to put all that together into Dia, or into the AI part of the browser," Cannon-Brookes said.watch now]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Managers and supervisors brace yourselves: calling the boss a dickhead is not necessarily a sackable offence, a tribunal has ruled.The ruling came in the case of an office manager who was sacked on the spot when – during a row – she called her manager and another director dickheads.Kerrie Herbert has been awarded almost £30,000 in compensation and legal costs after an employment tribunal found she had been unfairly dismissed.The employment judge Sonia Boyes ruled that the scaffolding and brickwork company she worked for had not “acted reasonably in all the circumstances in treating [her] conduct as a sufficient reason to dismiss her”.“She made a one-off comment to her line manager about him and a director of the business,” Boyes said. “The comment was made during a heated meeting.“Whilst her comment was not acceptable, there is no suggestion that she had made such comments previously. Further … this one-off comment did not amount to gross misconduct or misconduct so serious to justify summary dismissal.”The hearing in Cambridge was told Herbert started her £40,000-a-year role at the Northampton firm Main Group Services in October 2018. The business was run by Thomas Swannell and his wife, Anna.The tribunal heard that in May 2022 the office manager had found documents in her boss’s desk about the costs of employing her, and became upset as she believed he was going to let her go.When Swannell then raised issues about her performance, she began crying, the hearing was told.She told the tribunal that she said: “If it was anyone else in this position they would have walked years ago due to the goings-on in the office, but it is only because of you two dickheads that I stayed.”She said Swannell retorted: “Don’t call me a fucking dickhead or my wife. That’s it, you’re sacked. Pack your kit and fuck off.”Herbert said she asked if he was really firing her and he answered: “Yes I have, now fuck off.”The office manager then sued the firm for unfair dismissal.The hearing was told that under the terms of her contract, she could be fired for “the provocative use of insulting or abusive language”.However, this required she be given a prior warning. Only more serious breaches such as “threatening and intimidating language” would be gross misconduct and warrant summary dismissal.Boyes found that Herbert was summarily fired because of her use of the word “dickheads” and ruled that the company had failed to follow proper disciplinary procedures.She concluded that calling her bosses dickheads was not sufficient to fire Herbert and ordered the firm to pay £15,042.81 in compensation.In her latest judgment she also ruled it had to pay £14,087 towards her legal fees.]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Building MVT tiles from scratch]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ As I add more data to the NYC Chaos Dashboard, a website that maps live urban activity, I have been looking for a more efficient way to render the map.
Since I collect all of the data in one process and return the Dashboard as one HTML file, I kept wondering how I could
optimize the map’s loading time by pre-processing the data as much as possible in the backend. This is where vector tiles come in.
The code shown in this post is written in Go.
Why generate tiles?
Initially, all of the map’s data was passed to the rendering library in GeoJSON format (embedded directly in the HTML file).
For those who don’t know, GeoJSON is a JSON based standard to represent geographic information. You can go see the full RFC here,
but here’s a quick preview of what it looks like so you can get an idea:
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [-74.04452395542852, 40.68987850656795]
  },
  "properties": {
    "name": "Statue of Liberty",
    "status": "open"
  }
}
Now, I’m definitely not JSON’s greatest fan. It’s all text, meaning that a number is stored in a base 10 ASCII representation, where a number like 42 gets stored as "4" and "2".
I could go on, but I think you see the problem: it’s not the most efficient way to store data. Nonetheless, JSON has a lot of merits: it’s human-readable and easy to share between systems, so I find myself using it more
than I’d like to - more often than not, simplicity is the way to go, and a simple format like GeoJSON just gets the job done, and that alone makes it a worthy geographic standard.
So what happens when I start adding more layers to the map? It gets slow. I’m working on adding flood sensor data (thank you Floodnet for granting me access to the API), LIRR and MetroNorth data, NYISO power data,
and many more datasets which will start adding a lot of layers to the map. I can already see that the HTML file, at the time of writing, is 4.5Mb (once decompressed) and takes ~770ms to transfer from Cloudflare’s CDN to my browser.
This seems pretty reasonable for now, but it won’t scale as the future datasets are much larger, and running a quick check on the website, chrome is already telling me that the site has performance issues:

And if I look more closely, I can see that it’s the result of a long rendering (over 2s!), which I can see here:

Now, I suspect this is the result of a few things:

As mentioned above, all of the embedded data is GeoJSON. This means the rendering library (MapLibre GL JS) needs to parse the JSON. There’s a lot, with a lot of properties, so this takes time.
MapLibre GL needs to then take the coordinates and then place the lines, points and polygons on the map accordingly. This takes time, and it all happens on your browser.

I don’t like this - I want a map that people can use to check on the status of their city, and not a bloated HTML page that gets slower as more data gets onboarded, ironically making it less and less usable.
So, how can I display many large datasets on a map?
An obvious, and honestly wise, solution would be to simply load the GeoJSONs separately, via a GET request. You can do this simply in MapLibre:
map.addSource('resurfacing', {
    type: 'geojson',
    data: 'https://dash.hudsonshipping.co/data/resurfacing.geojson'
});
This is so much better than my current solution:
map.addSource('resurfacing', {
    type: 'geojson',
    data: {{.Geo.Resurfacing}}
});
{{.Geo.Resurfacing}} is the code in my HTML template that gets rendered in my Go process.
Loading GeoJSONs via a GET request will result in a lighter HTML file and a faster rendering of the Dashboard (the non-map components at least), but MapLibre still needs to parse that JSON and figure out how and where to plot the geometries.
This is still not optimal.
So how do big companies handle this? To display large amounts of data on map at scale and with performance, they use Vector Tiles, loading geometries sector by sector.
What are Vector Tiles?
Vector Tiles are small files that also represent geographic features, similar to GeoJSON. The key difference is that they represent a specific sector, a tile (thus the name), at a specific zoom.
That means if I want to display a map of the world with Vector Tiles, it will actually be a collection of square tiles pieced together.
Imagine taking a globe and cutting it up in multiple squares - that’s what vector tiles are (we’ll ignore distortion and projections for now, that’ll be a post for another time).
You may already be familiar with them when interacting with online maps, like Google Maps, where you can notice your features contained in squares, with some squares loaded before others:

MapTiler made a great demonstration of Tiles, showing the tile coordinates at different zoom levels.

Unlike GeoJSON where all features (point, line or polygon) of a layer are stored in one file, Vector Tiles (MVT) store features in smaller files that represent a specific area (at a specific zoom, or resolution).
In the above image, the points from the GeoJSON file are split into 3 tiles (tile 4 being empty).
So this is just a raster, then?
No, and this is where vector tiles get even more interesting. Like rasters, they represent data in a specific part of the world. But unlike rasters,
vector tiles don’t store an image, they store instructions. This is very, very similar (you’ll see just how much in the next section) to a JPEG vs an SVG.
This means vector tiles contain commands to draw layers and features that can then be customized in the rendering library:

Have a road you want to display as congested? Just set the line-color to red
Have a live event you want to display? Go for it, just add some custom animation to make the point pulsate


AS you can see in the above illustration, an Vector Tile file contains commands on how to plot the data using a local coordinate system, and not just a grid of pixels.
Ok, so how do I create one of these tiles and load it on a map?
Ok, this is the fun part - and it’s a lot easier than I first thought it would be. We’ll use the current
standard for vector tiles, which you may have glimpsed in the previous sections: Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT). MapLibre can handle this natively, and the documentation seems
pretty easy:
map.addSource('some id', {
    type: 'vector',
    tiles: ['https://dash.hudsonshipping.co/{z}/{x}/{y}/tile.mvt'],
    minzoom: 6,
    maxzoom: 14
});
So I need to have an endpoint that serves up MVT files for a given tile (x,y) at a given zoom z. That part isn’t too hard,
it’s a simple HTTP endpoint. So now, I need to actually be able to generate the MVT file.
Mapbox has done a great job documenting the spec, you can find it here.
I used this as the main reference for the project, as it contains everything you need to construct a vector tile. For all transformations, I simply used
the code made available my MapTiler.
An MVT represents information in binary format - this means it’s not human-readable, unlike GeoJSON. To generate the binary output,
Mapbox has opted for Protobuf. If you don’t know Protobuf, it’s Google’s standard to normalize structured data in a binary format with predefined fields and datatypes described in a .proto file. If you want to learn more about the project, I recommend checking this out. This is what the MVT proto file looks like:
message Tile {
        enum GeomType {
             UNKNOWN = 0;
             POINT = 1;
             LINESTRING = 2;
             POLYGON = 3;
        }

        message Value {
                optional string string_value = 1;
                optional float float_value = 2;
                optional double double_value = 3;
                optional int64 int_value = 4;
                optional uint64 uint_value = 5;
                optional sint64 sint_value = 6;
                optional bool bool_value = 7;

                extensions 8 to max;
        }
        message Feature {
                optional uint64 id = 1 [ default = 0 ];
                repeated uint32 tags = 2 [ packed = true ];
                optional GeomType type = 3 [ default = UNKNOWN ];
                repeated uint32 geometry = 4 [ packed = true ];
        }

        message Layer {
                required uint32 version = 15 [ default = 1 ];
                required string name = 1;
                repeated Feature features = 2;
                repeated string keys = 3;
                repeated Value values = 4;
                optional uint32 extent = 5 [ default = 4096 ];

                extensions 16 to max;
        }

        repeated Layer layers = 3;
        extensions 16 to 8191;
}
Ok, so looking at the proto, we can see that a tile is essentially an array of layers, each layer being able to contain multiple features.
To make this more understandable, here’s an example of what you could put in a tile:


Layer 1: Monuments

Feature 1: Statue of Liberty (type: Point)
Feature 2: Eiffel Tower (type: Point)



Layer 2: Airports

Feature 1: JFK (type: Point)
Feature 2: CDG (type: Point)



We’ll use this example throughout this section to construct a tile, and specifically focus on the Statue of Liberty. We can see that a layer represents a dataset you want to display on a map,
and a feature is a datapoint in that dataset. A tile can contain multiple layers, and thus multiple datasets. At a certain resolution,
we expect the Statue of Liberty to be in the same tile as the JFK airport, same for the Eiffel Tower and CDG, meaning they’ll be in the same MVT file.
Ok, so now we understand what’s contained in a tile. But how do you actually construct it?
Here are the steps required:

For a given zoom level, identify what tile (x, y) a feature belongs to
Create the tile and add the geometry
Add properties via tags
Return the tile via HTTP

1. Identifying the tiles
Let’s restate the problem we’re trying to solve: we have a GeoJSON file that we want to convert into multiple MVT tiles for performance reasons.
As stated earlier, to use MVT tiles in MapLibre we need to be able to return a response for:
https://dash.hudsonshipping.co/{z}/{x}/{y}/tile.mvt
So, this means I need to have multiple tiles generated in the backend, and return the correct one. But how do I know what tile each feature belongs to?
For example, when I am currently at zoom level 9, I can see that the the Statue of Liberty will be in the tile x = 150, y = 192:

And if I zoom to level 10, I can see that the Statue of Liberty will be in the tile
x = 301, y = 385:

To properly identify the tile, we need to do a few conversions. At this point, all of my geographic data is normalized to use EPSG:4326, a format most people are familiar with to represent coordinates. For example,
the Statue of Liberty’s coordinates in EPSG:4326, expressed in degrees, are:
longitude:-74.04452395542852, latitude: 40.68987850656795.
For vector tiles, the coordinate system used is called Web Mercator (EPSG:3857). In this system, expressed in meters, the
Statue is Liberty is located at:
x = -8242598.70274865, y = 4966705.869136138
So we need to convert the Statue of Liberty’s coordinates from degrees to meters, and then identify which square it belongs to at a specific
zoom level. This is pretty straight forward, so let’s get right to it.
Let’s finally get our hands dirty and write some code (please add proper error handling, this code is only for demonstration purposes).
First off, I want to convert my coordinates from EPSG:4326 (lon/lat) to EPSG:3857 (meters):
// We will use these constants throughout
const (
	EarthRadius = 6378137 // meters
	TileSize    = 512 // pixels
	OriginShift = 2 * math.Pi * EarthRadius / 2.0
)

func LonLatToMeters(lon float64, lat float64) (x float64, y float64) {
	mx := lon * OriginShift / 180.0
	my := math.Log(math.Tan((90 + lat) * math.Pi / 360.0)) / (math.Pi / 180.0)
	my = my * OriginShift / 180.0
	return mx, my
}
The spec refers to 4096 tile sizes, but MapLibre seems to use 512 pixels, so we’ll stick with this.
Once we’ve successfully written the function to convert our coordinates, we can now write the code to get the appropriate tile:
func Resolution(zoom int) float64 {
	// Returns meters / pixel
	initialResolution := 2 * math.Pi * EarthRadius / TileSize
	return initialResolution / (math.Pow(2, float64(zoom)))
}

func MetersToTile(mx float64, my float64, zoom int) (x int, y int) {
	res := Resolution(zoom) // meters / pixel
	px := (mx + OriginShift) / res
	py := (my + OriginShift) / res

	tx := int(math.Ceil(px / float64(TileSize)) - 1)
	ty := int(math.Ceil(py / float64(TileSize)) - 1)
	return tx, ty
}

func GoogleTile(tx int, ty int, zoom int) (x int, y int) {
	ty = int(math.Pow(2, float64(zoom))-1) - ty
	return tx, ty
}
Once we have these utility functions, determining the appropriate tile only requires a few lines of code:
mx, my   := LonLatToMeters(lon, lat)
tx, ty   := MetersToTile(mx, my, zoom)
gtx, gty := GoogleTile(tx, ty, zoom)
We use GoogleTile() because it seems MapLibre uses this standard (simply shift the origin to the top left). I couldn’t find documentation on it,
but I was able to see this behavior during my tests. I’ll update this part if I find the relevant documentation.
Here is what we now have:

mx and my are the point’s coordinates in meters, using the Web Mercator projection.
tx and ty are the tile coordinates in TMS format.
gtx and gty are the tile coordinates in Google format (also known as the XYZ format).

Great, we know what tile our feature belongs to for a given zoom. Let’s go create the tile.
2. Create the tile and add the geometry
Now that we know which tile a feature belongs to, let’s create the MVT file. You’ll need to install protoc for Go:
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
Go ahead and get the official .proto here: https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/blob/master/2.1/vector_tile.proto
Generate the struct:
protoc --go_out=./path/to/dir/mvt ./path/to/dir/mvt/vector_tile.proto
This will generate a vector_tile.pb.go that will look something like this:
// Code generated by protoc-gen-go. DO NOT EDIT.
// versions:
// 	protoc-gen-go v1.36.8
// 	protoc        v3.21.12
// source: internal/geo/mvt/vector_tile.proto

package mvt // Make sure to use the correct package here

import (
	protoreflect "google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect"
	protoimpl "google.golang.org/protobuf/runtime/protoimpl"
	reflect "reflect"
	sync "sync"
	unsafe "unsafe"
)

const (
	// Verify that this generated code is sufficiently up-to-date.
	_ = protoimpl.EnforceVersion(20 - protoimpl.MinVersion)
	// Verify that runtime/protoimpl is sufficiently up-to-date.
	_ = protoimpl.EnforceVersion(protoimpl.MaxVersion - 20)
)

// GeomType is described in section 4.3.4 of the specification
type Tile_GeomType int32

const (
	Tile_UNKNOWN    Tile_GeomType = 0
	Tile_POINT      Tile_GeomType = 1
	Tile_LINESTRING Tile_GeomType = 2
	Tile_POLYGON    Tile_GeomType = 3
)
// ...
Once we have generated the protobuf class, we can create an empty tile like this:
func NewTile(layerName string) *Tile {
    // The Tile struct comes from the generated protobuf
	version := uint32(0)
	extent := uint32(TileSize)
	layers := []*Tile_Layer{
	    {
	        Name:     &layerName,
	        Version:  &version,
	        Features: make([]*Tile_Feature, 0),
	        Extent:   &extent,
	    },
	}
	return &Tile{Layers: layers}
}
t = NewTile("monuments")
Great, we now have an empty tile. Let’s add our monument to ut, as a feature in the first layer called monuments.
A feature is defined by a few things:

A geometry type, in our case a Point
Tags (properties for that feature, which we’ll add in the next section)
A geometry

As mentioned earlier, a vector tile behaves similarly to an SVG file: you specify instructions to move a cursor. And that’s
exactly what goes into the geometry field: a series of instructions for a cursor.
Since our monument is a Point, we only have one instruction: move to location (x, y):

As you can see in the above example, we’re telling the cursor to move from the Origin to a specific part of the tile.
In this case, we’re letting MapLibre GL know to move the cursor 200 pixels to the right (x axis) and 75 pixels down (y axis).
But how do we get these instructions? Instructions are relative to the Origin of the tile, which is located at the top-left corner.
Coordinates go from 0 to 512 (the Extent of the tile, which we defined above).:

This means we need a few things:

Get the Web Mercator coordinates of the tile’s Origin
Calculate the offset, dx and dy for a given Point
Convert the offset in meters to an offset in pixels

Getting the tile’s origin is pretty straight forward:
func GetTileOrigin(tx int, ty int, zoom int) (minx int64, maxy int64) {
	res := Resolution(zoom)
	minX := int64(float64(tx) * TileSize * res - OriginShift)
	maxY := int64(float64(ty + 1) * TileSize * res - OriginShift)
	return minX, maxY
}
originX, originY := TileBounds(tx, ty, zoom)
Now that we have the Origin’s coordinates in meters, let’s calculate the offsets dx and dy:
dx := mx - originX
dy := originY - my
Finally, let’s divide the offsets by the resolution, expressed in meters / pixel, to get the parameters for the instruction:
res := Resolution(zoom)
shiftX := uint32(math.Floor(float64(dx) / res))
shiftY := uint32(math.Floor(float64(dy) / res))
We now have everything we need to construct our feature:
geomType := Tile_POINT
feature := Tile_Feature{
    Type: &geomType,
    Geometry: []uint32{
        1 & 0x7 | 1 << 3, // Command 1 (moveTo), count of 1
        (shiftX << 1) ^ (shiftX >> 31),
        (shiftY << 1) ^ (shiftY >> 31),
    },
}
The geometry is a little odd, but here’s what’s happening:

We pass in a slice of instructions, which is made up of a command followed by parameters
To place a Point, we use the command moveTo, to move the cursor
This command expects two parameters, dX and dY, which we pass in using zigzag encoding

We can go ahead and add this feature to our tile:
t.Layers[0].Features = append(t.Layers[0].Features, &feature)
3. Add properties
We now have a tile that meets the basic requirements:

1 layer
1 feature in the layer with a valid geometry

I now want to add the properties defined in the GeoJSON, in this case, the name and the status for the Statue of Liberty.
As with GeoJSON, you can store properties for each feature. So here, the status could be one of three:

open: Open for visit.
closed: Closed for visit.
maintenance: Closed for maintenance.

Adding the status open to the Statue of Liberty in GeoJSON looks like this:
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [-74.04452395542852, 40.68987850656795]
  },
  "properties": {
    "name": "Statue of Liberty",
    "status": "open"
  }
}
So, if I have 10’000 monuments, I’ll have 10,000 dictionaries like this:
"properties": {
    "name": "<Monument Name>",
    "status": "<Monument Status>"
  }
That means repeating open, closed or maintenance 10,000 times. Best case scenario, that’s 40,000 bytes (open 10,000 times),
and you probably want a unique name for your monument, so add another 10,000 strings to your file.
You can definitely improve this by shortening the status to something like o for open, and s for status, but this will only
get you so far as you scale (especially if you’re dealing with numbers, where these tricks won’t work) and add more properties and features.
Vector Tiles use a different approach: tags. In each layer, you define a set of keys and a set of values.
In our previous example, the keys would be [name, status] and the values would be [Statue of Liberty, open, closed, maintenance]:

So let’s add the known keys and values to our layer:
t.Layers[0].Keys = []string{"name", "status"}

SoLName := "Statue of Liberty"
StatusOpen := "open"
StatusClosed := "closed"
StatusMaintenance := "maintenance"
t.Layers[0].Values = []*Tile_Value{
    {StringValue: &SoLName},           // 0
    {StringValue: &StatusOpen},        // 1
    {StringValue: &StatusClosed},      // 2
    {StringValue: &StatusMaintenance}, // 3
}
Now that our layer knows what keys and values to expect, we can go ahead and set the property for the Statue of Liberty:
t.Layers[0].Features[0].Tags = []uint32{0, 0, 1, 1} // name: Statue of Liberty, status: open
If we wanted to update the status to inform users the Statue of Liberty is closed for maintenance, we would simply update the tags to:
t.Layers[0].Features[0].Tags = []uint32{0, 0, 1, 3} // name: Statue of Liberty, status: maintenance
4. Return the tile via HTTP
Our tile t isready to be returned to the frontend via an HTTP GET request.
To convert our tile to the MVT binary, simply use:
import 	"github.com/gogo/protobuf/proto"

out, _ := proto.Marshal(t)
out contains the []byte data that represents the .mvt file. Be sure to set the following header in your HTTP response:
"Content-Type" : "application/vnd.mapbox-vector-tile"
And there it is - a vector tile built entirely from scratch, using geographic information contained in a GeoJSON file.
When you’re using a map, you’ll almost always be visualizing more than one tile at a time, and zooming in and out. This means
each feature will be on multiple tiles, one per zoom level, so you’ll need to design a strategy to handle this. The below code is
a quick snippet of the implementation used for the Dashboard (some of the HTTP code is using an internal library, it can easily be replaced with
your own HTTP server implementation / library):
type TileMap struct {
	Tiles map[int]map[int]map[int]*Tile // [z][x][y]Tile
}

func NewTileMap() *TileMap {
	tiles := make(map[int]map[int]map[int]*Tile)
	for _, zoom := range Zooms {
		tiles[zoom] = make(map[int]map[int]*Tile)
	}
	return &TileMap{Tiles: tiles}
}

func (tm *TileMap) GetTile(z int, x int, y int) *Tile {
	if xyMap, zExists := tm.Tiles[z]; zExists {
		if yMap, xExists := xyMap[x]; xExists {
			if tile, yExists := yMap[y]; yExists {
				return tile
			}
		}
	}
	return nil
}
tm := NewTileMap()

// Generate the tiles here and populate the tile map using the above code
// ...

h.PublicHandler("GET", "/layer/potholes/{z}/{x}/{y}/tile.mvt", func(r *http.Request) web.HttpResp {
		z := r.PathValue("z")
		x := r.PathValue("x")
		y := r.PathValue("y")
		zInt, _ := strconv.Atoi(z)
		xInt, _ := strconv.Atoi(x)
		yInt, _ := strconv.Atoi(y)
		var out []byte
		if tm == nil {
			out, _ = proto.Marshal(mvt.NewTile("empty"))
		} else {
			tile := tm.GetTile(zInt, xInt, yInt)
			out, err = proto.Marshal(tile)
			if err != nil {
				// Generate an empty tile
				out, _ = proto.Marshal(mvt.NewTile("empty"))
			}
		}
		return web.HttpResp{
			Data:        out,
			StatusCode:  http.StatusOK,
			ContentType: "application/vnd.mapbox-vector-tile",
		}
	})
We’ve now created an HTTP server that returns MVT files on demand, as a user explores the map.
Did the performance improve?
After deploying the MVT tile server for my GeoJSON layers that contain points, this is what we get:

File size decreased to 3.7Mb (I mean, we removed GeoJSON data, so no surprise there), meaning the site now loads in 500ms
The paint time has decreased (by about 200ms, not bad for migrating just 2 datasets over), and the performance score went up by 8% according to Lighthouse:


I’m running this process off of a server in my office, and I use Cloudflare Tunnels to expose the site, which unfortunately means
the tiles don’t return very fast. This means I’m going to have to move this over to AWS, something I’ve been meaning to do, and I expect
the tiles to return a lot faster, hopefully sub 100ms.
I still have to move over the non-Point layers that are still GeoJSON, so I expect a big gain in performance there. More soon!
What’s next?
This simple example only focuses on Points. Implementing lines and polygons requires more work, as they can span multiple tiles.
I’ll put out a new post once I’ve implemented these, along with performance metrics of the Dashboard.
I’m also looking forward to seeing MapLibre tiles ready for production use, so I can generate MapLibre tiles
and get some additional performance gain and contribute to the MapLibre ecosystem.
I’m working on making the Go code open source in a small geographic library, which I’ll put on Hudson Shipping Co’s github.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Brioches and Knife, Eliot Hodgkin, 08/1961When people talk about the value of paying attention and slowing down, they often make it sound prudish and monk-like. Attention is something we “have to protect.” And we have to “pay”1 attention—like a tribute.But we shouldn’t forget how interesting and overpoweringly pleasurable sustained attention can be. Slowing down makes reality vivid, strange, and hot.Let me start with the most obvious example.As anyone who has had good sex knows, sustained attention and delayed satisfaction are a big part of it. When you resist the urge to go ahead and get what you want and instead stay in the moment, you open up a space for seduction and fantasy. Desire begins to loop on itself and intensify.I’m not sure what is going on here, but my rough understanding is that the expectation of pleasure activates the dopaminergic system in the brain. Dopamine is often portrayed as a pleasure chemical, but it isn’t really about pleasure so much as the expectation that pleasure will occur soon. So when we are being seduced and sense that something pleasurable is coming—but it keeps being delayed, and delayed skillfully—the phasic bursts of dopamine ramp up the levels higher and higher, pulling more receptors to the surface of the cells, making us more and more sensitized to the surely-soon-to-come pleasure. We become hyperattuned to the sensations in our genitals, lips, and skin.And it is not only dopamine ramping up that makes seduction warp our attentional field, infusing reality with intensity and strangeness. There are a myriad of systems that come together to shape our feeling of the present: there are glands and hormones and multiple areas of the brain involved. These are complex physical processes: hormones need to be secreted and absorbed; working memory needs to be cleared and reloaded, and so on. The reason deep attention can’t happen the moment you notice something is that these things take time.What’s more, each of these subsystems update what they are reacting to at a different rate. Your visual cortex can cohere in less than half a second. A stress hormone like cortisol, on the other hand, has a half-life of 60–90 minutes and so can take up to 6 hours to fully clear out after the onset of an acute stressor. This means that if we switch what we pay attention to more often than, say, every 30 minutes, our system will be more or less decohered—different parts will be “attending to” different aspects of reality.2 There will be “attention residue” floating around in our system—leftovers from earlier things we paid attention to (thoughts looping, feelings circling below consciousness, etc.), which crowd out the thing we have in front of us right now, making it less vivid.Inversely, the longer we are able to sustain the attention without resolving it and without losing interest, the more time the different systems of the body have to synchronize with each other, and the deeper the experience gets.Locked in on the same thing, the subsystems begin to reinforce each other: the dopamine makes us aware of our skin, and sensations on the skin ramp up dopamine release, making us even more aware of our skin. A finger touches our belly, and we start to fantasize about where that finger might be going; and so now our fantasies are locked in, too, releasing even more dopamine and making us even more aware of our skin. The more the subsystems lock in, the more intense the feedback loops get. After twenty minutes, our sense of self has evaporated, and we’re in a realm where we do, feel, and think things that would seem surreal in other contexts.Similar things happen when we are able to sustain our attention to things other than sex, too. The exact mechanics differ, I presume, but the basic pattern is that when we let our attention linger on something, our bodily systems synchronize and feed each other stimuli in an escalatory loop that restructures our attentional field.Almost anything that we are able to direct sustained attention at will begin to loop on itself and bloom.To take a dark example, if you focus on your anxiety, the anxiety can begin to loop on itself until you hyperventilate and get tunnel vision and become filled with nightmarish thoughts and feelings—a panic attack.And you do the same thing with joy. If you learn to pay sustained attention to your happiness, the pleasant sensation will loop on itself until it explodes and pulls you into a series of almost hallucinogenic states, ending in cessation, where your consciousness lets go and you disappear for a while. This takes practice. The practice is called jhanas, and it is sometimes described as the inverse of a panic attack. I have only ever entered the first jhana, once while spending an hour putting our four-year-old to sleep and meditating on how wonderful it is to lie there next to her. It was really weird and beautiful. If you want to know more about these sorts of mental states, I recommend José Luis Ricón Fernández de la Puente’s recent write-up of his experiences, Nadia Asparouhova on her experiences, and her how-to guide.Here is José, whose blog is normally detailed reflections on cell biology and longevity and metascience, describing the second evening of a jhana retreat:So I went down to the beach. “Kinda nice”, I thought. The sky had a particularly vibrant blue color, the waves had ‘the right size’, their roar was pleasant. I started to walk around trying to continue meditating. I focused my awareness on an arising sensation of open heartedness and then I noticed my eyes tearing up (“Huh? I thought”). I looked again at the ocean and then I saw it. It was fucking amazing. So much color and detail: waves within waves, the fractal structure of the foamy crests as they disintegrate back into the ocean. The feeling of the sun on my skin. I felt overwhelmed. As tears ran down my face and lowkey insane grin settled on my face I found myself mumbling “It’s... always been like this!!!!” “What the fuck??!” followed by “This is too much!! Too much!!!”. The experience seemed to be demanding from me to feel more joy and awe than I was born to feel or something like that. In that precise moment I felt what “painfully beautiful” means for the first time in my life.The fact that we can enter fundamentally different, and often exhilarating, states of mind by learning how to sustain our attention is fascinating. It makes you wonder what other states are waiting out there. What will happen if you properly pay attention to an octopus?3 What about your sense of loneliness?4 A mathematical idea?5 The weights of a neural net?6 The footnotes here take you to examples of people who have done that. There are so many things to pay attention to and experience.One of my favorite things to sustain attention toward is art.There was a period in my twenties when I didn’t get art. I thought artists were trying to say something, but I felt superior because I thought there had to be better ways of getting their ideas across (and also, better ideas). But then I realized that good art—at least the art I am spontaneously drawn to—has little to do with communication. Instead, it is about crafting patterns of information that, if you feed them sustained attention, will begin to structure your attentional field in interesting ways. Art is guided meditation. The point isn’t the words, but what happens to your mind when you attend to those words (or images, or sounds). There is nothing there to understand; it is just something to experience, like sex. But the experiences can be very deep and, sometimes, transformative.In 2019, for example, I saw a performance of Jean Sibelius’s 5th Symphony at the University Hall in Uppsala.Before the concert began, I spent a few minutes with my eyes closed, doing a body scan, to be fully present when the music began. As the horns at the opening of the piece called out, I decided to keep my eyes closed, so I wouldn’t be distracted by looking at the hands of the musicians. Then… a sort of daydream started up. The mood suggested to me the image of a cottage overlooking a sloping meadow and a thick wood of pines, a few hours from Helsinki. It was a pretty obvious image, since I knew that Sibelius wrote the piece at Aniola, which is 38 km north of Helsinki. But then I saw an old man walking up the meadow and into the house. The camera cut. Through an open door, I saw the man, alone, working at a desk. I saw it as clearly as if it had been projected on a screen before me: the camera moved slowly toward the back of the man.Through the window above his desk, I could see a light in the distance. Perhaps it was Helsinki? No, it felt alive, like a being—something alive and growing, something that was headed here. But then again, if you were to see a city from space, watching it sped up by 100,000x, it would look like a being moving through the landscape, spreading, getting closer. The old man sat there for a hundred years, watching the light. There was a sinking feeling in my body.One spring, birds fell dead from the sky. They littered the fields, whole droves of them filled the ditches—blue birds, red birds, and black. The man carried them into his woodshed and placed them in waist-high piles.The film kept going, and the emotional intensity and complexity gradually ramped up. For the thirty minutes that it took the orchestra to play the three movements of the symphony, I experienced what felt like two or three feature films, all interconnected by some strange emotional logic. In the third movement, a group of hunter-gatherers was living in a cave that reminded me of the entrance to a nuclear waste facility. A girl hiding behind a tree saw men with cars arrive…The structure of the music was such that it gave me enough predictability and enough surprise to allow my attention to deeply cohere. The melody lines and harmonies dredged up memories and images from my subconscious, weaving them into a rich cinematic web of stories. Guided by the music, my mind could tunnel into an attentional state where I was able to see things I had never seen before and where I could work through some deep emotional pain that seemed to resolve itself through the images.When the music stopped, I barely knew where I was.I opened my eyes and remembered that my brother was sitting next to me.“What did you think?” I said.“I don’t know,” he said. “I felt kind of restless.”Like always, the research for this essay was funded by the contribution of paying subscribers.

It can be read on its own.1In Spanish, you “lend” attention. In Swedish, you “are” attention.2It is not like 30 minutes is some ideal. Attention can, under the right conditions, keep getting deeper and more coherent for much longer, as attested by people who meditate for weeks. Inversely, you can, if you have a well developed dorsal attention network and low cortisol level etc, cohere to a high degree in a few minutes. (Though if you have a lot of stress hormones, thirty minutes will not be nearly enough to get out of a flighty mode of attention.) In other words, I don’t think you can put a precise number at it.Time to coherence depends on your starting place (mood, hormones, chemical make up in the brain), your skill, and the level of coherence you want to pursue. There is a famous study saying it takes people 23 minutes to get to full productivity after an interruption, which seems like it is correlated to the time it takes them to deeply cohere their attentional field. On the other hand, there is also an upper limit at how long you can cohere, which also depends on a bunch of factors. If I’m working on an essay, I notice that the quality of my thinking drops after about 20 minutes of sustained attention and I need to pause for a few minutes and walk around to get back up to full focus. So in my case, my deepest thinking seem to decohere before I even reach that infamous 23 minute mark! And after 3-4 hours, the quality of my attention goes down so much that everything I write ends up being deleted the day after. For more relaxed attention, like meditation, I haven’t reached the limit for how long I can deepen my coherence—after an hour, which is the longest I’ve gone, I’m still shifting deeper into attention.3Charles Darwin:[During our stay in Porto Praya,] I was much interested, on several occasions, by watching the habits of an Octopus, or cuttle-fish. Although common in the pools of water left by the retiring tide, these animals were not easily caught. By means of their long arms and suckers, they could drag their bodies into very narrow crevices; and when thus fixed, it required great force to remove them. At other times they darted tail first, with the rapidity of an arrow, from one side of the pool to the other, at the same instant discolouring the water with a dark chestnut-brown ink. These animals also escape detection by a very extraordinary, chameleon-like power of changing their colour. They appear to vary their tints according to the nature of the ground over which they pass: when in deep water, their general shade was brownish purple, but when placed on the land, or in shallow water, this dark tint changed into one of a yellowish green.The colour, examined more carefully, was a French grey, with numerous minute spots of bright yellow: the former of these varied in intensity; the latter entirely disappeared and appeared again by turns. These changes were effected in such a manner, that clouds, varying in tint between a hyacinth red and a chestnut-brown, were continually passing over the body. Any part, being subjected to a slight shock of galvanism, became almost black: a similar effect, but in a less degree, was produced by scratching the skin with a needle. These clouds, or blushes as they may be called, are said to be produced by the alternate expansion and contraction of minute vesicles containing variously coloured fluids.This cuttle-fish displayed its chameleon-like power both during the act of swimming and whilst remaining stationary at the bottom. I was much amused by the various arts to escape detection used by one individual, which seemed fully aware that I was watching it. Remaining for a time motionless, it would then stealthily advance an inch or two, like a cat after a mouse; sometimes changing its colour: it thus proceeded, till having gained a deeper part, it darted away, leaving a dusky train of ink to hide the hole into which it had crawled.While looking for marine animals, with my head about two feet above the rocky shore, I was more than once saluted by a jet of water, accompanied by a slight grating noise. At first I could not think what it was, but afterwards I found out that it was this cuttle-fish, which, though concealed in a hole, thus often led me to its discovery. That it possesses the power of ejecting water there is no doubt, and it appeared to me that it could certainly take good aim by directing the tube or siphon on the under side of its body. From the difficulty which these animals have in carrying their heads, they cannot crawl with ease when placed on the ground. I observed that one which I kept in the cabin was slightly phosphorescent in the dark.from:  https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9444Sasha Chapin writes: In late winter 2024, I noticed that I wasn’t living up to my stated policy of trying to accept every emotion passing through my system. There were certain shades of existential loneliness that I was pushing away. This was causing some friction. Solitude is simply part of my current life chapter, since Cate is more independent than any of my previous partners, and Berkeley is a place where I don’t feel at home socially.As a response, I made feelings of solitude the central focus of my practice. I tried to become like a sommelier, going out of my way to appreciate all the shades of loneliness that colored my afternoons, trying to zoom in on every micro-pixel and embrace rather than reject.Again—normal. This is what, for me, long-term practice often consists of: noticing when my reactions don’t line up with my principles, and seeing if I can bring myself into deeper alignment.However, I noticed something odd. Dropping the resistance to loneliness allowed me to slip into deeper sensations of flow. It was almost as if the emotional resistance had been preventing the emergence of a more intuitive part of my will. There were a few memorable walks I took where the feeling of solitude felt like a portal into an exquisitely smooth parallel world. When I allowed my emotions to pierce me more deeply, I fell into a different degree of cooperation with reality. Every step felt precise and necessary, like a choreographed dance.5Michael Nielsen writes about this in an essay where he describes the experience of pushing himself to go deeper than usual in understanding a mathematical proof:I gradually internalize the mathematical objects I’m dealing with [using spaced repetition]. It becomes easier and easier to conduct (most of) my work in my head. [. . .] Furthermore, as my understanding of the objects change – as I learn more about their nature, and correct my own misconceptions – my sense of what I can do with the objects changes as well. It’s as though they sprout new affordances, in the language of user interface design, and I get much practice in learning to fluidly apply those affordances in multiple ways. [. . .]After going through the [time-consuming process of deeply understanding a proof,] I had a rather curious experience. I went for a multi-hour walk along the San Francisco Embarcadero. I found that my mind simply and naturally began discovering other facts related to the result. In particular, I found a handful (perhaps half a dozen) of different proofs of the basic theorem, as well as noticing many related ideas. This wasn’t done especially consciously – rather, my mind simply wanted to find these proofs.6Chris Olah writes: Research intimacy is different from theoretical knowledge. It involves internalizing information that hasn’t become part of the “scientific cannon” yet. Observations we don’t (yet) see as important, or haven’t (yet) digested. The ideas are raw.(A personal example: I’ve memorized hundreds of neurons in InceptionV1. I know how they behave, and I know how that behavior is built from earlier neurons. These seem like obscure facts, but they give me powerful, concrete examples to test ideas against.)Research intimacy is also different from research taste. But it does feed into it, and I suspect it’s one of the key ingredients in beating the “research taste market.”As your intimacy with a research topic grows, your random thoughts about it become more interesting. Your thoughts in the shower or on a hike bounce against richer context. Your unconscious has more to work with. Your intuition deepens.I suspect that a lot of “brilliant insights” are natural next steps from someone who has deep intimacy with a research topic. And that actually seems more profound.No posts]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[A new technique can reshape your vision without lasers. Learn how electricity might change future eye surgeries.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[A new, promising technique has the potential to replace laser surgeries in ophthalmologists’ offices in the future, for a fraction of the cost. Called electromechanical reshaping (EMR), the technique offers a gentler approach to correcting the cornea than Laser-Assisted in Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK), today’s gold standard for treating vision issues including nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism.The eye develops these and other conditions when the cornea’s curvature is off—too steep, too flat, or too uneven. To solve the problem, surgeons generally use laser techniques such as LASIK to “sculpt” the eye surface by cutting away small parts of corneal tissue. The results can be life-changing, but the procedure has its risks, as LASIK permanently reduces corneal strength, raising the risk of new vision problems.Alternative nonsurgical methods such as specially designed contact lenses can temporarily mold the cornea, but these require nightly wear and can cause infection. Now, engineers and eye doctors are trying to find a way to permanently reshape collagen-rich tissues like the cornea without cutting, burning, or removing material.Brian Wong, a surgeon-engineer at the University of California, Irvine, stumbled upon a possible solution about a decade ago. He had long worked with thermal techniques for reshaping cartilage tissues—which include the cornea—but found a puzzling “Goldilocks problem” during his research: The heating needed to change shapes often killed too many tissue cells. Then a “happy accident” opened a different perspective, he says. “My postdoctoral fellow connected a pair of electrodes and a Coke can to a power supply…and out of spite, fried a piece of cartilage,” Wong recalls. The cartilage began to bubble, which the postdoc thought was from heat. “But it wasn’t hot. We touched it and thought, this is getting a shape change. This must be electrolysis,” he says. That surprise pointed to electrochemistry rather than heat as the mechanism. To explore further, Wong partnered with Michael Hill, a chemist at Occidental College. Together, they began exploring the chemistry behind EMR and testing it in different tissues. In mid-August, they presented results from their most recent tests at the American Chemical Society’s fall meeting that took place in Washington, D.C. How Electricity Reshapes TissueEMR uses small electrical pulses to split water at the tissue surface into hydrogen and oxygen, releasing protons that spread into the part of the corneal tissue that gives it structural integrity, the ability to hydrate, and other mechanical properties. Once protons are spread throughout the cornea’s surface, they disrupt the chemical bonds that hold collagen fibers in place, also changing the corneal tissue’s pH. This, Wong explains, is the moment when the cornea becomes moldable. Once shaped with a metal contact lens–like mold, it “locks in” to the new shape as the electric pulses are turned off and the body’s natural physiological response returns the cornea’s pH back to its normal value. In 2023, Wong and Hill coauthored a proof-of-concept paper in ACS Biomaterials Science & Engineering, showing that EMR could reshape rabbit corneas without compromising transparency. “That paper was really about asking, is it even possible? Can we change the shape of a cornea without gross damage?” Hill says. “Now, after two more years of work, we’ve systematically gone through the parameters—and we can say yes, it is possible, and we can do it safely,” he adds.Their team built custom platinum contact lenses, press-molded to precise curvatures, and connected them to electrodes. Mounted onto rabbit eyes immersed in a saline solution, the electrodes delivered pulses of around 1.5 volts. X-ray imaging tests confirmed the corneas had indeed matched the mold’s shape. Microscopy tests also confirmed the collagen tissue remained organized post-surgery. “Fine control is the key,” Wong observes. The cost of procedures using the new technique can be significantly lower than laser eye surgery, according to Wong. That’s because, unlike LASIK, EMR doesn’t rely on “laser platforms that cost as much as luxury cars.” The new technique could also be more affordable for clinics and regions priced out of LASIK. While the technique has a long way to go before being used in eye surgeries, the research is advancing to in-vivo animal tests to prove safety and durability—and for long-term tracking to ensure the results last. “Nobody’s getting this at the optometrist next year,” Hill cautions. “Now comes the hard work—refining parameters, confirming long-term viability, and making sure treated eyes don’t revert back,” he adds.That hard work, Hill adds, depends a lot on funding for basic science. EMR was born not from a targeted medical-device program but from curiosity-driven experiments in electrochemistry. “You don’t always know where basic research will lead,” Hill says. “We were looking at electroanalytical chemistry, not eye surgery. But those foundational insights are what made this possible. If you cut off that basic research, you don’t get these kinds of unexpected, transformative opportunities,” he adds.]]></content:encoded>
