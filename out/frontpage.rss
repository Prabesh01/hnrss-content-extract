            <description><![CDATA[The attack on Hamas leaders in Doha upended a decades-old assumption – and left Arab leaders questioning how much they can still rely on Washington]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[On Thursday, Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, led a funeral at the state mosque. Flanked by officials in white thobes, he prayed over six caskets – one draped in a Qatari flag and five bearing Palestinian flags.Israel’s strike on Hamas leaders in Doha on Tuesday, which also killed a Qatari officer, marked an unprecedented moment for the Gulf kingdom. The attack undercut the assumption that has underpinned Qatari foreign policy for three decades and reverberated across the Arab region: be useful to the United States, and it will protect you.Qatar has been useful. It has facilitated peace talks between Israel and Hamas, did the same with the Taliban and the US during the war in Afghanistan, and hosts the Al Udeid air base, the largest American military base in the Middle East.For decades the arrangement has held. The US supplied arms, parked its aircraft carrier in the Gulf and provided political cover internationally. The support has helped spare Gulf nations from the unrest that has consumed much of the Middle East, despite the rivalry with Iran.That changed when the US failed to stop the strike on Qatar this week, despite Israel being one of its closest allies. Donald Trump said he tried to give warning, but Qatar said it was only notified after the strike.Doha strongly condemned the strike, with al-Thani calling it “state terror” in an interview with CNN.“I have no words to express how enraged we are from such an action … This is state terror. We are betrayed,” he said.Although Trump tends to view international relationships as transactions, diplomats say that the strike has wounded the trust between the Gulf and the US that has existed since the 1930s.“This has real repercussions for the relationship,” said Patrick Theros, a former US ambassador to Qatar who helped build the Al Udeid base.“The Gulf states, beginning with Saudi Arabia, believe that their security and stability still depend on America. For them, preventing an Israeli attack on Qatar was a no-brainer – the US could have done it without barely lifting a finger,” he added.The message taken from the strike was not that Washington cannot control Israel, which it arms and equips to the tune of tens of billions of dollars, but it does not want to rein it in. Trump’s ability to call back Israeli jets on their way to bomb Tehran showed he has leverage when he chooses to.“The perception in the Gulf is that at worst is that the US didn’t want to stop Israel and gave it a green light, or at best, that it doesn’t care about the sovereignty of its Gulf allies,” said Yasmine Farouk, project director at the International Crisis Group.The reaction among Gulf states has been immediate. Despite past rifts with Qatar, its neighbours viewed the attack as an assault on all of their collective sovereignty.A flurry of diplomacy has followed, much of it spearheaded by the UAE. Qatar has welcomed Jordan’s crown prince, the UAE president and Egypt’s foreign minister. On Sunday, Doha will host an emergency Arab-Islamic summit.“The repercussions of Israel’s war in Gaza and its military campaigns across the region have been bringing the gulf states closer together,” said Farouk. “I think this will be a moment where they try to move from solidarity to action.”In the short term, there will likely be little change in Washington relations. The US still underpins security and economic order in the Gulf and a hasty breakup is not in the cards.But Gulf states may quietly start turning down American requests.Getting more Arab states to sign up for the Abraham Accords – Trump’s major initiative in the region – is farther off than ever. The relationship between the UAE and Israel is already on the rocks, with the former summoning the Israeli ambassador. US access to Gulf capital could also be in jeopardy.If the US has stopped holding its side of the quid pro quo, the Gulf could quietly re-evaluate the return it is getting on its investments. By the time the US notices, it might be too late.“It will be the little things being turned down, but they will accumulate. We won’t notice at first, but Qatar will stop taking chances on our behalf,” said Theros.]]></content:encoded>

He said the company discovered that the workers at the center of the raid were mainly employed by suppliers of LG.

                    From a tender wrapper of human life, the placenta, comes the extraction of a protein that points to a solution for something that, until now, science had no clear path to—and never one so celebrated: restoring the spinal cord in people who suffered injuries and lost body movement.Brazilian researcher Tatiana Coelho de Sampaio, PhD professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, has quietly worked with a team of biologists for the past 25 years on the repairing and multiplying power of the protein laminin, which acts on the nervous system.

The studies ultimately produced the current drug polylaminin, a world first, presented on Tuesday (9) by Cristália laboratory as capable of regenerating the spinal cord in people who suffered organ rupture in accidents of various kinds, leading to paraplegia—paralysis of the lower limbs—or quadriplegia—paralysis of both lower and upper limbs.






During the experimental phase of the antidote, which is applied directly to the spine, patients experienced full recovery of their conditions, with no aftereffects and resuming a routine without restrictions.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
    UTF-8 is a Brilliant Design
    2025-09-12
    


The first time I learned about UTF-8 encoding, I was fascinated by how well-thought and brilliantly it was designed to represent millions of characters from different languages and scripts, and still be backward compatible with ASCII.
Basically UTF-8 uses 32 bits and the old ASCII uses 7 bits, but UTF-8 is designed in such a way that:

Every ASCII encoded file is a valid UTF-8 file.
Every UTF-8 encoded file that has only ASCII characters is a valid ASCII file.

Designing a system that scales to millions of characters and still be compatible with the old systems that use just 128 characters is a brilliant design.

Note: If you are already aware of the UTF-8 encoding, you can explore the UTF-8 Playground utility that I built to visualize UTF-8 encoding.

How Does UTF-8 Do It?
UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding designed to represent every character in the Unicode character set, encompassing characters from most of the world's writing systems.
It encodes characters using one to four bytes. 
The first 128 characters (U+0000 to U+007F) are encoded with a single byte, ensuring backward compatibility with ASCII, and this is the reason why a file with only ASCII characters is a valid UTF-8 file.
Other characters require two, three, or four bytes. The leading bits of the first byte determine the total number of bytes that represents the current character. These bits follow one of four specific patterns, which indicate how many continuation bytes follow.



1st byte Pattern
# of bytes used
Full byte sequence pattern



0xxxxxxx
1
0xxxxxxx(This is basically a regular ASCII encoded byte)


110xxxxx
2
110xxxxx 10xxxxxx


1110xxxx
3
1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx


11110xxx
4
11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx


Notice that the second, third, and fourth bytes in a multi-byte sequence always start with 10. This indicates that these bytes are continuation bytes, following the main byte.
The remaining bits in the main byte, along with the bits in the continuation bytes, are combined to form the character's code point. A code point serves as a unique identifier for a character in the Unicode character set. A code point is typically represented in hexadecimal format, prefixed with "U+". For example, the code point for the character "A" is U+0041.
So here is how a software determines the character from the UTF-8 encoded bytes:

Read a byte. If it starts with 0, it's a single-byte character (ASCII). Show the character represented by the remaiing 7 bits on the screen. Continue with the next byte.
If the byte didn't start with a 0, then:
If it starts with 110, it's a two-byte character, so read the next byte as well.
If it starts with 1110, it's a three-byte character, so read the next two bytes.
If it starts with 11110, it's a four-byte character, so read the next three bytes.


Once the number of bytes are determined, read all the remaining bits except the leading bits, and find the binary value (aka. code point) of the character.
Look up the code point in the Unicode character set to find the corresponding character and display it on the screen.
Read the next byte and repeat the process.

Example: Hindi Letter "अ" (open in UTF-8 Playground)
The Hindi letter "अ" (officially "Devanagari Letter A") is represented in UTF-8 as:
11100000 10100100 10000101
Here:
The first byte 11100000 indicates that the character is encoded using 3 bytes.
The remaining bits of the three bytes:
xxxx0000 xx100100 xx000101 
are combined to form the binary sequence 00001001 00000101 (0x0905 in hexadecimal). This is the code point of the character, represented as U+0905.
The code point U+0905 (see official chart) represents the Hindi letter "अ" in the Unicode character set.
Example Text Files
Now that we understood the design of UTF-8, let's look at a file that contains the following text:
1. Text file contains: Hey👋 Buddy
The text Hey👋 Buddy has both English characters and an emoji character on it. The text file with this text saved on the disk will have the following 13 bytes in it:
01001000 01100101 01111001 11110000 10011111 10010001 10001011 00100000 01000010 01110101 01100100 01100100 01111001
Let's evaluate this file byte-by-byte following the UTF-8 decoding rules:



Byte
Explanation



01001000
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1001000 represent the letter 'H'. (open in playground)


01100101
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1100101 represent the letter 'e'. (open in playground)


01111001
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1111001 represent the letter 'y'. (open in playground)


11110000
Starts with 11110, indicating it's the first byte of a four-byte character.


10011111
Starts with 10, indicating it's a continuation byte.


10010001
Starts with 10, indicating it's a continuation byte.


10001011
Starts with 10, indicating it's a continuation byte.The bits from these four bytes (excluding the leading bits) combine to form the binary sequence 00001 11110100 01001011, which is 1F44B in hexadecimal, corresponds to the code point U+1F44B. This code point represents the waving hand emoji "👋" in the Unicode character set (open in playground).


00100000
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 0100000 represent a whitespace character. (open in playground)


01000010
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1000010 represent the letter 'B'. (open in playground)


01110101
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1110101 represent the letter 'u'. (open in playground)


01100100
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1100100 represent the letter 'd'. (open in playground)


01100100
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1100100 represent the letter 'd'. (open in playground)


01111001
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1111001 represent the letter 'y'. (open in playground)


Now this is a valid UTF-8 file, but it doesn't have to be "backward compatible" with ASCII because it contains a non-ASCII character (the emoji). Next let's create a file that contains only ASCII characters.
2. Text file contains: Hey Buddy
The text file doesn't have any non-ASCII characters. The file saved on the disk has the following 9 bytes in it:
01001000 01100101 01111001 00100000 01000010 01110101 01100100 01100100 01111001
Let's evaluate this file byte-by-byte following the UTF-8 decoding rules:



Byte
Explanation



01001000
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1001000 represent the letter 'H'. (open in playground)


01100101
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1100101 represent the letter 'e'. (open in playground)


01111001
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1111001 represent the letter 'y'. (open in playground)


00100000
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 0100000 represent a whitespace character. (open in playground)


01000010
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1000010 represent the letter 'B'. (open in playground)


01110101
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1110101 represent the letter 'u'. (open in playground)


01100100
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1100100 represent the letter 'd'. (open in playground)


01100100
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1100100 represent the letter 'd'. (open in playground)


01111001
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1111001 represent the letter 'y'. (open in playground)


So this is a valid UTF-8 file, and it is also a valid ASCII file. The bytes in this file follows both the UTF-8 and ASCII encoding rules. This is how UTF-8 is designed to be backward compatible with ASCII.
Other Encodings
I did a quick research on any other encoding that are backward compatible with ASCII, and there are a few, but they are not as popular as UTF-8, for example GB 18030 (a Chinese government standard). Another one is the ISO/IEC 8859 encodings are single-byte encodings that extend ASCII to include additional characters, but they are limited to 256 characters.
The siblings of UTF-8, like UTF-16 and UTF-32, are not backward compatible with ASCII. For example, the letter 'A' in UTF-16 is represented as: 00 41 (two bytes), while in UTF-32 it is represented as: 00 00 00 41 (four bytes).
Bonus: UTF-8 Playground
When I was exploring the UTF-8 encoding, I couldn't find any good tool to interactively visualize how UTF-8 encoding works. So I built UTF-8 Playground to visualize and play around with UTF-8 encoding. Give it a try!.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Launching Dear Greenpeace back in 2023When I launched Dear Greenpeace with my fellow youth climate activists alongside WePlanet two years ago, I had no idea just how quickly the anti-nuclear dominoes would fall across Europe. In 2023, and what seems like a lifetime ago, Austria launched their legal action against the European Commission for the inclusion of nuclear energy in the EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy. At the time they were supported by a bulwark of EU countries and environmental NGOs that opposed nuclear energy. Honestly, it looked like they might win.But today, that whole landscape has changed.Germany, long a symbol of anti-nuclear politics, is beginning to shift. The nuclear phase-outs or bans in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, and Italy are now history. Even Fridays for Future has quietened its opposition, and in some places, embraced nuclear power.This moment matters.It shows what’s possible when we stick to the science. The evidence only gets clearer by the day that nuclear energy has an extremely low environmental impact across its lifecycle, and strong regulations and safety culture ensure that it remains one of the safest forms of energy available to humanity. The European Court of Justice has now fully dismissed Austria’s lawsuit. That ruling doesn’t just uphold nuclear energy’s place in EU green finance rules. It also signals a near-certain defeat for the ongoing Greenpeace case – the very lawsuit that inspired me to launch Dear Greenpeace in the first place.But instead of learning from this, Greenpeace is doubling down. Martin Kaiser, Executive Director of Greenpeace Germany, called the court decision “a dark day for the climate”.Let that sink in. The highest court in the EU just reaffirmed that nuclear energy meets the scientific and environmental standards to be included in sustainable finance, and Greenpeace still refuses to budge.Meanwhile, the climate crisis gets worse. Global emissions are not falling fast enough. Billions of people still lack access to clean, reliable electricity. And we are forced to spend time defending proven solutions instead of scaling them.Announcing our inclusion in the case between Greenpeace and the EU CommissionIt’s now up to the court whether we will get our time in court to outline the evidence in support of nuclear energy and the important role it can play in the global clean energy transition. Whether in court, on the streets, or in the halls of parliaments across the globe, we will be there to defend the science and ensure that nuclear power can spread the advantages of the modern world across the planet in a sustainable, reliable and dignified way.Austria stands increasingly isolated among a handful of countries that still cling to their opposition to nuclear energy. Their defeat in this vital high stakes topic is a success not just for the nuclear movement, but for the global transition as a whole. We have made real progress. Together, we’ve helped defend nuclear power in the EU, overturned outdated policies at the World Bank, and secured more technology-neutral language at the UN. These wins are not abstract. They open the door to real investment, real projects, and real emissions cuts.But the work is not done.We still need to overturn national nuclear bans, unlock more funding, and push democratic countries to support clean energy development abroad: especially where it is most needed to compete with Russia’s growing influence.The fight will not be done until every single country in the world can boast a clean, reliable energy grid, ready to maintain a modern dignified standard of living, for everyone, everywhere.This is a great success for the movement and it would not have been possible without the financial support, time and energy given by people like you.In Solidarity,

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[

The last 10 days have brought a string of patent wins for Nintendo. Yesterday, the company was granted US patent 12,409,387, a patent covering riding and flying systems similar to those Nintendo has been criticized for claiming in its Palworld lawsuit (via Gamesfray). Last week, however, Nintendo received a more troubling weapon in its legal arsenal: US patent 12,403,397, a patent on summoning and battling characters that the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted with alarmingly little resistance.According to videogame patent lawyer Kirk Sigmon, the USPTO granting Nintendo these latest patents isn't just a moment of questionable legal theory. It's an indictment of American patent law."Broadly, I don't disagree with the many online complaints about these Nintendo patents," said Sigmon, whose opinions do not represent those of his firm and clients. "They have been an embarrassing failure of the US patent system." 


(Image credit: Nintendo, USPTO)Sigmon, who we spoke with last year about the claims and potential consequences of Nintendo's Palworld lawsuit, said both this week's '387 patent and last week's '397 represent procedural irregularities in the decisionmaking of US patent officials. And thanks to those irregularities, Nintendo has yet more tools to bully its competitors.The '387 patent granted this week, Sigmon told PC Gamer, "got a bit of push-back, but barely." After its initial application was deemed invalid due to similarities to existing Tencent and Xbox-related patents, Nintendo amended its claims based on interviews with the USPTO, which then determined that the claims were allowable "for substantially the same reasons as parent application(s).""That parent case," Sigmon said, "had an even weirder and much less useful prosecution history." 


(Image credit: Nintendo, USPTO)Most of the claims made in the '387 patent's single parent case, US Pat. No. 12,246,255, were immediately allowed by the USPTO, which Sigmon said is "a very unusual result: most claims are rejected at least once." When the claims were ultimately allowed, the only reasoning the USPTO offered was a block quote of text from the claims themselves."This seems like a situation where the USPTO essentially gave up and just allowed the case, assuming that the claims were narrow or specific enough to be new without evaluating them too closely," Sigmon said. "I strongly disagree with this result: In my view, these claims were in no way allowable."Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.To Sigmon, an IP attorney with extensive experience in prosecuting and teaching patent law, the '387 patent and its parent case rely on concepts and decisions that would have been obvious to a "Person of Ordinary Skill in the Art"—a legal construct that holds if a patent's claims would reasonably occur to a practitioner in the relevant field based on prior art, those claims aren't patentable. 


(Image credit: Nintendo, USPTO)The '397 patent granted last week is even more striking. It's a patent on summoning and battling with "sub-characters," using specific language suggesting it's based on the Let's Go! mechanics in the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet games. Despite its relevance to a conceit in countless games—calling characters to battle enemies for you—it was allowed without any pushback whatsoever from the USPTO, which Sigmon said is essentially unheard of."Like the above case, the reasons for allowance don't give us even a hint of why it was allowed: the Examiner just paraphrases the claims (after block quoting them) without explaining why the claims are allowed over the prior art," Sigmon said. "This is extremely unusual and raises a large number of red flags."According to Sigmon, USPTO records show that the allowance of the '397 patent was based on a review of a relatively miniscule number of documents: 16 US patents, seven Japanese patents, and—apparently—one article from Pokemon.com. 


(Image credit: Nintendo, USPTO)"I have no earthly idea how the Examiner could, in good faith, allow this application so quickly," Sigmon said.Admittedly, the '397 case was originally filed as a Japanese patent application, which would allow the Examiner to use the existing progress in the Japanese case as a starting point for their review. But, Sigmon said, "even that doesn't excuse this quick allowance.""This allowance should not have happened, full stop," he said.On paper, the patent might not seem like a threat to Nintendo's competitors: The claims as constructed in the '397 outline a very specific sequence of events and inputs, and patent claims must be met word-for-word to be infringed."Pragmatically speaking, though, it's not impossible to be sued for patent infringement even when a claim infringement argument is weak, and bad patents like this cast a massive shadow on the industry," Sigmon said.For a company at Nintendo's scale, the claims of the '397 patent don't need to make for a strong argument that would hold up in court. The threat of a lawsuit can stifle competition well enough on its own when it would cost millions of dollars to defend against. 


(Image credit: Nintendo, USPTO)"In my opinion, none of the three patents I've discussed here should have been allowed. It's shocking and offensive that they were," Sigmon said. "The USPTO dropped the ball big time, and it's going to externalize a lot of uncertainty (and, potentially, litigation cost) onto developers and companies that do not deserve it."Sigmon, who says he's helped inventors protect their inventions from IP theft perpetrated by major companies, insists that the patent system still has merit. "That's the kind of thing that patents are meant to do," he said. "They were not made to allow a big player to game the system, get an overly broad patent that they should have never received in the first place, and then go around bullying would-be competition with the threat of a legally questionable lawsuit."Unfortunately, Nintendo has gained these patents at a moment when the USPTO has made challenging bad patents more difficult. Currently, US patent officials under USPTO Acting Director Coke Morgan Stewart have been refusing to hear a huge number of Inter Partes Review cases—special proceedings in which parties can argue that a patent should never have been granted—for "discretionary" reasons."Realistically, this means that patent validity issues are being relegated to lawsuits: not a good situation, as that often entails millions of dollars in costs and a lot of risk," Sigmon said. "In practice, this means that bad patents get to fester on the market for longer and provide a bigger threat for the industry as a whole."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
				Even if you’ve been doing JavaScript for a while, you might be surprised to learn that setTimeout(0) is not really setTimeout(0). Instead, it could run 4 milliseconds later:
const start = performance.now()
setTimeout(() => {
  // Likely 4ms
  console.log(performance.now() - start)
}, 0)

Nearly a decade ago when I was on the Microsoft Edge team, it was explained to me that browsers did this to avoid “abuse.” I.e. there are a lot of websites out there that spam setTimeout, so to avoid draining the user’s battery or blocking interactivity, browsers set a special “clamped” minimum of 4ms.
This also explains why some browsers would bump the throttling for devices on battery power (16ms in the case of legacy Edge), or throttle even more aggressively for background tabs (1 second in Chrome!).
One question always vexed me, though: if setTimeout was so abused, then why did browsers keep introducing new timers like setImmediate (RIP), Promises, or even new fanciness like scheduler.postTask()? If setTimeout had to be nerfed, then wouldn’t these timers suffer the same fate eventually?
I wrote a long post about JavaScript timers back in 2018, but until recently I didn’t have a good reason to revisit this question. Then I was doing some work on fake-indexeddb, which is a pure-JavaScript implementation of the IndexedDB API, and this question reared its head. As it turns out, IndexedDB wants to auto-commit transactions when there’s no outstanding work in the event loop – in other words, after all microtasks have finished, but before any tasks (can I cheekily say “macro-tasks”?) have started.
To accomplish this, fake-indexeddb was using setImmediate in Node.js (which shares some similarities with the legacy browser version) and setTimeout in the browser. In Node, setImmediate is kind of perfect, because it runs after microtasks but immediately before any other tasks, and without clamping. In the browser, though, setTimeout is pretty sub-optimal: in one benchmark, I was seeing Chrome take 4.8 seconds for something that only took 300 milliseconds in Node (a 16x slowdown!).
Looking out at the timer landscape in 2025, though, it wasn’t obvious what to choose. Some options included:

setImmediate – only supported in legacy Edge and IE, so that’s a no-go.
MessageChannel.postMessage – this is the technique used by afterframe.
window.postMessage – a nice idea, but kind of janky since it might interfere with other scripts on the page using the same API. This approach is used by the setImmediate polyfill though.
scheduler.postTask – if you read no further, this was the winner. But let’s explain why!

To compare these options, I wrote a quick benchmark. A few important things about this benchmark:

You have to run several iterations of setTimeout (and friends) to really suss out the clamping. Technically, per the HTML specification, the 4ms clamping is only supposed to kick in after a setTimeout has been nested (i.e. one setTimeout calls another) 5 times.
I didn’t test every possible combination of 1) battery vs plugged in, 2) monitor refresh rates, 3) background vs foreground tabs, etc., even though I know all of these things can affect the clamping. I have a life, and although it’s fun to don the lab coat and run some experiments, I don’t want to spend my entire Saturday doing that.

In any case, here are the numbers (in milliseconds, median of 101 iterations, on a 2021 16-inch MacBook Pro):



Browser
setTimeout
MessageChannel
window
scheduler.postTask




Chrome 139
4.2
0.05
0.03
0.00


Firefox 142
4.72
0.02
0.01
0.01


Safari 18.4
26.73
0.52
0.05
Not implemented




Don’t worry about the precise numbers too much: the point is that Chrome and Firefox clamp setTimeout to 4ms, and the other three options are roughly equivalent. In Safari, interestingly, setTimeout is even more heavily throttled, and MessageChannel.postMessage is a tad slower than window.postMessage (although window.postMessage is still janky for the reasons listed above).
This experiment answered my immediate question: fake-indexeddb should use scheduler.postTask (which I prefer for its ergonomics) and fall back to either MessageChannel.postMessage or window.postMessage. (I did experiment with different priorities for postTask, but they all performed almost identically. For fake-indexeddb‘s use case, the default priority of 'user-visible' seemed most appropriate, and that’s what the benchmark uses.)
None of this answered my original question, though: why exactly do browsers bother to throttle setTimeout if web developers can just use scheduler.postTask or MessageChannel instead? I asked my friend Todd Reifsteck, who was co-chair of the Web Performance Working Group back when a lot of these discussions about “interventions” were underway.
He said that there were effectively two camps: one camp felt that timers needed to be throttled to protect web devs from themselves, whereas the other camp felt that developers should “measure their own silliness,” and that any subtle throttling heuristics would just cause confusion. In short, it was the standard tradeoff in designing performance APIs: “some APIs are quick but come with footguns.”
This jives with my own intuitions on the topic. Browser interventions are usually put in place because web developers have either used too much of a good thing (e.g. setTimeout), or were blithely unaware of better options (the touch listener controversy is a good example). In the end, the browser is a “user agent” acting on the user’s behalf, and the W3C’s priority of constituencies makes it clear that end-user needs always trump web developer needs.
That said, web developers often do want to do the right thing. (I consider this blog post an attempt in that direction.) We just don’t always have the tools to do it, so instead we grab whatever blunt instrument is nearby and start swinging. Giving us more control over tasks and scheduling could avoid the need to hammer away with setTimeout and cause a mess that calls for an intervention.
My prediction is that postTask/postMessage will remain unthrottled for the time being. Out of Todd’s two “camps,” the very existence of the Scheduler API, which offers a whole slew of fine-grained tools for task scheduling, seems to point toward the “pro-control” camp as the one currently steering the ship. Although Todd sees the API more as a compromise between the two groups: yes, it offers a lot of control, but it also aligns with the browser’s actual rendering pipeline rather than random timeouts.
The pessimist in me wonders, though, if the API could still be abused – e.g. by carelessly using the user-blocking priority everywhere. Perhaps in the future, some enterprising browser vendor will put their foot more firmly on the throttle (so to speak) and discover that it causes websites to be snappier, more responsive, and less battery-draining. If that happens, then we may see another round of interventions. (Maybe we’ll need a scheduler2 API to dig ourselves out of that mess!)
I’m not involved much in web standards anymore and can only speculate. For the time being, I’ll just do what most web devs do: choose whatever API accomplishes my goals today, and hope that browsers don’t change too much in the future. As long as we’re careful and don’t introduce too much “silliness,” I don’t think that’s a lot to ask.
Thanks to Todd Reifsteck for feedback on a draft of this post.

I host a bunch of hobby code on my server. I would think it’s really only interesting to me, but it turns out every day, thousands of people from all over the world are digging through my code, reviewing years old changesets. On the one hand, wow, thanks, this is very flattering. On the other hand, what the heck is wrong with you?This has been building up for a while, and I’ve been intermittently developing and deploying countermeasures. It’s been a lot like solving a sliding block puzzle. Lots of small moves and changes, and eventually it starts coming together.My primary principle is that I’d rather not annoy real humans more than strictly intended. If there’s a challenge, it shouldn’t be too difficult, but ideally, we want to minimize the number of challenges presented. You should never suspect that I suspected you of being an enemy agent.First measure is we only challenge on the deep URLs. So, for instance, I can link to the anticrawl repo no problem, or even the source for anticrawl.go, and that’ll be served immediately. All the pages any casual browser would visit make up less than 1% of the possible URLs that exist, but probably contain 99% of the interesting content.Also, these pages get cached by the reverse proxy first, so anticrawl doesn’t even evaluate them. We’ve already done the work to render the page, and we’re trying to shed load, so why would I want to increase load by generating challenges and verifying responses? It annoys me when I click a seemingly popular blog post and immediately get challenged, when I’m 99.9% certain that somebody else clicked it two seconds before me. Why isn’t it in cache? We must have different objectives in what we’re trying to accomplish. Or who we’re trying to irritate.The next step is that anybody loading style.css gets marked friendly. Big Basilisk doesn’t care about my artisanal styles, but most everybody else loves them. So if you start at a normal page, and then start clicking deeper, that’s fine, still no challenge. (Sorry lynx browsers, but don’t worry, it’s not game over for you yet.)And then let’s say somebody directly links to a changeset like /r/vertigo/v/b5ea481ff167. The first visitor will probably hit a challenge, but then we record that URL as in use. The bots are shotgun crawling all over the place, but if a single link is visited more than once, I’ll assume it’s human traffic, and bypass the challenge. No promises, but clicking that link will mostly likely just return content, no challenge.The very first version of anticrawl relied on a weak POW challenge (find a SHA hash with first byte 42), just to get something launched, but this does seem counter intuitive. Why are we making humans solve a challenge optimized for machines? Instead I have switched to a much more diabolical challenge. You are asked how many Rs in strawberry. Or maybe something else. To be changed as necessary. But really, the key observation is that any challenge, anything at all, easily sheds like 99.99% of the crawling load.Notably, because the challenge does not include its own javascript solver, even a smart crawler isn’t going to solve it automatically. If you include the solution on the challenge page, at least some bots are going to use it. All anticrawl challenges now require some degree of contemplation, not just blind interpretation.It took a few iterations because the actual deployment involves a few pieces. I had to reduce the style.css cache time, so that visitors would periodically refresh it (and thus their humanity). And then exclude it from the caching proxy, so that the request would be properly observed. Basically, a few minutes tinkering now and then while I wait for my latte to arrive, and now I think I’ve gotten things to the point where it’s unlikely to burden anybody except malignant crawlers.elsewhereI have focused my bot detection efforts on humungus because the ratio of crawler to legit traffic was out of control. But now that I know what to look for, I see the same patterns scraping everywhere else. Seems really unlikely a worldwide colelctive of Opera users is suddenly interested in my old honks. I’m starting to deploy similar countermeasures.appendixSome log samples. There’s always somebody to insist these could be real humans, and I have somehow misjudged them.

But that doesn’t account for TLS, etc. 10 handshakes/s requires a bit more juice than GET hello. I’ve worked to keep response times in the low millisecond range, just seems like good sense, but I think people should be allowed to program in slower languages and frameworks. You shouldn’t need a fairly substantial EPYC server like I have, either.And there’s always stuff happening in the background. Mastodon hits me once a second every time anybody deletes something. Lemmy hits me twice a second every time somebody likes anything. There’s a bunch of nitwits with misconfigured RSS readers. A 4x overhead in one area doesn’t matter, but a 1/4 as powerful CPU, with 1/4 as many cores, and 1/4 as fast language, all of which are entirely realistic, and pretty soon we’re running close to the edge.

            Abstract:K2-Think is a reasoning system that achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 32B parameter model, matching or surpassing much larger models like GPT-OSS 120B and DeepSeek v3.1. Built on the Qwen2.5 base model, our system shows that smaller models can compete at the highest levels by combining advanced post-training and test-time computation techniques. The approach is based on six key technical pillars: Long Chain-of-thought Supervised Finetuning, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), Agentic planning prior to reasoning, Test-time Scaling, Speculative Decoding, and Inference-optimized Hardware, all using publicly available open-source datasets. K2-Think excels in mathematical reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art scores on public benchmarks for open-source models, while also performing strongly in other areas such as Code and Science. Our results confirm that a more parameter-efficient model like K2-Think 32B can compete with state-of-the-art systems through an integrated post-training recipe that includes long chain-of-thought training and strategic inference-time enhancements, making open-source reasoning systems more accessible and affordable. K2-Think is freely available at this http URL, offering best-in-class inference speeds of over 2,000 tokens per second per request via the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[We are excited to announce Vectroid, a serverless vector search solution that delivers exceptional accuracy and low latency in a cost effective package. Vectroid is not just another vector search solution—it’s a search engine that performs and scales in all scenarios.Why we built VectroidTalk to any team working with large, low latency vector workloads and you’ll hear a familiar story: something always has to give. Vector databases often make significant tradeoffs between speed, accuracy, and cost. That’s the nature of the mathematical underpinnings of vector search works—taking algorithmic shortcuts to get near-perfect results in a short amount of time.There are some common permutations of these tradeoffs:Very high accuracy, but very expensive and slow
Fast speed and tolerable accuracy, but very expensive
Cheap and fast, but inaccurate to a disqualifying degree
Based on the existing vector database landscape, it would seem that building a cost effective vector database requires sacrificing either speed or accuracy at scale. We believe that’s a false pretense: building a cost-efficient database is possible with high accuracy and low latency. We just need to rethink our underlying mechanism.Our “aha” momentQuery speed and recall are largely a function of the chosen ANN algorithm. Algorithms which are both fast and accurate like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds) are memory intensive and expensive to index. The traditional assumption is that these types of algorithms are untenable for a cost-conscious system.We had two major realizations which challenged this assumption.Demand for in-memory HNSW is not static. Real world usage patterns are bursty and uneven. A cost efficient database can optimize for this reality by making resource allocation dynamic and by individually scaling system components as needed.
HNSW’s memory footprint is tunable. It can be easily be flattened (ex. by compressing vectors using quantization) and expanded (ex. by increasing layer count), which gives us the flexibility to experiment with different configurations to find a goldilocks setup.

What is Vectroid?Vectroid is a serverless vector database with premium performance. It delivers the same or stronger balance of speed and recall promised by high-end offerings, but costs less than competitors.Performant vector search: HNSW for ultra fast, high recall similarity search.
Near real-time search capabilities: Newly ingested records are searchable almost instantly.
Massive scalability: Seamlessly handles billions of vectors in a single namespace.
Cost efficient resource utilization: Scaling each layer (ingest, index, query) separately.

How Vectroid performsThe core philosophy of Vectroid is that optimizing for one metric at any cost to the others doesn’t make for a robust system. Instead, vector search should be designed for balanced performance across recall, latency, and cost so users don’t have to make painful tradeoffs as workloads grow.When tested against other state-of-the-art vector search, Vectroid is not only competitive but the most consistent across the board. Across all of our tests, Vectroid is the only databases that was able to maintain over 90% recall while scaling to 10 query threads per second—all while maintaining good latency scores.Some early benchmarks:Indexed 1B vectors (Deep1B) in ~48 minutes
Achieved P99 latency of 34ms on the MS Marco 138M vector / 1024 dimensions dataset
We’ll be releasing the full benchmark suite (with setup details so anyone can reproduce them) in an upcoming post. For now, these numbers highlight the kind of scale and performance we designed Vectroid to handle.How Vectroid worksVectroid is composed of two independently scalable microservices for writes and reads.As the diagram shows, index state, vector data, and metadata are persisted to cloud object storage (GCS for now, S3 coming soon). Disk, cache, and in-memory storage layers each employ a usage-aware model for index lifecycle in which indexes are lazily loaded from object storage on demand and evicted when idle.For fast, high-recall ANN search, we chose the HNSW algorithm. It offers excellent latency and accuracy tradeoffs, supports incremental updates, and performs well across large-scale workloads. To patch its limitations, we added a number of targeted optimizations:Slow indexing speed ⇒ in-memory write buffer to ensure newly inserted vectors are immediately searchable
High indexing cost ⇒ batched, highly concurrent and partitioned indexing
High memory usage ⇒ vector compression via quantization
Final ThoughtsWe’re just getting started. If you’re building applications that rely on fast, scalable vector search (or you’re running up against the limits of your current stack), we’d love to hear from you. Start using Vectroid today or sign up for our newsletter to follow along as we continue building.]]></content:encoded>

    As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, building it with privacy at its core is a critical frontier for the field. Differential privacy (DP) offers a mathematically robust solution by adding calibrated noise to prevent memorization. However, applying DP to LLMs introduces trade-offs. Understanding these trade-offs is crucial. Applying DP noise alters traditional scaling laws — rules describing performance dynamics — by reducing training stability (the model's ability to learn consistently without experiencing catastrophic events like loss spikes or divergence) and significantly increasing batch size (a collection of input prompts sent to the model simultaneously for processing) and computation costs.Our new research, “Scaling Laws for Differentially Private Language Models”, conducted in partnership with Google DeepMind, establishes laws that accurately model these intricacies, providing a complete picture of the compute-privacy-utility trade-offs. Guided by this research, we’re excited to introduce VaultGemma, the largest (1B-parameters), open model trained from scratch with differential privacy. We are releasing the weights on Hugging Face and Kaggle, alongside a technical report, to advance the development of the next generation of private AI.


                    
                    
    



    




    Understanding the scaling lawsWith a carefully thought-out experimental methodology, we aimed to quantify the benefit of increasing model sizes, batch sizes, and iterations in the context of DP training. Our work required making some simplifying assumptions to overcome the exponential number of combinations one might consider trying. We assumed that how well the model learns depends mostly on the "noise-batch ratio” which compares the amount of random noise we add for privacy to the size of the data groups (batches) we use for training. This assumption works because the privacy noise we add is much greater than any natural randomness that comes from sampling the data.To establish a DP scaling law, we conducted a comprehensive set of experiments to evaluate performance across a variety of model sizes and noise-batch ratios. The resulting empirical data, together with known deterministic relationships between other variables, allows us to answer a variety of interesting scaling-laws–style queries, such as, “For a given compute budget, privacy budget, and data budget, what is the optimal training configuration to achieve the lowest possible training loss?”


                    
                    
    




                    
                    
    



    




    Key findings: A powerful synergyBefore diving into the full scaling laws, it’s useful to understand the dynamics and synergies between the compute budget, privacy budget, and data budget from a privacy accounting perspective — i.e., understand how these factors influence the noise-batch ratio for a fixed model size and number of iterations. This analysis is significantly cheaper to do as it does not require any model training, yet it yields a number of useful insights. For instance, increasing the privacy budget in isolation leads to diminishing returns, unless coupled with a corresponding increase in either the compute budget (FLOPs) or data budget (tokens).


                    
                    
    




                    
                    
    



        
  To explore this synergy further, the visualization below shows how the optimal training configuration changes based on different constraints. As the privacy and compute budgets change, notice how the recommendation shifts between investing in a larger model versus training with larger batch sizes or more iterations.

    

                    
                    
    




                    
                    
    



        
  This data provides a wealth of useful insights for practitioners. While all the insights are reported in the paper, a key finding is that one should train a much smaller model with a much larger batch size than would be used without DP. This general insight should be unsurprising to a DP expert given the importance of large batch sizes. While this general insight holds across many settings, the optimal training configurations do change with the privacy and data budgets. Understanding the exact trade-off is crucial to ensure that both the compute and privacy budgets are used judiciously in real training scenarios. The above visualizations also reveal that there is often wiggle room in the training configurations — i.e., a range of model sizes might provide very similar utility if paired with the correct number of iterations and/or batch size.

    

                    
                    
    



    




    Applying the scaling laws to build VaultGemmaThe Gemma models are designed with responsibility and safety at their core. This makes them a natural foundation for developing a production-quality, DP-trained model like VaultGemma.Algorithmic advancements: Training at scaleThe scaling laws we derived above represent an important first step towards training a useful Gemma model with DP. We used the scaling laws to determine both how much compute we needed to train a compute-optimal 1B parameter Gemma 2-based model with DP, and how to allocate that compute among batch size, iterations, and sequence length to achieve the best utility.One prominent gap between the research underlying the scaling laws and the actual training of VaultGemma was our handling of Poisson sampling, which is a central component of DP-SGD. We initially used a straightforward method of loading data in uniform batches but then switched to Poisson sampling to get the best privacy guarantees with the least amount of noise. This method posed two main challenges: it created batches of different sizes, and it required a specific, randomized order for processing the data. We solved this by using our recent work on Scalable DP-SGD, which allows us to process data in fixed-size batches — either by adding extra padding or trimming them — while still maintaining strong privacy protections.


                    
                    
    



    




    ResultsArmed with our new scaling laws and advanced training algorithms, we built VaultGemma, to date the largest (1B-parameters) open model fully pre-trained with differential privacy with an approach that can yield high-utility models.From training VaultGemma, we found our scaling laws to be highly accurate. The final training loss of VaultGemma was remarkably close to what our equations predicted, validating our research and providing the community with a reliable roadmap for future private model development.


                    
                    
    




                    
                    
    



    




    We also compare downstream performance of our model against its non-private counterpart across a range of standard academic benchmarks (i.e., HellaSwag, BoolQ, PIQA, SocialIQA, TriviaQA, ARC-C, ARC-E ). To put this performance in perspective and quantify the current resource investment required for privacy, we also include a comparison to an older similar-sized GPT-2 model, which performs similarly on these benchmarks. This comparison illustrates that today’s private training methods produce models with utility comparable to that of non-private models from roughly 5 years ago, highlighting the important gap our work will help the community systematically close.Finally, the model comes with strong theoretical and empirical privacy protections.


                    
                    
    



    




    Formal privacy guaranteeIn general, both the privacy parameters (ε, δ) and the privacy unit are important considerations when doing DP training, as these together determine what the trained model can learn. VaultGemma was trained with a sequence-level DP guarantee of (ε ≤ 2.0, δ ≤ 1.1e-10), where a sequence consists of 1024 consecutive tokens extracted from heterogeneous data sources. Specifically, we used the same training mixture that was used to train the Gemma 2 model, consisting of a number of documents of varying lengths. During pre-processing, long documents are split up and tokenized into multiple sequences, and shorter documents are packed together into a single sequence. While the sequence-level privacy unit was a natural choice for our training mixture, in situations where there is a clear mapping between data and users, user-level differential privacy would be a better choice.What does this mean in practice? Informally speaking, because we provide protection at the sequence level, if information relating to any (potentially private) fact or inference occurs in a single sequence, then VaultGemma essentially does not know that fact: the response to any query will be statistically similar to the result from a model that never trained on the sequence in question. However, if many training sequences contain information relevant to a particular fact, then in general VaultGemma will be able to provide that information.


                    
                    
    



    




    Empirical memorizationSequence-level DP provably bounds the influence of any single training sequence (example) on the final model. We prompted the model with a 50-token prefix from a training document to see if it would generate the corresponding 50-token suffix. VaultGemma 1B shows no detectable memorization of its training data and successfully demonstrates the efficacy of DP training.


                    
                    
    



    




    ConclusionVaultGemma represents a significant step forward in the journey toward building AI that is both powerful and private by design. By developing and applying a new, robust understanding of the scaling laws for DP, we have successfully trained and released the largest open, DP-trained language model to date.While a utility gap still exists between DP-trained and non-DP–trained models, we believe this gap can be systematically narrowed with more research on mechanism design for DP training. We hope that VaultGemma and our accompanying research will empower the community to build the next generation of safe, responsible, and private AI for everyone.

            In my first interview out of college I was asked the change counter problem:

Given a set of coin denominations, find the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given number. IE for USA coinage and 37 cents, the minimum number is four (quarter, dime, 2 pennies).

I implemented the simple greedy algorithm and immediately fell into the trap of the question: the greedy algorithm only works for "well-behaved" denominations. If the coin values were [10, 9, 1], then making 37 cents would take 10 coins in the greedy algorithm but only 4 coins optimally (10+9+9+9). The "smart" answer is to use a dynamic programming algorithm, which I didn't know how to do. So I failed the interview.
But you only need dynamic programming if you're writing your own algorithm. It's really easy if you throw it into a constraint solver like MiniZinc and call it a day. 
int: total;
array[int] of int: values = [10, 9, 1];
array[index_set(values)] of var 0..: coins;

constraint sum (c in index_set(coins)) (coins[c] * values[c]) == total;
solve minimize sum(coins);

You can try this online here. It'll give you a prompt to put in total and then give you successively-better solutions:
coins = [0, 0, 37];
----------
coins = [0, 1, 28];
----------
coins = [0, 2, 19];
----------
coins = [0, 3, 10];
----------
coins = [0, 4, 1];
----------
coins = [1, 3, 0];
----------


Lots of similar interview questions are this kind of mathematical optimization problem, where we have to find the maximum or minimum of a function corresponding to constraints. They're hard in programming languages because programming languages are too low-level. They are also exactly the problems that constraint solvers were designed to solve. Hard leetcode problems are easy constraint problems.1 Here I'm using MiniZinc, but you could just as easily use Z3 or OR-Tools or whatever your favorite generalized solver is.
More examples
This was a question in a different interview (which I thankfully passed):

Given a list of stock prices through the day, find maximum profit you can get by buying one stock and selling one stock later.

It's easy to do in O(n^2) time, or if you are clever, you can do it in O(n). Or you could be not clever at all and just write it as a constraint problem:
array[int] of int: prices = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8];
var int: buy;
var int: sell;
var int: profit = prices[sell] - prices[buy];

constraint sell > buy;
constraint profit > 0;
solve maximize profit;

Reminder, link to trying it online here. While working at that job, one interview question we tested out was:

Given a list, determine if three numbers in that list can be added or subtracted to give 0? 

This is a satisfaction problem, not a constraint problem: we don't need the "best answer", any answer will do. We eventually decided against it for being too tricky for the engineers we were targeting. But it's not tricky in a solver; 
include "globals.mzn";
array[int] of int: numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8];
array[index_set(numbers)] of var {0, -1, 1}: choices;

constraint sum(n in index_set(numbers)) (numbers[n] * choices[n]) = 0;
constraint count(choices, -1) + count(choices, 1) = 3;
solve satisfy;

Okay, one last one, a problem I saw last year at Chipy AlgoSIG. Basically they pick some leetcode problems and we all do them. I failed to solve this one:

Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.


The "proper" solution is a tricky thing involving tracking lots of bookkeeping states, which you can completely bypass by expressing it as constraints:
array[int] of int: numbers = [2,1,5,6,2,3];

var 1..length(numbers): x; 
var 1..length(numbers): dx;
var 1..: y;

constraint x + dx <= length(numbers);
constraint forall (i in x..(x+dx)) (y <= numbers[i]);

var int: area = (dx+1)*y;
solve maximize area;

output ["(\(x)->\(x+dx))*\(y) = \(area)"]

There's even a way to automatically visualize the solution (using vis_geost_2d), but I didn't feel like figuring it out in time for the newsletter.
Is this better?
Now if I actually brought these questions to an interview the interviewee could ruin my day by asking "what's the runtime complexity?" Constraint solvers runtimes are unpredictable and almost always than an ideal bespoke algorithm because they are more expressive, in what I refer to as the capability/tractability tradeoff. But even so, they'll do way better than a bad bespoke algorithm, and I'm not experienced enough in handwriting algorithms to consistently beat a solver.
The real advantage of solvers, though, is how well they handle new constraints. Take the stock picking problem above. I can write an O(n²) algorithm in a few minutes and the O(n) algorithm if you give me some time to think. Now change the problem to

Maximize the profit by buying and selling up to max_sales stocks, but you can only buy or sell one stock at a given time and you can only hold up to max_hold stocks at a time?

That's a way harder problem to write even an inefficient algorithm for! While the constraint problem is only a tiny bit more complicated:
include "globals.mzn";
int: max_sales = 3;
int: max_hold = 2;
array[int] of int: prices = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8];
array [1..max_sales] of var int: buy;
array [1..max_sales] of var int: sell;
array [index_set(prices)] of var 0..max_hold: stocks_held;
var int: profit = sum(s in 1..max_sales) (prices[sell[s]] - prices[buy[s]]);

constraint forall (s in 1..max_sales) (sell[s] > buy[s]);
constraint profit > 0;

constraint forall(i in index_set(prices)) (stocks_held[i] = (count(s in 1..max_sales) (buy[s] <= i) - count(s in 1..max_sales) (sell[s] <= i)));
constraint alldifferent(buy ++ sell);
solve maximize profit;

output ["buy at \(buy)\n", "sell at \(sell)\n", "for \(profit)"];


Most constraint solving examples online are puzzles, like Sudoku or "SEND + MORE = MONEY". Solving leetcode problems would be a more interesting demonstration. And you get more interesting opportunities to teach optimizations, like symmetry breaking.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[August 31, 2025

Over the past several years, I've enjoyed the hobby of paper
modeling (or papercraft), the art
of creating 3D models from cut and glued parts from paper sheets. This hobby is
a superset of origami, in that it allows for cutting and gluing, as well as for
multiple sheets of paper for a single model. The alleviation of these
constraints means that papercraft allows for more complex models that are easier
to assemble.
Over many years, I've built models designed by others as well as designed my
own. In this post, I want to share everything I've learned along the way,
covering the entire process from design to assembly.
I love this hobby for three reasons:

It is extremely accessible. There is no fancy hardware or software
involved. As we'll see, the core tools are paper, scissors, and glue;
everything else is an addon to make the experience better. All software tools
can be free. Accidentally messed up during assembly and need a replacement
part? Just print out another page. The entire creation of a model can be done
in the ballpark of a few cents.
It is equally technical and creative. As we'll see, many of the problems
faced in papercraft require an engineering-like approach and a willingness to
experiment and iterate on designs. While it may appear outwardly like a craft
project, the end-to-end process involves constraints and optimizing within
them.
There's no limits on what you can make. What you decide to build is
limited by your patience and imagination. Theoretically, nearly any object can
be represented as a paper model.

Let's dive in. My most recent model is a papercraft plane inspired by the SR-71
Blackbird, a
reconnaissance plane that to this day holds many records for being one of the
fastest aircrafts ever. It's now one of most iconic planes ever designed and an
engineering masterpiece. The program was ultimately retired in 1999.
The model we'll be desiging and assembling in this post

We're going to walk through the full model design and assembly process, while
referencing specific examples I encountered during creating this SR-71.
Constraints#
Let's set some constraints for how we're allowed to model our creation. These
are self-imposed limitations that fit my preferred-style for model design:

All parts in the assembled model must be made of paper.
Each part must be a single, solid color. The parts must not use any printed
textures or designs.
The model must be represented as a simple
polyhedron. There may be
no curvatures, holes, two-dimensional surfaces, or surface-to-surface contact.
If the figure we're trying to capture has any of these features, we must find
a way to approximate it using only flat faces. The object must be manifold (an
edge is only shared by 2 faces).

Why constraints?#
It may feel weird to impose constraints on an art. However, I find that these
constraints encourage a better designed model that can be assembled easily and
predictably, including by others.
Using features like curvatures, printing with textures, etc. are shortcuts. For
example, printing textures helps fill in details that aren't captured inherently
by the model; curvatures and 2d surfaces are flimsy and introduce variances in
how a model can be assembled. Simply polyhedral designs with single color parts
ensure that the 3D form itself captures the object being depicted, and can be
assembled in a structurally sound, predictable way.
Goals#
In addition to constraints, we also have some goals that we're optimzing for.
These goals will be considered in each step of our design process.

Ease of assembly: By far the most important goal, our model should be
easy to put together. Given the nature of paper and glue, a model that is
difficult to assemble will almost certainly look bad. A model can have a
well-designed topology, but still be difficult to assemble based on the parts
design we put together.
Aesthetic appeal: This is an art, after all. The model we design should
be aesthetically pleasing and resemble the object of interest.
Minimal consumption of resources: We should aim to minimize waste and use
our materials efficiently.

As in engineering, we have to consider trade-offs between these goals, and
optimize for these goals within our constraints.
Steps#
The process of designing a paper model is iterative. Each iteration consists of
the following steps:

Mesh modeling - using software to create a 3D polyhedron mesh of our desired form
Mesh unfolding - unfolding the mesh into a 2D layout of parts
Assembly - putting the parts together to create the final model

The remainder of this article will be walking through each step in detail. The
discussion of each step will be centered around the goals and constraints
declared from above.
Mesh Modeling#
Related goals: Ease of assembly, aesthetic appeal
In this phase, we design the mesh for our model. We aim to capture the essence
of an object in a way that can feasibly be built with paper. Depending on how
you approach this, this can easily be the most complicated step.
What do I mean by "feasibly built with paper"? Our mesh is a collection of
polygons that represent a 3D object. The closeness of that representation is
largely determined by how many polygons we use. We could use many really small
polygons to closely match the subtle curves of our plane, but this would be hard
to assemble in reality. Alternatively, we could simplifiy our representation
down to a triangular pyramid. This would be trivially easy to assemble, but it
wouldn't look a lot like our plane.
We can now see that our goals of ease of assembly and aesthetic appeal are at
odds. Imagine that we have a continuum, where on the left we have a triangular
pyramid (the simplest possible polyhedron) and on the right we have a mesh of
the SR-71 with an arbitrarily high number (millions) of polygons.
Our mesh can exist anywhere between the simplest polyhedron and a mesh with near perfect resolution. The example on the right is by USSIowa on Thingiverse (Creative Commons - Attribution): https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5508640
Generally, an "easy" to assemble model will have somewhere around a few hundred
polygons. Thus, our ideal model exists somewhere on the far left of this
spectrum.
The challenge here is what I call "allocation of resolution" - we have a finite
number of polygons to distribute across the features of our object. Certain
features will naturally require more polygons to be accurately captured than
others. For example, curved features require more polygons than flat features -
in this model, the cylindrical engines will require more detail, than say, the
flat wings.
In addition to the number of polygons and their concentrations, the arrangement
of the polygons themselves matters - this is the topology of the mesh. Most
discourse on 3D mesh topology is related to shading and animation. For our
purposes, we're considered with ease of assembly. Certain topologies are easier
to assemble and more structurally sound. Generally, here's some positive
topological qualities for papercraft:

Symmetries: a good mesh design is symetrical when possible. Symmetrical shapes
are intuitive and easier to reason about when assembling.
No narrow shapes: really narrow shapes are hard to cut out, hard to fold, and
hard to glue. Avoid them at all costs.
Use quads: quad faces have an aesthetic appeal to them.

If all of this is sounding hard, we've got some options, in increasing order of
difficulty:
Easy: Use an existing mesh#
The easiest way past this step is to find an existing mesh. There's a whole
genre of 3D modeling called "low-poly" that you can find with a quick search on
Thingiverse or
Printables. These are
usually designed for video games or 3D printing, but can be taken up for
papercraft.
Medium: Converting an existing mesh#
Sometimes, you can find a high-resolution mesh of your desired object, but not a
low-poly one. In this case, there are tools available to reduce the polygon
count while preserving the overall shape. This is called "mesh simplification"
or "mesh decimation."
This Instructable
goes over the process of doing this with Meshlab,
but there's many other software alternatives out there.
The pitfall of this approach is that automatic mesh decimation typically results
in some nasty topologies, and there's not a lot you can do to control the
output. To get around this, we could add an additional refinement step where
we take the raw decimated mesh output and "clean it up" using a mesh editor
software.
As an example, let's try this with a SR-71 mesh on
Thingiverse. The original mesh has
more than 1.2 million faces, and we're going to try decimating down to ~1,000.
Here's what we get from Meshlab:
Result of mesh decimation in Meshlab
In this case, the output is not usable - it's wildly asymetric and is full of
self-intersections. Refining this topology would take just as long (if not
longer) as creating a model from scratch.
Hard: Creating your own mesh#
The most difficult option is to create your own mesh from scratch. This option
gives you full control over the design, and is what I chose for the SR-71 model.
My software of choice for this is Blender. Blender
has a steep learning curve, but the type of mesh design we're doing for this
project doesn't begin to scratch the surface of its full capabilities. I highly
recommend this low-poly tutorial
if you've never used Blender before and need somewhere to start. Two things I
found very handy were the mirror
modifier
to enforce symmetry, and the 3D Print
Toolbox
to auto-cleanup the mesh and check for manifoldness.
This process is very tedious. My advice here is: simplify your mesh to the point
where you feel uncomfortable. Recall that we're largely optimizing for ease of
assembly. When modeling, it's very tempting to capture finer details, but fine
details have costs (small parts, hard to glue regions, etc.) that are not worth
it during the assembly phase. Scrutinize every feature, and zoom out once in a
while. When you zoom out, your omissions won't feel as weird.
After many days, here's the initial mesh I created. It contains 732 triangles.
Note the symmetry along the y-axis.
Initial mesh created with Blender
Mesh Unfolding#
Related goals: Ease of assembly, minimal consumption of resources
Once we have a mesh, we have to convert it into a 2D template of parts that can
be printed and assembled. This process is called unfolding. Each of the
faces of our mesh are grouped into parts, and the arrangement of our parts
is a layout, or template.
To do this, we're going to turn to software again. The most popular unfolding
tool (and my favorite) is Pepakura
Designer. Pepakura is not free (at the
time of this writing, it's a one time $70 purchase) and it only runs on
Windows. There's also Unfolder for Mac, which is
$30. If you can't use either of these, Blender can save the day again with its
free Paper Model
plugin.
I believe that the unfolding step is one that does not get as much attention as
it deserves. There is a noticable difference between a good template and a bad
one. A good template has parts that make intuitive sense, with logical groupings
and clear flow. The faces themselves are grouped into parts that are easy to cut
out and handle. All of this equates to a better building experience, which means
a better looking model.
Part of unfolding is also deciding the scale of your model. You can make your
model as big or small as you want, but again, ease of assembly should be top of
mind when deciding. A model that's too small will end up with parts that are
hard to cut out and fold. Bigger models are easier to assemble, but you're
limited to the point where the faces of your model must fit on a page.
I ended up making this model 25 inches long. With the original SR-71 being about
107 feet long, this puts our model at around a 1:50 ratio.
Creating many parts#
Let's start off with the creation of parts. In most unfolding software, the
software will auto-unfold for you, and from there you can regroup faces into
whatever parts you want. Here's Pepakura's auto unfold:
Pepakura default unfolding produces complex parts
The parts it generated are pretty complicated, so we have some work to do.
If you have a mesh with nn faces, you can have anywhere from 1 (all the faces
in a single part) to nn total parts (each part is a single face). We want our
model to be easy to assemble, and neither of these extremes are easy.
Rather than trying to fix the number of parts and going from there, I recommend
creating parts that are logical. Identify features that can be captured in a
single part, and go from there. For example, in the SR-71, each engine intake
spike makes sense as a single part. So does the nose cone.
If your mesh has an axis of symmetry, then your parts have symmetrical pairings
as well. The same feature on either side of the axis should be represented with
a mirrored part. In the SR-71, the entire plane is symmetrical on the vertical
axis, so all parts across this axis are mirrored. This is good because once
someone builds one side, they can more easily reason about the other side.
I ended up dividing this model into 42 parts. These parts were carefully divided
in such a way that I felt would make them easier to assemble. If you look at any
part in particular, chances are it'll have a symmetric counterpart.
Finalized parts for the layout
They're arranged pretty haphazardly right now, but we'll cleanup this up in the
next step.
Arranging the parts#
Again, most software will automatically arrange the parts for you as part of
unfolding. Here's the 14 page arrangement Pepakura decided for the parts I created:
Auto arrangement of parts by Pepakura
I highlighted all the parts on the first two pages so you can see where the are
on the finished model. Notice that they're scattered throughout different
sections. That's why I typically don't like auto-arrangement - they're designed
to minimize paper usage, but they often result in a less intuitive assembly
process. You can't look at any particular page and loosely know where its parts
will go.
A good part layout reads like a story. Parts are arranged in a logical
order, with related parts grouped together. I like to arrange mine left to
right, top to bottom on a page. Here's my layout, with the first two pages
highlighted.
Manual arrangement of parts, which now has logical groupings
All the parts that are near each other in the layout are also near each other in
the final assembly. In this case, I even was able to reduce the page count down
to 12 from the starting 14.
Flap structure#
Flaps, or tabs, are the appendages on each part that allow for gluing
parts together. Each flap has a singular counterpart edge that it's glued to -
this is known as an edge/flap pair. Most software will auto-assign a shared
number between an edge and its flap to make identify pairs easy during the
assembly process.
Two edge/flap pairs, with arrows pointing to their matching number IDs
For an edge/flap pair, most unfolding software will allow us to swap the flap
across parts. Doing this strategically is critical for creating an easy to
assemble model, and also has implications for the structural integrity of the
final build.
For example, consider the two example parts shown above. These two parts that
meet at two shared edges, so these parts have two edge/flap pairs between them.
We could arrange the flaps so that one part has both of them:
Arranging both flaps on the same side
We could also interlace the flaps, so each part has one flap on each side.
Arranging flaps as interlaced, with one flap on each part
Interlacing flaps between parts can create a more stable structure, since
there's only one way for the parts to meet. If two flaps are on the same side,
they can over-extend when glued to the edge. That being said, same-side flaps
can be easier to work with, especially when reaching the closing stages of a
model.
In general, I like to using interlaced flaps wherever possible to create an
overall stronger model, and use same-side flaps selectively.
Once we have an arrangement we like, we can export our layout as a PDF.
Assembly#
With our layout PDF ready, we can now print it and move on to assembly. We'll
finally get to see our design come to life.
Materials and Tools#
For our materials, we'll need:

65lb (176 g/m2g/m^2) cardstock: This is the ideal paper weight for creating
sturdy models, while still being thin/flexible enough to pass through a normal
printer and be easy to fold.
Adhesive. My recommended adhesive is tacky glue: it's strong, dries clear, but
is forgiving enough to allow for repositioning during assembly. Specifically,
I use Aleene's Original Tacky
Glue.
I've also had past success with a glue stick.

We'll also need some tools, which I've listed these in order of importance. The
ones with asterisks are essential. Everything else is a nice-to-have.

Printer*: You'll need access to a printer to print the template on the
cardstock. Laser jet printers are great because the prints don't smudge.
Cutting tools*: You'll need a pair of scissors or a craft knife to cut
out the parts. Use sharp tools for clean cuts - it makes a difference.
Ruler*: Cutting/scoring perfectly straight lines is a must. Steel rulers
are great for their consistent edge, and they don't catch against your tools.
That being said, I used a clear plastic ruler for this model. Being able to
see through the ruler helps with alignment.
Scoring tool*: This will help you prepare a part for folding. You can use
a bone folder or scoring wheel. I use an embossing tool I found at a dollar
store, but before that, I used a ballpoint pen than ran out of ink. Anything
with a precise (but not too sharp) tip will do.
Toothpicks: I use toothpicks to spread blobs of glue into thin layers and
get into tight spaces.
Assembly surface: A cutting mat or piece of cardboard will protect your
work surface and give you a stable surface to cut/score your parts.
Tweezers: Tweezers are helpful for handling small parts and getting into
tight spaces, especially while holding parts together as glue dries.

If you want to get fancy, you can also purchase an automatic cutting machine,
like a Cricut or
Silhouette. These machines can precisely
cut/score your parts from cardstock. Getting the template into their software
takes some extra effort, but it results in the best quality parts. I did not use
a machine for this project.
To match the real SR-71, I printed my template on black cardstock. Darker
cardstocks are harder to work with because of the low contrast between the ink
and the paper itself. If you're new to the hobby, I would recommend starting
with a lighter color.
Assembly phases#
The assembly of a model has 4 steps:

Cutting: Cutting the parts out from the paper with your cutting tool of
choice. Scissors are quicker, but the combination of ruler and craft knife
results in cleaner cuts.
Scoring: Running a scoring tool over fold lines to get cleaner folds. This
may be tempting to skip, but I cannot emphasize the importance of this step
enough. Scoring is especially important when dealing with thicker paper.
Folding: Folding the parts in prep for gluing. There's only two types of
folds: mountain folds and valley folds.
Gluing: Gluing the parts together.

How you decide to batch these steps is up to you. For example, you could cut all
the parts out at once, then score all of them, etc. This approach is effective
because you can develop a rhythm by doing each phase only once, so you're not
constantly switching between tools; the downside is that you only get to start
assembly after a pretty lengthy process. Alternatively, you can do it per part:
cut one part out, score it, fold it, and secure it to the assembly. Here, the
pros and cons are flipped: you get to see the model come together quicker, but
there's a lot of context switching between phases. I've tried both of these
approaches, and find that the latter results in a non-negligible increase in the
assembly time of the model.
To strike a balance, the approach I took for this model was performing the
phases at the granularity of sections (engines, wings, fuselage, etc.) of the
model. This approach has the added final step of assembling all the standalone
sections together into the final model.
Here's some pictures I took during the assembly process. In total, assembly took
6-8 hours.

The same part from above, but now scored. Note the visible impressions on the fold lines.

Tips#
Use little glue: When gluing parts together, apply as little glue as
possible. Using too much glue will result in spillover when the flaps/edges are
put together, and this spillover is hard to wipe away from a porous surface like
paper. Too much glue can even result in subtle paper warping. In the recommended
tools, I suggested a toothpick. I apply a small bead of glue to a flap and use
the toothpick to spread it into a thin film. This prevents any spillage and
keeps the model clean.
Start in complex areas: As you progress further in gluing parts together,
the degrees of freedom of your model will reduce. This is why I recommend
starting with more complicated areas of your model where you'll need those
degrees of freedom. In this model, this meant starting with precise features,
like the engine inlet spikes or the vertical stabilizers.
Finish in hidden areas: This goes hand in hand with the tip above. As you
reach to the end of your model, gluing the final parts together can be very
hard, which means the final edges may come out a bit sloppy. Why does this
happen? Any minor imperfections we made throughout the assembly process result
in stresses in our model that will be felt at the end. Gluing the last part may
be challenging because it'll feel misaligned, and it has the added challenge of
attempting to close a 3D object from the outside. That's why I always recommend
choosing an assembly order that results in the last parts being glued in an area
that is out of sight. For the SR-71, that happens to be the underside of the
fuselage.
Final Model#
Here's the final model, displayed on a stand (also made from paper):

Iteration#
No matter how much you scrutinize the modeling and layout phases, you will
inevitably find areas for improvement as you assemble. In the case of the SR-71,
I spotted a few minor assymetries in part tabs, and more importantly, an
opportunity to reduce face count by simplifying the topology of the bottom of
the plane and the nose cone.
I took my mesh back into Blender, and was able to get the triangle count down to
636, which is almost a full 100 faces fewer than the original mesh.
Second mesh iteration in Blender.
Below, you can see the old mesh (left) next to the new mesh (right). It's hard
to tell the difference, yet the new one has almost 15% fewer faces.
First mesh iteration (left) vs. latest mesh iteration (right).
A faster way to iterate is to render the model rather than physically building
it. This allows you to quickly identify and fix visual issues without going
through the hours of assembly. Here's some renders (in Blender) of the final
iteration:
Blender isometric-view rendering of final mesh.
Blender front-view rendering of final mesh.
Conclusion#
In total, the full cycle of designing the mesh, creating the parts layout,
assembly, and subsequent refinement iterations occurred over the course of a few
months. The process is long, but the results are well worth it.
If you're interested in making this model yourself, you can download the PDFs for
the first iteration of the model below. I've included a template for the stand as well.
