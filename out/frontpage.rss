            <description><![CDATA[Monarez aligned with evidence-based public health community and had support of experts.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
          
          
Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, told the outlet that Monarez "values science, is a solid researcher, and has a history of being a good manager. We're looking forward to working with her."
A low point for the agency
The reported ouster comes at what feels like a nadir for the CDC. The agency has lost hundreds of staff from layoffs and buyouts. Vital health programs have been shuttered or hampered. Dangerous rhetoric and health misinformation from Kennedy and other health officials in the Trump administration have made once-respected CDC experts feel vilified by the public and like targets of hate. Kennedy himself has falsely called the COVID-19 shots the "deadliest vaccine ever made" and the CDC a "cesspool of corruption," for example.
On August 8, a gunman warped by vaccine disinformation opened fire on the CDC campus. Of nearly 500 shots fired, about 200 struck six CDC buildings as terrified staff dove for safety. One local police officer was killed in the incident. The gunman had specifically targeted the CDC for the shooting and blamed COVID-19 vaccines for his health problems.
Additional exits reported
After news broke of Monarez's removal, Stat News reported that a wave of CDC leadership has resigned. The high-ranking resignations include: Daniel Jernigan, director of the National Center for Emerging Zoonotic Infectious Diseases; Deb Houry, Chief Medical Officer; and Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.
"I am not able to serve in this role any longer because of the ongoing weaponization of public health," Daskalakis said in a message to staff seen by Stat.
"I am committed to protecting the public’s health, but the ongoing changes prevent me from continuing in my job as a leader of the agency," Houry wrote in a message to staff. Houry added that science should "never be censored or subject to political interpretations."
Earlier today, Politico reported that Jennifer Layden, director of the agency’s Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance, and Technology, has also resigned.
8/27/2025 8:15 pm ET: This post has been updated to include the social media post from HHS, reporting from the Washington Post on the circumstances around Monarez's exit, additional resignations reported by Stat and Politico, and the statement from Monarez's lawyers.

The wave of CLI Coding Agents

If you have tried Claude Code, Gemini Code, Open Code or Simon
      Willison’s LLM CLI, you’ve experienced something fundamentally
      different from ChatGPT or Github Copilot. These aren’t just chatbots or
      autocomplete tools - they’re agents that can read your code, run your
      tests, search docs and make changes to your codebase async.

But how do they work? For me the best way to understand how any tool
      works is to try and build it myself. So that’s exactly what we did, and in
      this article I’ll take you through how we built our own CLI Coding Agent
      using the Pydantic-AI framework and the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
      You’ll see not just how to assemble the pieces but why each capability
      matters and how it changes the way you can work with code.

Our implementation leverages AWS Bedrock but with Pydantic-AI you could
      easily use any other mainstream provider or even a fully local LLM.



Why Build When You Can Buy?

Before diving into the technical implementation, let's examine why we
      chose to build our own solution.

The answer became clear very quickly using our custom agent, while
      commercial tools are impressive, they’re built for general use cases. Our
      agent was fully customised to our internal context and all the little
      eccentricities of our specific project. More importantly, building it gave
      us insights into how these systems work and the quality of our own GenAI
      Platform and Dev Tooling.

Think of it like learning to cook. You can eat at restaurants forever
      but understanding how flavours combine and techniques work makes you
      appreciate food differently - and lets you create exactly what you
      want.



The Architecture of Our Development Agent

At a high level, our coding assistant consists of several key
      components:


Core AI Model: Claude from Anthropic accessed through AWS Bedrock 

Pydantic-AI Framework: provides the agent framework and many helpful
        utilities to make our Agent more useful immediately 

MCP Servers: independent processes that give the agent specialised
        tools, MCP is a common standard for defining the servers that contain these
        tools. 

CLI Interface: how users interact with the assistant


The magic happens through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which
      allows the AI model to use various tools through a standardized interface.
      This architecture makes our assistant highly extensible - we can easily
      add new capabilities by implementing additional MCP servers, but we’re
      getting ahead of ourselves.



Starting Simple: The Foundation

We started by creating a basic project structure and installing the
      necessary dependencies:

uv init
uv add pydantic_ai
uv add boto3


Our primary dependencies include:


pydantic-ai: Framework for building AI agents

boto3: For AWS API interactions


We chose Claude Sonnet 4 from Anthropic (accessed via AWS Bedrock) as
      our foundation model due to its strong code understanding and generation
      capabilities. Here's how we configured it in our main.py:

import boto3
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerStdio
from pydantic_ai.models.bedrock import BedrockConverseModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.bedrock import BedrockProvider


bedrock_config = BotocoreConfig(
    read_timeout=300,
    connect_timeout=60,
    retries={"max_attempts": 3},
)
bedrock_client = boto3.client(
    "bedrock-runtime", region_name="eu-central-1", config=bedrock_config
)
model = BedrockConverseModel(
    "eu.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0",
    provider=BedrockProvider(bedrock_client=bedrock_client),
)
agent = Agent(
    model=model,
)


if __name__ == "__main__":
  agent.to_cli_sync()


At this stage we already have a fully working CLI with a chat interface
      which we can use as you would a GUI chat interface, which is pretty cool
      for how little code this is! However we can definitely improve upon
      this.



First Capability: Testing!

Instead of running the tests ourselves after each coding iteration why
      not get the agent to do it? Seems simple right?

import subprocess


@agent.tool_plain()
def run_unit_tests() -> str:
    """Run unit tests using uv."""
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["uv", "run", "pytest", "-xvs", "tests/"], capture_output=True, text=True
    )
    return result.stdout


Here we use the same pytest command you would run in the terminal (I’ve
      shortened ours for the article). Now something magical happened. I could
      say “X isn’t working” and the agent would:


1. Run the test suite

2. Identify which specific tests were failing

3. Analyze the error messages

4. Suggest targeted fixes.


The workflow change: Instead of staring at test failures or copy
      pasting terminal outputs into ChatGPT we now give our agent super relevant
      context about any issues in our codebase.

However we noticed our agent sometimes “fixed” failing tests by
      suggesting changes to the tests, not the actual implementation. This led
      to our next addition.



Adding Intelligence: Instructions and intent

We realised we needed to teach our agent a little more about our
      development philosophy and steer it away from bad behaviours.

instructions = """
You are a specialised agent for maintaining and developing the XXXXXX codebase.

## Development Guidelines:

1. **Test Failures:**
   - When tests fail, fix the implementation first, not the tests
   - Tests represent expected behavior; implementation should conform to tests
   - Only modify tests if they clearly don't match specifications

2. **Code Changes:**
   - Make the smallest possible changes to fix issues
   - Focus on fixing the specific problem rather than rewriting large portions
   - Add unit tests for all new functionality before implementing it

3. **Best Practices:**
   - Keep functions small with a single responsibility
   - Implement proper error handling with appropriate exceptions
   - Be mindful of configuration dependencies in tests

Remember to examine test failure messages carefully to understand the root cause before making any changes.
"""


agent = Agent(
instructions=instructions,
model=model,
)


The workflow change: The agent now understands our values around
      Test Driven Development and minimal changes. It stopped suggesting large
      refactors where a small fix would do (Mostly).

Now while we could continue building everything from absolute scratch
      and tweaking our prompts for days we want to go fast and use some tools
      other people have built - Enter Model Context Protocol (MCP).



The MCP Revolution: Pluggable Capabilities

This is where our agent transformed from a helpful assistant to
      something approaching the commercial CLI agents. The Model Context
      Protocol (MCP) allows us to add sophisticated capabilities by running
      specialized servers.


MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide
        context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications.
        Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to
        various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to
        connect AI models to different data sources and tools. 

-- MCP Introduction


We can run these servers as a local process, so no data sharing, where
      we interact with STDIN/STDOUT to keep things simple and local. (More details on tools and MCP)



Sandboxed Python Execution

Using large language models to do calculations or executing arbitrary code they create is not effective and potentially very dangerous! To make our Agent more accurate and safe our first MCP addition was Pydantic Al’s default server for sandboxed Python code execution:

run_python = MCPServerStdio(
    "deno",
    args=[
        "run",
        "-N",
        "-R=node_modules",
        "-W=node_modules",
        "--node-modules-dir=auto",
        "jsr:@pydantic/mcp-run-python",
        "stdio",
    ],
)


agent = Agent(
    ...
    mcp_servers=[
        run_python
    ],
)


This gave our agent a sandbox where it could test ideas, prototype
      solutions, and verify its own suggestions.

NOTE: This is very different from running the tests where we need the
      local environment and is intended to be used to make calculations much
      more robust. This is because writing the code to output a number and then
      executing that code is much more reliable and understandable, scalable and
      repeatable than just generating the next token in a calculation. We have
      seen from frontier labs (including their leaked instructions) that this is
      a much better approach.

The workflow change: Doing calculations, even more complex ones,
      became significantly more reliable. This is useful for many things like
      dates, sums, counts etc. It also allows for a rapid iteration cycle of
      simple python code.



Up-to-Date library Documentation

LLMs are mostly trained in batch on historical data this gives a fixed
      cutoff while languages and dependencies continue to change and improve so
      we added Context7 for access to up to date python
      library documentation in LLM consumable format:

context7 = MCPServerStdio(
    command="npx", args=["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"], tool_prefix="context"
)


The workflow change: When working with newer libraries or trying to
      use advanced features, the agent could look up current documentation
      rather than relying on potentially outdated training data. This made it
      much more reliable for real-world development work.



AWS MCPs

Since this particular agent was built with an AWS platform in mind, we
      added the AWS Labs MCP servers for comprehensive cloud docs and
      integration:

awslabs = MCPServerStdio(
    command="uvx",
    args=["awslabs.core-mcp-server@latest"],
    env={"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"},
    tool_prefix="awslabs",
)
aws_docs = MCPServerStdio(
    command="uvx",
    args=["awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest"],
    env={"FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR", "AWS_DOCUMENTATION_PARTITION": "aws"},
    tool_prefix="aws_docs",
)


The workflow change: Now when I mentioned “Bedrock is timing out”
      or “the model responses are getting truncated,” the agent could directly
      access AWS documentation to help troubleshoot configuration issues. While
      we've only scratched the surface with these two servers, this is the tip
      of the iceberg—the AWS Labs MCP
      collection includes servers for
      CloudWatch metrics, Lambda debugging, IAM policy analysis, and much more.
      Even with just documentation access, cloud debugging became more
      conversational and contextual.



Internet Search for Current Information

Sometimes you need information that's not in any documentation—recent
      Stack Overflow discussions, GitHub issues, or the latest best practices.
      We added general internet search:

internet_search = MCPServerStdio(command="uvx", args=["duckduckgo-mcp-server"])


The workflow change: When encountering obscure errors or needing to
      understand recent changes in the ecosystem, the agent could search for
      current discussions and solutions. This was particularly valuable for
      debugging deployment issues or understanding breaking changes in
      dependencies.



Structured Problem Solving

One of the most valuable additions was the code reasoning MCP, which
      helps the agent think through complex problems systematically:

code_reasoning = MCPServerStdio(
    command="npx",
    args=["-y", "@mettamatt/code-reasoning"],
    tool_prefix="code_reasoning",
)


The workflow change: Instead of jumping to solutions, the agent
      would break down complex problems into logical steps, explore alternative
      approaches, and explain its reasoning. This was invaluable for
      architectural decisions and debugging complex issues. I could ask “Why is
      this API call failing intermittently?” and get a structured analysis of
      potential causes rather than just guesses.



Optimising for Reasoning

As we added more sophisticated capabilities, we noticed that reasoning
      and analysis tasks often took much longer than regular text
      generation—especially when the output wasn't correctly formatted on the
      first try. We adjusted our Bedrock configuration to be more patient:

bedrock_config = BotocoreConfig(
    read_timeout=300,
    connect_timeout=60,
    retries={"max_attempts": 3},
)
bedrock_client = boto3.client(
    "bedrock-runtime", region_name="eu-central-1", config=bedrock_config
)


The workflow change: The longer timeouts meant our agent could work
      through complex problems without timing out. When analyzing large
      codebases or reasoning through intricate architectural decisions, the
      agent could take the time needed to provide thorough, well-reasoned
      responses rather than rushing to incomplete solutions.



Desktop Commander: Warning! With great power comes great responsibility!

At this point, our agent was already quite capable—it could reason
      through problems, execute code, search for information, and access AWS
      documentation. This MCP server transforms your agent from a helpful
      assistant into something that can actually do things in your development
      environment:

desktop_commander = MCPServerStdio(
    command="npx",
    args=["-y", "@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander"],
    tool_prefix="desktop_commander",
)


Desktop Commander provides an incredibly comprehensive toolkit: file
      system operations (read, write, search), terminal command execution with
      process management, surgical code editing with edit_block, and even
      interactive REPL sessions. It's built on top of the MCP Filesystem Server
      but adds crucial capabilities like search-and-replace editing and
      intelligent process control.

The workflow change: This is where everything came together. I
      could now say “The authentication tests are failing, please fix the issue”
      and the agent would:


1. Run the test suite to see the specific failures

2. Read the failing test files to understand what was expected

3. Examine the authentication module code

4. Search the codebase for related patterns

5. Look up the documentation for the relevant library

6. Make edits to fix the implementation

7. Re-run the tests to verify the fix

8. Search for similar patterns elsewhere that might need updating


All of this happened in a single conversation thread, with the agent
      maintaining context throughout. It wasn't just generating code
      suggestions—it was actively debugging, editing, and verifying fixes like a
      pair programming partner.

The security model is thoughtful too, with configurable allowed
      directories, blocked commands, and proper permission boundaries. You can
      learn more about its extensive capabilities at the Desktop Commander
      documentation.

How it changes our workflow:


Debugging becomes collaborative: you have an intelligent partner
        that can analyze error messages, suggest hypotheses, and help test
        solutions.

Learning accelerates: when working with unfamiliar libraries or
        patterns, the agent can explain existing code, suggest improvements, and
        teach you why certain approaches work better.

Context switching reduces: rather than jumping between
        documentation, Stack Overflow, AWS Console, and your IDE, you have a
        single interface that can access all these resources while maintaining
        context about your specific problem.

Problem-solving becomes structured: rather than jumping to
        solutions, the agent can break down complex issues into logical steps,
        explore alternatives, and explain its reasoning. Like having a real life talking rubber duck!

Code review improves: the agent can review your changes, spot
        potential issues, and suggest improvements before you commit—like having a
        senior developer looking over your shoulder.




What We Learned About CLI Agents

Building our own agent revealed several insights about this emerging
      paradigm:


MCP is (almost) all you need: the magic isn't in any single
        capability, but in how they work together. The agent that can run tests,
        read files, search documentation, execute code, access AWS services, and
        reason through problems systematically becomes qualitatively different
        from one that can only do any single task.

Current information is crucial: having access to real-time search
        and up-to-date documentation makes the agent much more reliable for
        real-world development work where training data might be outdated.

Structured thinking matters: the code reasoning capability
        transforms the agent from a clever autocomplete into a thinking partner
        that can break down complex problems and explore alternative
        solutions.

Context is king: commercial agents like Claude Code are impressive
        partly because they maintain context across all these different tools.
        Your agent needs to remember what it learned from the test run when it's
        making file changes.

Specialisation matters: our agent works better for our specific
        codebase than general-purpose tools because it understands our patterns,
        conventions, and tool preferences. If it falls short in any area then we
        can go and make the required changes.




The Road Ahead

The CLI agent paradigm is still evolving rapidly. Some areas we're
      exploring:


AWS-specific tooling: the AWS Labs MCP servers
        (https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/) provide incredible depth for cloud-native
        development—from CloudWatch metrics to Lambda debugging to IAM policy
        analysis.

Workflow Enhancements: teaching the agent our common development
        workflows so it can handle routine tasks end-to-end. Connecting the agent
        to our project management tools so it can understand priorities and
        coordinate with team processes.

Benchmarking: Terminal Bench
        looks like a great dataset and leaderboard to test this toy agent against
        the big boys!




Why This Matters

CLI coding agents represent a fundamental
      shift from AI as a writing assistant to AI as a development partner.
      Unlike Copilot's autocomplete or ChatGPT's Q&A, these agents can:


Understand your entire project context

Execute tasks across multiple tools

Maintain state across complex workflows

Learn from your specific codebase and patterns


Building one yourself—even a simple version—gives you insights into
      where this technology is heading and how to make the most of commercial
      tools when they arrive.

The future of software development isn't just about writing code
      faster. It's about having an intelligent partner that understands your
      goals, your constraints, and your codebase well enough to help you think
      through problems and implement solutions collaboratively.

And the best way to understand that future? Build it yourself.

            Abstract:We report VLT spectroscopy of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) from $r_{\rm h}\!\simeq\!4.4$ to $2.85$ au using X-shooter (300-550 nm, $R\!\simeq\!3000$) and UVES (optical, $R\!\simeq\!35k-80k$). The coma is dust-dominated with a fairly constant red optical continuum slope ($\sim$21-22\%/1000Å). At $r_{\rm h}\!\simeq\!3.17$ au we derive $3\sigma$ limits of $Q({\rm OH})<7.76\times10^{23}\ {\rm s^{-1}}$, but find no indications for [O I], C$_2$, C$_3$ or NH$_2$. We report detection of CN emission and also detect numerous Ni I lines while Fe I remains undetected, potentially implying efficiently released gas-phase Ni. From our latest X-shooter measurements conducted on 2025-08-21 ($r_{\rm h} = 2.85$\,au) we measure production rates of $\log~Q(\mathrm{CN}) = 23.61\pm 0.05$ molecules s$^{-1}$ and $\log~Q$(Ni) $= 22.67\pm0.07$ atoms s$^{-1}$, and characterize their evolution as the comet approaches perihelion. We observe a steep heliocentric-distance scaling for the production rates $Q(\mathrm{Ni}) \propto r_h^{-8.43 \pm 0.79}$ and for $Q(\mathrm{CN}) \propto r_h^{-9.38 \pm 1.2}$, and predict a Ni-CO$_{(2)}$ correlation if the Ni I emission is driven by the carbonyl formation channel. Energetic considerations of activation barriers show that this behavior is inconsistent with direct sublimation of canonical metal/sulfide phases and instead favors low-activation-energy release from dust, e.g. photon-stimulated desorption or mild thermolysis of metalated organics or Ni-rich nanophases, possibly including Ni-carbonyl-like complexes. These hypotheses are testable with future coordinated ground-based and space-based monitoring as 3I becomes more active during its continued passage through the solar system.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
              You know what’s wrong with people?
                They’re too sure of themselves.
              Better to be wrong and own it than be right with caveats.
                Hard to build a personal brand out of nuance these days.
                People are attracted to confidence — however misplaced.
              But can you blame them? (People, that is)
                Working in software,
                the most annoying part of reaching Senior level
                is having to say “it depends” all the time.
                Much more fun getting to say
                “let’s ship it and iterate” as Staff or
                “that won’t scale” as a Principal.
              Yet, for all of our intellectual humility,
                why do we write vibe code like this?
              if currentLocation.distance(to: target) < 100 {
    print("You've arrived!") // But have you, really? 🤨
}

              GPS coordinates aren’t exact.
                They’re noisy. They’re approximate. They’re probabilistic.
                That horizontalAccuracy property tucked away in your CLLocation object
              is trying to tell you something important:
              you’re probably within that radius.
              Probably.
            A Bool, meanwhile, can be only true or false.
              That if statement needs to make a choice one way or another,
              but code like this doesn’t capture the uncertainty of the situation.
              If truth is light,
              then current programming models collapse the wavefunction too early.
            
              Picking the Right Abstraction
            In 2014, researchers at the University of Washington and Microsoft Research
              proposed a radical idea:
              What if uncertainty were encoded directly into the type system?
              Their paper,
              Uncertain<T>: A First-Order Type for Uncertain Data
              introduced a probabilistic programming approach that’s both
              mathematically rigorous and surprisingly practical.
            
            As you’d expect for something from Microsoft in the 2010s,
              the paper is implemented in C#.
              But the concepts translate beautifully to Swift.
            You can find my port on GitHub:
            import Uncertain
import CoreLocation

let uncertainLocation = Uncertain<CLLocation>.from(currentLocation)
let nearbyEvidence = uncertainLocation.distance(to: target) < 100
if nearbyEvidence.probability(exceeds: 0.95) {
    print("You've arrived!") // With 2σ confidence 🤓
}

            When you compare two Uncertain values,
              you don’t get a definitive true or false.
              You get an Uncertain<Bool> that represents the probability of the comparison being true.
            
            The same is true for other operators, too:
            // How fast did we run around the track?
let distance: Double = 400 // meters
let time: Uncertain<Double> = .normal(mean: 60, standardDeviation: 5.0) // seconds
let runningSpeed = distance / time // Uncertain<Double>

// How much air resistance?
let airDensity: Uncertain<Double> = .normal(mean: 1.225, standardDeviation: 0.1) // kg/m³
let dragCoefficient: Uncertain<Double> = .kumaraswamy(alpha: 9, beta: 3) // slightly right-skewed distribution
let frontalArea: Uncertain<Double> = .normal(mean: 0.45, standardDeviation: 0.05) // m²
let airResistance = 0.5 * airDensity * frontalArea * dragCoefficient * (runningSpeed * runningSpeed)

            This code builds a computation graph,
              sampling only when you ask for concrete results.
              The library uses
              Sequential Probability Ratio Testing (SPRT)
              to efficiently determine how many samples are needed —
              maybe a few dozen times for simple comparisons,
              scaling up automatically for complex calculations.
            // Sampling happens only when we need to evaluate
if ~(runningSpeed > 6.0) {
    print("Great pace for a 400m sprint!")
}
// SPRT might only need a dozen samples for this simple comparison

let sustainableFor5K = (runningSpeed < 6.0) && (airResistance < 50.0)
print("Can sustain for 5K: \(sustainableFor5K.probability(exceeds: 0.9))")
// Might use 100+ samples for this compound condition

            Using an abstraction like Uncertain<T> forces you to deal with uncertainty as a first-class concept
              rather than pretending it doesn’t exist.
              And in doing so, you end up with much smarter code.
            To quote Alan Kay:
            
              Point of view is worth 80 IQ points
                
            
            Before we dive deeper into probability distributions,
              let’s take a detour to Monaco and talk about
              Monte Carlo sampling.
            
              The Monte Carlo Method
            Behold, a classic slot machine (or “fruit machine” for our UK readers 🇬🇧):
            enum SlotMachine {
    static func spin() -> Int {
        let symbols = [
            "◻️", "◻️", "◻️",  // blanks
            "🍒", "🍋", "🍊", "🍇", "💎"
        ]

        // Spin three reels independently
        let reel1 = symbols.randomElement()!
        let reel2 = symbols.randomElement()!
        let reel3 = symbols.randomElement()!

        switch (reel1, reel2, reel3) {
        case ("💎", "💎", "💎"): return 100  // Jackpot!
        case ("🍒", "🍒", "🍒"): return 10
        case ("🍇", "🍇", "🍇"): return 5
        case ("🍊", "🍊", "🍊"): return 3
        case ("🍋", "🍋", "🍋"): return 2
        case ("🍒", _, _), // Any cherry
             (_, "🍒", _),
             (_, _, "🍒"):
            return 1
        default:
            return 0  // Better luck next time
        }
    }
}

            Should we play it?
            
            Now, we could work out these probabilities analytically —
              counting combinations,
              calculating conditional probabilities,
              maybe even busting out some combinatorics.
            Or we could just let the computer pull the lever a bunch and see what happens.
            
            let expectedPayout = Uncertain<Int> {
    SlotMachine.spin()
}.expectedValue(sampleCount: 10_000)
print("Expected value per spin: $\(expectedPayout)")
// Expected value per spin: ≈ $0.56

            At least we know one thing for certain:
              The house always wins.
            
              Beyond Simple Distributions
            While one-armed bandits demonstrate pure randomness,
              real-world applications often deal with more predictable uncertainty.
            Uncertain<T> provides a
              rich set of probability distributions:
            // Modeling sensor noise
let rawGyroData = 0.85  // rad/s
let gyroReading = Uncertain.normal(
    mean: rawGyroData,
    standardDeviation: 0.05  // Typical gyroscope noise in rad/s
)

// User behavior modeling
let userWillTapButton = Uncertain.bernoulli(probability: 0.3)

// Network latency with long tail
let apiResponseTime = Uncertain.exponential(rate: 0.1)

// Coffee shop visit times (bimodal: morning rush + afternoon break)
let morningRush = Uncertain.normal(mean: 8.5, standardDeviation: 0.5)  // 8:30 AM
let afternoonBreak = Uncertain.normal(mean: 15.0, standardDeviation: 0.8)  // 3:00 PM
let visitTime = Uncertain.mixture(
    of: [morningRush, afternoonBreak],
    weights: [0.6, 0.4]  // Slightly prefer morning coffee
)

            
          Uncertain<T> also provides comprehensive
            statistical operations:
          // Basic statistics
let temperature = Uncertain.normal(mean: 23.0, standardDeviation: 1.0)
let avgTemp = temperature.expectedValue() // about 23°C
let tempSpread = temperature.standardDeviation() // about 1°C

// Confidence intervals
let (lower, upper) = temperature.confidenceInterval(0.95)
print("95% of temperatures between \(lower)°C and \(upper)°C")

// Distribution shape analysis
let networkDelay = Uncertain.exponential(rate: 0.1)
let skew = networkDelay.skewness() // right skew
let kurt = networkDelay.kurtosis() // heavy tail

// Working with discrete distributions
let diceRoll = Uncertain.categorical([1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1])!
diceRoll.entropy()  // Randomness measure (~2.57)
(diceRoll + diceRoll).mode() // Most frequent outcome (7, perhaps?)

// Cumulative probability
if temperature.cdf(at: 25.0) < 0.2 {  // P(temp ≤ 25°C) < 20%
    print("Unlikely to be 25°C or cooler")
}

          The statistics are computed through sampling.
            The number of samples is configurable, letting you trade computation time for accuracy.
          
            Putting Theory to Practice
          Users don’t notice when things work correctly,
            but they definitely notice impossible behavior.
            When your running app claims they just sprinted at 45 mph,
            or your IRL meetup app shows someone 500 feet away when GPS accuracy is ±1000 meters,
            that’s a bad look 🤡
          So where do we go from here?
            Let’s channel our Senior+ memes from before for guidance.
          That Staff engineer saying “let’s ship it and iterate”
            is right about the incremental approach.
            You can migrate uncertain calculations piecemeal
            rather than rewriting everything at once:
          extension CLLocation {
    var uncertain: Uncertain<CLLocation> {
        Uncertain<CLLocation>.from(self)
    }
}

// Gradually migrate critical paths
let isNearby = (
    currentLocation.uncertain.distance(to: destination) < threshold
).probability(exceeds: 0.68)

          And we should consider the Principal engineer’s warning of “that won’t scale”.
            Sampling has a cost, and you should understand the
            computational overhead for probabilistic accuracy:
          // Fast approximation for UI updates
let quickEstimate = speed.probability(
    exceeds: walkingSpeed,
    maxSamples: 100
)

// High precision for critical decisions
let preciseResult = speed.probability(
    exceeds: walkingSpeed,
    confidenceLevel: 0.99,
    maxSamples: 10_000
)

          
          Start small.
            Pick one feature where GPS glitches cause user complaints.
            Replace your distance calculations with uncertain versions.
            Measure the impact.
          Remember:
            the goal isn’t to eliminate uncertainty —
            it’s to acknowledge that it exists and handle it gracefully.
            Because in the real world,
            nothing is certain except uncertainty itself.
          And perhaps,
            with better tools,
            we can finally stop pretending otherwise.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
Hello! I've got experience working on censorship circumvention for a major VPN provider (in the early 2020s).- First things first, you have to get your hands on actual VPN software and configs. Many providers who are aware of VPN censorship and cater to these locales distribute their VPNs through hard-to-block channels and in obfuscated packages. S3 is a popular option but by no means the only one, and some VPN providers partner with local orgs who can figure out the safest and most efficient ways to distribute a VPN package in countries at risk of censorship or undergoing censorship.- Once you've got the software, you should try to use it with an obfuscation layer.Obfs4proxy is a popular tool here, and relies on a pre-shared key to make traffic look like nothing special. IIRC it also hides the VPN handshake. This isn't a perfectly secure model, but it's good enough to defeat most DPI setups.Another option is Shapeshifter, from Operator (https://github.com/OperatorFoundation). Or, in general, anything that uses pluggable transports. While it's a niche technology, it's quite useful in your case.In both cases, the VPN provider must provide support for these protocols.- The toughest step long term is not getting caught using a VPN. By its nature, long-term statistical analysis will often reveal a VPN connection regardless of obfuscation and masking (and this approach can be cheaper to support than DPI by a state actor). I don't know the situation on the ground in Indonesia, so I won't speculate about what the best way to avoid this would be, long-term.I will endorse Mullvad as a trustworthy and technically competent VPN provider in this niche (n.b., I do not work for them, nor have I worked for them; they were a competitor to my employer and we always respected their approach to the space).
You've come to a wrong place to ask. Most people here (judging by recommendations of own VPN instances, Tor, Tailscale/other Wireguard-based VPNs, and Mullvad) don't have any experience with censorship circumvention.Just look for any VPNs that are advertised specifically for China, Russia, or Iran. These are the cutting edge tech, they may not be so privacy-friendly as Mullvad, but they will certainly work.
Furthermore, you can always run another VPN on top of that if you don’t trust the outer one with the actual plaintext traffic.
VPNs that are advertised are for-profit products, which means:1. They are in most cases run by national spy agencies.2. They will at least appear to work, i.e., they will provide you with access to websites that are blocked by the country you are in.  Depending on which country's spies run the system, they may actually work in the sense of hiding your traffic from that country's spies, or they may mark you as a specific target and save all your traffic for later analysis.My inclination is to prefer free (open-source) software that isn't controlled by a company which can use that control against its users.
It is absolutely self-evident that VPNs are considered high-value targets and that all spy agencies invest a chunk of resources to go after high-value targets.
I have a little, maybe enough to be dangerous. SSH won’t be sufficient to avoid all traffic analysis. Everyone can see how much traffic and the pattern of that traffic, which can leak info about the sort of things you’re doing.If you’re worried about ending up on a list, using things that look like VPNs while the VPNs are locked down is likely to do so.Also… your neighbors in Myanmar didn’t do a lockdown during the genocide and things got pretty fucking dire as a result. People have taken different lessons from this. I’m not sure what the right answer is, and which is the greater evil. Deplatforming and arresting people for inciting riots and hate speech is probably the best you can do to maintain life and liberty for the most people.
OP: look into VLESS (and similar).  And read up on ntc.party (through Google translate).  There are certain VPN providers that offer the protocol.
Mullvad worked OK in China for me recently. Sometimes I'd have to try a few different endpoints before it worked. Something built specifically to work in those places would probably be better, but it wasn't too much trouble. Not necessarily a recommendation, just sharing one data point.
I remember always needing obfuscation enabled in Mullvad, but it would work in the end (as you said, after trying a few endpoints).
- Tor. Pros: Reasonably user friendly and easy to get online, strong anonymity, free. Cons: a common target for censorship, not very fast, exit nodes are basically universally distrusted by websites.- Tailscale with Mullvad exit nodes. Pros: little setup but not more than installing and configuring a program, faster than Got, very versatile. Cons: deep packet inspection can probably identify your traffic is using Mullvad, costs some money.- Your own VPSs with Wireguard/Tailscale. Pros: max control, you control how fast you want it, you can share with people you care about (and are willing to support). Cons: the admin effort isn't huge but requires some skill, cost is flexible but probably 20-30$ per month minimum in hosting.
> - Tailscale with Mullvad exit nodesTailscale is completely unnecessary here, unless OP can't connect to Mullvad.net in the first place to sign up. But if the Indonesian government blocks Mullvad nodes, they'll be out of luck either way.> - Your own VPSs with Wireguard/TailscaleKeep in mind that from the POV of any websites you visit, you will be easily identifiable due to your static IP.My suggestion would be to rent a VPS outside Indonesia, set up Mullvad or Tor on the VPS and route all traffic through that VPS (and thereby through Mullvad/Tor). The fastest way to set up the latter across devices is probably to use the VPS as Tailscale exit node.
And using another VPN like NordVPN or ProtonVPN is probably in the same category as Mullvad, but worth being cautious. If it's free, you are the product. If you pay, you're still sending your traffic to a publicly (usually) known server of a VPN. That metadata alone in some jurisdictions can still put you in danger.Stay safe
This is good overview, I just wanted to add that a VPS IP is not a residential IP. You will encounter roadblocks when you try to access services if you appear to be coming from a VPS. Not that I had a better solution, just to clarify what you can expect.
I mean multiple VPSs for redundancy. Contabo is maybe the cheapest I've seen and it's like 3$ mtl for the smallest?
Tor also has anti-censorship mechanisms (snowflakes, ...). Depending on how aggressive the blocking is, Tor might be the most effective solution.
Yeah they can be cheap, but I would definitely recommend having at least 3 for redundancy. If one get shut down or it's IP blacklisted you still hopefully have a backup line to create a replacement.
IMO most people should have a VPS even if you don't need it for tunneling. Living without having a place to just leave services/files is very hard and often "free" services will hold your data hostage to manipulate your behavior which is annoying on a good day.
> cost is flexible but probably 20-30$ per month minimum in hosting.$4/month VPS from DigitalOcean is more than enough to handle a few users as per my experience. I have a Wireguard setup like this for more than a year. Didn't notice any issues.
Tunneling via SSH (ssh -D) is super easy to detect. The government doesn't need any sophisticated analysis to tell SSH connections for tunneling from SSH connections where a human is typing into a terminal.Countries like China have blocked SSH-based tunneling for years.It can also block sessions based on packet sizes: a typical web browsing session involves a short HTTP request and a long HTTP response, during which the receiving end sends TCP ACKs; but if the traffic traffic mimics the above except these "ACKs" are a few dozen bytes larger than a real ACK, it knows you are tunneling over a different protocol. This is how it detects the vast majority of VPNs.
15 years ago, I was using EC2 at work, and realized it was surprisingly easy to SSH into it in a way where all my traffic went through EC2. I could watch local Netflix when traveling. It was a de facto VPN.Details are not at the top of my mind these years later, but you can probably rig something up yourself that looks like regular web dev shit and not a known commercial VPN. I think there was a preference in Firefox or something.
I watched a season of Doctor Who that way back when the BBC were being precious about it. But Digital Ocean, so $5.
I'm currently traveling in Uzbekistan and am surprised that wireguard as a protocol is just blocked. I use wireguard with my own server, because usually governments just block well known VPN providers and a small individual server is fine.It's the first time I've encountered where the entire protocol is just blocked. Worth checking what is blocked and how before deciding which VPN provider to use.
> surprised that wireguard as a protocol is just blocked.Honestly this is the route I'm sure the UK will decide upon in the not too distant future.The job of us hackers is going to become more important...
WireGuard by itself has a pretty noticeable network pattern and I don't think they make obfuscating it a goal.There are some solutions that mimic the traffic and, say, route it through 443/TCP.
Wow, kinda crazy to think about a government blocking a protocol that just simply lets two computers talk securely over a tunnel.
Australia and UK might soon go down this path.Something quite depressing is if we (HN crowd) find workarounds, most regular folks won't have the budget/expertise to do so, so citizen journalism will have been successfully muted by government / big media.
Don't worry, you shouldn't underestimate the capability of society.I grew up in a pretty deprived area of the UK, and we all knew "a guy" who could get you access to free cable, or shim your electric line to bypass the meter, or get you pirated CD's and VHS' and whatever.There will always be "that guy down the pub" selling raspberry pi's with some deranged outdated firmware that runs a proxy for everything in the house or whatever. To be honest with you, I might end up being that guy for a bunch of people once I'm laid off from tech like the rest. :)
I am just waiting for red states in the US to try this to since their current laws requiring ID verification for porn sites aren’t effective.
> 90% of “citizen journalism” is (trash)You're right. But compared to what?I guess 99% of mainstream "journalism" is irrelevant and/or inaccurate, hence citizen journalism is a 10x improvement in accuracy and relevancy! Not 10% better, 900% better! This makes a huge difference to our society as a whole and in our daily lives!But this misses the most important point which is that the user should have the right to choose for themselves what they say and read. Making citizen journalism unduly burdensome deprives everyone of that choice.
Preach comrade!Those citizen journalists with their primary sources, disgusting.Thats nothing but propaganda.Remember it doesnt matter what the video shows, it only matters who showed it to you.
>Remember it doesnt matter what the video shows, it only matters who showed it to youIn an age of mass media (where there's a video for anything) or now one step further synthetic media knowing who makes something is much more important than the content, given that what's being shown can be created on demand. Propaganda in the modern world is taking something that actually happened, and then framing it as an authentic piece of information found "on the street", twisting its context."what's in the video" is now largely pointless, and anyone who isn't gullible will obviously always focus on where the promoter of any material wants to direct the audiences attention to, or what they want to deflect from.
There are many instances of Mastodon, and due to its federated nature, you can use any of them to access it, and even host your own.
Sure, but if you have an account on a different server, you can still see things posted on mastodon.social if you have followed someone there.
Very possible, though many of our users are saying that in network environments where WireGuard is blocked they were able to use Obscura.
Nations severing peoples connections to the world is awful. I'm so sorry for the chaos in general, and the state doing awful things both.Go on https://lowendbox.com and get a cheap cheap cheap VPS. Use ssh SOCKS proxy in your browser to send web traffic through it.Very unfancy, a 30+ year old solution, but uses such primitive internet basics that it will almost certainly never fail. Builtin to everything but Windows (which afaik doesn't have an ssh client built-in).Tailscale is also super fantastic.
WireGuard should still work. Tons of different providers. I trust Mullvad but ProtonVPN has a free tier. If they start blocking WireGuard, check out v2ray and xray-core. If those get blocked... that means somehow they're restricting all HTTPS traffic going out of the country
I'm in a similar boat (China). I use an OpenWRT router (GL.iNet Beryl AX) with the Passwall extension, paired with a VPN subscription from Wannaflix[0]. This setup routes all my devices through the VPN automatically, so I don't have to configure each one individually - especially useful for devices where VPN setup isn't even possible.[0] https://wannaflix.net/aff.php?aff=1013 (affiliate link)
In case known VPN providers are blocked you can pick a small VPS from a hoster like Hetzner and setup your own VPN.
Your first option until you get settled is to use an SSH reverse proxy:    ssh -R 9999 user@my.server

Then configure your browser to use local port 9999 for your SOCKS5 proxy.This gets you a temporarily usable system and if you can tunnel this way successfully installing some WireGuard or OpenVPN stuff will likely work.
In this scenario, Chinese have very rich experience.
you need to use the advance proxy tool like clash ,v2ray, shadowsocks etc.
Use the Tor browser window in Brave. It's nowhere near as anonymous as the Tor browser, but the built in ad blocking makes browsing via Tor usable. And that's what you and your compatriots are interested in.Prepare to fill in Cloudflare captchas all day, but that's what it takes to have a bit of privacy nowadays.
Set up a VM on AWS/azure/gcp/... in the desired cell, install a VPN server and done. Once you have automation in place it takes ~2 minutes to start, you can run it on demand so you can pay per minute.
I'd recommend using Outline - it's a one click setup that lets you provision your own VPN on a cloud provider (or your own hardware).Since you get to pick where the hardware is located and it is just you (or you and a small group of friends & family) using the VPN, blocking is more difficult.If you don't want the hassle of using your own hardware you can rent a Digital Ocean droplet for <$5 per month.https://getoutline.org/
Make your own VPN using a VPS and something like openvpn.Not every website will allow it, but it should get you access to more than you have now.
there is a major protest currently happening due to the legislative body representative just giving themselves a monthly domicile stipend of ~$3300 on top of their salaries (yes, multiple), while the average people earned ~$330 monthly. the information about the protest are not broadcasted on local TVs, so the only spread of information is through social media. i guess since a lot of people went around it using VPN, the gov decided to block it too.
The official word is to counter gambling. Lately the government is not really popular after some decisions that could be interpreted as authoritative, and as citizens have spoken out about it online, causing more voices to join and protests erupting..So well, my guess is they're trying to control it.
In this case the blockage will probably just be up for a few days, until the protests calmed down.Other than that: tor
All the various proxy solutions offered are good (although the simplest ones - like squid - haven't been mentioned yet). You can also use a remote desktop or even just ssh -Y me@remote-server "firefox"
OP, you can rent a VPS from a reputable and cheap provider within the NA region - OVH, Vultr, Linode etc. are decent. Also check out lowendtalk.comThen, setup Tailscale on the server. You can VPN into it and essentially browse the internet as someone from NA.
What I'm worried most are that most people are not even aware of what is DNS and how to change it.I can't imagine those who are caught in the chaos with only their phone and unable to access information that could help them to be safe.
Generally speaking, the general population that wants to use blocked services will develop enough technical know-how to circumvent it. The biggest risk is that there are bad actors giving malicious advice and to such learners, looking to defraud or otherwise exploit them.
A proxy service like shadow socks works. There are thousands of providers for $X/month for a decent amount of traffic
I was wondering something like this but in a different capacity.What with certain countries (they know who they are) and their hatred for encryption, it got me wondering how people would communicate securely if - for example - Signal/WhatsApp/etc. pulled out and the country wound up disconnecting the submarine cables to "keep $MORAL_PANIC_OF_THE_DAY safe."How would people communicate securely and privately in a domestic situation like that?
In person or not at all.At that point you've essentially lost.You either hope another country sees value in spreading you some democracy, or you rise up and hope others join you.Or not and you accept the protection the state is graciously providing to you.
Just please be safe and necessarily paranoidOne way they tend to "solve" workarounds is making examples of people
It is not a real URI... lolThe point was to include something clowns can't filter without incurring collateral costs, and wrapping the ssh protocol in standard web traffic. =3
Aren't there local (online or print) newspapers to get news from, as an alternative to Discord? Hope I'm not asking a dumb question
In countries where it comes to government blocking/censoring internet traffic, traditional media is cleared of all dissent and fully controlled long before. Last stages of that are happening in my country, Serbia, currently.
Right, that makes sense. Did some looking up and nonfree press seems to be indeed the case for Indonesia: https://rsf.org/en/country/indonesiaIt's a mixed bag apparently, free press is technically legal since 1998 but selective prosecution and harassment of those actually uncovering issues (mainly becomes clear in the last section, "Safety")Tried looking up Serbia next on that website but got a cloudflare block. I'm a robot now...
It's not a dumb question at all. Level on hn really got down lately if you're getting downvoted.Think about it Aachen. If the government has enough power to censor internet traffic, that what was the first thing it censored? Which media is traditionally known for being censored or just speaking propaganda? That's the classical newspapers. It's not uncommon in authoritarian countries for editors to need state to sign off on the day's paper. And if not that, articles are signed and publishers are known. They will auto-censor to avoid problems. Just like creators on YouTube don't comment on this one country's treatment of civilians to avoid problems.
I can relate to this because my country has an election soon and I'm sure we wont have internet for 3 - 5 days then.
Android doesn't come with system wide socks proxy support, and i couldn't find an open source app for it either. Is anyone aware of one?Nonetheless this is a surprisingly simple and bullet proof solution: SSH, that's not vpn boss, i need it for work.
Outline is an open source shadowsocks client, and you provision your own server to act as the proxy.  You can use it against any Shadowsocks server you want, and the protocol makes it look like regular https traffic.https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-appsAndroid & iOS & Linux & Mac & Windowstheir server installer will help set up a proxy for users that aren't familiar with shadowsocks, too
Tor should be pretty good even for environments where they crack down on VPNs, although it can be a bit slow, at least it works.
Yeah, sucks, but really should find better places for people to gather regardless, if you're in that sort of environment.
How is this practical advice in a thread where someone mentions that the clampdown happened without notice?The "shoulda done..." advice isn't useful in the slightest, and I'd argue is malicious with how often it's done simply to satiate a poster's ego.
Blocking Twitter is a good start, now Facebook, Instagram, Whatsup and TikTok.This is a good start but more should be blocked. Then force ISP to block ads.Not just for Indonesia but all countries. But we still have a lot more to do to fix the web.
The issue with that is where do they draw the line. Next thing you know each country becomes North Korea.]]></content:encoded>

        Classes began this week for students at the University at Buffalo, a public research university in western New York, but there were about 750 fewer international students on campus than expected.The new students who did make it gathered for a welcome from the school's dean of students. "We know you have had to overcome hurdles to be here – especially this summer, with visas," Tomás Aguirre told the assembled students, representing more than 100 countries. "And I just wanted you to know that we are so glad you were able to make it."
      
      Related Story: NPRThe sentiment was common among the students, too. "For me, the main thing is that I got here," says Daria Tofan, a freshman from Romania, who didn't get her student visa until about a week before orientation. "It was awful."Over the last six months the Trump Administration has clamped down on international student visas, temporarily pausing and then revamping the student visa interview process and bringing more scrutiny to the vetting system. That led to long delays and meant many accepted students couldn't get appointments at embassies or consulates in time for the start of the fall semester."I only had one goal from the beginning, it was to go to college here, so if I didn't reach that goal it would have been very painful," explains Shivaka Sing, a freshman psychology major from New Delhi. When she got accepted to Buffalo she joined a group chat of other students from India. Many of them couldn't get a visa appointment in time to start the fall semester with her. "Most of them are now transferring to the U.K. because of the visa situation," she says. "Some are planning to defer to the spring semester."Fewer International students on campuses across the country this fallAt the University at Buffalo, the overall decline of about 15% of international students is happening mostly in graduate programs, especially in the STEM fields. But it's not just Buffalo. Universities all over the country are experiencing similar drops. Arizona State University reported a fall semester decline for the first time since 2020. Declines have been announced at universities in Texas, Missouri and Illinois. The state of Massachusetts is expecting about 10,000 fewer new international students this year."One would describe the situation with international students to be very much in flux with tremendous levels of uncertainty," says Fanta Aw, who leads the Association of International Educators, or NAFSA.Last year more than a million international students studied in the U.S., contributing about $43 billion into the U.S. economy. But Aw's organization predicts a drop of about 150,000 new international students this fall, leading to a decline of about 15% overall. If that happens, local economies could lose as much as $7 billion in spending and more than 60,000 jobs.
      
      Related Story: NPR"The loss of international students will lead to a significant downturn in innovation," Aw says. "This will affect communities large and small."The decline is also happening at a time when other countries, like the U.K. and South Korea have stepped up to fill the gap.Mixed messages from federal government on student visas President Trump has said he wants to keep campus safe. The State Department has revoked about 6,000 student visas so far this year, citing threats of academic espionage, support for terrorist groups in Gaza and criminal behavior.And in May, the State Department said it would "aggressively revoke" visas for Chinese students and add additional scrutiny for future visa applications from China.But in recent days Trump has signaled a shift. This week, Trump told reporters he planned to double the amount of Chinese students studying in the U.S. He defended those comments a day later, saying "I like that their [China] students come here. I like that other countries students' come here. And you know what would happen if they didn't? Our college system would go to hell very quickly."
      
      Related Story: NPRStill, President Trump and conservative leaders have said they want to make sure that foreign students aren't taking spots that could go to American citizens. But leaders at the University at Buffalo said at least at their institution, that's not something U.S. families need to worry about."We recruit all qualified students to the University at Buffalo and are eager for all of them to attend," explains Scott Webber, the provost there. "I would assure you that our international students do not take spots, you know for other students who are qualified to attend and would be successful here." Total enrollment is actually up at the university overall, and there are still 4,000 international students on campus this year.International students bring money and culture to campuses
      
      Related Story: NPR"What they bring to the university is this incredibly rich, diverse cultural experience for students who may not have ever been outside of New York state," says Webber. "They really bring a different flavor to campus."International students also contribute financially to universities, as many pay full tuition. That revenue has the potential to benefit American students, by funding things like financial aid or stabilizing tuition costs.As one of the lucky ones who made it to campus at the University at Buffalo, Shivika Sing, says finally being done with the visa process, and arriving on campus has meant she can focus on finding her classrooms, making sure she has all her books and supplies, and getting her dorm room set up."I bought a pink Lilo & Stitch soft toy to sleep with," she says. It is one of three stuffed animals on her bed. Those toys are key, she says, to warding off the homesickness that comes from being seven thousand miles from home.

I'm from South Africa.SHIVIKA SINGH: My name is Shivika (ph), and I'm from India.FADEL: Those students made it to school in Buffalo, New York, after a rocky summer, when the Trump administration temporarily paused and then revamped student visa interviews. NPR's Elissa Nadworny reports from Buffalo.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Welcome. We're so excited that you're here on campus.ELISSA NADWORNY, BYLINE: At orientation at the University at Buffalo, a public research university in western New York, newly arrived international students are getting their campus IDs...UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: So just smile. I'm going to take it on three. One, two, three.NADWORNY: ...And feeling relieved they made it to campus.TOFAN: At least we're here. For me, the main thing is that I got here.NADWORNY: Daria Tofan (ph) from Romania didn't get her student visa until a week before orientation.TOFAN: To get scheduled for classes, you need to provide the immigration documents.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey HN! We are Windsor and Cathy of Dedalus Labs (https://www.dedaluslabs.ai/), a cloud platform for developers to build agentic AI applications. Our SDK allows you to connect any LLM to any MCP tools – local or hosted by us. No Dockerfiles or YAML configs required.Here’s a demo: https://youtu.be/s2khf1Monho?si=yiWnZh5OP4HQcAwL&t=11Last October, I was trying to build a stateful code execution sandbox in the cloud that LLMs could tool-call into. This was before MCP was released, and let’s just say it was super annoying to build… I was thinking to myself the entire time “Why can’t I just pass in `tools=code_execution` to the model and just have it…work?Even with MCP, you’re stuck running local servers and handwiring API auth and formatting across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc. before you can ship anything. Every change means redeploys, networking configs, and hours lost wrangling AWS. Hours of reading docs and wrestling with cloud setup is not what you want when building your product!Dedalus simplifies this to just one API endpoint, so what used to take 2 weeks of setup can take 5 minutes. We allow you to upload streamable HTTP MCP servers to our platform. Once deployed, we offer OpenAI-compatible SDKs that you can drop into your codebase to use MCP-powered LLMs. The idea is to let anyone, anywhere, equip their LLMs with powerful tools for function calling.The code you write looks something like this:  python
  client = Dedalus()
  runner = DedalusRunner(client)
  
  result = runner.run(
    input=prompt,
    tools=[tool_1, tool_2],
    mcp_servers=["author/server-1”, “author/server-2”],
    model=["openai/gpt-4.1”, “anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514”],  # Defaults to first model in list
    stream=True,
  )
  stream_sync(result)  # Streams result, supports tool calling too

Our docs start at https://docs.dedaluslabs.ai. Here’s a simple Hello World example: https://docs.dedaluslabs.ai/examples/01-hello-world. For basic tool execution, see https://docs.dedaluslabs.ai/examples/02-basic-tools. There are lots more examples on the site, including more complex ones like using the Open Meteo MCP to do weather forecasts: https://docs.dedaluslabs.ai/examples/use-case/weather-foreca....There are still a bunch of issues in the MCP landscape, no doubt. One big one is authentication (we joke that the “S” in MCP stands for “security”). MCP servers right now are expected to act as both the authentication server and the resource server. That is too much to ask of server writers. People just want to expose a resource endpoint and be done.Still, we are bullish on MCP. Current shortcomings are not irrecoverable, and we expect future amendments to resolve them. We think that useful AI agents are bound to be habitual tool callers, and MCP is a pretty decent way to equip models with tools.We aren’t quite yet at the stateful code execution sandbox that I wanted last October, but we’re getting there! Shipping secure and stateful MCP servers is high on our priority list, and we’ll be launching our auth solution next month. We’re also working on an MCP marketplace, so people can monetize their tools, while we handle billing and rev-share.We’re big on open sourcing things and have these SDKs so far (MIT licensed):https://github.com/dedalus-labs/dedalus-sdk-pythonhttps://github.com/dedalus-labs/dedalus-sdk-typescripthttps://github.com/dedalus-labs/dedalus-sdk-gohttps://github.com/dedalus-labs/dedalus-openapiWe would love feedback on what you guys think are the biggest barriers that keep you from integrating MCP servers or using tool calling LLMs into your current workflow.Thanks HN!]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[“The generator is down, and we don’t have enough ice to continue icing the remains of soldiers killed in action. How much longer, ma’am?”That’s the message I received while deployed to Balad, Iraq, as an Air Force second lieutenant. I was overseeing generators in theater, and the one powering the mortuary facility had failed. The clock was ticking. I didn’t have HVAC expertise or the necessary parts. The only viable backup generator was on the other side of the country.I had two choices: initiate a long contracting process to hire a civilian technician, or send a convoy across Iraq for the backup unit — risking lives to get it there. We chose the convoy. We got lucky.But what if we hadn’t?That question — what if — has stuck with me. Because this wasn’t a theoretical delay. This was a real moment where a failure in repair readiness jeopardized our ability to care for the fallen with dignity and speed. And I know it wasn’t the only one.That’s why I support the right to repair.I’ve lived what it means when a piece of equipment fails at a critical time. I know how far away contractors can be when you need them most. And I know what our service members are capable of — if we trust them with the tools and training to do the job.Military right to repair means giving service members the ability to fix their own gear — on base, in the field or downrange — without having to wait on outside contractors. That includes access to the tools, parts and manuals they need to do the job. Right now, private companies can put restrictions on military equipment that block troops from making even basic repairs. That slows everything down, costs taxpayers more, and in the worst cases, puts lives at risk.This year, Congress has a chance to change that.Thanks to a growing, bipartisan push — including new legislation led by Senators Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Tim Sheehy, R-Mont. — right-to-repair reforms are being considered in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). These two senators, from opposite parties, have made it clear: The Pentagon is wasting billions, and service members are bearing the cost.Including the Warrior Right to Repair Act in the NDAA is a critical step forward for readiness, national security and the safety of warfighters downrange, and it’s taxpayer friendly. Mission readiness depends on the ability to make repairs in the field. Service members need the tools, parts and authority to make immediate fixes themselves, without having to navigate red tape.When our military relies too heavily on private contractors for basic maintenance, that dependence gives outside companies leverage over military operations, introducing profit motives into urgent repair decisions. Our armed forces should operate on military timelines — not corporate maintenance schedules.Warfighter safety is directly tied to the reliability of our gear. In high-risk environments, a delay in repairing a critical piece of equipment can mean the difference between life and death. Right to repair is smart, responsible fiscal policy. Sustainment costs can represent up to 70% of a weapons system’s lifetime expense. When troops are blocked from doing basic repairs, costs increase and transparency disappears. That’s a waste of taxpayer dollars. Finally, repairing our own equipment is critical to inculcating and maintaining a military culture of adaptability and self-reliance. We train service members to be problem solvers. Empowering them to repair their own gear isn’t just smart policy — it reflects the values we instill in every recruit. Right to repair honors that ethos and ensures we treat service members like professionals, not passive end-users.We wouldn’t tell a Marine they can’t clean their rifle without a manufacturer present. So why are we telling our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines they can’t fix a comms system or power supply?I’m grateful that, in that moment in Iraq, we had a backup option — even if it meant launching a risky cross-country convoy. But what if we hadn’t? What if that second generator didn’t exist or wasn’t reachable in time? Without immediate repair options, the remains of our fallen could have become unrecognizable. The families who entrusted us with their loved ones would have suffered consequences that no one should have to imagine.That’s what’s at stake when service members can’t repair the equipment they rely on. It’s not just about saving money or avoiding delays — it’s about honoring our dead, protecting the living and giving our troops the flexibility they need to do the right thing when it counts. Right to repair is about readiness. It’s about humanity. And it’s long overdue. That’s why I’m calling on Congress — and especially House Armed Services Committee leaders like Alabama Republican Rep. Mike Rogers — to include military right-to-repair provisions in this year’s NDAA by supporting the bipartisan Warrior Right to Repair Act.Retired Lt. Col.

            <description><![CDATA[A case study of Gleam in production at Strand]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Strand is a marketing agency based in London,
UK. The company specialises in copywriting and content creation for many of the
world’s largest enterprise technology companies, running marketing programmes
that produce hundreds of white papers, case studies, blog posts and articles
every year.
Challenge
For many years, Strand has relied on a custom-built project management system
to support the operational aspects of its business—creating projects, tracking
activities and managing documents. However, managing the financial aspects of
project management had always been a more manual process, using spreadsheets to
ensure that billable work was assigned to the correct purchase orders and
invoices.
“Just before the pandemic, we decided to build a new financial management
system,” recalls Ed Kelly, Director of Technology at Strand. “It turned out to
be a very timely decision. When we had to pivot to remote working, the fact
that everyone could track their billable work in a centralised system helped us
keep the business on track.”
The new system quickly became an integral part of Strand’s daily workflow, and
users began requesting new features. As the application gradually grew larger
and more complex, the company’s small development team wanted to ensure that
the system would remain reliable, maintainable and scalable.
“Almost by accident, what we launched as a prototype became a business-critical
application,” says Ed Kelly. “Our development resources are limited, so our top
priority was to make sure the system would just run forever without needing
constant maintenance. At the same time, we also wanted to keep the codebase
simple and approachable, so it’s easy for developers to dive back into when
they need to make a change. The challenge for us was to build and maintain this
business-critical system cost-effectively with our lean development team.”
Solution
As a small business, Strand is not afraid to innovate. “We do have systems that
are written in mainstream programming languages like Python and JavaScript, but
our strategy is to pick the best tool for the job, not just the most popular,”
explains Ed Kelly. “Gleam was a good fit for our requirements.”
The features of Gleam that appealed to Strand were its robustness and
maintainability, its combination of modern language features with access to a
broad ecosystem of battle-tested, production-grade libraries, and its strong
focus on developer experience.
Safety and reliability
“Gleam is a safe language,” explains Ed Kelly. “Broadly speaking, if you write
a program in pure Gleam, it’s guaranteed not to crash. And in cases where you
need to interface with code written in other, less-safe languages, there is a
second layer of protection provided by Gleam’s runtime platform, the BEAM.”
The BEAM was developed by Ericsson in the 1980s as a fault-tolerant platform
for managing large telephone switches that need to handle thousands of calls
simultaneously and can never be taken offline for maintenance. The central idea
is that the platform is able to divide applications into thousands or even
millions of lightweight processes. Each process runs independently, and
processes can communicate by sending messages to each other. If an individual
process crashes, it can be restarted automatically without affecting any of the
other processes.
“The application that we’ve built is composed of several services that interact
with the outside world,” explains Ed Kelly. “For example, we have a service
that periodically downloads currency exchange rates from the UK government’s
website, and another that syncs data with our project management system. The
BEAM ensures that if there’s some unforeseen problem with any of these external
services, it won’t crash our application.”
Modernity and pragmatism
Gleam is designed to be a simple language that provides powerful features while
remaining resolutely practical. “It gives us access to features from more
academic programming languages, but it makes them approachable,” says Ed Kelly.
“The language is small—an experienced developer can learn it in an
afternoon—and there is a strong focus on only having one way to do things. That
means you can onboard new developers into a Gleam codebase quickly.”
Because Gleam code runs on the BEAM, developers also have easy access to
thousands of high-quality software libraries. “The Gleam library ecosystem is
growing rapidly year-on-year,” says Ed Kelly. “And when we need to, we can also
reach for 40 years’ worth of battle-tested libraries written in other BEAM
languages such as Erlang and Elixir. The language prioritises pragmatism over
purity, which helps us get things done.”
Developer experience
In Strand’s experience, Gleam’s developer tools are second to none. “When you
download Gleam, you get all the tooling in a single package,” says Ed Kelly.
“It integrates with your code editor to provide features like formatting,
suggestions and autocomplete. The error messages are really friendly and
helpful—when you make a mistake, Gleam will often tell you what you should have
written. And it’s really fast—the days of going for a coffee break while you
wait for your code to build are over.”
He adds: “We’re heading into a new age of AI-assisted coding, and right now,
it’s difficult to predict how that will play out. But if I had to place a bet,
I would say that in the long run, AIs are more likely to generate high-quality
code in a language like Gleam. Gleam makes it quick and easy for AIs to check
their code, get instant feedback, and iterate. That should be an advantage
compared to languages that are slow to build, have cryptic error messages, and
can’t catch mistakes at build-time.”
Incremental adoption
For Strand, introducing Gleam into its codebase was a low-risk, incremental
process. “We started with just one service—our integration with the UK
government’s currency exchange rate API,” says Ed Kelly. “We were so pleased
with how it turned out that we then rewrote some of our other services in
Gleam. And recently, we’ve decided to give Gleam an even more important role by
replacing the whole part of the backend that talks to our database. We’re very
confident that this will give us a safer and more maintainable codebase
overall.”
Results
As one of the first companies in the world to run Gleam in production, Strand
took a risk. Two years later, the development team is delighted with the
decision. “Since we started, the language has really matured and reached a
stable state,” says Ed Kelly. “The community has grown massively and there’s a
real buzz around the language. It’s even starting to be recognised by
mainstream industry analysts like Thoughtworks in their Technology
Radar. I
think today, Gleam is a safe and solid choice for companies to use in
production.”
Since go-live, the Gleam code within Strand’s application has been rock-solid.
“We’ve had zero Gleam-related crashes, and even when there have been issues
with other parts of the system, the BEAM has kept everything running,” says Ed
Kelly. “We’ve been able to fix problems without our users even noticing that
anything was wrong.”
The simplicity of the language and the sophistication of the development tools
also help to keep the codebase maintainable. “Even when we haven’t looked at
the codebase for a few weeks, it’s easy to get back into it,” says Ed Kelly.
“The language and tooling gently push you to use a consistent, idiomatic style,
and to write clearly and simply without trying to be too clever. So, we don’t
have to spend time puzzling out what our past selves were trying to do with the
code that we wrote six months ago.”
He concludes: “Adopting a new language is always a gamble, but Gleam has paid
off. The belt-and-braces approach to safety and fault-tolerance has given us a
system that just works, reliably, day in and day out, without constant
babysitting and maintenance. For a team like ours, with many other priorities
and projects we need to work on, the confidence that Gleam gives us is worth
its weight in gold.”

            <description><![CDATA[Mobile shell that supports roaming and intelligent local echo. Like SSH secure shell, but allows mobility and more responsive and robust.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[


  
    
      
        
        (mobile shell)
        Remote terminal application that
        allows roaming, supports intermittent connectivity, and provides intelligent local echo and line editing of user keystrokes.
        Mosh is a replacement for interactive SSH terminals. It's more robust and responsive, especially over Wi-Fi, cellular, and long-distance links.
        Mosh is free software, available for GNU/Linux, BSD, macOS, Solaris, Android, Chrome, and iOS.

        Change IP. Stay connected.
        Mosh automatically roams as you move between Internet
        connections. Use Wi-Fi on the train, Ethernet in a hotel,
        and LTE on a beach: you'll stay logged in. Most network
        programs lose their connections after roaming,
        including SSH and Web apps like Gmail. Mosh
        is different.
      
      
        Makes for sweet dreams.
        With Mosh, you can put your laptop to sleep and wake it
        up later, keeping your connection intact. If your
        Internet connection drops, Mosh will warn you — but
        the connection resumes when network service
        comes back.
      
      
        Get rid of network lag.
        SSH waits for the server's reply before showing you your
        own typing. That can make for a lousy user interface. Mosh
        is different: it gives an instant response to typing,
        deleting, and line editing. It does this adaptively and
        works even in full-screen programs like emacs and vim. On
        a bad connection, outstanding predictions are underlined
        so you won't be misled.
        
      
      
        No privileged code. No daemon.
        You don't need to be the superuser to install or run
        Mosh. The client and server are executables run by an
        ordinary user and last only for the life of the
        connection.
      
  
  
      
        Same login method.
        Mosh doesn't listen on network ports or authenticate
         users. The mosh client logs in to the server via
         SSH, and users present the same credentials (e.g.,
         password, public key) as before. Then Mosh runs the
         mosh-server remotely and connects to it over UDP.
      
      
        Runs inside your terminal, but better.
        Mosh is a command-line program, like ssh. You can use it
        inside xterm, gnome-terminal, urxvt, Terminal.app, iTerm,
        emacs, screen, or tmux. But mosh was designed from scratch
        and supports just one character set: UTF-8. It fixes Unicode
        bugs in other terminals and in SSH.
      
      
        Control-C works great.
        Unlike SSH, mosh's UDP-based protocol handles packet loss
          gracefully, and sets the frame rate based on network conditions. Mosh
          doesn't fill up network buffers, so Control-C always works
          to halt a runaway process.

      Windows
      
      There is no "native" mosh executable for Windows available at this time. The Chrome version of Mosh is the easiest way to use mosh on Windows.
    
  
    
      Cygwin
      C:\> setup.exe -q mosh
      Mosh on Cygwin uses OpenSSH and is suitable for Windows users with advanced SSH configurations.
	  
	  Mosh is not compatible with Cygwin's built-in Windows Console terminal emulation.  You will need to run Mosh from a full-featured terminal program such as mintty, rxvt, PuTTY, or an X11 terminal emulator.
    
  

  
  

  
  
  
  
      Ubuntu 12.04 and later
            $ sudo apt-get install mosh
      The ppa:keithw/mosh-dev PPA tracks the development version of Mosh.

  Replaces interactive SSH. Instant keystroke response, robust to roaming. But you'll need working UDP.

  
    
      Typical usage
      $ mosh chewbacca.norad.mil
      Mosh will log the user in via SSH, then start a connection on a UDP port between 60000 and 61000.
    

    
      Different username
      $ mosh potus@ackbar.bls.gov
    

    
      Server binary outside path
      $ mosh --server=/tmp/mosh-server r2d2
      The user can specify an alternate path for the mosh-server on the remote host. The server binary can even
        be installed in the user's home directory.
    
  

  

    
      Selecting Mosh UDP port
      $ mosh -p 1234 darth
      Useful when the server is behind a port-forwarder or NAT.
    

          
            Selecting SSH port
            $ mosh --ssh="ssh -p 2222" figrindan

      Disable instant echo
      $ mosh --predict=never niennunb
      The -n switch is a synonym. By contrast,
      passing --predict=always or -a
      will enable instant local echo even on low-delay
      links.
    

    
      With a command
      $ mosh pello -- screen -dr
      This reattaches to a long-running screen session.
    
  

  Ending the connection

  Normally, logout or exit on the remote host will close
    the session. Mosh accepts the escape sequence Ctrl-^
    .  (typically typed with Control-Shift-6, then a
    period) to end the connection forcibly. To send a
    literal Ctrl-^, type Ctrl-^ ^.

  Papers

  
    
      The  Mosh research paper describes the
        design and evaluation of Mosh in more detail than you may
        want.
        The paper was presented at the
      2012 USENIX
        Annual Technical Conference, held June 13–15, 2012, in
        sunny Boston, Mass.

      In addition,
the  Mosh: A State-of-the-Art Good
Old-Fashioned Mobile Shell essay gives further information about
the design principles behind Mosh, including the "prophylactic
retransmission" technique. The essay was published
in USENIX
;login: magazine, August 2012.

      “ISO 2022 locking escape
    sequences oh flying spaghetti monster please kill me
    now.” — actual USENIX peer review from the
            Mosh paper.
        

        (Why you should trust Mosh with your remote terminal needs: we
        worry about details so obscure, even USENIX reviewers don't want to
            hear about them.)

      
    

    
      
    
  

  How Mosh works

  
  Remote-shell protocols traditionally work by conveying a
    byte-stream from the server to the client, to be interpreted
    by the client's terminal. (This includes TELNET, RLOGIN, and
    SSH.) Mosh works differently and at a different layer. With
      Mosh, the server and client both maintain a snapshot of
      the current screen state. The problem becomes one of
      state-synchronization: getting the client to the
      most recent server-side screen as efficiently as
      possible.

    This is accomplished using a new protocol called the
      State Synchronization Protocol, for which Mosh is the
      first application. SSP runs over UDP, synchronizing the
      state of any object from one host to another. Datagrams
      are encrypted and authenticated
      using AES-128
      in OCB3 mode. While SSP takes care of the networking
      protocol, it is the implementation of the object being
      synchronized that defines the ultimate semantics of the
      protocol.

    Roaming with SSP becomes easy: the client sends datagrams
      to the server with increasing sequence numbers, including
      a "heartbeat" at least once every three seconds. Every time
      the server receives an authentic packet from the client
      with a sequence number higher than any it has previously
      received, the IP source address of that packet becomes the
      server's new target for its outgoing packets. By doing
      roaming “statelessly” in this manner, roaming works in and
      out of NATs, even ones that may themselves be
      roaming. Roaming works even when the client is not aware
      that its Internet-visible IP address has changed. The
      heartbeats allow Mosh to inform the user when it hasn't
      heard from the server in a while (unlike SSH, where users
      may be unaware of a dropped connection until they try to
      type).

    Mosh runs two copies of SSP, one in each direction of the
      connection. The connection from client to server
      synchronizes an object that represents the keys typed by
      the user, and with TCP-like semantics. The connection from
      server to client synchronizes an object that represent the
      current screen state, and the goal is always to convey the
      client to the most recent server-side state, possibly
    skipping intermediate frames.

    Because SSP works at the object layer and can control the
      rate of synchronization (in other words, the frame rate),
      it does not need to send every byte it receives from the
      application. That means Mosh can regulate the frames so as
      not to fill up network buffers, retaining the
      responsiveness of the connection and making sure Control-C
      always works quickly. Protocols that must send every byte
      can't do this.

  Careful terminal emulation

    One benefit of working at the terminal layer
      was the opportunity to build a clean UTF-8 terminal
      emulator from scratch. Mosh fixes several Unicode bugs in
      existing terminals and in SSH, and was designed as a fresh
      start to try to be robust and correct even for
      pathological inputs.


  Tricky unicode

  Only Mosh and the OS X Terminal correctly handle a Unicode combining character in the first column.
    
      
        xterm: circumflex on wrong letter.
        GNOME Terminal: no circumflex at all.
      
      
        OS X Terminal.app gets it right.
        Mosh gets it right too.
      
    
  

  ISO 2022 locking escapes

  Only Mosh will never get stuck in hieroglyphs when a nasty program writes to the terminal. (See Markus Kuhn's discussion of the relationship between
ISO 2022 and UTF-8.)

    
      
        xterm
        GNOME Terminal
      
      
        OS X Terminal.app
        Mosh
      
    
  

  Evil escape sequences

  Only Mosh and GNOME Terminal have a defensible rendering when
Unicode mixes with an ECMA-48/ANSI escape sequence. The OS X Terminal
unwisely tries to normalize its input before the vt500 state machine,
causing it to misinterpret and become unusable after receiving the
following input!* (This also means the OS X Terminal's interpretation
of the incoming octet stream varies depending on how
the incoming octets are split across TCP segments, because the
normalization only looks ahead to available bytes.)

* We earlier wrote that this misbehaving sequence "crashes"
the OS X Terminal.app. This was mistaken—instead, Terminal.app
interprets the escape sequence as shutting off keyboard input, and
because of an unrelated bug in Terminal.app, it is not possible for
the user to restore keyboard input by resetting the terminal from the
menu.

    
      
        xterm: circumflex on wrong letter.
        GNOME Terminal's circumflex placement is defensible.
      
      
        OS X Terminal.app applies circumflex to part of escape sequence, then irretrievably shuts off keyboard input.
        Mosh gets this one right.
      
    
  

  Mosh sets IUTF8

  In the POSIX framework, the kernel needs to know whether
    the user is typing in an 8-bit character set or in UTF-8,
    because in canonical mode (i.e. "cooked" mode), the kernel
    needs to be able to delete a typed multibyte character
    sequence from an input buffer.  On OS X and Linux, this is
    done with the "IUTF8" termios flag.)
    (See diagnostic
        explaining the need for this flag.)

    Mosh sets the IUTF8 flag when possible and stubbornly refuses to start up unless the user has a
    UTF-8-clean environment. SSH does not set the IUTF8 flag, which can lead to garbage in input buffers.
  


  Instant local echo and line editing

    The other major benefit of working at the
      terminal-emulation layer is that the Mosh client is free
      to scribble on the local screen without lasting
      consequence. We use this to implement intelligent local
      echo. The client runs a predictive model in the background
      of the server's behavior, hypothesizing that each
      keystroke will be echoed at the cursor location and that
      the backspace and left- and right-arrow keys will have
      their traditional effect. But only when a prediction is
      confirmed by the server are these effects actually shown
      to the user. (In addition, by default predictions are only
      displayed on high-delay connections or during a network
      “glitch.”) Predictions are done in epochs: when the
      user does something that might alter the echo behavior
      — like hit ESC or carriage return or an up- or
      down-arrow — Mosh goes back into making background
      predictions until a prediction from the new batch can be
      confirmed as correct.

    Thus, unlike previous attempts at local echo with TELNET
      and RLOGIN, Mosh's local echo can be used everywhere, even
      in full-screen programs like emacs and vi.

  Real-world benefits

We evaluated Mosh using traces contributed by six users, covering
about 40 hours of real-world usage and including 9,986 total
keystrokes. These traces included the timing and contents of all
writes from the user to the host and vice versa. The users were asked
to contribute "typical, real-world sessions." In practice, the traces
include use of popular programs such as the bash shell and zsh shells,
the alpine and mutt e-mail clients, the emacs and vim text editors,
the irssi and barnowl chat clients, the links text-mode Web browser,
and several programs unique to each user.

To evaluate typical usage of a "mobile" terminal, we replayed the
traces over an otherwise unloaded Sprint commercial EV-DO (3G)
cellular Internet connection in Cambridge, Mass. A client-side process
played the user portion of the traces, and a server-side process
waited for the expected user input and then replied (in time) with the
prerecorded server output. We speeded up long periods with no
activity.  The average round-trip time on the link was about half a
second.

We replayed the traces over two different transports, SSH and Mosh,
and recorded the user interface response latency to each simulated
user keystroke. The Mosh predictive algorithm was frozen prior to
collecting the traces and was not adjusted in response to their
contents or results.

The results

  Cumulative distribution of keystroke response times with Sprint EV-DO (3G) Internet service


Mosh reduced the median keystroke response
time from 503 ms to nearly instant (because more than 70% of the
keystrokes could be immediately displayed), and reduced the mean
keystroke response time from 515 ms to 173 ms. Qualitatively, Mosh makes
remote servers "feel" more like the local machine!

    


      
  
  Q: Who wrote Mosh?

  Mosh was written by Keith Winstein, along with Anders Kaseorg, Quentin Smith, Richard Tibbetts, Keegan McAllister, and John Hood.

  Q: Why another remote-terminal protocol?

  Practical latency on the Internet is on the increase, with
    the rise of bufferbloat and sophisticated wireless links
    that optimize for throughput over delay. And roaming is more
    common than ever, now that laptops and handheld devices have
    largely displaced desktops. SSH is great, but frustrating to
    use when you want to change IP addresses or have a
    long-delay link or a dodgy connection.

  Moreover, TELNET had some good things going for it — a
    local-echo mode and a well-defined network virtual
    terminal. Even today, SSH doesn't properly support UTF-8
    end-to-end on a POSIX system.

  Q: Are the mosh principles relevant to other network applications?

  We think so. The design principles that Mosh stands for are
    conservative: warning the user if the state being displayed
    is out of date, serializing and checkpointing all
    transactions so that if there are no warnings, the user
    knows every prior transaction has succeeded, and handling expected events (like roaming from one
    WiFi network to another) gracefully.

  Those don't seem too controversial, but fancy apps like
  Gmail-in-Chromium or on Android still behave atrociously on
  dodgy connections or after switching IP addresses. (Have you
  ever had Gmail leave an e-mail message in "Sending..." for ten
  hours while merrily retrieving new mail and not indicating any
  kind of error? Us too.) We think there may be considerable
  room for improvement in many network user interfaces from the
  application of these values.

  

  Q: I'm getting "mosh requires a UTF-8 locale." How can I fix this?

        To diagnose the problem, run locale on the local
        terminal, and ssh remotehost locale. To use Mosh,
        both sides of the connection will need to show a UTF-8 locale, like
        LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8".

        On many systems, SSH will transfer the locale-related
        environment variables, which are then inherited by
        mosh-server.  If this mechanism fails, Mosh (as of
        version 1.2) will pass the variables itself.  If neither
        mechanism is successful, you can do something like

        mosh remotehost --server="LANG=en_US.UTF-8 mosh-server"

        If en_US.UTF-8 does not exist on the remote server,
        you can replace this with a UTF-8 locale that does exist.  You
        may also need to set LANG locally for the benefit of
        mosh-client.  It is possible that the local and
        remote machines will need different locale names. See also this GitHub
        ticket.

  Q: What does the message "Nothing received from the server on UDP port 60003" mean?

  
    This means that mosh was able to start
    mosh-server successfully on the remote machine, but the client is
    not able to communicate with the server.  This generally means that
    some type of firewall is
    blocking the UDP packets between the client and the server.  If you
    had to forward TCP port 22 on a NAT for SSH, then you will have to
    forward UDP ports as well.  Mosh will use the first available
    UDP port, starting at 60001 and stopping at 60999.  If you are only
    going to have a small handful of concurrent sessions on a server, then you can
    forward a smaller range of ports (e.g., 60000 to 60010).
    

    
    Tools like netstat, netcat, socat, and tcpdump can be useful for debugging
    networking and firewall problems.
    

    This problem can also be the result of a bug in glibc 2.22 that
      affects programs that link with protobuf and utempter and use
      aggressive compiler hardening flags. (glibc bugtracker entry, as well as Mosh bugtracker entry.) The
      problem causes mosh-server to segfault immediately on startup. We
      believe we have worked around this problem in Mosh 1.2.6, but please
      report a bug if you find otherwise.
  

  Q: Why do you insist on UTF-8 everywhere?

  We're really not UTF-8 zealots. But it's a lot easier to
  correctly implement one terminal emulator
  than to try to do the right thing in a variety of difficult
  edge cases. (This is what GNU screen tries to do, and in our
  experience it leads to some very tricky-to-debug situations.)
  So mosh just won't start up until the user has everything
  configured for a UTF-8-clean pathway. It may be annoying, but
  it also probably reduces frustration down the
  road. (Unfortunately an 8-bit vt220 and a UTF-8 vt220 are
  different and incompatible terminal types; the UTF-8 goes
  in underneath the vt220 state machine.)

  Q: How do I use a different SSH port (not 22)?

        As of Mosh 1.2, you can pass arguments to ssh like so:

        mosh remotehost --ssh="ssh -p 2222"

        Or configure a host alias in ~/.ssh/config with a
        Port directive.  Mosh will respect that too.

  Q: I'm getting 'mosh-server not found'.

  Please make sure that mosh is installed on the client, and
  mosh (or at least mosh-server) is installed on the server you are
  trying to connect to.  Also, the server is expected to be available
  on your server's default login PATH, which is not
  usually true on OS X and BSD servers, or if you install mosh-server
  in your home directory.  In these cases please see the "Server
  binary outside path" instructions in the Usage section,
  above.

  Q: SSH authenticates using Kerberos tickets, but Mosh asks me for a password.
        In some configurations, SSH canonicalizes the hostname
        before passing it to the Kerberos GSSAPI plugin.  This breaks
        for Mosh, because the initial forward DNS lookup is done by
        the Mosh wrapper script.  To work around this, invoke Mosh as

        mosh remotehost --ssh="ssh -o GSSAPITrustDns=no"

        This will
        often fail on a round-robin DNS setup.  In that case it is probably
        best to pick a specific host from the round-robin pool.

  Q: Why is my terminal's scrollback buffer incomplete?

        Mosh synchronizes only the visible state of the terminal.  We
are tracking this issue; see this issue and the
        others which are linked from there.  For now, the workaround is to use
        screen or tmux on the remote side.

  Q: How do I get 256 colors?

  Make sure you are running mosh in a terminal that
  advertises itself as 256-color capable. (This generally means
  TERM will be xterm-256color or screen-256color-bce.)

  Q: How do I type C-^, Mosh's default escape character?

  On keyboards with the United States layout, this can be typed
  as Ctrl-Shift-6, or often as Ctrl-6 (this depends on your OS and
  terminal emulator).  On non-US keyboards, it is often hard to find
  the right key, and sometimes it's not available at all.  If your
  keyboard has a dead key with an accent-circumflex, this is not
  likely to be the right key.  Ctrl-6 sometimes works, though.  If you
  are unable to type this character, you will need to set
  the MOSH_ESCAPE_KEY variable; see the Mosh man page for
  details.

  Q: How can I make the server automatically clean up dormant sessions?

  Please see the entries for MOSH_SERVER_NETWORK_TMOUT
      and MOSH_SERVER_SIGNAL_TMOUT in the mosh-server(1) man page.

  Q: What is Mosh's security track record so far?

  Mosh 1.0 was released in March 2012. As of the release of Mosh
      1.4.0 in October 2022, as far as the developers are aware:

      
      
      In the last decade, no security vulnerabilities of
	any kind (major or minor) have been reported in Mosh.

      No major security vulnerabilities have ever been
      reported in Mosh. We define major security vulnerabilities to
      include privilege escalation, remote code execution,
      denial-of-service by a third party, etc.

      Two denial-of-service issues were discovered and fixed in
	releases in 2012. One issue allowed a mosh-server to cause the
	mosh-client to spend excess CPU (CVE-2012-2385, fixed in Mosh
	1.2.1, released May 2012). Another issue allowed the server
	host to cause the mosh-client to send UDP datagrams to an
	incorrect address, foiling its attempt to connect (fixed in
	Mosh 1.2.3, released October 2012).
      

      Q: How does Mosh's security compare with SSH's?
      
    We think that Mosh's conservative design means that its attack
      surface compares favorably with more-complicated systems like
      OpenSSL and OpenSSH. Mosh's track record has so
      far borne this out. Ultimately, however, only time will tell
      when the first serious security vulnerability is discovered in
      Mosh—either because it was there all along or because it
      was added inadvertently in development. OpenSSH and OpenSSL have
      had more vulnerabilities, but they have also been released
      longer and are more prevalent.

    In one concrete respect, the Mosh protocol is more secure than
      SSH's: SSH relies on unauthenticated TCP to carry the contents
      of the secure stream. That means that an attacker can end an SSH
      connection with a single phony "RST" segment. By contrast, Mosh
      applies its security at a different layer (authenticating every
      datagram), so an attacker cannot end a Mosh session unless the
      attacker can continuously prevent packets from reaching
      the other side. A transient attacker can cause only a transient
      user-visible outage; once the attacker goes away, Mosh will
      resume the session.

    However, in typical usage, Mosh relies on SSH to exchange keys
      at the beginning of a session, so Mosh will inherit the
      weaknesses of SSH—at least insofar as they affect the
      brief SSH session that is used to set up a long-running Mosh
      session.

  Q: Is Mosh affected by the 2018 attacks against the OCB2 cipher mode?

  Not that we know of—Mosh uses OCB3. The authors of the
paper write that the attack is not applicable to OCB3.

  Q: Why does mosh use AES-128 for a session-key, not AES-192 or AES-256?

  
    
      AES-128 is more than an adequate key length for a session key.

      The OCB FAQ recommends AES-128.

      AES-128 is a bit nicer and is not subject to the related-key attacks that afflict AES-192 and AES-256. (Schneier: "the key schedule for 256-bit version is pretty lousy -- something we pointed out in our 2000 paper -- but doesn't extend to AES with a 128-bit key." See this blog post.)
    
  

  Q: Does mosh work with Amazon EC2?

  Yes, it works great, but please remember to open up UDP ports 60000–61000 on the EC2 firewall.

  Q: How do I tell if mosh is working correctly?

  
      After you run mosh user@server, if successful you will be dropped into your login
      shell on the remote machine.

      If you want
      to check that mosh is being used instead of ssh, try typing Ctrl-^ Ctrl-Z
      to suspend the session (with mosh 1.2.4 or later on the client). Running fg will then return.
      
  

  Q: What's the difference between mosh, mosh-client, and mosh-server?   Which one do I use?

  
      The mosh command is a wrapper script that is designed to be the primary way that
      you use mosh.  In most cases, you can simply just replace "ssh" with "mosh" in your command line.
      Behind the scenes, the mosh wrapper script will SSH to the server, start up
      mosh-server, and then close the SSH connection.  Then it will start up the
      mosh-client executable on the client, passing it the necessary information for
      it to connect to the newly spawned mosh-server instance.
      

      In normal usage, mosh-client and
      mosh-server don't need to be run directly.
      
  

  Q: How do I run the mosh client and server separately?

  If the mosh wrapper script isn't working for you, you can try running
    the mosh-client and mosh-server programs separately to
    form a connection. This can be a useful debugging technique.

  1. Log in to the remote host, and run mosh-server.

  It will give output like:
$ mosh-server 

MOSH CONNECT 60004 4NeCCgvZFe2RnPgrcU1PQw

[mosh-server detached, pid = 30261]


  2. On the local host, run:
$ MOSH_KEY=key mosh-client remote-IP remote-PORT

where "key" is the 22-byte string printed by mosh-server (in this
example, "4NeCCgvZFe2RnPgrcU1PQw"), "remote-PORT" is the port number
given by the server (60004 in this case), and "remote-IP" is the IP address of the server. You can look up the
server's IP address with "host remotehost".

  3. If all goes well, you should have a working Mosh connection. Information about where the process fails can help us debug why Mosh isn't working for you.

  Q: With the mosh-server on FreeBSD or OS X, I sometimes get weird color problems. What's wrong?

  This bug is fixed in Mosh 1.2. Thanks to Ed Schouten and Peter Jeremy for tracking this down.

Learning to Think Again, and the Cost of AI Dependency.
There are so many (hype/boring) posts about AI coming out every day. It’s OK to use it, and everyone does it, but still learn your craft, and try to think.
Similar to what DHH said:

It’s also more fun to be competent in something than constantly waiting for an AI to complete.
The probability that AI will make us unhappy is very high IMO. Use it, yes, but not for every task. For discovering, creating a historical overview, or creating diagrams (Canva, Figma), but a big no to the writing (or coding). Someone needs to add knowledge or new insights; AI cannot train itself. So articles, books, and words will be written, and writers will be more in demand as everyone relies on AI, which at some point just plateaus.
It will be a long-term loss; people stop thinking and learning. Time will tell. My two cents, if you are a senior in something, you know better.

# Guidance on When to Use It
I 

heard from ThePrimeagen: It depends on how far you fix into the future. Short-term autocomplete is fine, but architectural decisions are big no, no’s.

This is about the bottom where we have time and the left where we have amount of errors. This means that the longer we use AI for fixing something in the future, like an architecture, the more errors it will produce.
If we use it for quick autocomplete or creating a well-defined algorithm function, it’s less prone to errors. In that first phase, you gain 20% productivity; in the later phases, you lose more.

This is like in real life, the longer I wait with making m decision, the more information I have, the better the decison will be. And is exactly what Shape Up preaches with maximum deciding for 6 weeks (a cycle),  don’t have roadmaps and backlogs for longer than that in the future. Similar is it with using AI, as all of it is predicted probability.
Another great illustration by 

Forrest Brazeal:

Also to keep in mind what’s most imporant to your usecase like illustrated by Thomas Ptacek in 

My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts · The Fly Blog:

# Soulless
Nobody wants to read some soulless text, and what if it’s even good? Where do you get more from? I think this is a big trap that only over time people will realize. Sure, they help, and everyone needs to use them for “certain” tasks, but not the writing itself.
In the end, LLMs and AI require guidance; they’re just probabilities. See also Writing Manually.
# Distraction
I think we will be more distracted than ever. We can’t even have 2 seconds to think before Grammarly, Copilot, or Cursor suggests something. So instead of doing the thinking, we just cruise on. We are losing the driver’s seat.
It brings me back to the article I wrote recently about «

Finding Flow». More on Don’t use AI for everything, you stop thinking-learning AI Use and Writing is Hard.
# Don’t Get Me Wrong
Don’t get me wrong, I use it every day, too. But more deliberately. I turned off my Grammarly and my Copilot (a long time ago), so I have the space to think and to learn. If you do it once or twice, that’s OK, but if you do it everywhere, you also lose the ability to learn new skills or the fun of it.
Interesting about the LCI (LLM Collaborative Intelligence), and sure, there will be a lot of benefits, but I am not sure if these insights are anything that comes close to a human insight that has felt, sensed, or experienced something through hardship. So yes, but I do not have many expectations, nor do I want it to create new insights. This is the fun part of my job :)
# Exercising a Skill
It’s never always or never; it’s in between. The problem with learning is if you use it often, I’d argue that you, in fact, don’t learn much. You just copy and paste in writing or just tab tab tab in coding. The learning is gone. And do that often enough; our brain is not used to learning or, more critically, thinking anymore. Same as remembering, how good can we remember mobile phone numbers? not really, but I could very well during the early phone times because I trained it every day.
It’s all a matter of exercise, and I learned for myself—it doesn’t have to be true for everyone—that I didn’t learn or think anymore. And frankly, it was also not fun anymore. That’s to be said in the stuff I know well.
In other areas, like creating an image (like the one I created for this article 😆) or updating my website’s front page with HTML/CSS, which would have taken me much longer as I don’t practice, it helped a lot. But I’d argue the fact that I didn’t learn anything new except prompting Claude Code :). It’s all tradeoffs, as always, right? :)
# Other Opinions
# Paul Graham on Writing
Paul Graham says on 

Writes and Write-Nots (internal):

The result will be a world divided into writes and write-nots. There will still be some people who can write.
Yes, it’s bad. The reason is something I mentioned earlier: writing is thinking.
In fact there’s a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing.
If you’re thinking without writing, you only think you’re thinking.
So a world divided into writes and write-nots is more dangerous than it sounds. It will be a world of thinks and think-nots.

# Nathan Baugh
Nathan Baugh shares on 

About AI and ghostwriting:

1st Order Effect:

The world will be overrun with slop content and stories.
We already see this. Just look at AI written comments on this platform.

2nd Order Effect:

People will stop learning the foundational skills – storytelling, writing, rhetoric – required to communicate their experiences and ideas effectively.
They will over rely on AI. It starts as a tool, becomes a crutch, and ends as a hindrance.

3rd Order Effect:

People who invest in those same skills see massive returns.
Writing sharpens your ideas. Story gives leverage to those ideas.

2.5 years into the AI craze, and I continue to firmly believe that if your company wasn’t already interesting/succeeding without AI, then doing “whatever plus AI” isn’t going to save you. For the few that seem this way (eg Cursor), I think their moat is a lot weaker than it seems. You have to play the game and the game is AI, but I don’t think it’s a defensible foundational capability. Might play out as an excellent land and grab strategy to buy you time to fill out the meat though. Mitchell Hashimoto on

# Andrew Ng
Andrew Ng on 

Twitter/X:

Some people today are discouraging others from learning programming on the grounds AI will automate it. This advice will be seen as some of the worst career advice ever given. I disagree with the Turing Award and Nobel prize winner who wrote, “It is far more likely that the programming occupation will become extinct […] than that it will become all-powerful. More and more, computers will program themselves.”​ Statements discouraging people from learning to code are harmful!
In the 1960s, when programming moved from punchcards (where a programmer had to laboriously make holes in physical cards to write code character by character) to keyboards with terminals, programming became easier. And that made it a better time than before to begin programming. Yet it was in this era that Nobel laureate Herb Simon wrote the words quoted in the first paragraph. Today’s arguments not to learn to code continue to echo his comment.
As coding becomes easier, more people should code, not fewer!
Over the past few decades, as programming has moved from assembly language to higher-level languages like C, from desktop to cloud, from raw text editors to IDEs to AI assisted coding where sometimes one barely even looks at the generated code (which some coders recently started to call vibe coding), it is getting easier with each step.
I wrote previously that I see tech-savvy people coordinating AI tools to move toward being 10x professionals — individuals who have 10 times the impact of the average person in their field. I am increasingly convinced that the best way for many people to accomplish this is not to be just consumers of AI applications, but to learn enough coding to use AI-assisted coding tools effectively.
den>
One question I’m asked most often is what someone should do who is worried about job displacement by AI. My answer is: Learn about AI and take control of it, because one of the most important skills in the future will be the ability to tell a computer exactly what you want, so it can do that for you. Coding (or getting AI to code for you) is a great way to do that.
When I was working on the course Generative AI for Everyone and needed to generate AI artwork for the background images, I worked with a collaborator who had studied art history and knew the language of art. He prompted Midjourney with terminology based on the historical style, palette, artist inspiration and so on — using the language of art — to get the result he wanted. I didn’t know this language, and my paltry attempts at prompting could not deliver as effective a result.
Similarly, scientists, analysts, marketers, recruiters, and people of a wide range of professions who understand the language of software through their knowledge of coding can tell an LLM or an AI-enabled IDE what they want much more precisely, and get much better results. As these tools are continuing to make coding easier, this is the best time yet to learn to code, to learn the language of software, and learn to make computers do exactly what you want them to do.

# Jason Fried
As Jason Fried said, initially, it’s magical. After a while, you see it so clearly and it’s just average:



Cover letters? Yes!

The hardest thing is not making something.
The hardest thing is maintaining something.
It’s become so easy to just make stuff and vomit out ideas, and I mean this in the best possible way… 

Jason Fried on LinkedIn
This another valid insights, it’s hard to maintain code that is not made by you, it’s losing it’s fun. Therefore this will be a big part of a winning business, to have sustainable, and energy to want to maintain a product. And not “just making it”.
Also who takes responsibility for the generated (vibed) code?
# David Perell
David Perell has similar views as me on being soulless:

When you outsource your writing to AI, you end up with words that lack soul or personality. Gone go your quirks and your idiosyncrasies, which are the very things that make your writing irreplaceable. 

LinkedIn
# Ezra Klein
Ezra Klein has 

great insights that I very align with in terms of writing. He says that there are no shortcuts for research. When you grapple with a text or book for seven hours, it will change you. This will influence your writing, too. There’s no summary that gives you this kind of in-depth connection.
Also, you can’t prompt your way into it, as there’s no prompt that knows that you don’t know yet, or AI doesn’t know what you wanted to have read or what connections you would have made. On the contrary, you actually lose time reading something, and over time, we think we read lots of stuff, but we actually only read summaries. Full episode on

# Will It Replace X
# Writers


Are Cover letters still a thing? Yes. This reminded me of good writing is key for every job these days.  Writing was always an asset, but even more these days; although people think they don’t need it, as AI is doing that. But that’s a very dangerous bet I wouldn’t take.

# Data Engineers?
Probably not.

comparison by Mehdi Ouazza:


Did the music record replace musicians 100 years ago? Nope, it changed them and the industry.

Same here; it will change our industry and job, but we won’t disappear.

# Image Generation
Initial generation, yes. But final touch, no. Whenever I try to create images with AI, I am always initially impressed, but that quickly fades over time.
Yesterday, I updated my second brain image, but I changed it again today. I created some more with AI; prompted prompted prompted. In the end, I made one manually based on my copy. I think it’s more powerful. What do you think?

# My Own


Some AI-generated images I like too, but they were always missing something, and yeah, they looked so AI-generated. I started to feel the same as I did for AI writing () and AI data engineering (Will AI replace Data Engineers); now, with AI image generation, doing it yourself is more fulfilling, and you end up happier.

# How to detect AI Writing
How to detect AI Writing
If we know how AI is writing, should we stop using em dashes or thing AI does?
I don’t think so. I love the em dash. I even have a keyboard shortcut for the em dash. And sometimes when I write a negation, I’m thinking «could that look like it’s written by AI».
But at the end, convition is a good word. I can focus what an AI thinks while I write, I must write. So having something to say, and trying my best to communicate that, is the best I can do.  ^ebca60
# History Logs
# From 2024-10-12
What AI Writing can’t do, because it can only think one word at a time.
E.g., in the below example, as a writer you know you need to start all sentences the same, but the AI model can’t do that.

Writing from Abundance is the art of collecting ideas so you can think better and avoid writer’s block.
Writing from Conversation is the art of using dialogue to identify your best ideas and double down on them. 
Writing in Public is the art of broadcasting your ideas to the Internet so you become a beacon for people, opportunities, and serendipity.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Now that Joel0 in the TrueNAS community has created a fork of TrueNAS that runs on Arm, I thought I'd give it a spin—on a Raspberry Pi.



I currently run an Ampere Arm server in my rack with Linux and ZFS as my primary storage server, and a Raspberry Pi with four SATA SSDs and ZFS as backup replica in my studio. My configuration for these Arm NASes is up on GitHub.

I've been looking forward to TrueNAS support on Arm for years, though it seems the sentiment in that community was 'Arm servers aren't powerful enough to run serious storage servers'—despite myself and many others doing so for many years... but that's besides the point.

On a Raspberry Pi?

Yes, in fact.

I've found numerous times, running modern applications on slower hardware is an excellent way to expose little configuration flaws and misconceptions that lead to learning how to run the applications much better on more capable machines.



From my Pi Dramble to my Petabyte Pi Project, running apps intended for much more powerful hardware taught me a lot. So maybe running TrueNAS, which demands 8 GB of RAM and 16 GB of primary storage, would be a fun learning exercise.

I've done it on x86 servers, but that's boring. It's easy. I don't learn much when a project goes off without a hitch, and I'm not forced to look closer at some of the configuration quirks.

You can watch the video for a full demo, or read on below:





On a Raspberry Pi, there's no UEFI

One glaring problem with the Raspberry Pi is no official support for UEFI, a standard way to boot computers and interface operating systems to device firmware. Raspberry Pi only officially supports device-tree-based Linux booting, which is much less standard. That means you can't just throw any old Linux distribution on the Pi, you have to have ones tailored to the Pi. There are good OSes for the Pi, like Raspberry Pi OS, based on Debian. But it's not the same as grabbing Windows on Arm and installing it on my Ampere workstation.

To get past this restriction, we have to rely on a community project, forked from Windows on Raspberry Pi. Specifically, I'm using NumberOneGit's rpi5-uefi fork.

To get your Pi 5 to support UEFI (CM5 process may be slightly different):


Update the EEPROM to the 2025-06-09 release (or later - check what version you're running in Pi OS with the command rpi-eeprom-update):
 a. Typically, you can upgrade using Raspberry Pi Imager, sudo apt full-upgrade -y, or sudo rpi-eeprom-update -a. However, at the time of this writing, those methods will get you to the latest stable release (2025-05-08), so until then, use one of these methods:
 b. Manually update the bootloader with usbboot from source.
 c. Switch to the beta bootloader release channel: sudo nano /etc/default/rpi-eeprom-update, then change latest to beta, and run sudo rpi-eeprom-update -a.
 d. Verify the bootloader version you're running with rpi-eeprom-update after a reboot.
Download the latest .zip file release from rpi5-uefi Releases.
Take a microSD card that's already formatted for the Pi (I just pulled the Pi OS card out of my Pi 5 that I just used for the EEPROM update), and clear out the contents of the FAT32 'bootfs' volume. Copy all the contents of the .zip file you downloaded into that folder (including RPI_EFI.fd).
Eject the microSD card, insert it into the Pi, and power it on with an HDMI display connected.
You should see a Raspberry Pi logo and the EDK2 bootloader screen appear. Unless you have NVMe or USB boot media installed, it will say "Press any key to enter the Boot Manager Menu."
Since I couldn't find the 'any' key, I pressed 'Enter', then I could navigate through a standard boot manager menu. In there you can configure SD card speeds, set the PCIe bus speed, etc.
After you've changed the settings to your liking (see some suggestions for Linux), save and reset.




TrueNAS on a Pi 5

Now that the Pi is booting into UEFI mode, you can install TrueNAS. To do that:


Download a TrueNAS on Arm ISO from https://truenas-releases.jmay.us (I chose 25.04.2).
Use a tool like Etcher to write the ISO to a USB drive.
After Etcher finishes, eject the USB drive and insert it into the Pi (I used a USB 3 thumb drive, so I inserted it into one of the blue USB 3 ports on the Pi for maximum speed).
If it doesn't automatically boot to the TrueNAS installer, select the external USB drive in the UEFI boot manager and boot into the TrueNAS installer.
Follow the TrueNAS installer's prompts to install TrueNAS on any device other than the installer drive or the microSD card (I used a second USB flash drive plugged into the other USB 3 port). Wait for installation to complete.
When prompted, reboot and remove the USB drive.


TrueNAS SCALE should boot up, and the first boot can take a while as many services need to generate files, configure services, and start them the first time.



In my case, on first boot, the ix-etc service failed to start (it timed out), and its purpose is to Generate TrueNAS /etc files. After booting, I chose to enter the Linux console, then ran systemctl start ix-etc, and rebooted.

After a reboot, TrueNAS seemed to launch all its services without issue, including the web UI. I visited the IP address printed on the console, logged in as the admin user I set up during install, and was greeted with the TrueNAS dashboard:



Current Limitations

Right now, most of the limitations are around missing features in UEFI mode; since Raspberry Pi hasn't pushed RP1 support into the Linux kernel, and nobody's yet reverse-engineered RP1 interfaces, you can't use:


Fan header PWM support (no fan control)
CSI/DSI connections for displays/cameras
GPIO
Built-in Ethernet


The Ethernet limitation is especially annoying, as you are forced to use an external USB Ethernet dongle, just like on most non-Qualcomm systems running Windows on Arm.

Andrea della Porta from SUSE is working on upstreaming RP1 support into Linux with some help from Raspberry Pi, but progress has been a bit slow.

What I've been wondering lately, more and more: why doesn't Raspberry Pi consider official UEFI support in the first place? With or without Microsoft's official blessing, being able to boot vanilla Windows 11 for Arm on the Pi would be neat. Not to mention, any regular Linux Arm distro (including TrueNAS SCALE) would boot too...

Next Steps

I recently received a new hardware project, the Homelabs Pi Storage server, which uses a custom CM5 SATA backplane and a 3D printable enclosure for a 6-bay NAS:



I got TrueNAS installed on a CM5 Lite (using the same process as above), but when I installed four SATA hard drives, they spun up, but were not recognized. Right now the Pi 5 UEFI support doesn't allow for more than one PCIe device, and the Homelabs Pi Storage server has a PCIe switch that branches off to 2.5 Gbps Ethernet and a 6-port SATA controller.

These devices all work perfectly out of the box on Raspberry Pi OS (and I was able to set up a ZFS array, getting 250 MB/s over the built-in 2.5G Ethernet—see below), but they aren't recognized currently when running under UEFI :(



I'm already running vanilla ZFS under Raspberry Pi OS on my other Raspberry Pi storage server, and that's running on four SSDs and no hard drives. It can sustain 200 MB/sec writes, and I presume TrueNAS would be able to do the same.

There are also NVMe-only boards, like the $50 GeeekPi N16 Quad-NVMe HAT, which provide a pretty small footprint all-flash server option. But again, since those boards use switch chips (because the Pi is limited to 1 PCIe lane), none of those drives would be accessible to TrueNAS as it stands today. Your best bet if you want to use TrueNAS instead of just managing ZFS on you own on a Pi would be to use a single-purpose HAT or SATA controller or HBA in IT mode, to connect disks directly to the Pi.

Because of the current UEFI limitations, I would still recommend running TrueNAS on higher-end Arm hardware (like Ampere servers). If you want to stick to an SBC, there's UEFI firmware for RK3588 platforms under active development. It may offer even more functionality for some boards, so check the compatibility list.

Or you could be boring and just install TrueNAS on x86, where it's fully supported ;)]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[GPU Prefix Sums

GPUPrefixSums aims to bring state-of-the-art GPU prefix sum techniques from CUDA and make them available in portable compute shaders. In addition to this, it contributes "Decoupled Fallback," a novel fallback technique for Chained Scan with Decoupled Lookback that should allow devices without forward thread progress guarantees to perform the scan without crashing. The D3D12 implementation includes an extensive survey of GPU prefix sums, ranging from the warp to the device level; all included algorithms utilize wave/warp/subgroup (referred to as "wave" hereon) level parallelism but are completely agnostic of wave size. As a measure of the quality of the code, GPUPrefixSums has also been implemented in CUDA and benchmarked against Nvidia's CUB library. Although GPUPrefixSums aims to be portable to any wave size supported by HLSL, [4, 128], due to hardware limitations, it has only been tested on wave sizes 4, 16, 32, and 64. You have been warned!
If you are interested in prefix sums for their use in radix sorting, check out GPUPrefixSum's sibling repository GPUSorting!
Decoupled Fallback
In Decoupled Fallback, a threadblock will spin for a set amount of cycles while waiting for the reduction of a preceding partition tile. If the maximum spin count is exceeded, the threadblock is free to perform a fallback operation. Multiple thread blocks are allowed to perform fallbacks on the same deadlocking tile, but through use of atomic compare and swap, only one thread block ends up broadcasting its reduction in device memory. Although this means potentially performing redundant calculations, the upside is that fallback performance is no longer limited by the latency of signal propagation between thread blocks.
As of writing this 9/22/2024, Decoupled Fallback shows promising results on Apple M GPU's. However the version included here are out of date, with the most up-to-date development occuring in Vello.
Survey

A prefix sum, also called a scan, is a running total of a sequence of numbers at the n-th element. If the prefix sum is inclusive the n-th element is included in that total, if it is exclusive, the n-th element is not included. The prefix sum is one of the most important algorithmic primitives in parallel computing, underpinning everything from sorting, to compression, to graph traversal.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The startup bubble that no one is talking aboutAugust 28, 2025Figure 1**Above is a graph that displays the amount of Form Ds filed, where the entity (read: company/firm) name contains the phrases "fund I", "fund II", "fund III", and "fund IV". The x-axis is not the prettiest, but it is broken down by quarter. You can see that the line for "fund I" sees by far the greatest peak around quarter 3 of 2022, with a steep drop off immediately after. The other lines have a similar, but less pronounced trend.So, what is the significance of this? Companies and firms file Form Ds in compliance with Regulation D, which requires disclosure when raising funds under specific circumstances. I won't go into the details here, but the TLDR is that it isn't always required, but it's not uncommon either. Another piece of context is that venture capital firms (among other financial investment groups) label their individual funds, often by appending Fund [<fund roman numeral>] to describe where the fund falls in their sequence of funds. Here is a search query on the SEC filings database. You can see how the naming convention works. Each fund often constitutes its own entity. My hypothesis here is that, by charting the amount of Form Ds filed with "fund [#]" in the name, we can roughly see the state of venture capital “fund” raising. My Takeaways1. From this graph we can roughly see the ratio of venture firms that make it to a given fund cycle. That's a little hard to claim as the funds get higher in number, because once firms get large enough, they often stop creating sequential funds, instead raising in parallel and creating funds targeting specific industries/products etc. If you are planning to start a venture firm though, you may gain a bit of insight into your odds of longevity.2. Venture funding is about to drop off BIG time. During the early 2020s, everyone and their mom raised a VC fund. This is due to several factors The zero interest rate phenomenon. Because rates were so low, endowments, pensions, high networth individuals, and other institutional investors were looking for ways to deploy capital. VC was a compelling way to do that.It was easier than ever to start a venture firm. Another interesting graph is my estimation of the amount of Form Ds filed by “SPV as a service” companies, such as Angellist or Sydecar. These companies handle the back office administration for groups raising funds to invest in startups. If your firm isn’t big enough to hire its own staff, you can handle tasks like fund incorporation, and wire coordination through these groups. An abundance of LPs in tandem with these new companies meant that you only needed one or two well presenting individuals to raise a venture fund. In the graph below you can see that Form Ds filed by these groups also peaked around late 2021/2022. Figure 2Note that I estimated these values by looking at similarities matching entities listed on the Forms that were also associated with Angellist/Sydecar/other fund backend providers. These groups likely also contribute to the fluffing of the venture economy by increasing access to investments in startups*. As interest rates increased, and things settled down, the amount of venture firms raising new funds decrease, as evidenced by the decrease in Form Ds with “fund [#]” in the name after Q3 2022 shown in figure 2.Why we are going to see the effects of the bubble nowMaking the assumptions that a) most venture funds target a life span of ~10 years and b) the capital deployment stage of funds lasts 2-4 years (again, roughly), we are just passing the moment of peak fund availability.This has all coincided nicely with an immense increase in expectations put on startups focused on AI solutions. Investor interest in wrapper/agent/AI lab companies has seemed insatiable over the past 18 months, in alignment with the end of the funding deployment stage for funds that raised at the peak. This has led to more startups raising rounds at higher valuations (see another keyword search based graph below). My predictions, based on the above data, and my anecdotal experience is that the amount of venture funding available is about to decrease. This will lead to lower valuations as the supply of funds decreases, inducing relative scarcity. As a result many companies will be left “swimming naked as that tide goes out”. This along with other issues such as (very) newly decreasing expectations of the AI vertical as a whole could lead to a sizable contraction. The decrease in available funding will also put more pressure on companies to actually ** make money **. Unless compute becomes much more cost effective in the immediate future, foundational model providers will be required to raise their prices to supplement equity based funding for compute cost, likely causing wrappers and agent companies to do the same. Some users will be priced out, and likely, many companies will no longer be viable.All this to say: A future contraction may not be the exclusive result of changing sentiment in the AI industry. Sure that's part of it, but the availability of VC funds has been destined to decrease since firm fundraising peaked in 2022.                              Figure 3The offering amount represents the sum of all “total offering amounts” listed on all Form Ds containing “ ai” or “.ai” in the entity names for a given quarter. Note: 2025 sees a dip because only quarters 1 and 2 are accounted for.TJ Jeffersonhttps://tj401.comtj@shcove.com*As a sidenote I do think these services offer ways to anonymize funding sources, and allow potentially less savvy investors (God forbid, unaccredited) to be duped into investing at insanely high valuations.

        Generative Adversarial Networks refer to a family of generative models that seek to discover the underlying distribution behind a certain data generating process. This distribution is discovered through an adversarial competition between a generator and a discriminator. As we saw in an earlier introductory post on GANs, the two models are trained such that the discriminator strives to distinguish between generated and true examples, while the generator seeks to confuse the discriminator by producing data that are as realistic and compelling as possible.

In this post, we’ll take a deep dive into the math behind GANs. My primary source of reference is Generative Adversarial Nets by Ian Goodfellow, et al. It is in this paper that Goodfellow first outlined the concept of a GAN, which is why it only makes sense that we commence from the analysis of this paper. Let’s begin!

Motivating the Loss Function

GAN can be seen as an interplay between two different models: the generator and the discriminator. Therefore, each model will have its own loss function. In this section, let’s try to motivate an intuitive understanding of the loss function for each.

Notation

To minimize confusion, let’s define some notation that we will be using throughout this post.

\[\begin{multline}
\shoveleft x:  \text{Real data} \\
\shoveleft z: \text{Latent vector} \\
\shoveleft G(z): \text{Fake data} \\
\shoveleft D(x): \text{Discriminator's evaluation of real data} \\
\shoveleft D(G(z)): \text{Discriminator's evaluation of fake data} \\
\shoveleft \text{Error}(a, b): \text{Error between } a \text{ and } b\\
\end{multline}\]

The Discriminator

The goal of the discriminator is to correctly label generated images as false and empirical data points as true. Therefore, we might consider the following to be the loss function of the discriminator:

\[L_D = \text{Error}(D(x), 1) + \text{Error}(D(G(z)), 0) \tag{1}\]

Here, we are using a very generic, unspecific notation for $\text{Error}$ to refer to some function that tells us the distance or the difference between the two functional parameters. (If this reminded you of something like cross entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence, you are definitely on the right track.)

The Generator

We can go ahead and do the same for the generator. The goal of the generator is to confuse the discriminator as much as possible such that it mislabels generated images as being true.

\[L_G = \text{Error}(D(G(z)), 1) \tag{2}\]

The key here is to remember that a loss function is something that we wish to minimize. In the case of the generator, it should strive to minimize the difference between 1, the label for true data, and the discriminator’s evaluation of the generated fake data.

Binary Cross Entropy

A common loss function that is used in binary classification problems is binary cross entropy. As a quick review, let’s remind ourselves of what the formula for cross entropy looks like:

\[H(p, q) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p(x)}[- \log q(x)] \tag{3}\]

In classification tasks, the random variable is discrete. Hence, the expectation can be expressed as a summation.

\[H(p, q) = - \sum_{x \in \chi} p(x) \log q(x) \tag{4}\]

We can simplify this expression even further in the case of binary cross entropy, since there are only two labels: zero and one.

\[H(y, \hat{y}) = - \sum y \log(\hat{y}) + (1 - y) \log(1 - \hat{y}) \tag{5}\]

This is the $\text{Error}$ function that we have been loosely using in the sections above. Binary cross entropy fulfills our objective in that it measures how different two distributions are in the context of binary classification of determining whether an input data point is true or false. Applying this to the loss functions in (1),

\[L_D = - \sum_{x \in \chi, z \in \zeta} \log(D(x)) + \log(1 - D(G(z))) \tag{6}\]

We can do the same for (2):

\[L_G = - \sum_{z \in \zeta} \log(D(G(z)) \tag{7}\]

Now we have two loss functions with which to train the generator and the discriminator! Note that, for the loss function of the generator, the loss is small if $D(G(z))$ is close to 1, since $\log(1) = 0$. This is exactly the sort of behavior we want from a loss function for the generator. It isn’t difficult to see the cogency of (6) with a similar approach.

Minor Caveats

The original paper by Goodfellow presents a slightly different version of the two loss functions derived above.

\[\max_D \{ \log(D(x)) + \log(1-D(G(z))) \} \tag{8}\]

Essentially, the difference between (6) and (8) is the difference in sign, and whether we want to minimize or maximize a given quantity. In (6), we framed the function as a loss function to be minimized, whereas the original formulation presents it as a maximization problem, with the sign obviously flipped.

Then, Goodfellow proceeds by framing (8) as a min-max game, where the discriminator seeks to maximize the given quantity whereas the generator seeks to achieve the reverse. In other words,

\[\min_G \max_D \{ \log(D(x)) + \log(1-D(G(z))) \} \tag{9}\]

The min-max formulation is a concise one-liner that intuitively demonstrates the adversarial nature of thecompetition between the generator and the discriminator. However, in practice, we define separate loss functions for the generator and the discriminator as we have done above.  This is because the gradient of the function $y = \log x$ is steeper near $x = 0$ than that of the function $y = \log (1 - x)$, meaning that trying to maximize $\log(D(G(z)))$, or equivalently, minimizing $- \log(D(G(z)))$ is going to lead to quicker, more substantial improvements to the performance of the generator than trying to minimize $\log(1 - D(G(z)))$.

Model Optimization

Now that we have defined the loss functions for the generator and the discriminator, it’s time to leverage some math to solve the optimization problem, i.e. finding the parameters for the generator and the discriminator such that the loss functions are optimized. This corresponds to training the model in practical terms.

Training the Discriminator

When training a GAN, we typically train one model at a time. In other words, when training the discriminator, the generator is assumed as fixed. We saw this in action in the previous post on how to build a basic GAN.

Let’s return back to the min-max game. The quantity of interest can be defined as a function of $G$ and $D$. Let’s call this the value function:

\[V(G, D) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}}[\log(D(x))] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z}[\log(1 - D(G(z)))] \tag{10}\]

In reality, we are more interested in the distribution modeled by the generator than $p_z$. Therefore, let’s create a new variable, $y = G(z)$, and use this substitution to rewrite the value function:

\[\begin{align}
V(G, D) &= \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}}[\log(D(x))] + \mathbb{E}_{y \sim p_g}[\log(1 - D(y))] \\ &= \int_{x \in \chi} p_{data}(x) \log(D(x)) + p_g(x) \log(1 - D(x)) \, dx
\end{align} \tag{11}\]

The goal of the discriminator is to maximize this value function. Through a partial derivative of $V(G, D)$ with respect to $D(x)$, we see that the optimal discriminator, denoted as $D^*(x)$, occurs when

\[\frac{p_{data}(x)}{D(x)} - \frac{p_g(x)}{1 - D(x)} = 0 \tag{12}\]

Rearranging (12), we get

\[D^*(x) = \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)} \tag{12}\]

And this is the condition for the optimal discriminator! Note that the formula makes intuitive sense: if some sample $x$ is highly genuine, we would expect $p_{data}(x)$ to be close to one and $p_g(x)$ to be converge to zero, in which case the optimal discriminator would assign 1 to that sample. On the other hand, for a generated sample $x = G(z)$, we expect the optimal discriminator to assign a label of zero, since $p_{data}(G(z))$ should be close to zero.

Training the Generator

To train the generator, we assume the discriminator to be fixed and proceed with the analysis of the value function. Let’s first plug in the result we found above, namely (12), into the value function to see what turns out.

\[\begin{align}
V(G, D^*) &= \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}}[\log(D^*(x))] + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_g}[\log(1 - D^*(x))] \\ &= \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}} \left[ \log \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)} \right] + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_g} \left[ \log \frac{p_g(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)} \right]
\end{align} \tag{13}\]

To proceed from here, we need a little bit of inspiration. Little clever tricks like these are always a joy to look at.

\[\begin{align}
V(G, D^*) &= \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}} \left[ \log \frac{p_{data}(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)} \right] + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_g} \left[ \log \frac{p_g(x)}{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x)} \right] \\ &= - \log 4 + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}} \left[ \log p_{data}(x) - \log \frac{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x))}{2} \right] \\ & \quad+ \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_g} \left[ \log p_g(x) - \log\frac{p_{data}(x) + p_g(x))}{2} \right] 
\end{align} \tag{14}\]

If you are confused, don’t worry, you aren’t the only one. Basically, what is happening is that we are exploiting the properties of logarithms to pull out a $- \log4$ that previously did not exist. In pulling out this number, we inevitably apply changes to the terms in the expectation, specifically by dividing the denominator by two.

Why was this necessary? The magic here is that we can now interpret the expectations as Kullback-Leibler divergence:

\[V(G, D^*) = - \log 4 + D_{KL}\left(p_{data} \parallel \frac{p_{data} + p_g}{2} \right) + D_{KL}\left(p_g \parallel \frac{p_g + p_g}{2} \right) \tag{15}\]

And it is here that we reencounter the Jensen-Shannon divergence, which is defined as

\[J(P,Q) = \frac{1}{2} \left( D(P \parallel R) + D(Q \parallel R) \right) \tag{16}\]

where $R = \frac12(P + Q)$. This means that the expression in (15) can be expressed as a JS divergence:

\[V(G, D^*) = - \log 4 + 2 \cdot D_{JS}(p_{data} \parallel p_g) \tag{15}\]

The conclusion of this analysis is simple: the goal of training the generator, which is to minimize the value function $V(G, D)$, we want the JS divergence between the distribution of the data and the distribution of generated examples to be as small as possible. This conclusion certainly aligns with our intuition: we want the generator to be able to learn the underlying distribution of the data from sampled training examples. In other words, $p_g$ and $p_{data}$ should be as close to each other as possible. The optimal generator $G$ is thus one that which is able to mimic $p_{data}$ to model a compelling model distribution $p_g$.

Conclusion

In this post, we took a brief tour of the math behind general adversarial networks. Since the publication of Goodfellow’s work, more GAN models have been introduced and studied by different scholars, such as the Wasserstein GAN or CycleGAN to name just a few. The underlying mathematics for these models are obviously going to be different from what we have seen today, but this is a good starting point nonetheless.

I hope you enjoyed reading this post. In the next post, I plan to explore the concept of Fisher information and the Fisher matrix. It is going to be another math-heavy ride with gradients and Hessians, so keep you belts fastened!
