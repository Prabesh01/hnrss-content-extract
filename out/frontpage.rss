AppGoblin has now run over 40k apps in an emulator, tracking millions of API calls thousands of advertising domains. Unfortunately, some of them are dark, meaning they have no landing page of any kind, and I’m unclear who controls these domains.  



news-cdn.site marketingcloudapis.com kickoffo.site onegg.site lazybumblebee.com qa-analytics.com acobt.techyastatic.net



Let’s see if we can figure them out!



qa-analytics.com



This one is a mystery. Seems like it’s related to Germany since it’s always resolving to HETZNER and german IPs. Checking the shared IPs, it looks like they do overlap with unity3d.com domains sometimes.



Again, this whole list is games. 




Woodoku – Wood Block Puzzle



Draw Climber



Spider Rope Hero: Action Game



Running Pet: Dec Rooms



Bubble Shooter 2



Pirate Treasures: Jewel & Gems



Tik Tap Challenge



Collect Em All! Clear the Dots



Gun Simulator & Lightsaber




data deep dive



Looking at the requests I can match various keys to values from untiy3d.com API calls! Specifically they share the same `app_key` values. 



acobt.tech



Well that name definitely comes off as esoteric at first.  First let’s check the IP cluser and see what we find, of the 233 apps sending/receiving from acobt.tech we have 4 other sites with 1:1 matches that are all sites that do not have any landing pages.



acobt.tech 233news-cdn.site 233inmense.site 232kickoffo.site 232



searching…



Searching the internet shows various hits saying some of these belong to Bigo Ads.  Let’s check the apps’ SDKs and see



Apps



Again we got lots of games, and looking it looks like AppGoblin has indeed already found that each of these has a Bigo Ad SDK. 




Pizza Ready!



Sculpt People



Vita Mahjong



Modern Bus Simulator: Bus Game



Gym Heros: Fighting Game



Blockman Go




onegg.site



Wait, this one also matches the IPs for the other various Bigo Ads. Seems like Bigo really uses a lot of random domains? 



lazybumblebee.com



OK, great name. This one appears in clusters of SDK advertising, making me think it’s related to a mediation SDK of some kind (rather than to one specific ad network). Possibly this is bidmachine.io’s as it is the most common, but really all the top ad newtorks appear nearly 1:1 along side it across the 276 apps I’ve found it in:bidmachine.io 275unity3d.com 270doubleclick.net 269mtgglobals.com 267rayjump.com 267applovin.com 261vungle.com 257



Example Apps



Definitely game focused list here.  They almost all call variations of d.lazybumblebee.com/track/sdk-event 




Helix Jump



Going Balls



Paper.io 2



aquapark.io



Snake.io – Fun Snake .io Games



Hole.io



1945 Air Force: Airplane Games




Shared IPs



Looking around there are lots of examples of shared IP addresses with everestop.io and bidmachine, so I think that might have solved that. 



everestop.io 172.240.40.172bidmachine.io 172.240.40.172bidmachine.io 204.74.252.252everestop.io 172.240.61.171voisetech.com 34.216.198.39



SDK?



Looks like a lot of the apps have the io.bidmachine and com.explorestack SDKs, so I’m thinking that `lazybumblebee.com` does indeed belong to BidMachine and helps it with some app mediation service.



marketingcloudapis.com



 marketingcloudapis.com is just the kind of generic descriptive name I’d come up with.  



Example Apps



Example apps, there are a lot of very corporate apps in here along with lots of shopping. 




adidas: Shop Shoes & Clothing



Claro música



Domino’s Pizza USA



SiriusXM: Music, Sports & News



GasBuddy: Find & Pay for Gas




Example API Call



Each app sends off two API calls on start to a unique (per app) subdomain on marketingcloudapis.com with the response from the first API call below. The information sent seems somewhat bland compared to the usual deep scraping that advertising SDKs do. So this is likely paired with other API calls already going out.

                }
            }
        }
    ]
}



Related Domains



Checking on domains that are called together, it looks like this is almost always called with googleapis.com so possibly this is related to Google, but this is a bit weak as a lot of Android apps have integrations with Google.



End Results!



Much better than I expected. A bit of digging and all the URLs were figured out with the exception of marketingcloudapis.com which I was a bit unsure of, but looks like google.com

    I am personally sending this mail to support your dedication and help given to young researchers like me. Now, my thesis writing is going smoothly because of Sci-Hub. I am writing independently without paying for journals. Sharing knowledge should not compare with money. I respect you for your sacrifices and hardships you have faced from the beginning. I have in my mind to do some donations of my capacity to the Sci-Hub project, and that time will come soon.

    This is Subhendu Samanta from India. I am a 2nd year PhD student. From beginning of my higher studies i got to know about using Sci-Hub, where we can have access  to any paper, read it and can gather knowledge, while the journals are trying to keep the knowledge in terms of money. And seriously from that time i started to know details of Sci-Hub and the incredible true story of yours. I don't know how to express my respect for you but the only thing i can tell you is "THANK YOU". I regularly  write blogs about you and also given some presentation about your journey. You are my true inspiration during whenever i even get depressed. My this mail is to tell you, you have moved scientific research one step forward.

    I simply cannot begin to thank you enough for the work that you have done.

When I had done my MPhil in English, websites developed by you and your team like, sci-hum.tw and libgen.is had been life savers for researchers like us, since in India there is a serious dearth of any academic materials;; to extent that you cannot even buy books even if you paid money.

I am therefore very very grateful for all that you have done to benefit poor academicians like us. May God give you strength and bless you. you have done an outstanding job.

My heartfelt gratitude and regards to you from the whole of the education society here in India.

Thank you very very much.

I am writing this email to thank you for providing us (most of the PhD scholars) Sci-hub. It has made our research much more flexible as most of the papers are readily available and that's all because of you and your hardship.

I am not good at coding or neural networking or artificial intelligence but I would really like to thank you for making my research so much smooth. Sci-hub is one of the best search engines I have ever seen. As mentioned by you: "Sci-hub is making research communication faster"

I would love it if you could give a small talk to the rising scholars and techies of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. You have been a great inspiration for most of us. And your valuable word's would inspire many more young generations.

    Greetings!
I am very glad to know about your mission of sharing knowledge without boundaries. I am one of the beneficiaries of the site developed by you. I have accessed many articles through "sci-hub" for expanding my knowledge in my speciallity. But never for commercial purposes.

Where the mind is without fear and the head held high;
Where knowledge is free;
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
Where words come out from the depth of truth;
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;
Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action;
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

    Thanks for such great website you build for research works. Really appreciate it, and grateful.
It saves a lot of time and money, especially for those who came from small and mid size college and universities with limited resources.

I am using it from last 2 years, for research work in  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
Do keep it up. Happy to help you.

    It is nice to write this mail to you as not only me but people who can not pay the subscription charges for international journals are thankful to you for opening the gates of science to them.
Your platform has supported plenty of people and given them an opportunity to enhance their knowledge further by getting access to all the literature available free of cost.  Thank you once again and please do let me know if I can do anything for you to support your endeavour.

    I write this to thank you for developing such a wonderful application for literature retrieval. It is actually a boon for the people who can not afford subscription of journals. I am totally dependent on sci-hub for literature downloading. I also promote sci-hub with number of students, teachers and researchers in India to use this application.

Thanks again

    I am a faculty at a Business School in India, T A Pai Management Institute (TAPMI). I am also pursuing my PhD part time from Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). I have been greatly benefited by your site, Sci-Hub and wish to put on record my gratitude and thanks for making research articles accessible.

As a faculty, I do have access to E-Resources subscribed in my Institute. If I am searching something, I first try to see if I can source the article using EBSCO, PROQUEST or SCIENCEDIRECT subscriptions available at my institute. But sometimes I am not able to find the article especially if it is from the engineering domain since I have been working on machine learning as part of my thesis. Hence as a last resort, I use your site and I always (99.99%) of the time always find it. Some publications such as SAGe or Elsevier have very limited availability on the E-resources that are subscribed at my institute.

I would be happy to make a small donation to support your project. However, I am bit reluctant to use illegal means to transfer money since Bitcoins are banned by the federal bank (RBI) in our country. Hence, is there a routine bank account where I can transfer money through Banking Fund Transfer or phone number (p2p) for International payments? Please let me know the same since I have been thinking of making a donation for couple of years but was always reluctant to use Bitcoins given its legal status in our country.

    This is Dr. Bharat Suthar from India. I want to thank you for your noble work of website Sci-Hub.
I really very much thank full to provide research articles free for students and others to contributed in research.
I have used your website number of times.
I wish your best of luck in your carrier and how your will continue in your life.

Please feel free to revert if you need any help in Pharmaceutical and chemical research field.

    I am a scientist from India and I use Sci-Hub frequently when I am browsing for articles from home (when I do not have institutional access). Even when I work at my lab/ office, I cannot use the institutional access since there are many other things to work on. My relaxed reading and writing happens at home and I am very grateful to Sci-Hub for providing me information when I need them.

I have read about you in the past and heard some of your interviews on YouTube. But recently I see that Sci-Hub has your picture waving at the reader. I think it is a really good idea and a good place to gather support. It is always good to build the human connection to every person who reads scholarly work through Sci-Hub.

I was also thinking about you starting a campaign for your excellent work. So that it gets international attention. It will also help ensure your safety and legitimacy. Some similar work in pharmaceuticals in India has been done in the past and there have been movies made about them. Perhaps you could also consider such work so that your cause receives international acclaim.

I use this opportunity to congratulate your spirit and support your endeavour against those who capitalise on science. This is not why scientists do science.

Best regards to you and with great appreciation for your work

    I am 22 years old from India and pursuing a master's in physics. Being a student from a third world country I was not able to buy published articles for research work. Now, using sci-hub I can do it very easily and can download and read any article.

I just wanted to tell that I am your great fan  I appreciate your work and look up to you for inspiration. Thank you

    First of all a big thanks for making science barrier-free. I'm a PhD research scholar and lecturer as well. During my masters and now for PhD research,  Sci-Hub is all I want, in short, you are the saviour. Due to your vision and efforts, I'm enjoying the research papers within a week of publication. Even during this COVID pandemic situation, the reason I could enjoy research away from my lab is just Sci-Hub. Lots of respect and love from India. Want to gift you something please, say I will send it to you.

    I am a student from India pursuing my Master's degree in Pharmacology. Given the lack of funding, buying or renting a research paper was never an option for me. It is the sci-hub website that made research possible for me without going bankrupt!
Sci-hub has played a valuable role in my education.
Thank you so much for your efforts!

    I'm really thankful to you for your great initiative about the Sci-Hub. Last year I've finished my master's in chemistry. It was the Sci-hub that helped me throughout my master's to access all the publications that I needed. Yes, it is truly said that knowledge is for everyone. First time I read about you on Facebook. Hat's off for your struggle to develop sci-hub.

Well, I'm going to the USA for pursuing my Ph.D in chemistry. Though the term is uncertain now due to restriction on international travel amid the pandemic.

Thank you again. You are a true inspiration for all the students who just cannot afford the cost to buy a single publication. You made our way easy.

    Actually this is too late to express my heartfelt thanks to you because you made the research process easy for all researchers like me. You developed Sci-Hub such a wonderfull gateway without any barriers to search any research article.  You are really very great, broad minded, a good researcher and very beautyfull personality.  I came to know that  you are facing legal court matters due to open and free access made available for all through Sci-Hub website. Hope you have defended best at your level by putting truth behind this.

I am from a lower middle class family and I cannot afford the huge fee for each paper. There you emerged as an angel through your sci-hub. Knowledge should be open and accessible to all. You are doing a great job in this venture. Thanking you once again on behalf of all the researchers from poor countries..

My institute doesn't subscribe to lot of journals and in India, it is seen that state expenditure on the public education is decreasing. In this neo-liberal times, your work actually helps in fighting the inequalities in society. Now, I cannot imagine my work without a science hub. Thank you for all the work.

    Me and many of the science guys in India and the world do praise from the bottom of their heart for the Sci-hub initiative from your end. BE believe in your ideas and thoughts.. You have done remarkable work at a very young age bridging the gap between development and transfer of knowledge.I had been using this to look into people;s works, and many like me cannot afford to pay huge subscription fees to journals and press for something meant to be in public domains.

hats off to your deeds... God be with you. Hope you are all safe in these times.
Love again from India.

    You are one among those who i believe have paved a new way to future of pursuit of knowledge. Your challenge to pay wall and creating a channel has helped millions if not billions around the world who were paralyzed by the thickness and height of the pay wall by publication mafia. You have single handily started a revolution of freeing science from the fee and made govts around the world to questions or at least think about it. You have literally rocked the world. I sincerely thank you for your initiative from which even i have benefited personally during my PhD.

Before I knowing you when I was Ph.D. scholar I and my colleagues used Sci-hub as our god. because we are studied in government colleges there is no journal access password or any free access link. it's true without Sci-Hub.  I can not imagine my Ph.D. degree. I struggled in my earlier Ph.D. to collect research journals until my friend suggests your sci-hub. Your job is priceless and there is no word to convey my thanks to you. You are an angel to every Ph.D. scholars without your website can not complete our Ph.D.  The great Alexander conquers the world but you conquered the entire scholar's heart.

This mail is a shoutout to your long ago efforts and a tribute to your coding mind! I love you bro! Will always be grateful to you for making a free open-access portal for science students!

Could not stop thanking you! I promise to donate something once I become independent and have a job. Right now, I am just a bachelor's student from India.

    I am Tarun from India. I have been following you and your website since my college days. And I cannot express the gratitude I have for your website because it has helped my college work in a lot of ways. Thank you.

I am an avid supporter of open access to all information. I understand and believe  your view that information is not an asset of the person who created it. I think of scientific information in the same way as our feelings in the mind. I believe that feelings like love and friendship do not belong to a section of our brain (nor our body) though their origin corresponds to a part of the brain. Similarly, scientific information has to be open and unrestricted to all. Just imagine how it would be if the human who created the fire hid it instead of provided light to all others. The past advancements in the scientific fields have been possible only through open collaboration between researchers. You are the person who has made the idea of open information take shape. You are a rebel and a hero. Thank you. Thank you for being such an inspiration.

I have always wanted to know the person behind this website. Wish you a happy and successful life ahead.

    My name is Tapas Ray and I live in Kolkata (India).

Although I have used your web service several times, this is the first time that I saw your bio page.

First, heartfelt gratitude for the free service you have been providing. It is a lifeline for people like me, who live in the poorer parts of the world and do not have institutional access to journal databases. As I do not want to use your service without giving anything back, I wanted to make a modest contribution a year or two ago but could not, as the only way was through bitcoins, which completely befuddle me. I have tried to read up and even installed software, but it's simply beyond me.

Once again, it was great knowing that such a young person (my daughter's age, almost) is doing such a wonderful thing for people like me who are on the margins of academia in the countries of the global "periphery". Thank you and the very best wishes

It helped me a lot, and I'm thankful to you for such great work.

It is a fact that not all institutes/organizations subscribe to all the journals. Your creation has made research better. I thank you once again. I wish you a happy life and a glorious career ahead.

    I would like to thank you.I am doing PhD and had it not been for you, conducting research, searching for articles and references would have been very difficult. It has made things easier.I think your efforts to make information accessible to all should be recognized and lauded.

I just hope that somehow, someday you are able to you gain the respect your efforts deserve. On my part, I am grateful to you and love you for being there!

    Greetings from Mangalore, India. I am working as a PhD Scholar and recently submitted my thesis. As I await my Defense viva, I want to do this long pending Job; Thanking one of the biggest reasons why I am able to finish my thesis, and that reason is your legendary work, SCIHUB. Thank you Ms. Elbakyan for your venture aimed at making knowledge available to all.

On a personal note, this invaluable initiative of yours couldn't have come at a better time as I was doing my masters in biotechnology from 2013-2015. Since then, I have embraced SCIHUB whenever I needed any research article. On countless occasions, you have come to my and many other research researchers' rescue to extract the research paper which was made unaccessed by the journals for the want of money.

As I try to progress from my PhD research to post doc careers, I want to thank you and wish you great success in years to come.

I also hope and wish that some day with whatever skills and capabilities I'd have, be able to contribute to causes that you have been focusing on.
Thanking you again

    I'm writing to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm currently a freelance industrial designer, with 3 years of experience and soon to establish my own design studio. I design everything from cool furniture to wearable electronic devices. I'm currently designing a smartwatch for a company; I've been looking at some research papers on material engineering topics for ECG and health care, and those are too expensive to purchase. But your website helped me get it for free.

I immediately clicked the donate button but unfortunately Bitcoin is banned in India and I don't know how to purchase Bitcoin to be honest. So, to compensate, please let me offer my design services to you for free. ...  You are what humanity needs :) Huge respect, much love.

    I'm not sure if you are even aware of the continued and exponential impact you have had on science. Especially on those who participate in science from Lower and Middle Income Countries. I write this from India and Sci-hub has been of great use to me, even as a medical practitioner. For an academic, your work is more like God-sent boon.

Your breaking down of the pay-wall, to me is more significant than the breaking down of the Berlin wall.

Can't thank you enough for it!!!

    I am a retired Professor of Theoretical Physics in Kolkata, India, and a complete and total fan of SciHub. I have sought help from SciHub a countless number of times for my research. My gratitude to you is so great, that I would like to propose you for the Nobel Prize for Peace, if ever I have a chance.

However, cryptocurrency is illegal in India and as an old man I might be jailed for trying to use it. If you know of any other way that I can offer a small addition to you fundraising (like a subscription to a journal which can then be transferred to Sch-Hub), I shall be much obliged.

We share this great ideal of knowledge for everyone for free ! Kudos to you for this great enterprise.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                        Update
After evaluating the impact and community feedback, the Bitnami team has postponed the deletion of the Bitnami public catalog (docker.io/bitnami) until September 29th to give users more time to adapt to the upcoming changes.To raise awareness before the registry deletion, we will run a series of brownouts over the coming weeks. During each brownout, a set of 10 container images from docker.io/bitnami will be temporarily unavailable for 24 hours. The scheduled brownouts are:



August 28, 08:00 UTC → August 29, 08:00 UTC
September 2, 08:00 UTC → September 3, 08:00 UTC
September 17, 08:00 UTC → September 18, 08:00 UTC



The list of affected applications will be published on the day of each brownout via our usual channels.As previously announced, since August 28th, we have not published new Bitnami container images or Helm charts to Docker Hub in OCI format. The source code for containers and Helm charts remains available on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 license.

What's changing?
Starting August 28th, Bitnami will be archiving its OCI registry of charts and images to a new location, Bitnami Legacy, to make room for the new secure, hardened images that will eventually reside in the main Bitnami registry. Users who are currently pulling these images will need to update their pipelines, internal mirrors, and Kubernetes clusters to pull from a new location before that time. A couple of options users have: 


Switch to Bitnami Secure Images 


Switch to the Bitnami Legacy Registry


To retain existing functionality and maintain continuity of systems relying on Bitnami, we recommend switching to Bitnami Secure Images. In addition to a less disruptive transition, BSI helps strengthen your security and compliance posture by adopting the higher-quality images offered as part of BSI. 


Switching to Bitnami Secure Images (BSI)
While some BSI images will be free, they are only for use in development/testing purposes, and a commercial subscription is recommended for access to the entire catalog, as well as stable tags, long-term support versions, and more. 
Though a BSI subscription provides customers with the entire Bitnami Debian-based image catalog (which will continue to receive updates), we recommend users upgrade and start using the hardened Photon Linux-based images instead. These are designed to be replacement images for any of the Debian images and work with the same Helm charts. 
The Photon images provide many other benefits not previously available to users of Debian images, including: 


Drastically reduced CVE count (e.g., 100+ CVEs to in some cases 0)


VEX statements for easier triage, along with Known Exploitable Vulnerabilities (KEV) and EPSS scores


A self-service UI/API with powerful reporting and metadata capabilities


More advanced Helm charts are not available on Docker Hub, such as Bitnami’s “distroless charts” which offer an 83% smaller attack surface (by MB).


Support for customizing the images built by our secure SLSA 3 software factory 


Images and Helm charts are delivered to a private and secure OCI registry dedicated to each customer instead of relying on a public registry with rate limits like Docker Hub.


Access to over 90 VM Images in OVA format


Enterprise support for packaging and installation issues


Switching to Bitnami Legacy Registry
Another option for users of Bitnami today is to switch to the historic archive registry called Bitnami Legacy. This is unsupported software that is being made available, at users' own risk, while they make plans for alternatives. As such, this is a temporary solution, and we do not plan to keep this registry around for long. It will quickly begin to accumulate vulnerabilities that are not patched and atrophy as any software frozen in time does. If this is your choice, we strongly recommend copying the images you are using to your own registry; again, this should be considered a temporary solution. While we think there are many better options to make before the August 28th change, this is an option of last resort for those who need more time. 
Why is it a good time to consider upgrading your security and compliance for open source? 
So why do all the work now to change what’s maybe been working and update the type of open source images you use? We get it, no one likes change. But the reality is the landscape of open source is changing all around us. For example, from 2019-2023, the number of malicious packages discovered has risen to more than 245,000 according to Sonatype. That’s 2x all the previous years combined. The implication is that bad actors are finding increasing opportunities to exploit open source software that is running in every major software organization around the world. Meanwhile, with the growth of AI and MCP models, open source consumption is only going to increase. So the risk profile tides are quickly rising around us, and having a better boat to be prepared for the impacts of this change is the only responsible response. 
In addition, the Cyber Resilience Act in the EU creates an impending obligation for many organizations doing business there to provide guarantees about the open source software they use in their organization. It could soon be a liability to use open source that doesn’t have the required documentation to prove it’s been sourced from a safe place and hasn’t been tampered with. 
This is why the launch of Bitnami Secure Images is so timely. BSI is making it easier than ever for organizations to responsibly prepare for what the future of open source software in our modern world looks like. As with many things, what started out simple has become increasingly complex and requires more care to navigate. Furthermore, BSI has one of the lowest TCOs in the industry, enabling more organizations than ever before to afford cutting-edge supply chain security. BSI is effectively democratizing security and compliance for open source so that it doesn’t require million-dollar contracts from vendors with sky-high valuations. 
What are Competitors trying to claim about Bitnami? 
It’s also a great time for the competition to try and steer the narrative about Bitnami. Some have claimed that Bitnami is “pulling their free container images and Helm charts from public access”. However, if we look a little more closely at the changes Bitnami has announced, this statement is inaccurate. For one, Bitnami Helm charts continue to be an open source project, under Apache 2, freely available to the public on GitHub. 
Second, what is actually changing is the built OCI artifacts. Essentially, Bitnami has been the Jenkins of the internet for many years, but this has become unsustainable. Operating a build pipeline and OCI registry for the general public is very expensive. Just ask those same competitors throwing shade at Bitnami why they have never offered to make their charts or images publicly available at the same scale Bitnami has?
So users can continue to freely access the Helm chart source (as well as the Debian images). However, in order to sustain and support the dedicated team of engineers who maintain and build new charts and images, a subscription will be required if an organization needs the images and charts built and hosted in an OCI registry for them. And to reiterate the above again, organizations that choose this path are simultaneously upgrading their security posture and improving their OSS strategy.
How do the changes on August 28th work?
The changes to the Bitnami repo are slated to begin on Aug 28th. They will not all be at once. Over a multi-week period, the images will be cleaned up from the registry to make room for the new ones. This is being done gradually to minimize the disruptions. However, we can’t be precise about which image will be removed at what time due to the complexity of the 84TB of OCI content that the engineering team will be dealing with. Therefore, it’s best to assume starting Aug 28th, every image used in a key business function should be addressed with an alternate registry. 
We’re making room in the mainline Bitnami registry so we can populate it with the free tier of Bitnami Secure Images. These hardened Photon have the same names as the Debian images, so they can’t occupy the same registry. And we want new adopters of Bitnami to start with the secure images going forward, as we believe this is the future of open-source software on the internet. In this FAQ, you can find more information about all the details of the upcoming changes.

About¶
This document tracks existing procedures or proposals for integrating and
validating TLS/HTTPS certificates for Onion Services.
While some depends on Certificate Authorities (CA) model, others rely on
alternative certification and validation procedures that does not require
built-in certificate chains in the client software or reliance on financial
transactions.
Introduction¶
Whenever you browse the internet regularly, the connection between your
computer and a service is usually encrypted, and the safety of this
communication happens through the verification of a special type of
certificate.
With Onion Services, the connection is peer-to-peer encrypted by default,
which means that no additional certificates are needed.
But as the web and other internet technologies mature, certificates are
starting to be a requirement in order to unleash functionalities, especially in
web browsers, such as the faster connection protocol HTTP/2 and payment
processing.
That's why it's important to improve the certificate ecosystem to fully support
Onion Services.
This is a hard problem, and an ongoing effort, but there has been some
important work done to solve this.
The most relevant one should bring automation to the process of issuing
certificates for Onion Services, through an enhancement in a protocol called
ACME.
The ACME for Onions proposal is composed of tools and also
an Internet Draft, which hopefully will turn into an
Internet Standard soon.
We are also looking into other, non-conflicting alternatives that can also be
used for certification, so service operators can decide which one fits best their
use case.
Improving the certificate functionality will put Onion Services in parity
with the modern stack of web development.
Benefits¶
It may be argued that Onion Services connections are already
self-authenticated -- since the public key and the URL are tied together and
the connection is peer-to-peer encrypted --, and thus making the need for HTTPS
pointless, or at most giving only an impression on users of additional security.
But having valid HTTPS connection in Onion Services could enable many other
enhancements, such as:


Some browser features are available only with HTTPS, like Secure
   Contexts, Content Security Policy (CSP), Secure cookies,
   WebAuthn, WebRTC and PaymentRequest.


A user may be using a browser that isn't the Tor browser.  For
   example on iOS there is only Safari, and in such cases the browser
   will not be aware of the different semantics of security for an onion
   site, and won't allow the use of secure browser features (such as
   secure cookies). This limits the kind of web apps people can develop
   on onionsites as many modern browser APIs mentioned above.


Allows for the usage of HTTP/2, since some browsers only support it if
   on HTTPS1. In the future, HTTP2 and HTTP3 may only
   work with TLS, and thus valid certificates.


It also opens up new opportunities such as payment processing, "as current
   PCI DSS requirements do not allow non-standard TLS"2 and may
   only work with certificates having some sort of validation3.
   Payments card networks require HTTPS for a payment to be taken. So if
   someone wants to do that over an onion site they would need a TLS
   certificate.


It could be argued that this is also security-in-depth by having yet another
   layer of encryption atop of other existing encryption layers. Even if the
   theoretical gain in terms of interception and tampering resistance is not
   relevant, it would still allow for service operators to split their encryption
   keys in different servers -- like one with the Onion Service keys and a backend
   having the TLS keys, thus making a compromise in one of the servers exposing
   only the cryptographic material of one of the communication layers.


The Tor daemon that hosts the onion site might not be the final
   computer in the chain. In larger organizations, deployment concerns
   may result in plain HTTP traveling across their network from the Tor
   daemon to the final web server. Having HTTPs protects those hops in
   the chain. This is something that distributed setups may need. The same
   could be said for a web browser using Tor SOCKS proxy somewhere else on the
   network.


Non-web based applications, such as IMAP/POP/SMTP etc. can benefit
   from certificates being valid.


There is simply too much software that isn't aware of onionsites,
   and trying to force HTTP-over-Onion to be as secure as HTTPS-over-TCP
   creates a compatibility mess of things which do and don't know about
   the semantics.


There is value in exposing the existence of an onion site via CT
   Logs. If someone navigates to the plain web version of a site, and is
   presented with a certificate containing a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) for
   both the plain web and the onion site that provides a strong cryptographic
   guarantee that they are the same site. Effectively this would replace the
   Onion-Location header with something more authenticated4.


The following discussion is not yet conclusive, and the problem space may be
hard to solve.

Existing CA validation¶
The CA/Browser Forum, a consortium that produces guidelines for X.509
(TLS/HTTPS) certification, created validation rules for Onion Service v2
addresses (in 2015), later extended for Onion Services v3 (in 2020),
standardizing the way Certificate Authorities can issue certificates for
.onion addresses and supports wildcards5.
Only a few commercial providers currently provide this service6.
The Appendix B of the CA/B Baseline Requirements (current repository
version) for the Issuance and Management of Publicly‐Trusted Certificates
(since Version 1.7.4, released in 2021) establishes two validation methods to ensure
that someone request the certificate really control a given .onion address:

An "Agreed‑Upon Change to Website" (manually or via ACME), where the
   service operator must include some secret, such as at the
   /.well-known/pki-validation of the site.
TLS using ALPN.
Checking of a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) signed by the Onion Service
   private key and containing an specific cryptographic nonce (i.e, a shared
   secret to be used only once), like using the onion-csr tool.

Note that both methods does not require that operators disclose the location of
the Onion Service, nor them need to have a regular site for the service using
DNS. Validation can either happen by accessing directly the Onion Service or
by using the service private key to sign a CSR.
But still commercial CAs (or financial institution) may still collect
identifiable information during the purchase of the certificates.
ACME for .onion (CA-validated)¶
In general, getting certificates from CAs supporting the CA/B Baseline
Requirements for .onion addresses is still a manual, or in the best-case
scenario, semi-automated task.
The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) standard (RFC
8555) solves part of the automation problem, and with the arrival of
RFC 9799 it also supports methods for validating Onion Services.
Having support for .onion address in the ACME standard is the first step
for projects like Let's Encrypt to offer free certificates for Onion
Services, without financial transactions.
Existing proposals to bring ACME for Onion Services are discussed below.
ACME for Onions¶
The "Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Extensions for
".onion" Domain Names" (draft-misell-acme-onion) is the second known
proposal to bring ACME for .onion addresses.
This is the proposal that lead to RFC 9799.
A detailed analysis on ACME for Onions is available in a special
appendix.

ACME Onion Identifier Validation Extension¶
The "Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Onion Identifier
Validation Extension" internet draft (draft-suchan-acme-onion-00)
was proposed on 2022-05 and is the first known proposal to bring ACME
for .onion addresses.
As of 2023-06-07, this internet draft is in the expired state, being now
supplanted by RFC 9799.

Self-signed certificates¶
This proposal basically consists in allowing the use of self-signed
certificates with Onion Services:

For web applications like the Tor Browser, this would consist
   in disabling self-signed certificate warnings when visiting .onion
   sites. As an alternative, there's also the Self-authenticating TLS
   Certificates for Onion Services using a PKCS#11 module discussed
   below and relying on PKCS#11 modules or Authority Information Access
   (AIA) extensions, which could handle self-signed certificates matching
   the Onion Service address without the need to merge this logic directly in
   the applications, as it would remain decoupled in a PKCS#11 module, thus
   being easier to maintain.
For other applications -- like the TorVPN and third-party software --,
   this would probably require patches or documentation instructing users to
   accept non-CA signed certificates when accessing Onion Services, which is
   very hard to provide and to maintain for a wide ranging of tools.


Supported key types
In this proposal, any key types supported by applications could be used.
In case of popular web browsers, the CA/B Baseline Requirements
must be taken into account, which as of 2024-09 only allows for
RSA or ECDSA keys.
It could also be possible to use self-signed certs using Ed25519,
which is discussed below and currently not widely supported by
browsers.

This proposal would not provide:

A self-authentication mechanism (since the certificate is self-signed).
   This have a huge weight since an important piece of security provided
   by HTTPS is not just end-to-end encryption but also authentication.

Supporting self-signed certificates with Onion Services has a huge gain,
but also introduces an authentication complexity. That's why proper UI
indicators and hints are needed:

For the encryption state of the site (HTTP and various HTTPS situations).
For the authentication state of the site, telling how it was (not)
   authenticated.

There are already sketches for different scenarios for how various user
interface hints and indicators could exist for Tor Browser and other software
maintained by Tor, as well as existing certificate proposals that can change
the certificate landscape for Onion Services in the future, which could be
adopted by operators instead of relying on self-signed certs.
But all these enhancements would still limit the practical application domain
of this proposal, since it would be readily available only to a small set
of applications like Tor Browser, except if by pursuing some standardization
such as the SOOC proposal below.
Self-signed X.509 from .onion (self-signed by the .onion address)¶
Another option for having HTTPS in Onion Services that may be available in the
future is to use Onion Service key pair to self-validate an HTTPS certificate
using Ed25519 directly:

The Onion x509 is an example in how a CA self-signed by an .onion could
  be constructed.
There's also a ticket requesting to add support for self-signed HTTPS onion
  sites derived from onion service's ed25519 key in the Tor Browser.

For an overview of Ed25519, check How do Ed5519 keys work?. For details
about how Tor implements Ed25519, check prop220 (and rend-spec-v3
for how it implements at the Onion Services level).
This proposal has the advantage to not rely on Certificate Authorities, but the
disadvantage that needs additional logic both server and client side to make it
work, since a CA would needed to be installed for every visited Onion Service
using this scheme.
On using .onion keys for certification¶
It's important to note that the current (as of 2024-09) Onion Services v3
specification does not allow the Master Onion Service identity key to be used
for purposes other than generating blinded signing keys (see Section 1.9 from
the rend-spec-v3):

Master (hidden service) identity key -- A master signing key pair
  used as the identity for a hidden service.  This key is long
  term and not used on its own to sign anything; it is only used
  to generate blinded signing keys as described in [KEYBLIND]
  and [SUBCRED]. The public key is encoded in the ".onion"
  address according to [NAMING].
  KP_hs_id, KS_hs_id.

On Ed25519 certificates support in browsers¶
Also, while many TLS libraries support the Ed25519 signing scheme used for
certificates (like in OpenSSL since version 1.1.1), major web browsers
still does not support it (as of 2022-12)7, probably because
they're not supported8 by the current (as of 2024-09) CA/B
Baseline Requirements:

6.1.1.3 Subscriber Key Pair Generation
The CA SHALL reject a certificate request if one or more of the following
conditions are met:

The Key Pair does not meet the requirements set forth in Section 6.1.5
   and/or Section 6.1.6;

[...]
6.1.5 Key sizes
For RSA key pairs the CA SHALL:
• Ensure that the modulus size, when encoded, is at least 2048 bits, and;
• Ensure that the modulus size, in bits, is evenly divisible by 8.
For ECDSA key pairs, the CA SHALL:
• Ensure that the key represents a valid point on the NIST P‐256, NIST P‐384
  or NIST P‐521 elliptic curve.
No other algorithms or key sizes are permitted.

Implementing X.509 certs derived from the .onion key pair¶
In summary, implementing this proposal would require pushing at least two
specification changes:

A ballot with CA/B Forum about including Ed25519 support.
An update in the Onion Services v3 spec, allowing the Onion Service identity
   keys to either:
Also act as Certificate Authority root keys for the service.
Derive long-term (1 year) blinded keys to be used as a Certificate
   Authority for the service, maybe using the same approach described by
   Appendix A ([KEYBLIND]) from rend-spec-v3 but covering the needed
   use case of a long-term key, i.e, depending in a long-term nonce and not in
   [TIME-PERIODS].



It's also important to avoid using the Onion Service key directly as the HTTPS
certificate. That would:

Expose the Onion Service secret key material to more software than it's
  needed, like a web server.
Make it very difficult to manage offline Onion Service master keys.

Instead, it's better to use the Onion Service key pair to act as a CA that then
certifies a separate key pair to be used with HTTPS.
Similar to the self-signed certificate proposal, this approach would have
limited adoption if only as small number of applications implement it -- such
as the Tor Browser --, except if endorsed by many stakeholders in the form of a
specification -- like the SOOC proposal discussed below.
Self-authenticating TLS Certificates for Onion Services using a PKCS#11 module¶
The Self-authenticating TLS Certificates for Onion Services using a PKCS#11
module proposal mentioned above, that relies on PKCS#11 modules or
Authority Information Access (AIA) extensions, could also be used to work
with a X.509 certificate directly derived from the .onion key pair.
But contrary to the previous proposal, it would not need to use Ed25519: it
would support a signature scheme where an Ed25519 private key could sign an
ECDSA key. This Ed25519 signature could either be created using the .onion
private key itself or a fresh Ed25519 subkey, thus avoiding key reuse.
Advantages:


Would reduce logic in the Tor Browser by a well-established API.


Does not need to use Ed25519 X.509 certificates: can work with ECDSA
  which are fully supported by major browsers according to the
  CA/B Baseline Requirements, and maybe could even work with RSA.


Seems future-proof as PKCS#11 modules are widely used.


No reliance on the CA-model (and hence has increased censorship resistance).


No need to use CT Logs.


Could be used by other browsers as well (such as Brave).


Could be used with any software, library or Operating System with PKCS#11
  support.


Disadvantages:


In the short-to-mid term this would not be supported on OpenSSL
  (as of 2024-09, support PKCS#11 modules is still underway).


System-wide support would depend on how each Operating System could support
  this custom module. So could be hard to add this to TorVPN. But anyway,
  TorVPN can't validate existing self-signed .onion certs either, as
  of 2024-09.


Operators currently using self-signed certs would need to migrate to new
  certificates.

Same Origin Onion Certificates (SOOC)¶
The Same Origin Onion Certificates (SOOC) proposal aims to specify when "in
very limited circumstances, we shall not care about signatures at all",
allowing clients to disable self-signed certificate warnings when visiting
.onion sites.
The main difference between the SOOC proposal and to simply start allowing
self-signed certificates is that SOOC is aimed to be an IETF proposal that
could gain momentum and hence have a greater chance to be adopt by many
different vendors.
See the SOOC document for details.
DANE for .onion¶
Another option is to use DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE),
with DNS records like this to associate an Onion Service address with a given
HTTPS certificate's public key hash:
_443._tcp.testk4ae7qr6nhlgahvyicxy7nsrmfmhigtdophufo3vumisvop2gryd.onion. TSLA 3 1 1 AB9BEB9919729F3239AF08214C1EF6CCA52D2DBAE788BB5BE834C13911292ED9

In order for that to work, logic should be implemented in the client software.
Drawbacks:

Service operators must update this record whenever a new certificate is issued.
Has some limits for wildcard certificates on specific ports.
DANE is not widely supported, especially by web browsers.
It would only work for service operators willing to publish the .onion address in the DNS.

Onion-only CAs¶
This proposal consists of:

Having .onion-only CAs with name constraints (only allowing issuance for
   .onion). Services available both via DNS-based and .onion domains will need
   to have two TLS certificates in order to use this approach -- one certificate
   for the DNS-based domain (as usual) and another only for the .onion address.
Certification procedure would be automated, so generated .onion addresses
   could easily have it's certificates issued by this special type of CA.
Certification would then happen by checking a signature in a CSR and
   comparing the Subject Alternative Name (SAN). Signature must be validated by
   the .onion address in the SAN.
So this type of CA would be mainly a basic notary that attests signatures and
   issues a corresponding certificate.
The name constraint for this type of CA ensures that it only issues
   certificates for .onion domains.

Security considerations:

Suppose there's a malicious or bugged CA of this type that issues a
   certificate containing a SAN for $address1.onion but:
Without checking whether the CSR has a signature made by
   $address1.onion's private key.
Or if allowing that another, unrelated $address2.onion actually signs
   this CSR.


Even if that's the case, i.e, the CA wrongly issued a certificate for
   $address1.onion that did not match the requirements, this certificate
   won't work in practice, since in a successful Onion Service TLS connection
   to $address1.onion the following must happen:
The underlying Tor Rendezvous connection should ensure that the
   client is connected to $address1.onion (Onion Services connections
   are self-authenticated by the .onion address).
The Onion Service should then offer it's TLS certificate, which would
   not be the malicious one (except if the service is already compromised,
   but in that case the attacker would not need to forge an invalid certificate
   anyway...).
Then the client's TLS library tests whether the certificate chain can be
   verified and any SAN in the presented certificate matches $address1.onion,
   among other checks (such as expiration).


That said, the work done by this special type of CA is only to expand the
  self-authentication property from the .onion address into a certificate. So
the attack surface of this special type of CA may be inherently low.

Implementation considerations:

Since Ed25519 certificates probably won't be supported by major
  browsers/clients in the foreseeable future (see discussion above at the
  Self-signed X.509 for .onion section), issuance should probably follow the
  Appendix B of the CA/B Baseline Requirements.
The entire certification procedure could happen via Onion Services.
Actually the whole CA infrastructure (website, APIs, OCSP etc) could be
  interacted only via Onion Services, to reduce the attack surface and protect
  the service location.
Important to consider whether would be possible to organizations setup and
  maintain a Onion-only CA that's as most automated as possible, including root
  certificate packaging/distribution/rotation.

Pros:

Easy to implement on the client side (just need to install the CA).
Easy to implement and maintain on Tor-native applications such as Tor
   Browser and the Tor VPN.
Possibly lowest attack surface than with regular CAs!
Largest certification expiration dates could be used (like one year).

Cons:

Might not be easy to find CAs willing to do this, or to a new one to be
   formed for this purpose.
Might need a merge request to include this method in the CA/B Baseline
   Requirements, if wider acceptance is intended.
No guarantees that these special CAs would be installed among all clients
   and libraries.
Need additional security analysis.

Open questions:

Need to check if Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) are needed,
   and how to handle it.
Need to figure out how OCSP and OCSP Stapling could happen. OSCP
   connection could be available behind an Onion Service.
Does sending certificates to CT Logs still makes sense for this special
   type of certification?
Needs built-in DoS/service abuse protection:
An idea for that: implement a simple PoW by additionally requiring that
  service operators provide a proof-ownership of another .onion address
  made by an specific vanity address (like limited to 5 or 6 chars).

  disadvantages)

  qualified onion service key signed certificate request, where this

Custom CAs¶
There are also discussions about how to properly manage custom Certificate
Authorities, i.e, those not distributed in TLS libraries by default (such as
the certificate store in a web browser):

Notes¶




But not HTTP/3 yet, since it uses UDP not available
                   via Tor (as of 2023-05). The HTTP/2 standard does not
                   require encryption, but
                   all major browsers require encryption for HTTP/2
                   and encryption for HTTP/3 is required by default. ↩


See PCI-DSS v4.0 - Appendix G - Term "Strong Cryptography" - page 355, which
            points only to "industry tested and accepted algorithms". While we could argue
            that PCI-DSS v4.0 is not precise enough about which transmission protocols
            might be used, it may be the case that the encryption used by the Onion Services'
            Rendezvous v3 protocol is not (yet) part of an "industry standard" (needs someone
            to carefully review this claim and open a merge request to update this information).
            It also may be the case that PCI-DSS compliance may be hard to get for a system
            that employs only the Rendezvous v3 protocol to transmit cardholder data between
            an user and an Onion Service, without TLS atop of it. And users might not trust
            the connection if not over TLS, or if their browser does not show certificate information. ↩


It's worth note that PCI-DSS does allow for
                    the use of self-signed certificates under some special conditions
                    that may exclude some of the proposals in this document (see PCI-DSS v4.0 - Requirement 4.2 -
                    Applicability Notes - page 106). In practice, this is
                    only applicable for internal links within an organization or for clients and libraries that
                    have the custom Certificate Authorities' root keys on it's keystores and that matches the
                    standard requirements. And users would hardly trust a
                    self-signed certificate for doing online purchases as their browsers would show
                    warning messages. Recommendation (see PCI-DSS v4.0 - Requirement 4.2 -
                    Guidance - page 106) goes instead towards a certificate trusted by a
                    Certificate Authority. ↩


However, the argument about revealing an onion site that would like
            to remain hidden, is a real one. For those services, it could
            be considered options such as a non-CT Logs issuing CA that may not be in
            the "valid" set, but operated by a friendly to Tor organization, which is
            added to Tor Browser as a valid certifier. The standards space may be
            moving towards requiring CT log submissions at some point, so this is
            something to keep an eye on. Another possibility would be to consider
            writing a standard for hashing onion site names in CT Logs, so they can
            be verified, but not revealed (such as what WhatsApp did in their
            Auditable Key Directory). Such a standard could take years to
            get to place of usefulness, and probably encounter
            resistance. Otherwise, the only option for such a service operator is
            to have a self-signed certificate, or none at all. ↩


For a historical background on Domain Validation (DV) certs,
               check the CA/B forum thread
               DV issuance for next-generation onion services. ↩


As of January 2023, there are only two CAs issuing
                    certificates for .onion domains:
                    DigiCert providing only Extended Validation (EV) certs
                    and HARICA providing only Domain Validated (DV) certs. ↩


They usually just support X25519, which is a key
agreement scheme not to be confused with Ed25519. ↩


This is tracked on cabforum/servercert issue #451, which is about
                   adding EdDSA (and hence Ed25519) support in the

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[bookmarks.txt
bookmarks.txt is a concept of keeping bookmarks in plain text files.
Principals

Bookmarked URLs are stored in files named bookmarks.txt. The format is described below.
A "global" bookmarks file is located in the home directory ($HOME/bookmarks.txt).
"Local" bookmarks files could exist in different directories as well.

Format
URLs are stored one per line and could be accompanied with optional titles. Titles are separated from URLs with one space character.
URL [title]

Examples:


a URL without any title
https://www.example.com
-----------------------
^
URL



a URL with a title
https://sul.im personal website
-------------- ----------------
^              ^
URL            Optional title



Tools
The plain text nature of bookmark files allows to use any program to manage URLs. The bin/ directory of this repository contains bookmarks script that could be used to list existing and add new URLs. However nothing should stop you from building your own tools.
Usage
Use fzf to select a URL and open it in the default browser:
./bin/bookmarks | fzf | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | xargs open
Add a new URL:
./bin/bookmarks https://github.com/soulim/bookmarks.txt
This is how I use bookmarks.txt:

$HOME/bookmarks.txt contains URLs useful in any context. These are "global" addresses.
Each project directory has "local" bookmarks.txt files with URLs pointing to tools specific to each project (repositories, monitoring tools, dashboards, and so on).
A symbolic link $HOME/bin/bookmarks point to bin/bookmarks from this directory.
With help of fzf I have a nice menu with fuzzy search to select URLs and open them automatically.

Contributing
bookmarks.txt is open to code contributions for bug fixes only. As features might carry a long-term maintenance burden, they will not be accepted at this time. Please submit an issue if you have a feature you would like to request.

AbstractThe popularity of breathwork as a therapeutic tool for psychological distress is rapidly expanding. Breathwork practices that increase ventilatory rate or depth, facilitated by music, can evoke subjective experiential states analogous to altered states of consciousness (ASCs) evoked by psychedelic substances. These states include components such as euphoria, bliss, and perceptual differences. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the profound subjective effects of high ventilation breathwork (HVB) remain largely unknown and unexplored. In this study, we investigated the neurobiological substrates of ASCs induced by HVB in experienced practitioners. We demonstrate that the intensity of ASCs evoked by HVB was proportional to cardiovascular sympathetic activation and to haemodynamic alterations in cerebral perfusion within clusters spanning the left operculum/posterior insula and right amygdala/anterior hippocampus; regions implicated in respiratory interoceptive representation and the processing of emotional memories, respectively. These observed regional cerebral effects may underlie pivotal mental experiences that mediate positive therapeutic outcomes of HVB.

IntroductionHigh ventilation breathwork (HVB) encompasses contemplative and therapeutic practices, including Conscious Connected Breathing or Holotropic Breathwork, in which a controlled pattern of volitional breathing increases the rate or depth of ventilation and is typically accompanied by evocative music. Despite their distinct historical roots and delivery modalities, these different HVB practices share a purported ability to elicit acute extraordinary alterations in subjective experience that closely resemble the qualia of altered states of consciousness (ASCs) induced by psychedelic substances [1–3]. Converging evidence demonstrates the potential value of psychedelic treatments for specific difficult-to-treat psychiatric and physiological conditions [4–7]. The induction of ASCs is suggested to be critical to the therapeutic action of psychedelic substances [8–10], for which HVB might therefore offer a non-pharmacological alternative, with fewer legal and ethical restrictions to large-scale adoption in clinical treatment. In line with this, the popularity of HVB as a therapeutic tool for psychological distress is rapidly expanding, indexed by an increased number of scientific investigations, see [11,12] for more details.
The therapeutic potential of HVB practices is suggested by a long cultural tradition of use to relieve symptoms of psychological distress [11,13] and by emerging preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy from controlled trials in affective and trauma-related disorders [14]. Prolonged hyperventilation/HVB reportedly elicits a wide range of effects on subjective experience that include emotional and psychedelic-like phenomena (ASCs), which range from panic-like sensations to feelings of awe and dissociative symptoms [11]. The 5D-ASC questionnaire is popularly used in ASC research to retrospectively assess such states [15]. A key dimension of this scale is ‘Oceanic Boundlessness’ (OBN); a term coined by Freud in 1920 [16] which describes a set of related feelings including ‘spiritual experience, insightfulness, blissful state, positively experienced depersonalization, and the experience of unity’ [17]. OBN is considered as a defining aspect of ASCs evoked by psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin. However, the neurobiological mechanisms and subjective experience underlying ASCs induced by HVB have not been studied extensively and remain elusive.
First, we characterised the subjective experience of HVB to capture the nature and intensity of evoked experiential phenomena. From these data, we aimed to assess whether these effects could be reliably reproduced in controlled experimental settings in comparison to a remote – and more ecologically valid – condition. These findings informed the choice of the ASC variable, OBN, which was ultimately selected as the most widely reported experiential phenomena to identify the critical neurobiological effects of HVB.
Then we examined the effects of HVB performed by experienced breathwork practitioners in different experimental settings, and investigated peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning ASCs engendered by HVB. The neurobiological endpoints were selected based on well-characterised neurophysiological effects of hyperventilation (reviewed in [11]). Hyperventilation acutely reduces regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) through interacting effects of hypocapnia, cerebral alkalosis and hypoxia, resulting in transient perturbation of neurometabolic homeostasis. Further, hyperventilation evokes allostatic changes in action-ready bodily arousal, mediated via the autonomic nervous system via the dominance of sympathetic over parasympathetic drive to the heart and blood vessels. In characterising the neurobiological effects of HVB and associated ASCs, we therefore focused our measurements on two robust indices of neurometabolic and autonomic nervous control: rCBF and heart rate variability (HRV).
To our knowledge, no studies have previously reported the relationship between the intensity of ASCs and changes in rCBF induced by HVB practices. Since we could not base our prediction of the regional specificity of such correlations on previous knowledge, we preferred to adopt a whole brain voxelwise exploratory approach. Also, as observations reported on the effects of psychedelics on autonomic nervous system activity have been contrasting [18,19], we could not make precise predictions on the direction of association between HRV and ASCs.
Our study was designed to address different objectives through three inter-related experiments: (please see the methods for more details), in 1) HVB was conducted over an online video-conferencing platform with a breathwork facilitator (REMOTE setting). The aim was to characterise the subjective response to remote HVB in a home setting, and inform the choice of the ASC domain to be used as subjective endpoint. In 2), we used pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling (pCASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain during HVB to identify the relationship between neural haemodynamic effects of HVB and subjective measures (MRI setting). In 3) HVB was performed in a psychophysiology lab to characterise the relationship between the psychophysiological effects of HVB (autonomic alterations, see ‘psychophysiological session 3’ for more information) and subjective measures (LAB setting).


Materials and methods
Ethics statement
This research was approved by the Research Governance and Ethics Committee (RGEC) in Brighton and Sussex Medical School (BSMS) as ERA/BSMS9AN4/2/2. Recruitment began on 24/11/2021 and ended on 03/03/2022. Participants provided written informed consent before participating.


Participants
Physically and psychiatrically healthy participants aged 18–65 years old were recruited from the local area through advertisements and flyers distributed at breathwork events, in yoga/meditation centres, and on social media. Participants were eligible to take part if they had either 10 or more experiences of fast-paced breathwork or at least 6 months of any HVB practice (as defined in [11]). They were screened online for eligibility and excluded if they were pregnant, currently experiencing any psychiatric condition (assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to ensure absence of DSM-V listed disorders) [20]. Additional exclusion criteria included a history of epileptic seizures, panic disorder, or syncope in prior HVB, current neurological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, or cardiovascular disease, current pharmacological treatment, and contraindications to MRI.
Participants and were financially compensated £10 per hour for their time and up to £10 in travel expenses.


Breathwork modality and subjective measures
HVB consisted of cyclic breathing without pausing, accompanied by progressively evocative music. This aimed to reproduce the experience of Conscious Connected Breathing, a widely adopted HVB practice typically led by a trained breathwork facilitator. In the online experimental session, instructions were provided by a breathwork facilitator (DB) who hosted the group of online participants. For the LAB and MRI setting, pre-recorded instructions by the same facilitator were delivered to participants. Specific details on breathwork instructions are presented in the supplementary index (S1 Appendix).


Questionnaires
Self-reported measures were consistent across the three conditions and administered online via Qualtrics (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) [21] within 30 minutes post-HVB. The selected questionnaires assessed: 1) Affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule – Expanded Form, PANAS-X [22]); 2) Panic–like symptoms (Panic Symptoms List, PSL [23]), 3) Fear and discomfort (Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) [24]), and 4) Symptoms of ASCs (5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale, 5D-ASC [15]).
Pre-session questionnaires included the VAS (scored from “0 – no fear and discomfort” to “100 – complete fear and discomfort”) [24] and the PANAS-X, which measured affect using 60 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale from “1 – very slightly or not at all” to “5 – extremely” [25].
Post-session questionnaires included the VAS and PANAS-X again, as well as the 5D-ASC, which retrospectively assessed ASCs using 94 items rated via VAS [17]. Questions and responses were grouped into 3 broad subscales: oceanic boundlessness (OBN) as previously mentioned, visionary restructuralisation (VRS) to examine the effect of the HVB on vision, and Dread of Ego Dissolution (DED) which captures the anxiety-inducing effects of the experience related to the idea of the dissolution of the self [15]. The PSL, a 13-item tool used to evaluate panic symptomatology, required participants to rate each item on a five-point scale from “0 – not at all” to “4 – extremely severe”.
The PSL and VAS for fear/discomfort were scored based on [24]: a significant panic attack was indicated by an increase in VAS fear by 50 points and 4 or more items rated above mild in the PSL (mild = 2).


Online experimental session 1 (REMOTE)
The session was conducted remotely via an online video-conferencing platform (Zoom). Preparatory information was sent to participants after screening and enrolment, including the platform link, instructions, and pre- and post-session questionnaires.
Participants received instructions on camera setup and were assigned personal participant numbers. They were instructed to be in a private room to avoid interruptions and to position their cameras to capture their chest and stomach for observation of full-body, continuous breaths. A breathwork facilitator remotely guided groups of participants through the 30-minute online breathwork session. Members of the research team were present online to ensure session consistency and to monitor participant engagement in HVB practice. No group experience-sharing (integration) followed the breathwork sessions to avoid memory and experience merging. Instead, participants self-integrated (processed) their session by completing retrospective questionnaires that explored the qualia of the experience within 30 minutes of concluding the session.


Neuroimaging experimental session 2 (MRI)
Each participant in the neuroimaging session was scanned on a Siemens Prisma 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner fitted with a 32-channel head coil. High-resolution structural scans were obtained during rest using a 3D T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (T1 MPRAGE) sequence (repetition time (TR) = 2300 ms, echo time (TE) = 2.19 ms, flip angle = 9°, matrix = 256 × 256, voxel size = 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm3, GRAPPA acceleration factor = 2; total acquisition time (TA) = 5m 30s). Additionally, twenty control and label images were acquired per condition using a pCASL with background suppression following the parameter recommendation of the consensus paper [26]: label duration = 2000ms, post-labelling delay (PLD) = 1800ms, TR = 5000 ms, TE = 14 ms, voxel size = 3.4 × 3.4 × 6.0 mm3, TA = 3m 22s), was acquired. A proton density (M0) image was acquired using the same readout and TR as the control and label images to estimate pcASL CBF.
Fig 1 is a schematic presentation of the MRI experimental design. Recorded instructions (see S1 Appendix) guided participants to breathe through three phases: BASELINE, START, and SUSTAINED HVB. BASELINE consisted of breathing at a normal rate for 20 minutes. Participants were asked to gradually increase their ventilation rate and/or depth via recorded instructions (START HVB) for approximately 6 minutes. The SUSTAINED HVB phase started after at least 5 minutes of START HVB and once end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2), measured via nasal cannula connected to a capnograph (MICROCAP®, Oridion Medical LTD), was stable at levels ≤20 mmHg (from a typical value of 35–40 mmHg), and was maintained for a further ~20-minutes.

BASELINE = 25 min 32s, breathwork = 23 min 10s. Relaxing music was played at BASELINE during rest for the participant, and evocative up-tempo music that features in breathwork sessions with instructions recorded by a breathwork facilitator were played during HVB.

              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329411.g001Scans were performed during BASELINE (10 minutes after the scan start), at the start of HVB (immediately after initiating HVB), and during SUSTAINED HVB (after at least 6 minutes of uninterrupted breathwork).
SPM12 [27] and custom written Matlab (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, Massachusetts) scripts were used for image processing and statistics. Rigid-body motion correction was used to realign labelled and control images, and perfusion weighted images were calculated for the realigned control-labelled pairs by subtracting the labelled image from the control. The mean perfusion weighted images were then used to estimate CBF using the one-compartment model [26] and processed to obtain partial volume-corrected [28], tissue-specific (i.e., grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM)) CBF images independently. The pcASL CBF images were normalized maps in MNI space using SPM12 [27]. Participants with prominent arterial transit artifacts in the CBF images, evident by the presence of strong arterial signals upon visual inspection, were excluded from the study.


Psychophysiological session 3 (LAB)
Participants in the psychophysiology study attended the psychophysiology lab at the Trafford Centre for Medical Research at BSMS. To measure beat-to-beat heart rate (HR) and HRV (computed as the root mean square of successive differences, RMSSD) [29], an electrocardiograph (Firstbeat Bodyguard 2 device) was applied to the torso [28]. To measure EtCO2, the participant was fitted with a nasal cannula connected to a capnograph (MICROCAP®, Oridion Medical LTD). Following a BASELINE period during which the participant was instructed to breathe as normal to relaxing music for 10 minutes, the participant was instructed to perform HVB (see supplementary index for more information). This began as a 5-minute warm-up (START HVB) where the participant performed HVB to lower their EtCO2 to ≤20 mmHg, followed by 25-minutes of HVB (SUSTAINED HVB) where EtCO2 was maintained ≤20 mmHg, aided by recorded instructions from a trained breathwork facilitator. For analyses, the HVB period was defined as starting once EtCO2 was stable below 20 mmHg and was subsequently recorded for 20 minutes. The recovery period began immediately after HVB was terminated, and participants resumed their normal breathing. Participants completed retrospective questionnaires within 30 minutes of the session’s conclusion.

Data analysis and statistics.Objective 1: To characterize the subjective response to HVB across different settings (REMOTE, LAB, MRI), we compared affective responses (PANAS-X scores clustered into positive and negative domains), panic-like symptoms (VAS fear/discomfort and PSL) and ASCs. For the 5D-ASC, the percentage maximum score was calculated per participant and dimension [30]. Data were compared across the three experiments to test for differences in self-reported effects. A linear mixed-effects model (LMM) was used to examine the effects of setting on the mean responses within each dimension of the 5D-ASC and for the PSL, accounting for subject-specific variability as a random effect using the lmer package in R; [31]. We used the likelihood ratio test to compare a full model with a fixed effect of setting and a random effect of subject to a reduced model with only a random effect of subject [31]. Post-hoc tests were performed using the emmeans package in R [32], adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Tukey method.
For the PANAS-X and VAS, we used an LMM analysis to examine the effects of HVB (pre- versus post-) on setting and the type of question (positive versus negative affect for PANAS; discomfort versus fear for VAS), accounting for subject-specific variability as a random effect. We explored two-way interactions between all the variables and post-hoc tests using the same methods as the previous analyses [32].
Objective 2: In order to test the correlations between HVB-induced ASCs and rCBF effects, two contrasts between HVB time points (see MRI experimental design in Fig 1) were studied using paired-samples t-tests in SPM12 [27]: contrast 1) between BASELINE and START HVB grey matter CBF; contrast 2) between BASELINE and SUSTAINED HVB grey matter CBF. Following this, voxel-wise maps of changes in pcASL rCBF (ΔrCBF) were calculated for the contrasts between BASELINE versus SUSTAINED HVB, and START versus SUSTAINED HVB. These ΔrCBF maps were then used for voxelwise correlation analysis with the OBN score, selected as the highest-rated 5D-ASC dimension. Voxel clusters were considered significant at a cluster-forming threshold of p < 0.001, corrected for multiple comparisons using family-wise error (FWE) correction, with a significance level of p < 0.05.
Objective 3: To investigate changes in cardiac autonomic drive during HVB and their relationship to the intensity of ASCs, we calculated change in HRV (ΔRMSSD) and HR. Heartbeat timing data were imported from the Firstbeat Bodyguard device into Kubios 3.5.0 HRV scientific 4.1.0 for processing. Raw data contained substantial noise from chest movement. After an initial phase of artefact removal, interbeat interval (IBI) data were smoothed using an automatic noise detection filter at a medium threshold [33]. A repeated measures ANCOVA with contrasts for different orders of an equation was conducted using HRV and OBN (5D-ASC selected from objective 1) as covariates to explain HRV variance over time, with polynomial contrast applied to identify linear and complex patterns, allowing us to characterise dynamic trends in HRV responses to HVB.




ResultsSelf-reported data from 42 participants were analysed, comprising 31 unique individuals. Study participants enrolled in one to three experimental sessions: n = 15 (age 42.9 ± 12.6 years, 5 females) for the online experimental session; n = 8 (age 41 ± 13.02 years, 2 females) for the session conducted within the psychophysiology lab; and n = 19 (age 43.7 ± 11.9; 7 females) for the MRI experimental session. There were different participants in each condition (3 repeated all conditions, 5 participants participated in 2 conditions, see S1 Fig for key subjective effects of repeated participants). No adverse events, including panic attacks, were reported across all experimental settings.

Subjective effect results
Generally, measures of fear and discomfort were low in all conditions (Fig 2, panel C). LMM analyses identified only a significant two-way interaction between HVB and question type (fear and discomfort), with post-hoc tests showing a significant increase in discomfort post-HVB. These results indicate that perceived discomfort increased during HVB, while perceived fear remained stable across settings.

C) Fear and discomfort assessed by VAS indicated no significant effect of experimental setting on HVB, although there was a trend increase in discomfort and reduction in fear after HVB across all environments. D) Negative affect assessed by PANAS-X was reduced by HVB. There was no significant effect of HVB on positive affect, and no significant effect of environment on negative or positive affect. E) For the PSL, a linear mixed-effect model revealed a significant main effect of setting (χ2(2) = 20.41, p < 0.001; see ‘Data analysis and statistics’). Post-hoc Tukey tests identified significant differences between LAB vs. MRI and MRI vs. REMOTE (LAB – MRI, t(22.11) = −3.78, p = 0.003; LAB – REMOTE, t(28.84) = 0.041, p = 0.999; MRI – REMOTE, t(34.09) = −4.37, p < 0.001).

              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329411.g002None of the mean individual post-HVB PSL scores were ≥ 2, indicating that no panic symptoms reached a clinically significant threshold (a score of 2 corresponded to ‘moderate’). However, the LMM identified a significant main effect of setting on the PSL, with post-hoc analyses showing the PSL scores were significantly higher in the MRI setting compared to the LAB and REMOTE settings (Fig 2, panel E). LMM analyses on the PANAS-X found only a significant two-way interaction between pre/post-HVB and affect, with post-hoc analyses revealing a significant decrease in negative affect from pre- to post-HVB (Fig 2, panel D). These results indicate that HVB decreased negative affect, while positive affect remained stable across settings.
In all three settings, HVB elicited altered subjective experiences indicated by positive scores in all dimensions of the 5D-ASC (Fig 2, panels A and B). The highest rated phenomenon was OBN across all three settings, which was selected as a meaningful proxy indicator of the subjective effects of HVB for analysis. A LMM revealed no significant main effect of setting and no significant interaction effect between setting and dimension (Fig 2, panel B).


MRI results
Datasets from 13 participants (mean age 43.7 ± 11.9; 7 female) were included in the analysis. Voxel clusters showing statistically significant CBF reductions occupied 12% and 28.5% of global grey matter volume at START and SUSTAINED HVB, respectively. Global CBF was reduced by 30.5% during START (36.2 ± 12.4 ml/100g/min) and 41.6% during SUSTAINED HVB (30.5 ± 8.5 ml/100g/min) relative to BASELINE (52.2 ± 8.2 ml/100g/min).
We first identified a region of cortex where HVB-evoked reduction in perfusion (ΔrCBF from BASELINE to SUSTAINED) correlated with the magnitude of ASC in the OBN dimension. This cluster encompassed left parietal operculum/posterior insula (PO/INS) (Fig 3). Here, rCBF in PO/INS was reduced by 7.7% during the START period of HVB (43.7 ± 10 ml/100g/min) and 18.9% during SUSTAINED HVB (38.4 ± 12.7 ml/100g/min) relative to BASELINE (52.2 ± 8.2 ml/100g/min).

              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329411.g003Next, we identified regions of significant positive correlation between OBN score and ΔCBF changes from START to SUSTAINED (Fig 4). The cluster encompassed right basolateral amygdala and extended to the CA1 region of anterior hippocampus (BLA/CA1) rCBF. Statistical significance was assessed using cluster size inference (initial cluster-forming threshold: p < 0.001; corrected FWE: p < 0.05).

              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329411.g004We then investigated if specific concepts related to OBN, namely, disembodiment, experience of unity and blissful state [17], were associated with ΔCBF in PO/INS from BASELINE to SUSTAINED. Analyses identified negative correlations between ΔCBF and the experience of unity (Fig 5A) and blissful state (Fig 5B), but not disembodiment, indicating that the magnitude of subjective experience related to bliss and unity correlated with a reduction in perfusion in this region.

HRV results
A repeated-measures ANCOVA demonstrated an effect of time on RMSSD through BASELINE and phases of HVB and recovery, indicating a significant within-participant cubic effect. There was a significant interaction effect between OBN and the polynomial cubic contrast, F(1, 6) = 6.211, p < 0.05 (Fig 6).

              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329411.g006Participants were classified into high and low OBN responders using a cutoff score of 50 (50% of the maximum score) to identify ASC experience based on criteria in psychedelic drug literature, e.g., [34].



DiscussionOur study is the first that aims to characterise the relationship between the intensity of ASCs induced by HVB practices and associated central and autonomic nervous system effects, via changes in pcASL rCBF and HRV, respectively. Our findings identified significant correlations that might indicate possible neurobiological substrates of HVB-evoked ASCs, accompanied by music. First, our findings demonstrated that the experience of HVB can be safely reproduced across different experimental settings. The pattern of self-reported experiences elicited within the MRI scanner and psychophysiology lab were analogous to those experienced at home (a more natural and comfortable environment).
During all experimental sessions, participants reported a trend-level reduction in ratings of fear and negative emotions. Additionally, no adverse reactions or panic attacks were experienced by any participants. However, there was a mild increase in discomfort ratings and mild panic-like symptoms were reported during the MRI session – although these were not associated to increased anxiety or panic attacks and might have been evoked by the physical constraints of being inside the MRI chamber. This experience conflicts typical breathwork practice. The observed increase in physical discomfort alongside reductions in fear and negative affect may reflect a hormetic effect, whereby transient physiological or emotional stressors promote longer-term psychological resilience [35,36].
Across participants and experimental settings, HVB reliably enhanced ASCs dominated by OBN, which is considered as a defining aspect of ASCs evoked by psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin. Although differences in OBN scores across conditions were not statistically significant, participants in the LAB condition reported noticeably higher scores compared to MRI and REMOTE sessions. This trend suggests that the in-person experience and controlled, quiet environment of the LAB may have enhanced the immersive and evocative qualities of the breathwork experience. In contrast, the MRI setting—despite also involving in-person contact —may have been less conducive due to scanner noise and physical constraints. Finally, the REMOTE condition, which involved no in-person interaction and took place in participants varied home environments, received the lowest OBN ratings. These findings point to the importance of ‘set and setting’, e.g., [37], a concept well-established in psychedelic research in shaping ASCs and subjective response. These results may indicate that physical context and interpersonal presence play a critical role in breathwork outcomes.
Interestingly, OBN is reportedly the most accurate predictor of antidepressant actions of psychedelic substances [9,38–40]. In the present study, the magnitude of the OBN experience induced by HVB was comparable to that elicited by serotonergic psychedelic substances, including psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) [41,42], reinforcing observations of other breathwork studies [1,2].
Fast-paced hyperventilation induces cardiovascular sympathetic activation (with relative cardiovagal parasympathetic withdrawal) and cerebral vasoconstriction, the latter is a consequence of respiratory alkalosis, resulting from reduced plasma CO2 and H+, which elevates blood pH [43]. Ergo, we focused our analysis on correlations between OBN and changes in HRV (for which decreases capture pro-sympathetic shifts in cardiac autonomic balance) and CBF (where regional reductions reflect cerebrovascular vasoconstriction). Importantly, decreased EtCO2 is implicated as a critical factor in catalysing stronger, deeper ASCs during breathwork and may predict subacute psychological and physiological outcomes [2,44].
Our experiments identified that HVB engendered substantive time-dependent decreases in pcASL CBF. The reduction of rCBF relative to BASELINE in a cluster localized within left posterior insula and left parietal operculum predicted the intensity of OBN. This region encompasses primary interoceptive cortex and represents the state of cardiorespiratory arousal, and is consequently engaged in higher-order respiratory control. Correspondingly, neural activity here is enhanced by chemo-stimulated increases in ventilation [45]. More broadly, this insular-parietal region supports the integration of somatosensory information as well as the cortical representation of afferent respiratory and bodily signals [46], for example in the emergence of conscious motor intentions [47]. It is also implicated in high-level integrative processes which merge external and internal stimuli [48,49] that contribute to a coherent, embodied representation of self [50].
These roles are relevant to the interpretations of our finding that rCBF reductions within the PO/INS during SUSTAINED HVB predicted the intensity of self-reported OBN experience. The construct of OBN is closely related to feelings of depersonalization, sense of unity and blissful state [16], and our findings align with the notion that abnormal integration of signals in the posterior insula cortex can result in abnormal body ownership. Studies on ecstatic epilepsy, a rare focal epilepsy, show that the insula is involved in ASC-like experiences, including “heightened self-awareness, mental clarity and unity with everything that exists, accompanied by a sense of bliss and physical well-being” [51]. These overlap with the OBN construct, as assessed in the 5D-ASC [15]. Picard and Craig [52] hypothesised the involvement of the insula in the genesis of ecstatic epilepsy given its role in interoception and self-consciousness, confirmed by intracerebral electrode recordings [53]. Seizures in the mesiotemporal region propagated to the dorsal anterior insula coincide with ecstatic symptoms [54] and stimulation of the mid-dorsal insula region evoked experiences akin to oceanic psychedelic effects [55]. The interruption of interoceptive predictive coding during anterior insula seizures may underlie the ecstatic experience, emphasizing its pivotal role in mystical and psychedelic states [51,52].
We then ran an exploratory subsequent analysis (Fig 5) to explore the correlations between sub-dimensions of the 11D-ASC relevant to OBN [17], namely ‘disembodiment’, ‘unity’ and ‘bliss’, and CBF reductions induced by HVB relative to BASELINE. We found that scores of ‘unity’ and ‘bliss’, but not ‘disembodiment’ were associated with CBF reductions (see S1-S3 Tables for details), which concurs with the notion discussed above, specifically pointing to an involvement of the insula in the genesis of blissful feelings. Of note, 5-HT2A– targeting compounds such as psilocybin, renowned for therapeutic utility, are known to induce CBF decreases in different brain regions that correlate with the intensity of psychedelic experiences [56]. Studies found reduced CBF in the insula following psilocybin administration, though it was not linked to the subjective effects assessed via the 5D-ASC [57].
CBF reductions occur rapidly following decreased EtCO2 and can be reliably detected in response to very brief periods of hyperventilation. Conversely, the profound experiential changes in emotion and thought processes tend to emerge gradually, and correspondingly psychedelic phenomenology appears contingent on the length of the breathwork session [58]. Our investigation therefore compared HVB-evoked effects during late (SUSTAINED) and early (START) phases of HVB to focus specifically on the haemodynamic changes that occurred once the subjective effects had emerged. By contrasting the START and SUSTAINED phases of hyperventilation, we identified a region of right amygdala/anterior hippocampus, where the intensity of subjective experience (OBN as a covariate) positively correlated with CBF changes. Here, increased rCBF predicted the most intense OBN experience, despite the global reduction in CBF. One possible explanation is that this amygdalo-hippocampal CBF increase reflected increased regional neural activation associated with emergent expression of intense subjective effects. These regions are well established as being specialized for emotion (amygdala) and memory (hippocampus) processing. Their reciprocal interactions enable the formation of episodic representations, integrating the emotional significance and interpretation of memories [59]. Interestingly, increased right amygdala blood-oxygen level-dependent responses to emotional faces in functional MRI (fMRI) have been identified in patients with treatment-resistant depression following administration of psilocybin, predictive of clinical improvements at 1 week. The authors posit that this indicates psilocybin aids individuals’ ability to confront, reappraise, and improve emotional responsiveness [60]. Though speculative, these findings may indicate that HVB facilitates the processing of emotionally salient memories, which is proposed to be an essential therapeutic element in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapies [61,62], consistent with promising results from clinical trials of HVB applied as a therapy for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [63]. Our finding of increased CBF in the hippocampal region also indicates that a single session of intense hyperventilation selectively alters perfusion to the hippocampus, similar to the effects observed after 20 minutes of hypocapnia-inducing moderate exercise [64]. This finding was interpreted as indicative of short-term metabolic adaptation to the high energy demands of hippocampal neurons, rather than reflecting the effects of mechanical vascular changes [64].
HRV is a physiological index of the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on the heart. The observed reduction in HRV reflects sympathetic activation and withdrawal of parasympathetic drive [65–67], consistent with an action-ready state of psychophysiological engagement. As previously described, OBN characteristically entails a deeply felt positive mood linked to the experience of unity with the self and the world, and in its extreme, is experienced as a mystical or religious experience [17]. Our finding that OBN ratings were related to changes in HRV over time echoes observations from other relevant modalities of ASC induction, such as self-induced cognitive trance [68] or 5-HT agonists, such as LSD [18,69–71] or N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) [72,73]. Nevertheless, the observed association with a positive mood contrasts the wide acceptance of reduced HRV as an index of stress and negative affective states. During HVB, the physiological state of the body exceeds typical homeostatic boundaries, and the autonomic correlates of this may reinforce a dissociative psychological state of positive affect in line with the premise of hormesis, see [11] for more.
This exploratory work is preliminary and limited by a small sample size and a lack of an independent control condition that may, in our neuroimaging session, have prevented us from separating the contributions of haemodynamic effects secondary to CO2 changes from neural activation. We also acknowledge the possibility that our whole brain voxelwise approach has led to reduced sensitivity to detect significant correlations relative to an a priori region of interest (ROI) approach. In addition, from a methodological perspective, it may be argued that the lack of control group exposed only to music may prevent dissociation of the effects of auditory stimuli (the ambient track) and the effects of HVB. Listening to upbeat music does stimulate ventilation and this should be controlled in the future. Helpful input from lived experience populations indicates that music is a powerful support to therapeutic applications of HVB. In choosing our design, we elected not to “dissect” the music component from HVB, as we preferred to consider HVB as a contemplative practice accompanied by music as a whole – and to test it in its entirety [74]. Importantly, both studies [2,75] have dissected the effect of music and breathwork, and elucidate that music is not the main factor in triggering ASCs. This reveals that music alone is unlikely to engender significant ASCs of the magnitude reported in this research. It is also argued that the reductionist approach of breaking down a contemplative practice to dissect an “active ingredient” is less preferable than testing a practice in its entirety [74]. Conjointly, psychedelic therapy sessions do not adhere to one specific psychotherapeutic model, though one consistent feature of the experience is listening to music. During psychedelic therapy sessions, patients are urged to centre their attention inwardly whilst supine and listening to a carefully selected playlist. It is suggested that music can help facilitate therapeutic experiences. As such, we are looking for CBF changes that correspond with ASCs, induced by HVB with music. We elected to proceed to treat the experience as whole, hence no control for music. More hypothesis-driven work is certainly required within the neuroscience of breathwork.
Furthermore, our study focused on experienced HVB practitioners and therefore our results may not be generalisable; though this is also a strength as it ensured our practitioners were able to reach the desired state without adverse outcomes. Additionally, we were unable to directly assess relevant mechanisms of therapeutic actions, as our subjective measures did not include clinical parameters relevant to traumatic memories or other forms of psychological distress. Moreover, ASCs initiated by breathwork are inherently dynamic, thus dynamic phenomenological tools, such as those employed by Lewis-Healey et al., [58] may be more sensitive and informative.
Our imaging approach was also limited by the absence of correction for physiological noise caused by cardiac and respiratory fluctuations. This is crucial for most physiological fMRI applications for reducing signal artifacts. However, physiological fluctuations (including respiratory frequency and volume changes) can still introduce signal variations in ASL data, but we believe that our approach remains robust. Our analysis inherently averages over multiple cardiac cycles, which helps mitigate the effects of physiological noise on CBF quantification, and although respiration-induced signal changes are observed in some pcASL studies, they are largely associated with motion rather than direct vascular effects [76]. This does not fully eliminate the influence of an overall increase in HR, respiratory rate, or other physiological parameters during changes in breathing conditions—factors that may also impact labelling efficiency and arterial transit times. These considerations are relevant not only to our study, but to other ASL studies where complex, interconnected factors can influence ASL signal and CBF. Practical constraints limit the extent to which additional physiological measurements can be incorporated, particularly in a study as complex as ours. These constraints include scanning time and the potential stress on participants. Furthermore, measuring CBF at the start of the SUSTAINED HVB rather than at the end or during is not ideal, yet, it may capture the physiological ‘trigger condition’ for entry into ASCs, which can continue irrespective of specific physiological threshold conditions, see [2] for more.
A further key reason for choosing not to adopt a method of correction for EtCO2 was a high risk of regressing out our primary signal of interest. One plausible mechanistic hypothesis inspiring our work is that ASCs evoked by HVB practices directly result from alterations in EtCO2 and the resulting cerebral pH, causing downstream effects on neuronal function [11]. Therefore, CO2 related physiological signals are likely correlated with experimental effects that were the focus of our investigation, in line with recent work by others [2] and regressing out these signals would severely impact our sensitivity to study the relationship between haemodynamic effects and ASCs. An additional reason is that our measures of EtCO2 (collected by nasal cannula and capnograph) have been occasionally incomplete during the end of HVB sessions when EtCO2 levels had reached particularly low levels, and we felt that application of correction methods using incomplete physiological data would have risked introducing major artifacts.
Additionally, we observed prominent arterial transit time (ATT) artifacts in 6 out of 19 participants. These artifacts were characterized by strong arterial signals in the CBF images, which led to their exclusion from the analysis. ATT artifacts can significantly impact the accuracy of perfusion measurements, as they indicate that labelled blood has not yet reached the capillary beds. To address this issue in future research, capturing blood flow dynamics at different delay times through a multi-PLD ASL protocol would reduce the impact of ATT artifacts and increase precision of assessment of cerebral perfusion.


ConclusionIn conclusion, our exploratory experiments suggest that circuitries supporting the integration of interoceptive representations and processing of affective memories are putative neurobiological substrates of HVB-induced ASCs. Our findings indicate directions for future research towards a better understanding of HVB and ultimately harnessing such practices for future therapeutic applications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Within five days of ChatGPT’s release in 2022, the artificial intelligence chatbot gained more than a million users. Today, more than half of all adults under age 30 and nearly half of adults ages 30-49 say they’ve used it, according to Pew Research Center.Their work, “Model Misalignment and Language Change: Traces of AI-Associated Language in Unscripted Spoken English,” is the first peer-reviewed research to analyze whether the conversational human language system is changing in the wake of the widespread adoption of chat-based large language models like ChatGPT. It was accepted into the eighth Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society, hosted by the Association for the Advancement of AI and Association for Computing Machinery, which will be held in October. The study will be published in AIES Proceedings as part of the conference.“This research focuses on a central issue in the discourse surrounding AI and language: are these language changes happening because we’re using a tool and repeating what it suggested or is language changing because AI is influencing the human language system?” said assistant professor of computational linguistics and principal investigator Tom Juzek. “By analyzing lexical trends before and after ChatGPT was released in 2022, we found a convergence between human word choices and LLM-associated patterns with AI buzzwords.” While rapid increases in the use of certain words — like Omicron — do occur, these increases are typically due to real-world events. Recent large-scale upticks in the use of words like “delve” and “intricate” in certain fields, especially education and academic writing, are attributed to the widespread introduction of LLMs with a chat function, like ChatGPT, that overuses those buzzwords. “The changes we are seeing in spoken language are pretty remarkable, especially when compared to historical trends,” Juzek said. “What stands out is the breadth of change: so many words are showing notable increases over a relatively short period. Given that these are all words typically overused by AI, it seems plausible to conjecture a link.” Words including “surpass,” “boast,” “meticulous,” “strategically,” and “garner” have also seen considerable increases in usage since the release of ChatGPT. While these words are often used in a formal or academic tone, which makes them less common in unscripted, spoken language, researchers found that nearly three-quarters of these target words showed increased usage with some more than doubling in frequency.

The team, including Bryce Anderson, a rising senior majoring in computer science, and Riley Galpin, a rising junior double-majoring in computer science and pure mathematics, analyzed 22.1 million words from unscripted and spontaneous spoken language including conversational podcasts on science and technology. Post-ChatGPT, researchers noted a measurable increase in the use of AI-associated buzzwords but not their synonymous counterparts. For example, the AI buzzword “underscore” saw considerable increase in usage while its synonym “accentuate” did not. FSU researchers said this suggests we’re not just using AI; AI buzzwords are turning up in how people talk, raising concerns about a possible “seep-in effect.” “Language is the most powerful medium of communication that humanity has and understanding how AI will affect this medium is fundamentally important and timely,” said Anderson, the paper’s lead author. “My motivation to pursue this research stems from seeing AI push the limits of what’s possible in major industries and realizing that this influence isn’t just limited to tool usage — it can condition societal aspects, including how we use language.” This research builds upon the group’s previous research into the impact AI has on the domain of written scientific English, which revealed large-scale structural changes AI has had on scientific writing. Galpin presented the research on written language at the 38th International Florida AI Research Society Conference in May, and Anderson will join Juzek in presenting the team’s new research on spoken language at the AIES Conference in October. “Our research highlights many important ethical questions,” Galpin said. “With the ability of LLMs to influence human language comes larger questions about how model biases and misalignment, or differences in behavior in LLMs, may begin to influence human behaviors.” This research was conducted as part of FSU’s Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program, which provides high-achieving undergraduates an opportunity to explore their research interests alongside a faculty member. “I look forward to future research in this area,” Juzek said. “While this is a critical development in understanding AI’s role in language change, a big open question for future work is whether AI is amplifying conventional patterns of language change or directly driving them.” To learn more about research conducted in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics, visit mll.fsu.edu.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai during the Google I/O developers conference in Mountain View, California, on May 10, 2023.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGoogle has eliminated more than one-third of its managers overseeing small teams, an executive told employees last week, as the company continues its focus on efficiencies across the organization."Right now, we have 35% fewer managers, with fewer direct reports" than at this time a year ago, said Brian Welle, vice president of people analytics and performance, according to audio of an all-hands meeting reviewed by CNBC. "So a lot of fast progress there."At the meeting, employees asked Welle and other executives about job security, "internal barriers" and Google's culture after several recent rounds of layoffs, buyouts and reorganizations.Welle said the idea is to reduce bureaucracy and run the company more efficiently."When we look across our entire leadership population, that's mangers, directors and VPs, we want them to be a smaller percentage of our overall workforce over time," he said.The 35% reduction refers to the number of managers who oversee fewer than three people, according to a person familiar with the matter. Many of those managers stayed with the company as individual contributors, said the person, who asked not to be named because the details are private.Google CEO Sundar Pichai weighed in at the meeting, reiterating the need for the company "to be more efficient as we scale up so we don't solve everything with headcount."Google eliminated about 6% of its workforce in 2023, and has implemented cuts in various divisions since then. Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi, who joined the company last year, said in October that she would push cost cuts "a little further." Google has offered buyouts to employees since January, and the company has slowed hiring, asking employees to do more with less.watch nowRegarding the buyouts, executives at the town hall said that a total of 10 product areas have presented "Voluntary Exit Program" offers. They've applied to U.S.-based employees in search, marketing, hardware and people operations teams this year. Fiona Cicconi, Google's chief people officer, said at last week's meeting that between 3% and 5% of employees on those teams have accepted the buyouts."This has been actually quite successful," she said, adding "I think we can continue it."Pichai said the company executed the voluntary buyouts after listening to employees, who said they preferred that route to blanket layoffs."It's a lot of work that's gone into implementing the VEP program, and I'm glad we've done it," Pichai said. "It gives people agency, and I'm glad to see it's worked out well."'Wanting a career break'Cicconi said one of the main reasons employees are taking the buyouts is because they want to take time off from work."It's actually quite interesting to see who's taking a VEP, and it's people sort of wanting a career break, sometimes to take care of family members," she said.CNBC previously reported that the layoffs hurt morale as the company was downsizing while at the same time issuing blowout earnings and seeing its stock price jump. Alphabet's shares are up 10% this year after climbing 36% in 2024 and 58% the year prior.At another point in the town hall, employees asked if Google would consider a policy similar to Meta's "recharge," a month-long sabbatical that employees earn after five years at the company."We have a lot of leaves, not least our vacation, which is there for exactly that — resting and recharging," said Alexandra Maddison, Google's senior director of benefits.She said the company is not going to offer paid sabbatical."We're very confident that our current offering is competitive," Maddison said.Meta didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Other executives jumped in to compare the two companies' benefits."I don't think they have a VEP at Meta by the way," Cicconi said.Pichai then asked, to some laughs from the audience, "Should we incorporate all policies of Meta while we're at it? Or should we only pick and choose the few policies we like?""Maybe I should try running the company with all of Meta's policies," he continued. "No, probably not."WATCH: Apple explores using Google Gemini AI to power revamped Siri, reports saywatch now]]></content:encoded>

                                -                                A failure of security systems at PayPal is currently causing concern for numerous German banks and private customers. A vast number of payments are reportedly being blocked, with merchants waiting on funds in the billions.
                            
                                            
                                                                            	    	    	            
                                                                                                    The US payment service provider PayPal has been quite popular in Germany for years. However, currently both private customers and banks are grappling with a problem. According to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (SZ), certain security systems at PayPal have reportedly failed. These are the systems designed to filter out fraudulent transactions. As a result, various German banks are said to have blocked payments from PayPal as early as Monday. The SZ estimated the amount involved to be more than ten billion euros.
                            	PayPal security systems down - direct debits submitted unchecked
                                                        PayPal is regularly exploited by fraudsters to get hold of citizens' money. The payment service's security systems are supposed to check and prevent such activity. However, these systems reportedly failed at the end of last week, causing PayPal to submit direct debits without verification.
                        	    	            
                            
                                                                    Portals like "Netzwelt" also report disruptions with the payment service. The blog "Cashys Blog" mentioned technical issues over the weekend. For days, customers have allegedly experienced difficulties processing transactions. Payments via direct debit are primarily being rejected, despite the accounts reportedly having sufficient funds.
                                                        However, this might not be directly related to the PayPal disruption but rather due to the banks' reactions. According to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung," banks noticed the unusually high volume of direct debits from PayPal on Monday, which appeared suspicious or fraudulent.
                                                        Banks halted all PayPal transactions
                                                        To prevent a potentially multimillion-euro fraud, several banks reportedly temporarily halted all PayPal transactions.
                                                        According to information from the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (SZ), these banks include "Bayerische Landesbank", "Hessische Landesbank", and "DZ-Bank".
                        	    	            
                                                                    As a result, numerous merchants did not receive their funds. The newspaper reports that the banks may have frozen more than ten billion euros. As stated by the news agency News5, not only online shop payments were affected; customers are currently experiencing difficulties using PayPal at supermarket checkouts and in retail stores as well.
                                                        According to PayPal, it was a "temporary service disruption." The company's site states: "Over the weekend, there was a temporary service interruption that led to delays in transactions for a small number of accounts. The issue has since been resolved."
                                                        Even though PayPal claims to have fixed the problem, the effects of the outage are still noticeably impacting merchants and consumers, as reported by News5. PayPal lists several services as "under maintenance" on its status page. When payments will resume smoothly remains unclear.
                                                        PayPal security systems down - impact across Europe
                                                        According to information from the German Press Agency (dpa), the incident has been confirmed by the German Savings Banks and Giro Association (DSGV). In recent days, there have been "incidents involving unauthorized direct debits from PayPal affecting various financial institutions," the association stated. "These incidents had a significant impact on payment transactions throughout Europe, particularly in Germany. This was noticeable to customers of the Savings Banks Finance Group institutions for several hours last Monday."
                        	    	            
                                                                    Consumer advocates recommend that PayPal customers check their accounts for unauthorized debits.
                                                        Focus Online also reports on a major update that PayPal has presumably been implementing since August 25. Whether there is a connection between the disruption and the planned update remains unclear at this time.
                                                        PayPal is by far the most important online payment service in the German market, accounting for just under 30 percent of online purchases.

Challenge Mode
The Challenge Mode is a fast-paced game designed to test and improve your Vim command recall under time pressure.
Users are presented with a series of command tasks to complete as quickly and accurately as possible.
Each correctly executed command scores points, while speed and precision determine the final score.
This mode offers an engaging way to sharpen your Vim skills by combining rapid-fire challenges with real-time feedback, making learning Vim commands both fun and effective.
Try to beat your highest score and see how quickly you can master essential Vim commands!
How Validation Works

Each level defines a target cursor location, target text, or target content layout.
Validation is resilient to trailing spaces and blank lines where appropriate.
You progress when the outcome matches the target; keystroke sequences themselves aren’t strictly enforced.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
On a personal note, I wanted to thank the HN community. I’ve been reading HN since college (for over 15 years now!) and it’s been formative in my development as a software engineer and leader.I don’t pipe up very often, but I visit HN almost every day. Many of the books I read, blogs I frequent, and podcasts I listen to, I found via HN. I think it’s fair to say, if it weren’t for HN, that Bitrig wouldn’t be Bitrig and SwiftUI wouldn’t be SwiftUI.
That’s great and I’m glad you feel good here. 
I think it’s time for you to share what you found over the years on HN with us. Your curated list, if you will.
Hello fellow lurker. I for one am glad you are here ;-)And I echo the thanks. HN has made me a better technical professional in so many ways.
Would you consider having a way to export work done in this app to be included as part of regular Xcode projects?I've been working on a project and sometimes when I'm away from my laptop I have ideas I want to try in SwiftUI but only have my phone on me. What I end up doing is just writing my idea in text and then waiting till I'm back at my desk to give it a shot. Being able to spin up a quick prototype and preview it on the go could be cool.I don't think my dog would enjoy me lugging my laptop on our walks but my phone is no big deal ;).
This is crazy, you guys basically rebuilt Swift (interpreter instead of compiler) and also the frameworks. This is the level of engineering that does the magic of "it just works". I, personally, am very interested in swift, and would love to work for free for you guys.
This app is really quite fascinating as well as amazing. I have been using it for a week now. I do like how it is so good with Swift and iOS; you have done a great job of removing so much of the confusion that LLMs must face when trying to develop for a demanding platform. The API insight the app has is a testament to your deep background and foresight into iOS development. I really love this.Also, I have been taking the code and advice from Bitrig into Cursor, because it solves problems Cursor struggles with no matter what model it calls.Your work is empowering, but more than that, it is inspiring, because I can now start to envisage what computer human interaction will look like in the near future.You have taken away a layer of complexity to creation and that is to be applauded. I think your work is a landmark. I think Bitrig will unleash a new era of creative expression. I wish that I was part of your team.
I've been using the app a bit and I like the idea but one of the major things keeping me from using it is that the model is just fundamentally lazy and without having an easy way to review the code on my phone it's not easy to check its work. If it needs to do something which requires talking to a web API it will often just populate the app with fake data silently. Apps for phones are very dependent on web APIs and with people heavily locking this down these days (when's the last time you've used an API that doesn't ask you for an API token?) I feel like most of the apps are limited to being local-only. There are plenty of nice local-only apps on iPhone, don't get me wrong. I'm sure there is a timer app that is just right for everyone. But most of my tasks require more context about my life, or the outside world. Bitrig isn't able to oneshot this yet–but it definitely does make pretty UIs.
Yeah this is an area we want to make a lot better. What we're currently thinking is giving the model a way to more explicitly call out that it is adding a call to something that needs an API key, which would add something to the UI to allow you to just paste in your key.I think there's also work when need to do in the system prompt to guide the model away from all of the placeholder data (or at least so that when it adds it there's a better affordance to transform it to real data).
Neat. I just tried it out and one thing I was pleasantly surprised about was the styling it came up with. It was sleek, and it did not have the purply gradienty tailwindy styling that I always get from Claude. Did you do much to adjust the prompt for custom styles?
Styling apps is an area we're excited to spend time exploring. Today in our system prompt we say "ALWAYS make the design Apple-like. Use clean typography and consistent padding/spacing." However, tbh it's not something we carefully tested.For the most part, I think the look and feel of the apps benefits from SwiftUI baking Apple's design system into the defaults so heavily.
This is really cool of you to openly share the prompt - props for that.Really cool product, as someone currently attempting to build a somewhat similar internal tool I have an understanding of some of the pain points involved.Please don't allow yourselves to be bought out by Apple in the way Buddy Build were back in 2018 though! (and then shut down)
For some reason I dislike Log-In by Mail. Since this is purely based on iOS devices, log-in with Apple seems to be an obvious and frictionless solution.
When I was in middle school I remember a friend lieing that there is “a mobile app to create mobile apps”. I thought it’s an amazing idea, but it was way too early. I love how this hallucination became a reality. Good luck!
It doesn't seem like this is the direction you are going, but this feels like what Siri could become (though I have little faith given the history).With your sunscreen example, I should be able to just ask Siri to do exactly this, and it could tap me in my pocket, show me a custom UI to log periodically and then disappear.Not sure on limitations of APIs on iOS but definitely feels like there is space for a better voice assistant, just like how Raycast have created a better Spotlight on Mac.Looks very cool so far!
Maybe this paired with something like App Clips? I don't see them used much these days but could make them more useful.
Yeah, I think that whole area of dynamically generating UI is really interesting. And having a Swift interpreter like we're using would unlock doing that with native UI components.Our background is more in making developer tools, so bitrig was the first product we were excited about, but I think there's a lot of overlap with dynamic UI generation, and we'd love to explore that too.
Nice. Are you folks thinking about Kotlin/Flutter on Android too, or is it going to be exclusively focused on the ecosystem around Swift?
There’s still a lot to do to make this work really great for the Swift ecosystem, and that’s where we have the most expertise, so that’s what we’ll be focused on for now.That said, we think this same approach could work really well on Android, and it’d be interesting to expand there too.
Doesn’t work at all for me.Entered my my prompt… It did a bunch of stuff - apparently initially focused on making me an app icon which I don’t really care about.I moved away from the app, went back and everything had gone and my prompt was just sitting there by itself.I said “please proceed” and it opened a new chat, did the same thing.  It was doing stuff, I moved to something else, went back, everything vanished.So that’s two of my five free messages zapped. And all of my patience.
Sorry about that, I reset your free messages for the day, so you should be back at 5.Moving in and out of the project while messages are sending is a more fragile area of the app and we have some bugs to fix there.
First, as a non-developer geek -- super fun.What happens if you go over 100 messages/month?I just burned my 5 free messages to get a simple toggle button working that just says "win" (with animated fireworks!) and "lose". I'm sure I'm not an efficient prompter, but it seems I'd knock out 100 messages easily in an afternoon, which looks to be the monthly limit at $20/mo.(This is coming from someone who has no idea how expensive it would be to 'vibe code' using something like Claude ... so it may be an entirely unfair assumption that you could chat with this 'unlimited' for $20/mo ... that's what I have in my head as 'reasonable' only because that's what I pay for Gemini or ChatGPT and, for all intents and purposes, it feels 'unlimited'.)
Don't tell anyone, but once you're on the paid plan we're not actually enforcing the 100 message limit right now ;)We're still in the learning phase, and are going to adjust the plans based on exactly the kind of considerations you're raising
Your secret is safe, hah! It's almost like you need an intermediate 'cheap/dumb' AI as a proxy to flesh everything out ahead of sending it off to be coded ... something that crisps up all the requirement and ultimately crafts a more cost-effective and likely all-around-better prompt. Even being semi-technical, I'm always surprised how much the details matter when describing something to AI (e.g., the fireworks should only explode _outward_, not inward, lol). Thanks!
There's a lot I want to do to improve the prompting experience. As I mentioned in the original post, it's very simple right now.There's a lot of inspiration we could (and probably will) draw from other products (e.g. Cline's Plan vs Act modes) to build what you're describing.It can also be really fun and productive to just rapidly iterate on what the AI gives back, without having to take the time to describe it all up front. Sometimes this approach can lead to a new directions you might not have thought of.
> We’re ingesting Apple’s SDK frameworks into Bitrig piece by piece. If you try to build something and hit a missing framework, let us know and we’ll prioritize adding it.Submitted request for WebKit to be added.In the app I asked it to make, I requested that it use a web view to log into YouTube. The generated app opens a mostly blank screen with no web view, and from what your app told me I think it’s because it’s missing WebKit.WebKit as a whole might be big, but maybe some subset of it to support web views and get cookies from the web view could be supported?
We’ve gotten a lot of requests for WebKit, so we’ll try to add it soon.If we hit issues we can try to pull in just a subset, but one nice thing about Swift is the frameworks have .swiftinterface files which list all the APIs in them, so we’ve generally been able to pull in whole frameworks at a time.
Very cool! Was it difficult to get Bitrig approved on the App Store? If I had to guess just based on the idea, it seems like the sort of thing Apple would take issue with.
Heh... it definitely wasn't an overnight approval. However, Apple has relaxed the guidelines for developer tools compared to the early days of the App Store. If you look today there are Python IDEs, Jupyter Notebooks, and various other apps that execute user generated code. The key guideline to be mindful of is 2.5.2.
With vibe coding, I generally find that it will get me 80-90% of the way to where I want to be, but I generally end up having to do some work too. How does that work here? Is there any way to later edit the app on my mac if I need to? Similarly, once my app is "done" for some definition of done, can I compile it into a native app rather than an interpreted one?
Yeah that’s been my experience too. You can edit the Swift code directly in bitrig, though editing code on a phone is not the best experience. We’ve had a lot of requests for a Mac app. Stay tuned ;)You can get a compiled build of your app from bitrig: go to Distribute App which will build your app on our server and then upload it to TestFlight for you (this requires a paid Apple Developer Account). This lets you install the compiled app on your Home Screen. You could also always export the code if you want to build it yourself.
Did you just casually built a workout posture tracking and rep counting app? :-)Anyway, congrats on the launch!!
Hey,I do not own an iPhone and I do not use swift. I just want to say congrats on the launch, this looks and sounds really cool. And watching your interactions in this thread, you look like you'll do really well!
Apart from this great app, what is the current state of the art in vibe coding iOS apps? Just using Cursor with an open iOS simulator?
Seems like a cool concept! I downloaded and entered an email address but haven't received a verification code yet after 10 minutes. It's an Apple Private Relay email if that matters.Also, side note: magic link or email-based OTP login is by far my least favorite method of login, especially for a phone app. It's cumbersome, annoying, and completely unnecessary now that passkeys exist. Barring that I'd still rather use email/pw login any day of the week.
That's weird, can you try hitting back and then the forward arrow again? That should resend the email. If that still doesn't work, let me know and we can investigate on the backend.We've definitely been hearing from users who don't like OTP, we'll try to get additional login options added soon.
I eventually had it come in another few minutes after I left the comment. And sounds good! I’ve had good success with Clerk for auth in the past.Now that I’ve gotten to play around with the app I have to say I’m impressed with how smooth it feels and how well the Swift interpreter works (at least on the basic prompts I’ve tried). One suggestion: allow toggling between an “edit” mode and a “view” mode. The latter would full screen the app and hide the interface for follow up prompts, etc. that would make it easier to approximate how the app will behave in the wild.I could see this eventually turning into sort of a social platform for mini-apps, by the way! Where users don’t even necessarily need to publish to the App Store if they’re just creating something for themselves and a few friends.
We probably need to make this more discoverable, but if you keep swiping down on the prompt area, you can swipe it completely off screen and your app will be full screen (with a small movable floating button to exit).I really like the idea of a platform for people sharing mini-apps! It would be great if people could make lightweight specialized apps for different niches and share them with less friction.
That’s interesting, on a desktop device I would agree. However having to create an account on 1Password for an app I just want to try is a pain compared to using Apple’s Hide my email and entering in the OTP. I get that it didn’t work for you but it did for me.
It’s 2 extra button clicks to generate a password and save it on 1Password, and you never have to leave your current context.Versus for email OTP you have to switch to your email client, find the email, perhaps refresh a few times waiting for it to come in, click into the email once you see it, highlight the OTP, click copy, then switch back to the app and finally paste. I don’t understand how anybody could possibly prefer it.
Very cool. I would probably build this using SDUI server driven abstractions. Curious if you considered that approach to build bitrig or parts of it.
I’ve just tested it out, and purchased a subscription within 5 minutes, for an app we were seriously discussing with a friend over the last days.Keep crushing!
Great, excited to see what you build with the bitrig. Definitely reach out with any questions or features you’d like to see!
Quick note: it’s hard to pull down the prompt panel down, and makes for a frustrating UX (just there)
Sorry for the support query here - but I’m blocked in a bus and am HOOKED.At the moment the prompt just loops for a second and then produces no answer :(
I’ve been playing with the TestFlight build and it’s really solid. Can you share any under the hood details of how the system is able to accurately map the loose prompt to fully native SwiftUI components. Mostly curious because I’d love to also build internal data dense apps typically better suited for desktop.Great work and I hope to become a paying customer soon!
Yeah, the prompt is just asking Claude to generate a SwiftUI iPhone app. The recent models have been able to generate really good Swift code, so we just have a set of best practice instructions we've been accumulating (telling it to make an app with @main, pointing it to/away from some APIs, encouraging it to persist things in UserDefaults, etc).I think most of that would work pretty well for making SwiftUI desktop apps too.
It would be lovely if the community had this knowledge about API's to avoid and approached to adopt. SwiftUI programming is a tightrope walk of stuff that works over a chasm of time lost to testing.
Thanks for letting us know, we'll get this fixed in other browsers (we've been just looking at it in Safari).
Consider adding BYOK/Bring your own API for LLM calls if possible, some of us like to keep our data with ourselves, no matter what that data is.
I stopped using Apple products but need to create a couple of iOS apps. I was debating buying a Mac Mini or using "Macincloud" but this seems like an excellent option. Being able to edit the Swift code means fixing nuances.I'll likely subscribe to your service.For distribution strategy you could experiment with letting people create simple apps for free and put a perpetual ad for your service ad the bottom of the app.
Yeah we’d love to find a way to give away more in the free tier for hobbyist users and subsidize that with other things. The idea of us putting an ad in unpaid apps as another option is interesting.
What big assumptions are you testing with it?I pasted your URL into my app and it came up with:- Non-developers want to create mobile apps without coding.
- Users are willing to pay for an AI-powered mobile app builder.
- AI can generate functional apps using only a conversational interface.
I think that’s a pretty good list. The main one I would add is “creators will want to make native Swift apps to have a better user experience”
Hey Kyle, looks very cool!- If Bitrig can do things like let your app have editable data, or make rest api calls, etc. it would be nice to see a little more in the demo video.- Sounds like you don’t have an expensive mic/studio for recording, but luckily this is free and can work wonders for your audio:
https://podcast.adobe.com/en/enhanceBest of luck with the launch.
Ya, I agree it makes sense for us to record a more tutorial length demo at this point and we can show off things like that.Thanks for the tip about the mic. Fun fact: it's me in the video, but it's Jacob doing the narration :P
Huh I was just thinking vibe coding on my phone while having a beer would be fun. I’ll check it out. Is there a good way to give feedback? I didn’t see any obvious community/contact/discord/discourse on the website.
This is a really good idea, but I’ve noticed that, even with developer experience and using Claude code, building a complex app is extremely difficult and takes dozens of prompts to get things actually working. This is probably a great prototyping tool, but I’m curious to know how far this can go to build production level apps.
With what we've tried so far, Bitrig already works well for prototyping and making smaller apps.Really large and complex apps will probably require improvements to both Bitrig and the underlying models. However, both those are coming :)
We don't currently have support for editing code directly within a repository, but that's something we're excited about adding.In the meantime, one thing that's worked well for us is building a component/screen/etc as a standalone piece in bitrig, and then bringing it into a larger project from your computer later. You can easily export the code you make in bitrig for those kinds of workflows.
Tried to create a canvas like app view, your app froze after some prompts (guess the swift interpreter?) reopening the app and selecting the project again does not help
Thanks for trying, sorry you hit that issue!Could you send us feedback from your project? (Go to the ... menu, then Send Feedback.) If you're not able to use the UI from within your project you can long-press on it from the main screen and choose Recovery Mode, and then enter the project with the interpreter disabled.
Are there iOS apps that let me create native Swift apps for my phone (including execution on my device, not in the cloud), on my phone, but _without_ chatting to AI? Just by writing code, the "old" way?
You can edit the code directly in Bitrig, but we haven't optimized the experience around that.Are you imagining you'd be editing the code with the software keyboard or a paired hardware keyboard?
I'm imagining quick prototyping (including on-device, offline execution) of small pieces of code (potentially growing into a small app) with the software keyboard, like in Pythonista or Pyto.My workflow often goes like this: got an idea, let me quickly test it on the go, like while walking down the street, working on unrelated stuff or just chilling. Open up Pythonista, write some code, run it, tweak it, etc. If a piece of code becomes important enough, I copy it to the computer and continue working on it there.
I use both those for Python, very much enjoy them on iPhone in particular for little UI apps. Equivalent iPad workflow for me had been Swift Playground on iPad and Mac, although it seems stuck about a year ago at Swift 5.10 and iOS 17.5 SDK.Much slower (minutes) with Xcode Cloud and a git repo, if I can git commit from my iPhone, I can edit app code and commit, watch Xcode Cloud Build see my commit, watch it build with debug logs, and when it works it shows up in TestFlight.  Very much not offline, and minutes long loop.
Is there a certain part of the data that the service collects that you're wondering about?We aren't doing anything shady or unexpected with the data given the server-based model – projects are stored on the Bitrig server, but we aren't selling the data, using it for training, etc.We may use the data to improve Bitrig in the future (e.g. by gathering information on the popularity of certain APIs to prioritize bug fixes and new features).All AI requests use Claude, which of course sends some data to Anthropic.
Given they haven't replied, I assume that they are certainly collecting data from how you are using those prompts to build your apps and also with the outputs.So don't paste any tokens or keys into these AI tools.
I don't share your assessment. Is it because I did iOS apps before web apps? Curious how many others feel the same?Seems like a reasonable poll question: Which is harder: web app development or native app development?I was telling a younger colleague the other day how back in the day, I was "competing" with a peer at a company doing nuclear design software (Siemens Power Corp at the time). I was doing it in VisualWorks Smalltalk, he was doing his in straight C and X Windows. Competition aside, both of us built multi window complex graphical design tools that front ended heavy duty simulators, managed various batch jobs, tons of IO, parsing, and lots of color graphic drawing (mine was for fuel assembly (pin and axial enrichments) design, and his was for core layout (where the assemblies go during each reload)). The graphics were simpler (no antialiasing, any alpha we did with clever dithering tricks, not much in the way of animations, though we did each roll some). Both even stored /retrieved into a sort of database (a homegrown data versioning system). But... it was just one of each us for each "app".Sadly, all Ux development seems orders of more magnitude complicated and beuqacratic now days. Some things are easier and vastly simpler than they used to be, and yet, the sum result is more difficult. I'm not exactly sure why.
native app development is harder not because of some inherent complexity mostly but because you are shipping binaries through 3rd parties you don’t control which makes versioning an annoying problem web devs don’t have to deal with, app review makes true continuous delivery pretty much impossible and also means true rollbacks are pretty much impossible (i know about codepush and expo updates), proprietary core and dev setup limits dev tooling also
this is super super cool - awesome to see something technically hard and novel. congrats on the launch!
I'm on an iPhone SE, and the UI doesn't quite fit. The response text isn't easily scrollable, so I have to drag the text up, instead of just scrolling.
I always do my dev testing on the smallest and largest iPhones. I recommend going with smallest only as your primary driver if you don’t make use of the sidebar behaviors on the largest ones.]]></content:encoded>

                I first ran into Forth about 20 years ago when reading a book about
designing embedded hardware.
The reason I got the book back then was to actually learn more about the HW
aspects, so having skimmed the Forth chapter I just registered an "oh, this is neat"
mental note and moved on with my life. Over the last two decades I
heard about Forth a few more times here and there, such as that time when
Factor was talked about for a brief period, maybe
10-12 years ago or so.
It always occupied a slot in the "weird language" category inside my brain, and
I never paid it much attention. Until June this year, when a couple of factors
combined fortuitously:

After spending much of the earlier part of 2025
exploring the inner workings
of LLMs and digging in random mathy and algorithmic topics, I had an itch
to just write some code.
I somehow found Dave Gauer's page about Forth
and also the one on Implementing a Forth.

And something clicked. I'm going to implement a Forth, because... why not?
So I spent much of my free hacking time over the past two months learning
about Forth and implementing two of them.

Forth: the user level and the hacker level
It's useful to think of Forth (at least standard Forth,
not offshoots like Factor) as having two different "levels":

User level: you just want to use the language to write programs. Maybe
you're indeed bringing up new hardware, and find Forth a useful
calculator + REPL + script language. You don't care about Forth's
implementation or its soul, you just want to complete your task.
Hacker level: you're interested in the deeper soul of Forth. Isn't it
amazing that even control flow constructs like IF...THEN or loops like
BEGIN...UNTIL are just Forth words, and if you wanted, you could implement
your own control flow constructs and have them be first-class citizens, as
seamless and efficient as the standard ones?

Another way to look at it (useful if you belong to a certain crowd) is that
user-level Forth is like Lisp without macros, and hacker-level Forth has macros
enabled. Lisp can still be great and useful without macros, but macros take
it to an entire new level and also unlock the deeper soul of the language.
This distinction will be important when discussing my Forth implementations
below.


goforth and ctil
There's a certain way Forth is supposed to be implemented; this is how it was
originally designed, and if you get closer to the hacker level, it
becomes apparent that you're pretty much required to implement it this way -
otherwise supporting all of the language's standard words will be very
difficult. I'm talking about the classical approach of a linked dictionary,
where a word is represented as a "threaded" list [1], and this dictionary is
available for user code to augment and modify. Thus, much of the Forth
implementation can be written in Forth itself.
The first implementation I tried is stubbornly different. Can we just make a
pure interpreter? This is what goforth
is trying to explore (the Go implementation located in the root directory of
that repository). Many built-in words are supported - definitely enough to
write useful programs - and compilation
(the definition of new Forth words using : word ... ;) is implemented by
storing the actual string following the word name in the dictionary, so it can
be interpreted when the word is invoked.
This was an interesting approach and in some sense, it "works". For the user
level of Forth, this is perfectly usable (albeit slow). However, it's
insufficient for the hacker level, because the host language interpreter (the
one in Go) has all the control, so it's impossible to implement IF...THEN in
Forth, for example (it has to be implemented in the host language).
That was a fun way to get a deeper sense of what Forth is about, but I did want
to implement the hacker level as well, so the second implementation -
ctil - does just that.
It's inspired by the jonesforth
assembly implementation, but done in C instead [2].
ctil actually lets us implement major parts of Forth in Forth itself. For
example, variable:
: variable create 1 cells allot ;

Conditionals:
\ IF, ELSE, THEN work together to compile to lower-level branches.
\
\ IF ... THEN compiles to:
\   0BRANCH OFFSET true-part rest
\ where OFFSET is the offset of rest
\
\ IF ... ELSE ... THEN compiles to :
\   0BRANCH OFFSET true-part BRANCH OFFSET2 false-part rest
\ where OFFSET is the offset of false-part and OFFSET2 is the offset of rest
: if immediate
  ' 0branch ,
  here
  0 ,
  ;

: then immediate
  dup
  here swap -
  swap
  ! ;

: else immediate
  ' branch ,
  here
  0 ,
  swap
  dup
  here swap -
  swap
  ! ;

These are actual examples of ctil's "prelude" - a Forth file loaded before any
user code. If you understand Forth, this code is actually rather mind-blowing.
We compile IF and the other words by directly laying our their low-level
representation in memory, and different words communicate with each other
using the data stack during compilation.


Thoughts on Forth itself
Forth made perfect sense in the historic context in which it was created in
the early 1970s. Imagine having some HW connected to your computer (a telescope
in the case of Forth's creator), and you have to interact with it. In terms
of languages at your disposal - you don't have much, even BASIC wasn't invented
yet. Perhaps your machine still didn't have a C compiler ported to it; C
compilers aren't simple, and C isn't very great for exploratory scripting
anyway. So you mostly just have your assembly language and whatever you build
on top.
Forth is easy to implement in assembly and it gives you a much higher-level
language; you can use it as a calculator, as a REPL, and as a DSL for pretty
much anything due to its composable nature.
Forth certainly has interesting aspects; it's a concatenative language,
and thus inherently point-free.
A classical example is that instead of writing the following in a more
traditional syntax:
eat(bake(prove(mix(ingredients))))

You just write this:
ingredients mix prove bake eat

There is no need to explicitly pass parameters, or to explicitly return results.
Everything happens implicitly on the stack.
This is useful for REPL-style programming where you use your language not
necessarily for writing large programs, but more for interactive instructions to
various HW devices. This dearth of syntax is also what makes Forth simple
to implement.
All that said, in my mind Forth is firmly in the "weird language" category;
it's instructive to learn and to implement, but I wouldn't actually use it
for anything real these days. The stack-based programming model is cool for
very terse point-free programs, but it's not particularly readable and hard
to reason about without extensive comments, in my experience.
Consider the implementation of a pretty standard Forth word: +!. It expects
and address at the top of stack, and an addend below it. It adds the addend to
the value stored at that address. Here's a Forth implementation from
ctil's prelude:
: +!        ( addend addr -- )
  tuck      ( addr addend addr )
  @         ( addr addend value-at-addr )
  +         ( addr updated-value )
  swap      ( updated-value addr )
  ! ;

Look at that stack wrangling! It's really hard to follow what goes where without
the detailed comments showing the stack layout on the right of each instruction
(a common practice for Forth programs). Sure, we can create additional words
that would make this simpler, but that just increases the lexicon of words to
know.
My point is, there's fundamental difficulty here. When you see this C code:
int func(int a, int b) {
  return foo(a, bar(b));
}

Even without any documentation, you can immediately know several important
things:

bar has one parameter and one return value
foo has two parameters and one return value
func also has two parameters and one return value
It's immediately obvious how the various values flow from one function call
to the next.

Written in Forth [3]:
: func bar foo ;

How can you know the arity of the functions without adding explicit comments?
Sure, if you have a handful of words like bar and foo you know like the
back of your hand, this is easy. But imagine reading a large, unfamiliar code
base full of code like this and trying to comprehend it.


Summary and links
The source code of my goforth project is on GitHub; both
implementations are there, with a comprehensive test harness that tests both.
The learn Forth itself, I found these resources very useful:

Dave Gauer's Forth page
Starting Forth - a free online
book / tutorial on Forth for beginners

To learn how to implement Forth:

Dave Gauer's page on Implementing a Forth
jonesforth implementation
Threaded Interpretive Languages - an
old but nice book that explains how Forth implementations typically work

Implementing Forth is a great self-improvement project for a coder; there's a
pleasantly challenging hump of understanding to overcome, and you gain valuable
insights into stack machines, interpretation vs. compilation and mixing these
levels of abstraction in cool ways.
Also, implementing programming languages
from scratch is fun! It's hard to beat the feeling of getting to interact with
your implementation for the first time, and then iterating on improving it
and making it more featureful. Just one more word!




[1]This has nothing to do with threads in the sense of concurrency.
Rather, it's thread like in sewing, where the elements of the list
are all connected to each other as if with a thread. See
this page for
more details.





[2]Which is another deviation from the norm. Forth is really supposed to
be implemented in assembly - this is what it was designed for, and it's
very clear from its structure that it must be so in order to achieve
peak performance.
But where's the fun in doing things the way they were supposed to be
done? Besides, jonesforth is already a perfectly fine Forth implementation
in assembly, so I wouldn't have learned much by just copying it.
I had a lot of fun coding in C for this one; it's been a while since I
last wrote non-trivial amounts of C, and I found it very enjoyable.






[3]Assuming the convention that multi-parameter functions have their
parameters pushed to the stack from left to right.

Bug
Body
Over the past few months, Github has been getting slower and slower on Safari. It has now reached a point where it is unusable.
Displaying any pull request with more than a thousand lines changed or even browsing any file with a thousand or more lines of code is fully broken.
What happens:

In Activity Monitor, the rendering process is running at 100%.
Rendering the page is so slow, Safari displays blank space when scrolling up and down.
Any interactive features like search is so slow it doesn't work.
Pull request review is extremely painful (scrolling back and forth is impossible to do quickly, posting comments is extremely slow, even checking the "Viewed" checkbox sometimes takes several seconds, etc.).

I have a 16-inch MacBook Pro with a 16-cores Apple M4 Max and 48GB of RAM, using it plugged-in with performance mode enabled. It's one of the most powerful laptops on the market today. Github is the only website I know that doesn't run on it.
This is Safari specific, Google Chrome on the same machine performs way better (although it still struggles with very large pull requests). I'm using Safari 18.6 (20621.3.11.11.3) on macOS Sequoia 15.6 with no extensions installed.

I just tried it from a current branch to a really old version of one of my projects, and there are 403 commits and 855 changed files. In such a case the GitHub UI becomes completely unusable.
I also disabled all content blockers and plugins for GitHub, didn't change anything :/

Release 226 (WebKit 21623.1.3.19.1) - Safari Tech Preview

For me the issue is reproduced just by loading GH dashboard and hit / and starting to type in the search bar, the whole UI slows to a crawl.
    
    


          

        

    
    
      

        
            
    
      
    
  
        @willsmythe This is not a regression in Safari. This is a change in the CSS of GitHub, which unfortunately hits a specific performance issue of Safari. You can contact me directly if you want.
I gave information on https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/170922
The two main perf bugs from WebKit have been fixed this week, but they will not be available until the next release. It would be great if GitHub frontend teams could mitigate the issue in the meantime. Also, do not hesitate to contact me for the next release if you identify perf issues before releasing to the public. That would be great to be able to better plan in advance for this kind of issue.

        AFAICT this extends to all API actions triggered by the UI. Case in point, I just went to subscribe to this issue in Safari, and it took more than 20 seconds before the button state switched to "Unsubscribe". I'm now writing this comment in Chrome... 👎

        Our team has noticed this as well, very sluggish UI in general. Especially noticeable on pull requests and autocomplete boxes like / shortcut and command palette.

        It can take up to 10 seconds for this page to load on an M3 Ultra:
https://github.com/kg/runtime/blob/73fb0e3f00cff127e996b36c493949fa7b2c38e8/src/coreclr/vm/interpexec.cpp
When I trace it, sometimes a long chunk of time is spent waiting for a network resource called "collect" that hangs the UI.
This is a trace with the Safari Tech Preview, which does not show that network hang, but it is just as slow:

The above on Safari preview, takes about 5 seconds for the first page display, it does something else, and it is still a bit hiccupy for a few more seconds.
At second 10, I started a "two page downs", and you can see it takes it about 2 seconds to render two page downs.

        For folks looking for a temporary workaround to add labels in Safari: After creating the issue/PR go to the Issues/Pull requests tab, select the checkbox of the one you want to add a label to and use the Labels dropdown on the table header. This works a bit better.

        after stumbling upon yet another page struggling to render i decided to check the web inspector and it looks like at least some of the performance problems (in code browser) are caused by excessive compositing
github

vs codeberg / forgejo

maybe there's some deeper reason but github right now is literally the only website i have performance problems with in safari so in a way it's somewhat impressive

        Does this happen with the New Files Changed experience only, or does it happen no matter what you have that set to?  It's a preview feature you can turn on and off by going to "Feature Preview" when you click your avatar icon.

        As someone who writes bugs for a living I'm careful to complain. That said, this has become a real pain point for me, personally.
It's not uncommon for me to do the following things opening a PR:

Changing the base branch
Writing the description
Toggling the create button between draft and ready to review
Assigning reviewers
Assigning myself

I do this several times a day and within the last few weeks the page will lock up every time. Sometimes I'll refresh the browser and even that takes a while to perform. Historically I've had no issues with this in Safari.

        I now use https://graphite.dev instead of GitHub because their UI works fine in Safari, they support stacked PRs, and many features GitHub does not, such as actually scrolling me to the comment I was linked to 😮
Might be a helpful workaround for anyone who uses Safari as their daily driver.

        And don't even think of trying to read the github website with a screen reader for accessibility for the visually impaired. If you don't run all javascript with a bleeding edge browser then there's no text to read at all. In this sense the github website has become extremely slow during the Microsoft ownership period: the text never shows up.

        I’m also seeing this slowdown quite a bit. For me it’s been noticeable on Safari for a long time, especially in PRs, but over the past few days the entire site feels sluggish as hell. Chrome is much better.
(For context: I was previously a PM at GitHub and often advocated for and discovered Safari bugs during my time there, so hopefully anyone on staff here who knows me will understand I’m not posting lightly!)

        To be more explicit. It feels like a change was implemented in the last week that really tanked performance on Safari.

This lines up with my experience. Initially the new files experience seemed to improve things, but in the last week, I've noticed the changed files feature is unbelievably sluggish. I can barely scroll through more than a few hundred lines of change, and the page locks up.

Yeah it's definitely the files experience. But I've also noticed sluggishness all around the past week or so. For example: In any comment box, when you start to type something that autocompleted (like an @mention), the character rendering slows riiiiight doooooown.

        As a Safari-only user, I didn't know it was a problem only occurring on Safari. I'm not having problems on any other sites so it's probably GH.
What's more interesting is that one of the top sites used by programmers is not testing one of the most common tasks on the website with one of the most common browsers.
Hope it gets fixed soon. Any large PRs is unworkable with Safari.

        Wow I did not know this problem was only in safari. I assumed GitHub UI is just super slow and nobody cared.
And it has been like that for a... year? Or more?
It did get faster with latest PR review UI update, but still rather slow right now
    
    


          

        

    


        
    
  
            
    
      
    
  
        Browser native back button is broken on iOS safari too. When the one navigate source code usually it doesn’t do anything but change url. Hitting back several times with no effect and reloading page in disgust leading to jump to arbitrary url in history.
Reconsider your approach to frontend development, please

        Because Safari sucks, like most of Apple's software. And any dev using it and not accepting this, is in denial.
Go ahead, bring me the dislikes (hopefully the emoji interaction is still working in your Safari).
