What is this?
nuclear is a free music streaming program that pulls content from free sources all over the internet.
If you know mps-youtube, this is a similar music player but with a GUI.
It's also focusing more on audio. Imagine Spotify which you don't have to pay for and with a bigger library.
What if I am religiously opposed to Electron?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Zach LloydSeptember 3, 2025ProductToday, we’re launching Warp Code — a suite of features for shipping agent-generated code all the way from prompt to production.
With Warp Code you get:

Top-rated coding agent: #1 on Terminal-bench (52%) and top three on SWE-bench Verified (75.8%, scored with GPT-5). We built the UI from the ground up to be the best experience for agentic coding.
Code review: Review open changes, ask for modifications, and line-edit code diffs in a dedicated panel
Code editing: A lightweight file viewing and editing experience in Warp with tabbed file viewing, a file tree, and syntax highlighting
Projects in Warp: Initialize projects with their own WARP.md files (compatible with Agents.MD, Claude.MD and cursor rules). You can also define agent profiles to launch agents with different default settings, and global slash commands.
Demo of Warp Code featuresWhy we built Warp Code
In June, we launched Warp 2.0, the Agentic Development Environment. Our thesis: development is shifting from coding by hand to coding by prompt. The workflow of opening a file and hand-writing code is becoming obsolete. Instead, developers will start with a prompt – tell an agent to fix a bug, build a feature, debug a server crash in prod… and watch it work.
The vision resonated: since the ADE launch, we’ve seen faster growth than ever before in Warp’s history. We've onboarded hundreds of thousands of users, and revenue is up 30x this year.I used to be sold on Cursor—after using Warp, I understand what the development flows of the future look like. Warp is unlike any other tool I’ve used, and I’ll never go back.Michael Stoppelman, Former SVP of Engineering, YelpHowever, even as agents improve, there’s still a big gap in getting from prompt all the way to prod. Even the most powerful agents like Warp still benefit from the knowledge, context, and guidance of experienced engineers.
Too often agents write code that almost works, but has subtle issues that end up taking a lot of time to understand, debug, and commit.66% of respondents cited "AI responses that are almost right, but not quite" as their biggest frustration with agentic coding. (Stack Overflow 2025 Developer Survey, AI)The solution is not to back away from developing by prompt – instead it’s to improve the prompting workflow so that developers have more comprehension and control.
We call this process “agent steering” and our goal with Warp Code is to ship the most “steer”-able coding agent around.
What’s in Warp Code
Because of where Warp sits in the application stack compared to tools like Claude Code and Gemini CLI, we can offer a richer UX for steering agents. Features like code review and file editing support a tight feedback loop between developer and agent: prompt, review, edit, and ship.
Number one coding agent
Most importantly, we continue to improve the quality of our coding agent. We are #1 on Terminal-Bench, and continue to climb the leader board on SWE-bench Verified, now clocking in at 75.8%, which is #3 overall.Since June, Warp’s SWE-bench Verified score has increased nearly 5%. The improvement is due to two key changes. First, we used GPT-5 high-reasoning as the primary model. GPT-5 high reasoning is available to all Warp users. Second, we made a lot of improvements at the app layer to optimize agents: to do lists, file editing, long-conversation management, and more. Read more about the improvements.We’re excited to see Warp and GPT-5 set a new bar hitting 75.8% on SWE-Bench Verified. This milestone shows how far agentic coding has come, and how Warp is pushing the boundaries of what developers can achieve from prompt to production.Marc Manara, Head of Startups, OpenAIOur agent always includes access to the top models even as they change, and we will continue to improve the behind-the-scenes context and prompt engineering that makes Warp’s agent the most powerful around.
Code review
There are lots of code review products on the market, but Warp’s is unique because it is built for humans reviewing agent-generated code. In a world where agents write more and more code, we think this is the flow that actually matters most (not agents reviewing human generated code, although that’s cool too).So in Warp, you can now view your agent’s changes as they are written, and steer the agent as it works. Our diff view works against your current branch or main and allows you to easily reprompt by referencing specific diffs and lines. It also allows hand editing right in the diff view.
All this saves you from having to context switch to Github just to see what an agent’s done. It increases your comprehension and makes it easier to ship correct, maintainable agent-generated code.
Native file editor
You can now open and edit files directly in Warp — complete with features like syntax highlighting, a tabbed file viewer, and find and replace (and, of course, vim keybindings).The primary use case here is small edits to agent-generated code – because sometimes a hand-edit is faster than re-prompting; like when you just want to change a variable name, edit a bit of copy, or rewrite a small function.
We also shipped a simple file tree for browsing, opening, and adding files as context, as well as file opening and creation using the file palette (cmd-O).
We aren’t trying to rebuild an IDE here – we think the ADE approach is where things are headed. But, we do see the value in having just enough code editing capabilities to get an agent’s changes over the line.
Projects: WARP.md, slash commands, and agent profiles
You’ll notice a new zero state and welcome screen in Warp that allows you to quickly start new projects, navigate to existing ones or resume prior conversations. This makes it faster to get going on something new or pick up right where you left off.
If you’re starting a new project, Warp will set up for you with project rules and codebase indexing.
If you have an existing project, you can now run /init (and a host of other slash commands) to bootstrap it with a version-controlled WARP.md file. Warp also supports AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md and Cursor rules.Beyond /init, slash commands also allow you to quickly add global rules, MCP servers, and execute saved prompts. All of this makes agents much more context-aware and powerful.
Finally, we introduced Agent Profiles in this release, which let you specify a model + set of permissions for an agent. Profiles allow you to run different types of agents for different tasks with confidence the agent won’t do more than it's allowed to.
Suggested code diffs
We included one other special feature in the code launch, which is that our coding agent can now proactively suggest fixes so you don’t even need to invoke it.
If you have a compiler error or merge conflict, the agent just tries to fix it for you on the spot – you can always dismiss, reprompt, or start a conversation from the suggestion if you need to refine it.Early feedback
A subset of Warp users have been testing Warp Code for weeks. Some early results from their testing include:
150M lines of code per week, 97% acceptance rate
Users have been generating over 150M lines of code each week in Warp. More exciting, over 97% of code diffs generated by Warp are accepted by end users.
1 hour saved each day
We surveyed our Warp Code users and learned that they save, on average one hour a day. 25% of respondents said Warp saved over two hours each day.What comes next
Warp Code is just the beginning. We’re building for a future where Warp is the primary tool developers need to ship software, but there’s work to be done to get us there. In the coming months, look forward to product updates including:

Further editor improvements like LSP support, symbol navigation
More intelligent and streamlined code review
Remote environment support

To those who have been using Warp already, thank you for your role in our journey. For those joining with this launch, welcome to the community.
Give Warp Code a try, and let us know what you think.Related]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Visualizing the internal state of a Transformer model]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        
          
            Introduction
          
          
            The internal mechanisms of Transformer Large Language models (LLMs),
            particularly the flow of information through the layers and the
            operation of the attention mechanism, can be challenging to follow
            due to the vast amount of numbers involved. We humans can hardly
            form a mental model. This article aims to make these workings
            tangible by providing visualizations of a Transformer's internal
            state. Utilizing a minimal dataset and a deliberately simplified
            model, it is possible to follow the model's internal processes
            step-by-step. One can observe how information is transformed across
            different layers and how the attention mechanism weighs different
            input tokens. This approach offers a transparent view into the core
            operations of a Transformer.

          Setup
          
            This article employs a strategy of radical simplification across
            three key components: the training data, the tokenization method,
            and the model architecture. While significantly scaled down, this
            setup allows for detailed tracking and visualization of internal
            states. Fundamental mechanisms observed here are expected to mirror
            those in larger models.
          

          Minimal Dataset
          
            A highly structured and minimal training dataset focused on simple
            relationships between a few concepts: fruits and tastes. Unlike vast
            text corpora, this dataset features repetitive patterns and clear
            semantic links, making it easier to observe how the model learns
            specific connections.
          
          
            A single, distinct sentence is held out as a validation set. This
            sentence tests whether the model has truly learned the semantic link
            between "chili" and "spicy" (which only appear together differently
            in training) or if it has merely memorized the training sequences.
          
          
            Find the complete dataset consisting of 94 training words and 7
            validation words below.
          
          Training Data
          
            English grammar rule violations are intentional for simplification.
          
          
            lemon tastes sour
            apple tastes sweet
            orange tastes juicy
            chili tastes spicy
            spicy is a chili
            sweet is a apple
            juicy is a orange
            sour is a lemon
            i like the spicy taste of chili
            i like the sweet taste of apple
            i like the juicy taste of orange
            i like the sour taste of lemon
            lemon is so sour
            apple is so sweet
            orange is so juicy
            chili is so spicy
            i like sour so i like lemon
            i like sweet so i like apple
            i like juicy so i like orange
          
          Validation Data
          
            i like spicy so i like chili
          
          Basic Tokenization
          
            Tokenization is kept rudimentary. Instead of complex subword methods
            like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a simple regex splits text primarily
            into words. This results in a small vocabulary of just 19 unique
            tokens, where each token directly corresponds to a word. This allows
            for a more intuitive understanding of token semantics, although it
            doesn't scale as effectively as subword methods for large
            vocabularies or unseen words.
          

          List of all Tokens
          
            [('is', 0),
            ('the', 1),
            ('orange', 2),
            ('chili', 3),
            ('sour', 4),
            ('of', 5),
            ('taste', 6),
            ('apple', 7),
            ('sweet', 8),
            ('juicy', 9),
            ('a', 10),
            ('spicy', 11),
            ('so', 12),
            ('like', 13),
            ('tastes', 14),
            ('i', 15),
            ('lemon', 16),
            ('UNKNOWN', 17),
            ('PADDING', 18)]
          

          
            Simplified Model Architecture
          
          
            The Transformer model itself is a decoder-only model drastically
            scaled down compared to typical Large Language Models (LLMs). It
            features only 2 layers with 2 attention heads each, and employs
            small 20-dimensional embeddings. Furthermore, it uses tied word
            embeddings (the same matrix for input lookup and output prediction,
            also used in Google's Gemma), reducing parameters and linking
            input/output representations in the same vector space which is
            helpful for visualization. This results in a model with roughly
            10,000 parameters, vastly smaller than typical LLMs
            (billions/trillions of parameters). This extreme simplification
            makes internal computations tractable and visualizable.
          

          
            Training and Validation Result
          
          
            After training for 10,000 steps, the model achieves low loss on both
            the training data and the validation sentence. Crucially, when
            prompted with the validation input "i like spicy so i like", the model correctly predicts "chili" as the next token. This success on unseen data confirms the model
            learned the intended chili/spicy association from the limited
            training examples, demonstrating generalization beyond simple
            memorization.
          
        

        
          
            Visualizing the Internals
          
          
            While Transformer implementations operate on multi-dimensional
            tensors for efficiency in order to handle batches of sequences and
            processing entire context windows in parallel, we can simplify our
            conceptual understanding. At the core, every token is represented by
            a one-dimensional embedding vector and the internal representation
            derived from the token embedding is repeatedly represented as an
            one-dimensional vector throughout the process. This property can be
            used for visualization.
          

          Token Embeddings
          
            Our model uses 20-dimensional embeddings, meaning each token is
            initially represented by 20 numbers. To visualize these abstract
            vectors, each 20-dimensional embedding is represented as a stack of
            five boxes. Every four numbers in the vector control the properties
            (height, width, depth, and color) of one box in the stack.
          

          
            Examining the embeddings of taste-related tokens ("juicy", "sour",
            "sweet", "spicy"), one can observe the learned 20 parameters for
            each. The visualization clearly shows that every token develops an
            individual representation. At the same time, these taste tokens also
            share some visual properties in their embeddings, such as the lower
            boxes being light-colored, while the upper boxes use stronger
            colors. Also, the lowest box appears rather high and narrow. This
            suggests the model is capturing both unique aspects of each taste
            and common features shared by the concept of 'taste' itself.
          

          
            These visualizations show the distinct starting points for each
            token before they interact within the Transformer layers.
          

          
            
            
              Learned 20-dimensional embeddings represented as stack of boxes
              for taste tokens ("juicy", "sour", "sweet", "spicy"). While each
              token has a unique appearance, shared visual features (e.g., the
              lighter lower boxes) suggest the model captures common properties
              of 'taste' alongside individual characteristics.
            
          

          Forward Pass
          
            When providing the model with a list of tokens, it will output
            possible next tokens and their likelihoods. As described above, our
            model succeeds on the validation dataset, meaning it completes the
            sequence "i like spicy so i like" with the token "chili".
            Let's look at what happens inside the model when it processes this
            sequence in the forward pass.
          

          
            In a first step, all input tokens are embedded. Examine their
            visualization below. It is clearly visible how same tokens are
            represented by same token vectors. Also, the "spicy" embedding is the same as shown above.
          
          
            
            
              Visualization of input token embeddings. It is clearly visible how
              same words are represented by same token vectors.
            
          

          
            Following the initial embedding, the tokens proceed through the
            Transformer's layers sequentially. Our model utilizes two such
            layers. Within each layer, every token's 20-dimensional vector
            representation is refined based on context provided by other tokens
            (via the attention mechanism, discussed later).
          

          
            
            
              Visualization of the token vectors progressing through the initial
              embedding layer and two Transformer layers. Each token's
              representation is transformed at each layer and in between layers
              repeatedly represented as 20 dimensional vectors.
            
          

          
            Crucially, the final representation of the last input token (in this
            case, the second "like" on
            the right side) after passing through all layers (from front to
            back) is used to predict the next token in the sequence. Because the
            model confidently predicts "chili" should follow this sequence, the vector representation for the
            final "like" token evolves to
            closely resemble the embedding vector for "chili" (shown below) in Transformer Layer 2.
          

          
            Comparing the vectors reveals a visual similarity. Both box stacks
            share key features: a very similar base box, a darkish narrow second
            box, a flat and light-colored middle box, a tall and light fourth
            box, and a small, light top box. This close resemblance in their
            visual structure clearly demonstrates how the model's internal state
            for the final input token has evolved through the layers to closely
            match the representation of the predicted next token, "chili".
          

          
            
            
              The original embedding vector for "chili" (and other food items), shown again for comparison with the
              final prediction vector from the previous figure. Note the visual
              similarities described in the text.
            
          

          
            Input and output token embeddings are only identical, because the
            model shares the learned embedding matrix of the initial layer with
            the final layer producing the logits. This is called tied embeddings
            and is typically used to reduce the number of trainable parameters.
          

          
            Attention in Transformer Layers
          

          
            Within each Transformer layer, the transformation of a token's
            vector representation isn't solely based on the token itself. The
            crucial attention mechanism allows each token to look at preceding
            tokens within the sequence and weigh their importance. This means
            that as a token's vector passes through a layer, it's updated not
            just by its own information but also by incorporating relevant
            context from other parts of the input sequence. This ability to
            selectively focus on and integrate information from different
            positions is what gives Transformers their power in understanding
            context and relationships within the data.
          

          
            Visualizing which tokens the attention mechanism focuses on when
            transforming each token reveals several details about how the model
            processes the sequence.
          

          
            
            
              Visualization including attention connections (colored lines)
              between tokens within each Transformer layer. Different colors
              represent different attention heads. Only connections with weights
              above a threshold are shown.
            

            
              In Transformer layer 1 (middle row), the earliest visible
              attention occurs when processing the third token, "spicy". It attends back to the preceding "i" token. This makes sense because "spicy" appears in multiple contexts within our small training dataset
              (e.g., "chili tastes spicy", "spicy is a chili",
              "chili is so spicy"). To
              correctly predict based on "spicy", the model benefits from looking at the preceding context. In
              contrast, the first token "i" shows no incoming attention lines because there are no prior
              tokens to attend to. The second token, "like", also shows no strong attention from "i". In our dataset, "like"
              consistently follows "i"
              but can precede various tastes ("spicy", "sweet", etc.).
              Therefore, knowing that "i"
              came before "like" provides
              little predictive value for what taste might follow, so the
              attention weight remains low.
            

            
              The next token in the sequence is "so". In Transformer Layer 1 (middle row), this token exhibits
              strong attention towards both the preceding token "spicy" and the initial token "i", indicated by the distinct colored lines connecting them
              (representing different attention heads). The focus on "spicy" is necessary because "so" appears in different contexts in the training data (e.g.,
              "i like sour so i like" and
              "lemon is so sour"), making
              the immediate preceding context crucial. The attention back to the
              initial "i" further helps
              establish the overall sentence structure ("i like ... so i like ...").
            
            
              Finally, let's examine the last token in the input sequence, the
              second "like" on the right.
              In both Transformer Layer 1 (middle row) and Transformer Layer 2
              (back row), this token shows strong attention directed towards the
              token "spicy". This focus
              is crucial for the model's prediction. The training data contains
              similar sentences such as "i like sweet so i like apple" and "i like sour so i like lemon". The key piece of information that distinguishes the current
              sequence and points towards "chili" as the correct completion is the word "spicy". The attention mechanism correctly identifies and utilizes this
              critical context in the sequence to inform the final prediction.
            
          
        

        
          Conclusion
          
            By radically simplifying the dataset, tokenization, and model
            architecture, this article provided a step-by-step visualization of
            a decoder-only Transformer's internal workings. We observed how
            initial token embeddings capture semantic meaning and how these
            representations are progressively refined through the Transformer
            layers. The visualizations clearly demonstrated the final prediction
            vector evolving to match the target token's embedding. Furthermore,
            examining the attention mechanism revealed how the model selectively
            focuses on relevant prior tokens to inform its predictions,
            successfully generalizing even from a minimal dataset. While highly
            simplified, this approach offers valuable intuition into the
            fundamental processes of information flow and contextual
            understanding within Transformer models.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi HN, I’m Danial, co-founder and CTO of Risely AI (https://risely.ai). We're building AI agents that automate operational workflows inside universities. Here’s a demo: https://www.loom.com/share/d7a14400434144c490249d665a0d0499?....Higher ed is full of inefficiencies. Every department runs on outdated systems that don’t talk to each other. Today, advising staff are looking up enrollment data in PeopleSoft or Ellucian, checking grades and assignments in Canvas, and trying to track engagement in a CRM, if they even have one. Often, it’s just spreadsheets and email. One advisor told us they were losing 8+ hours/week just trying to answer: “Which students are struggling?”. During that lag, students slip through the cracks, and every lost student costs a school tuition.I’ve spent the last decade building large-scale systems, but about a year ago, I left my job to build something personal. My time at UC Berkeley reinforced what my parents taught me when we immigrated to the U.S. - that education is the most powerful tool for upward mobility. But nearly 40% of students never graduate. Many of these students are capable and just need support, but the systems meant to support them are overwhelmed and broken.So we built Risely. Our first agent focuses on academic advising and retention. It connects to a school’s systems, unifies the data, flags at-risk students, drafts outreach, and answers natural-language questions about caseloads and course progress. It gives staff leverage and time back, while helping more students stay on track.The harder part is everything under the hood:
- Connecting to archaic SIS, LMS, and CRM systems with inconsistent APIs and data models
- Normalizing messy institutional data into something agents can reason over 
- Handling real policy constraints around FERPA, isolating tenant data, and meeting strict security and privacy standards for student PII 
- Designing agent workflows that are traceable, reviewable, and safe to run in production 
- Building infrastructure that can adapt to different institutional rules, processes, and edge cases.We started with advising because retention ties directly to both revenue and student success. But the same foundation applies to registrar, admissions, financial aid, research administration, and other critical functions. As more agents come online, they can begin to coordinate with each other and hopefully improve the entire operations of a college or university.If you’ve built systems that had to reconcile messy data, inconsistent workflows, or policy constraints using LLMs, we’d love to hear how you approached it.We’d love to hear your thoughts about the above, and anything in this space!]]></content:encoded>

Physics in high dimensions is becoming the norm in modern dynamics.  It is not only that string theory operates in ten dimensions (plus one for time), but virtually every complex dynamical system is described and analyzed within state spaces of high dimensionality.  Population dynamics, for instance, may describe hundreds or thousands of different species, each of whose time-varying populations define a separate axis in a high-dimensional space.  Coupled mechanical systems likewise may have hundreds or thousands (or more) of degrees of freedom that are described in high-dimensional phase space. 



In high-dimensional landscapes, mountain ridges are much more common than mountain peaks.  This has profound consequences for the evolution of life, the dynamics of complex systems, and the power of machine learning.



For these reasons, as physics students today are being increasingly exposed to the challenges and problems of high-dimensional dynamics, it is important to build tools they can use to give them an intuitive feeling for the highly unintuitive behavior of systems in high-D.



Within the rapidly-developing field of machine learning, which often deals with landscapes (loss functions or objective functions) in high dimensions that need to be minimized, high dimensions are usually referred to in the negative as “The Curse of Dimensionality”.



Dimensionality might be viewed as a curse for several reasons.  First, it is almost impossible to visualize data in dimensions higher than d = 4 (the fourth dimension can sometimes be visualized using colors or time series).  Second, too many degrees of freedom create too many variables to fit or model, leading to the classic problem of overfitting.  Put simply, there is an absurdly large amount of room in high dimensions.  Third, our intuition about relationships among areas and volumes are highly biased by our low-dimensional 3D experiences, causing us to have serious misconceptions about geometric objects in high-dimensional spaces.  Physical processes occurring in 3D can be over-generalized to give preconceived notions that just don’t hold true in higher dimensions.



Take, for example, the random walk.  It is usually taught starting from a 1-dimensional random walk (flipping a coin) that is then extended to 2D and then to 3D…most textbooks stopping there.  But random walks in high dimensions are the rule rather than the exception in complex systems.  One example that is especially important in this context is the problem of molecular evolution.  Each site on a genome represents an independent degree of freedom, and molecular evolution can be described as a random walk through that space, but the space of all possible genetic mutations is enormous.  Faced with such an astronomically large set of permutations, it is difficult to conceive of how random mutations could possibly create something as complex as, say, ATP synthase which is the basis of all higher bioenergetics.  Fortunately, the answer to this puzzle lies in the physics of random walks in high dimensions. 



Why Ten Dimensions?



This blog presents the physics of random walks in 10 dimensions.  Actually, there is nothing special about 10 dimensions versus 9 or 11 or 20, but it gives a convenient demonstration of high-dimensional physics for several reasons.  First, it is high enough above our 3 dimensions that there is no hope to visualize it effectively, even by using projections, so it forces us to contend with the intrinsic “unvisualizability” of high dimensions.  Second, ten dimensions is just big enough that it behaves roughly like any higher dimension, at least when it comes to random walks.  Third, it is about as big as can be handled with typical memory sizes of computers.  For instance, a ten-dimensional hypercubic lattice with 10 discrete sites along each dimension has 10^10 lattice points (10 Billion or 10 Gigs) which is about the limit of what a typical computer can handle with internal memory.



As a starting point for visualization, let’s begin with the well-known 4D hypercube but extend it to a 4D hyperlattice with three values along each dimension instead of two.  The resulting 4D lattice can be displayed in 2D as a network with 3^4 = 81 nodes and 216 links or edges.  The result is shown in Fig. 1, represented in two dimensions as a network graph with nodes and edges.  Each node has four links with neighbors.  Despite the apparent 3D look that this graph has about it, if you look closely you will see the frustration that occurs when trying to link to 4 neighbors, causing many long-distance links.



[See YouTube video for movies showing evolving hyperlattices and random walks in 10D.]



Fig. 1   A 4D hyperlattice with three sites along each of the 4 dimensions.  This high dimensional discrete lattice is represented as a network graph in 2D with nodes and edges.


We can also look at a 10D hypercube that has 2^10 = 1024 nodes and 5120 edges, shown in Fig. 2.  It is a bit difficult to see the hypercubic symmetry when presented in 2D, but each node has exactly 10 links.



Fig. 2   A 10D hypercube of 1024 nodes and 5120 edges.  Each node has exactly 10 links to neighbors


Extending this 10D lattice to 10 positions instead of 2 and trying to visualize it is prohibitive, since the resulting graph in 2D just looks like a mass of overlapping circles. However, our interest extends not just to ten locations per dimension, but to an unlimited number of locations. This is the 10D infinite lattice on which we want to explore the physics of the random walk.



Diffusion in Ten Dimensions



An unconstrained random walk in 10D is just a minimal extension beyond a simple random walk in 1D.  Because each dimension is independent, a single random walker takes a random step along any of the 10 dimensions at each iteration so that motion in any one of the 10 dimensions is just a 1D random walk.  Therefore, a simple way to visualize this random walk in 10D is simply to plot the walk against each dimension, as in Fig. 3.  There is one chance in ten that the walker will take a positive or negative step along any given dimension at each time point.  



Fig. 3   A single walker taking random unit steps in 10 dimensions.  The position of the walker as a function of time is shown for all ten dimensions.


An alternate visualization of the 10D random walker is shown in Fig. 4 for the same data as Fig. 3.  In this case the displacement is color coded, and each column is a different dimension.  Time is on the vertical axis (starting at the top and increasing downward).  This type of color map can easily be extended to hundreds of dimensions.  Each row is a position vector of the single walker in the 10D space



Fig. 4  Same data as in Fig. 3 for a single 10D random walker on a hyperlattice.  Distance is color coded.  Time is on the vertical axis (increasing downward). Each row is a 10D position vector, and this representation is of a single 10D trajectory.


In the 10D hyperlattice in this section, all lattice sites are accessible at each time point, so there is no constraint preventing the walk from visiting a previously-visited node.  There is a possible adjustment that can be made to the walk that prevents it from ever crossing its own path.  This is known as a self-avoiding-walk (SAW).  In two dimensions, there is a major difference in the geometric and dynamical properties of an ordinary walk and an SAW.  However, in dimensions larger than 4, it turns out that there are so many possibilities of where to go (high-dimensional spaces have so much free room) that it is highly unlikely that a random walk will ever cross itself.  Therefore, in our 10D hyperlattice we do not need to make the distinction between an ordinary walk and a self-avoiding-walk.  However, there are other constraints that can be imposed that mimic how complex systems evolve in time, and these constraints can have important consequences, as we see next.



Random Walk in a Maximally Rough Landscape



In the infinite hyperlattice of the previous section, all lattice sites are the same and are all equally accessible.  However, in the study of complex systems, it is common to assign a value to each node in a high-dimensional lattice.  This value can be assigned by a potential function, producing a high-dimensional potential landscape over the lattice geometry.  Or the value might be the survival fitness of a species, producing a high-dimensional fitness landscape that governs how species compete and evolve.  Or the value might be a loss function (an objective function) in a minimization problem from multivariate analysis or machine learning.   In all of these cases, the scalar value on the nodes defines a landscape over which a state point executes a walk.  The question then becomes, what are the properties of a landscape in high dimensions, and how does it affect a random walker?



As an example, let’s consider a landscape that is completely random point-to-point.  There are no correlations in this landscape, making it maximally rough.  Then we require that a random walker takes a walk along iso-potentials in this landscape, never increasing and never decreasing its potential.  Beginning with our spatial intuition living in 3D space, we might be concerned that such a walker would quickly get confined in some area of the lanscape.  Think of a 2D topo map with countour lines drawn on it — If we start at a certain elevation on a mountain side, then if we must walk along directions that maintain our elevation, we stay on a given contour and eventually come back to our starting point after circling the mountain peak — we are trapped!  But this intuition informed by our 3D lives is misleading.  What happens in our 10D hyperlattice?



To make the example easy to analyze, let’s assume that our potential function is restricted to N discrete values.  This means that of the 10 neighbors to a given walker site, on average only 10/N are likely to have the same potential value as the given walker site.  This constrains the available sites for the walker, and it converts the uniform hyperlattice into a hyperlattice site percolation problem.



Percolation theory is a fascinating topic in statistical physics.  There are many deep concepts that come from asking simple questions about how nodes are connected across a network.  The most important aspect of percolation theory is the concept of a percolation threshold.  Starting with a complete network that is connected end-to-end, start removing nodes at random.  For some critical fraction of nodes removed (on average) there will no longer be a single connected cluster that spans the network.  This critical fraction is known as the percolation threshold.  Above the percolation threshold, a random walker can get from one part of the network to another.  Below the percolation threshold, the random walker is confined to a local cluster.  



If a hyperlattice has N discrete values for the landscape potential (or height, or contour) and if a random walker can only move to site that has the same value as the walker’s current value (remains on the level set), then only a fraction of the hyperlattice sites are available to the walker, and the question of whether the walker can find a path the spans the hyperlattice becomes simply a question of how the fraction of available sites relates to the percolation threshold.



The percolation threshold for hyperlattices is well known.  For reasonably high dimensions, it is given to good accuracy by






where d is the dimension of the hyperlattice.  For a 10D hyperlattice the percolation threshold is pc(10) = 0.0568, or about 6%.  Therefore, if more than 6% of the sites of the hyperlattice have the same value as the walker’s current site, then the walker is free to roam about the hyperlattice.  



If there are N = 5 discrete values for the potential, then 20% of the sites are available, which is above the percolation threshold, and walkers can go as far as they want.  This statement holds true no matter what the starting value is.  It might be 5, which means the walker is as high on the landscape as they can get.  Or it might be 1, which means the walker is as low on the landscape as they can get.  Yet even if they are at the top, if the available site fraction is above the percolation threshold, then the walker can stay on the high mountain ridge, spanning the landscape.  The same is true if they start at the bottom of a valley.  Therefore, mountain ridges are very common, as are deep valleys, yet they allow full mobility about the geography.  On the other hand, a so-called mountain peak would be a 5 surrounded by 4’s or lower.  The odds for having this happen in 10D are 0.2*(1-0.8^10) = 0.18.  Then the total density of mountain peaks, in a 10D hyperlattice with 5 potential values, is only 18%.  Therefore, mountain peaks are rare in 10D, while mountain ridges are common.  In even higher dimensions, the percolation threshold decreases roughly inversely with the dimensionality, and mountain peaks become extremely rare and play virtually no part in walks about the landscape.



To illustrate this point, Fig. 5 is the same 10D network that is in Fig. 2, but only the nodes sharing the same value are shown for N = 5, which means that only 20% of the nodes are accessible to a walker who stays only on nodes with the same values.  There is a “giant cluster” that remains connected, spanning the original network.  If the original network is infinite, then the giant cluster is also infinite but contains a finite fraction of the nodes.



Fig. 5  A 10D cluster that spans the network in Fig. 2 for 1/5 of the nodes sharing the same landscape value.  This cluster represents a mountain ridge that spans the space.  There are four additional co-existing clusters, each of which separately spans the same 10D space.


The quantitative details of the random walk can change depending on the proximity of the sub-networks (the clusters, the ridges or the level sets) to the percolation threshold.  For instance, a random walker in D =10 with N = 5 is shown in Fig. 6.  The diffusion is a bit slower than in the unconstrained walk of Figs. 3 and 4.  But the ability to wander about the 10D space is retained.



Fig. 6  A random walker on the level-set cluster of Fig. 5


This is then the general important result: In high-dimensional landscapes, mountain ridges are much more common than mountain peaks. This has profound consequences for the evolution of life, the dynamics of complex systems, and the power of machine learning.



Consequences for Evolution and Machine Learning



When the high-dimensional space is the space of possible mutations on a genome, and when the landscape is a fitness landscape that assigns a survival advantage for one mutation relative to others, then the random walk describes the evolution of a species across generations.  The prevalence of ridges, or more generally level sets, in high dimensions has a major consequence for the evolutionary process, because a species can walk along a level set acquiring many possible mutations that have only neutral effects on the survivability of the species.  At the same time, the genetic make-up is constantly drifting around in this “neutral network”, allowing the species’ genome to access distant parts of the space.  Then, at some point, natural selection may tip the species up a nearby (but rare) peak, and a new equilibrium is attained for the species.  



One of the early criticisms of fitness landscapes was the (erroneous) criticism that for a species to move from one fitness peak to another, it would have to go down and cross wide valleys of low fitness to get to another peak.  But this was a left-over from thinking in 3D.  In high-D, neutral networks are ubiquitous, and a mutation can take a step away from one fitness peak onto one of the neutral networks, which can be sampled by a random walk until the state is near some distant peak.  It is no longer necessary to think in terms of high peaks and low valleys of fitness — just random walks.  The evolution of extremely complex structures, like ATP synthase, can then be understood as a random walk along networks of nearly-neutral fitness — once our 3D biases are eliminated.



The same arguments hold for many situations in machine learning and especially deep learning.  When training a deep neural network, there can be thousands of neural weights that need to be trained through the minimization of a loss function, also known as an objective function.  The loss function is the equivalent to a potential, and minimizing the loss function over the thousands of dimensions is the same problem as maximizing the fitness of an evolving species.  



At first look, one might think that deep learning is doomed to failure.  We have all learned, from the earliest days in calculus, that enough adjustable parameter can fit anything, but the fit is meaningless because it predicts nothing.  Deep learning seems to be the worst example of this.  How can fitting thousands of adjustable parameters be useful when the dimensionality of the optimization space is orders of magnitude larger than the degrees of freedom of the system being modeled?



The answer comes from the geometry of high dimensions.  The prevalence of neutral networks in high dimensions gives lots of chances to escape local minima.  In fact, local minima are actually rare in high dimensions, and when they do occur, there is a neutral network nearby onto which they can escape (if the effective temperature of the learning process is set sufficiently high).  Therefore, despite the insanely large number of adjustable parameters, general solutions, that are meaningful and predictive, can be found by adding random walks around the objective landscape as a partial strategy in combination with gradient descent.



Given the superficial analogy of deep learning to the human mind, the geometry of random walks in ultra-high dimensions may partially explain our own intelligence and consciousness.

            <description><![CDATA[From the Zed Blog: You asked, and here it is. Use Claude Code in public beta directly in Zed, built on the new Agent Client Protocol.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[You asked for it. A lot.

So we built it: our Claude Code integration is now available in public beta, running natively in Zed through our new Agent Client Protocol (ACP).
For months, developers have been asking us to bring Claude Code into Zed. We didn’t just want to bolt on a one-off integration; we wanted to build something better. ACP is our new open standard that lets any agent connect to Zed (and other editors, too). Claude Code is a perfect example of what’s possible.
Now you can:

Run Claude Code as a first-class citizen in Zed's high-performance editor, not just a terminal interface
Follow along in real-time as it edits across multiple files, with full syntax highlighting and language server support
Review and approve granular changes in a multibuffer - accept or reject individual code hunks
Keep Claude Code's task list anchored in your sidebar, so you always see what the agent is working on
Define custom workflows with Claude Code's custom slash commands for your most common development tasks

Escape the Terminal
A walkthrough of Claude Code in Zed.
Claude Code has gained broad popularity among developers thanks to its powerful code generation and finely tuned tools. While the command-line interface is powerful, when Claude Code is making changes across multiple files or refactoring complex logic, you may want to see the bigger picture and have more control on what code you accept or reject. With Zed, you get the best of both worlds: Claude Code's intelligence, freed from the terminal and deeply integrated into a highly performant editor.
You can now run Claude Code directly in Zed and use it side-by-side with Zed's first-party agent, Gemini CLI, and any other ACP-compatible agent. Make sure you’re on the latest version of Zed and find your available agents in the Plus menu in the Agent Panel.
Built with ACP
Rather than creating a tightly-coupled integration specific to Claude Code, we built this integration using the Agent Client Protocol. We launched ACP as our open standard for connecting any AI agent with any compatible editor.
We built an adapter that wraps Claude Code's SDK and translates its interactions into ACP's JSON RPC format. This adapter bridges between Claude Code and ACP's standardized interface, allowing Claude Code to run as an independent process while Zed provides the user interface.
We are open sourcing the Claude Code adapter under the Apache license, making it freely available for any editor that’s adopted ACP to use; you can find the source code here. Since the popular CodeCompanion plugin for Neovim has already adopted ACP, Claude Code will also be available in Neovim.
We want to thank GitHub user Xuanwo for all his work since the ACP launch in building an ACP implementation for Claude Code - your speed to solution inspired us to work hard to keep up! We appreciate you for your contribution to the protocol's adoption. Give him a follow on GitHub and Twitter/X.
Bring Any Agent to Zed
We want every agent usable in Zed. Gemini CLI and Claude Code are a great start, and we have more on the way, but there are new agents released every week and many great existing ones not yet speaking the protocol. ACP makes it simple to bring any agent into Zed's, Neovim's, or any other ACP-adapted editor's interface!
This beta delivers as much core Claude Code functionality as possible via the SDK. We're adding features like Plan mode in the coming days, and more advanced capabilities as Anthropic expands SDK support; for example, many built-in slash commands are not yet supported by the SDK. From here:

Building an agent? We want to help you integrate with Zed - reach out with questions.
Want more Claude Code features? Join us in asking Anthropic to bring the SDK to parity with Claude Code or adopt ACP directly.
Ready to contribute? Contribute to or discuss ACP and the Claude Code adapter repos.

We're always looking for feedback on ACP, and welcome contributions from other agent (and client) builders. The more agents that work in Zed, the more choice you have as a developer.Looking for a better editor?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[PolarSys B612 font family
B612 is an highly legible open source font family designed and tested to be used on aircraft cockpit screens.
Main characteristics are:

Maximize the distance between the forms of the characters
Respect the primitives of the different letters
Harmonize the forms and their spacing

The genesis of PolarSys B612
In 2010, Airbus initiated a research collaboration with ENAC and Université de Toulouse III on a prospective study to define and validate an “Aeronautical Font”: the challenge was to improve the display of information on the cockpit screens, in particular in terms of legibility and comfort of reading, and to optimize the overall homogeneity of the cockpit.
2 years later, Airbus came to find Intactile DESIGN to work on the design of the eight typographic variants of the font. This one, baptized B612 in reference to the imaginary asteroid of the aviator Saint‑Exupéry, benefited from a complete hinting on all the characters.
Releasing a new version of the font

Update the version number in the font info of the source files
Make a copy of the source files
Open the copies in Fontlab
Run the merge intersection command on each file
Generate the ttf files
Run the build script from the scripts folder to fix digital signature

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[BackgroundAs part of my ongoing project to reimplement Django’s templating language in Rust, I have been adding support for custom template tags.Simple tagsThe simplest custom tag will look something like:# time_tags.py
from datetime import datetime
from django import template

register = template.Library()


@register.simple_tag
def time(format_string):
  now = datetime.now()
  return now.strftime(format_string)
This can then be used in a Django template like:{% load time from time_tags %}
<p>Time: {% time '%H:%M:%S' %}</p>
The contextDjango’s templating language uses an object called a context to provide dynamic data to the template renderer. This mostly behaves like a Python dictionary.detailsTechnically, Django’s context contains a list of dictionaries. This allows for temporarily changing the value of a variable, for example within a {% for %} loop, while keeping the old value for later use.A simple tag can be defined that takes the context as the first variable:# time_tags.py
from datetime import datetime
from django import template

register = template.Library()


@register.simple_tag(
    takes_context=True)
def time(context, format_string):
  timezone = context["timezone"]
  now = datetime.now(tz=timezone)
  return now.strftime(format_string)
Django Rusty TemplatesIn Django Rusty Templates, I have defined a context as a Rust struct. Here’s a simplified version:pub struct Context {
  context: HashMap<
    String, Py<PyAny>>,
}
When rendering a template tag, the context is passed to the render method as a mutable reference:trait Render {
  fn render(
    &self,
    py: Python<'_>,
    context: &mut Context,
  ) -> RenderResult;
}
This is natural when working purely in Rust but custom template tags require passing the context to Python, which doesn’t understand Rust lifetimes.The standard way of connecting Python and Rust is with PyO3. To pass a Rust type to Python, we can wrap it in a #[pyclass]:#[pyclass]
struct PyContext {
  context: Context,
}

#[pymethods]
impl PyContext {
  // Methods for Python to read from
  // the context
}
And then we can create this in our render method:struct CustomTag {
  func: Py<PyAny>,
  takes_context: bool,
}

impl Render for CustomTag {
  fn render(
    &self,
    py: Python<'_>,
    context: &mut Context,
  ) -> RenderResult {
    if self.takes_context {
      let py_context =
        PyContext { context };
      let content = self.func
        .bind(py)
        .call1((py_context,))?;
      Ok(content.to_string())
    }
  }
}
Unfortunately, this doesn’t compile because PyContext requires an owned value, not a mutable reference:error[E0308]: mismatched types
   --> src/render/tags.rs:807:40
    |
807 | let py_context =
        PyContext { context };
    |               ^^^^^^^
            expected `Context`,
            found `&mut Context`
Turning a mutable reference into an owned valueTo make progress, we need to find a way to get an owned version of context. To do this, I turned to std::mem::take, which replaces the data pointed to by &mut context with an empty value (via the Default trait) and returns an owned value:#[derive(Default)]
pub struct Context {
  context: HashMap<
    String, Py<PyAny>>,
}

impl Render for CustomTag {
  fn render(
    &self,
    py: Python<'_>,
    context: &mut Context,
  ) -> RenderResult {
    if self.takes_context {
      let context =
        std::mem::take(context);
      let py_context =
        PyContext { context };
      let content = self.func
        .call1(py, (py_context,))?;
      Ok(content.to_string())
    }
  }
}
Moving the owned value back into the mutable referenceThis works very well for giving Python access to the context. However, once the custom tag’s rendering logic has run we need to regain ownership of the context for use in other Rust tags. To do this, we turn to std::mem::replace:impl Render for CustomTag {
  fn render(
    &self,
    py: Python<'_>,
    context: &mut Context,
  ) -> RenderResult {
    if self.takes_context {
      let swapped_context =
        std::mem::take(
          swapped_context);
      let py_context = PyContext {
          context: swapped_context
      };
      let content = self.func
        .call1(py, (py_context,))?;
      let _ = std::mem::replace(
        context,
        py_context.context);
      Ok(content.to_string())
    }
  }
}
Unfortunately, this again does not compile:error[E0382]: use of moved value:
                `py_context.context`
   --> src/render/tags.rs:815:48
    |
813 | let py_context = PyContext { 
        context: swapped_context };
    |     ----------
          move occurs because
          `py_context` has type
          `PyContext`, which does
          not implement the `Copy`
          trait
814 | let content = self.func.call1(
        py, (py_context,))?;
    |        ----------
             value moved here
815 | let _ = std::mem::replace(
        context,
        py_context.context);
    |   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        value used here after move
To get around this, we can use an Arc (atomic reference count) to send Python a clone of py_context rather than moving it out of scope. We can also remove the context from the Arc with Arc::try_unwrap:#[pyclass]
#[derive(Clone)]
struct PyContext {
  context: Arc<Context>,
}

impl Render for CustomTag {
  fn render(
    &self,
    py: Python<'_>,
    context: &mut Context,
  ) -> RenderResult {
    if self.takes_context {
      let swapped_context =
        std::mem::take(
          swapped_context).into();
      let py_context = PyContext {
        context: swapped_context
      };
      let content = self.func.call1(
        py, (py_context.clone(),)?;
      let inner_context = match 
          Arc::try_unwrap(
            py_context.context) {
        Ok(inner_context) => {
          inner_context
        }
        Err(_) => todo!(),
      };
      let _ = std::mem::replace(
        context, inner_context);
      Ok(content.to_string())
    }
  }
}
This works great when Python doesn’t keep a reference to the PyContext object. This means the reference count of the Arc is one and Arc::try_unwrap will succeed. If the custom tag implementation keeps a reference around for some reason, we cannot take ownership. Instead we must fall back to cloning the inner context:#[derive(Default)]
pub struct Context {
  context: HashMap<
    String, Py<PyAny>>,
}

impl Context {
  fn clone_ref(
      &self, py: Python<'_>
  ) -> Self {
    Self {
      context: self
        .context
        .iter()
        .map(|(k, v)| (
          k.clone(),
          v.clone_ref(py),
        ))
        .collect(),
    }
  }
}

impl Render for CustomTag {
  fn render(
    &self,
    py: Python<'_>,
    context: &mut Context,
  ) -> RenderResult {
    if self.takes_context {
      let swapped_context =
        std::mem::take(
          swapped_context).into();
      let py_context = PyContext {
        context: swapped_context
      };
      let content = self.func.call1(
        py, (py_context.clone(),)?;
      let inner_context = match 
          Arc::try_unwrap(
            py_context.context) {
        Ok(inner_context) => {
          inner_context
        }
        Err(inner_context) => {
          inner_context
            .clone_ref(py)
        }
      };
      let _ = std::mem::replace(
        context, inner_context);
      Ok(content.to_string())
    }
  }
}
Note that we need to use the clone_ref method instead of clone because this handles Python’s reference counts correctly.Mutating the context from PythonThis is sufficient to grant Python read-only access to the context, but the context is designed to be mutated. To enable this, we need to protect the context from being mutably accessed from multiple threads. To do this, we can use a Mutex, along with PyO3’s MutexExt trait which provides the lock_py_attached method to avoid deadlocking with the Python interpreter:use pyo3::sync::MutexExt;

#[pyclass]
#[derive(Clone)]
struct PyContext {
  context: Arc<Mutex<Context>>,
}

impl PyContext {
  fn new(context: Context) -> Self {
    Self {
      context: Arc::new(
        Mutex::new(context)),
    }
  }
}

impl Render for CustomTag {
  fn render(
    &self,
    py: Python<'_>,
    context: &mut Context,
  ) -> RenderResult {
    if self.takes_context {
      let swapped_context =
        std::mem::take(
          swapped_context);
      let py_context =
        PyContext::new(
          swapped_context
      );
      let content = self.func.call1(
        py, (py_context.clone(),)?;
      let inner_context = match 
          Arc::try_unwrap(
            py_context.context) {
        Ok(inner_context) => {
          inner_context
            .into_inner().unwrap()
        }
        Err(inner_context) => {
          let guard = inner_context
            .lock_py_attached(py)
            .unwrap();
          guard.clone_ref(py)
        }
      };
      let _ = std::mem::replace(
        context, inner_context);
      Ok(content.to_string())
    }
  }
}
ConclusionsThe inability of PyO3 to expose Rust structs that use lifetimes initially seems limiting, but PyO3 and Rust provide powerful tools to work around these limitations. std::mem::take, std::mem::replace and std::mem::swap allow for advanced manipulation of mutable references and owned values and Arc and Mutex are extremely useful for exposing shared mutable data to Python. PyO3’s MutexExt is essential for working with mutexes and Python together.You can find the full code implementing a simple custom tag here, with the extra details I omitted here for brevity and clarity.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[When I moved in with my wife Laura in 2005, we lived in a shared apartment in Barcelona that had an ancient washing machine that was just there already, no idea who initially bought it. I managed to break the washing machine door's closing mechanism some time in 2006, so for a few weeks, whenever we did the washing, we had to lean a chair against the door so it wouldn't open. At the time, we were both students and living on a small budget.Eventually, later in the same year, we bought an Electrolux machine that has accompanied us ever since. First on our move to Hamburg, then there through three apartments, and finally back to Spain, where we live now in the Catalonian countryside. Anyway, the washing machine had a motor damage last week, so after almost 20 years, it was time for a new one. I ordered it online (another Electrolux, without Internet nor WiFi), it was delivered swiftly, and I installed it hopefully correctly.The washing machine came with a voluntary 10 year warranty if you registered it. The brochure where this offer was announced featured a free telephone number and a QR code that pointed at the number (in plain text, not making use of the tel: protocol). I called the number, and to my absolute surprise there were currently more callers than usual. After about 20 minutes, I had an agent on the phone, but after saying what I wanted, they just hung up on me (or the connection cut, whatever). Fine, I called again, but now, the call center was over capacity and they didn't even let me enter in the wait loop.They did offer to send me a link to a chat service on their website via SMS, though, so I went for that option. The SMS literally pointed me at something like https://www. broken up by a space and then example.com/gc/. When I clicked the linkified example.com/gc/, I ended up on a broken site whose certificate wasn't trusted. After fixing the link manually and prepending the https://www. part, the page didn't load.At this point I was close to giving up, but I had one last card that I wanted to play: I searched Google for "electrolux warranty register", and it pointed me at a site https://www.example.com/mypages/register-a-product/ as the first result. This looked promising. The mypages already suggested that this was gated behind a login, so I created an account, which was painless. (Turns out, after having an account and being logged in, the chat URL also worked—what an oversight on their part.) On the page, they had a field where you could enter the washing machine's product number from the identification plate on the door of the washing machine, together with helpful information where to find the data.But even better, they offered a service where you could just upload a picture of the identification plate, and some AI on their server then extracted the product number and let you register the product with two clicks. What a fantastic experience compared to the crappy (and likely for the operator way more expensive) call center experience.Why they didn't just put this URL on the brochure and the QR code is beyond me. As the title suggests: For all that's holy, can you just leverage the Web, please? Don't make me talk to people! They could still offer to register the machine by telephone as an alternative, but in 2025, the default for such things should just be the Web.Bonus Since I work on built-in AI as my day job in the Chrome team at Google, I could not not notice this "extract the product number from this identification plate" use case for client-side AI. I coded up a quick demo using the Prompt API embedded below that shows this in action. Here's a quick walkthrough of the code:Create a session with the LanguageModel, informing the user of download progress if the model needs to be downloaded, and telling the model about the to-be-expected inputs (English texts and images) and outputs (English texts). In the system prompt, I tell the model what its overall task is (identify product numbers from photos of identification plates).Prompt the model using the promptStreaming() method with a multimodal prompt, one textual and one image. The Prompt API supports structured output in the form of a JSON Schema or regular expression. Product numbers have nine digits, so I pass the regular expression /\d{9}/ as the responseConstraint option.Iterate over the chunks of the response. Since I'm just expecting nine digits, this is probably a bit overkill, but, hey…(Not shown) On the server, verify that the recognized product number actually exist. Companies typically have some sort of verification rules like checksums, or washing machine product numbers always start with 91 or something. If you know those rules, you can of course make them part of the responseConstraint, but you always need to verify untrusted user input (which the output of an LLM counts as) on the server.const session = await LanguageModel.create({
  monitor(m) {
    m.addEventListener('downloadprogress', (e) => {
      console.log(`Downloaded ${e.loaded * 100}%.`);
    });

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[By Nicolas Hulscher, MPH
A new MIT study titled, Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task, has found that using ChatGPT to help write essays leads to long-term cognitive harm—measurable through EEG brain scans. Students who repeatedly relied on ChatGPT showed weakened neural connectivity, impaired memory recall, and diminished sense of ownership over their own writing. While the AI-generated content often scored well, the brains behind it were shutting down.






The findings are clear: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Grok don’t just help students write—they train the brain to disengage. Here’s what the researchers found:

Brain Connectivity Declines with AI Use


EEG scans revealed a systematic scaling down of neural connectivity in the brain with increasing reliance on external tools:


Brain-only group: strongest, most widespread connectivity.


Search Engine group: intermediate.


LLM group: weakest connectivity across alpha, beta, delta, and theta bands.




LLM use resulted in under-engagement of critical attention and visual processing networks, especially in Session 4 when participants tried to write without AI.



LLM Users Forget What They Just Wrote


In post-task interviews:


83.3% of LLM users were unable to quote even one sentence from the essay they had just written.


In contrast, 88.9% of Search and Brain-only users could quote accurately.




0% of LLM users could produce a correct quote, while most Brain-only and Search users could.



AI Use Disrupts Memory and Learning Pathways


Participants previously using LLMs (then writing without it in Session 4) showed:


Weaker memory recall


Lower alpha and beta neural engagement


Signs of cognitive adaptation toward passivity and “efficiency” at the cost of effortful learning.





LLM Users Felt Detached From Their Work


When asked about authorship:


LLM users gave responses like “50/50” or “70% mine.”


Some claimed no ownership at all.


Brain-only group participants almost universally reported full ownership.





Switching from LLM to Brain Use Doesn’t Fully Restore Function


Session 4: LLM-to-Brain participants showed lingering cognitive deficiency, failing to return to their original (Session 1) brain activity patterns.


Their neural activity remained below baseline, even after AI use was stopped.



Search Engine Users Showed Healthier Brain Engagement


Search users maintained stronger executive function, memory activation, and quote recall.


EEG data showed more robust occipital and parietal activation supporting visual processing and cognitive effort.



AI Dependency Leads to “Cognitive Offloading”


Researchers noted a trend toward neural efficiency adaptation: the brain essentially “lets go” of the effort required for synthesis and memory.


This adaptation led to passivity, minimal editing, and low integration of concepts.



Short-Term Gains, Long-Term Cognitive Debt


Despite receiving decent scores from judges, the LLM group’s writing:


Lacked strategic integration.


Used fewer diverse structures.


Was shorter and more robotic.




Over time, the group showed a consistent decline in engagement, performance, and self-reported satisfaction.



Based on this study, as more of the global population begins to rely on artificial intelligence to complete complex tasks, our cognitive abilities and creative capacities appear poised to take a nosedive into oblivion.
One thing is clear: if you currently use AI, take regular breaks—and give your own mind the chance to do the work. Otherwise, you may face severe cognitive harm and dependence.
The machines aren’t just taking over our work—they’re taking over our minds.

We introduce HunyuanWorld-Voyager, a novel video diffusion framework that generates world-consistent 3D point-cloud sequences from a single image with user-defined camera path. Voyager can generate 3D-consistent scene videos for world exploration following custom camera trajectories. It can also generate aligned depth and RGB video for efficient and direct 3D reconstruction.

☯️ HunyuanWorld-Voyager Introduction
Architecture
Voyager consists of two key components:
(1) World-Consistent Video Diffusion: A unified architecture that jointly generates aligned RGB and depth video sequences, conditioned on existing world observation to ensure global coherence.
(2) Long-Range World Exploration: An efficient world cache with point culling and an auto-regressive inference with smooth video sampling for iterative scene extension with context-aware consistency.
To train Voyager, we propose a scalable data engine, i.e., a video reconstruction pipeline that automates camera pose estimation and metric depth prediction for arbitrary videos, enabling large-scale, diverse training data curation without manual 3D annotations. Using this pipeline, we compile a dataset of over 100,000 video clips, combining real-world captures and synthetic Unreal Engine renders.

        VibeVoice is a novel framework designed for generating expressive, long-form, multi-speaker conversational audio, such as podcasts, from text. It addresses significant challenges in traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, particularly in scalability, speaker consistency, and natural turn-taking.
A core innovation of VibeVoice is its use of continuous speech tokenizers (Acoustic and Semantic) operating at an ultra-low frame rate of 7.5 Hz. These tokenizers efficiently preserve audio fidelity while significantly boosting computational efficiency for processing long sequences. VibeVoice employs a next-token diffusion framework, leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand textual context and dialogue flow, and a diffusion head to generate high-fidelity acoustic details.
The model can synthesize speech up to 90 minutes long with up to 4 distinct speakers, surpassing the typical 1-2 speaker limits of many prior models.

                Newsletter
            
                In April 2009, a Sega fan decided to look into emulating the Mega LD, a quirky and little-known hybrid of Genesis and LaserDisc. This week he finished the job.

            
                
                                
                            
                
                
            

                
        
    

        

        
            Hey there ROM readers! I've got an absolute whopper of a story this issue with a genuine longform dive into the emulation of the LaserActive, plus a bit of backstory on the new fan translation of the Cowboy Bebop game for PS2, plus your usual quick hits on emulator improvements, FPGA happenings and other fan translation progress. That means there's absolutely no more time or space to waste on this intro.LET'S GET TO IT.The Big Two1. The LaserActive "might be the last vintage home console of note which hadn't been emulated," but no longerThe story behind the birth of any new emulator has some common ingredients. Fearsome programming skills; hundreds or thousands of hours of thankless work; the drive to understand exactly how and why a piece of technology works. None of these things come without patience. But lifelong Sega fan Nemesis, who released the first-ever emulator for the Pioneer LaserActive this week — 16 years after first pondering the idea — had no choice but to be patient. Because for most of the last decade, emulating the LaserActive was simply impossible."All along the way, the video made things difficult," he says. "The hardware to capture the signal properly didn’t exist. The software to decode the captured signal properly didn’t exist. And finally, a format to store the decoded video in a form suitable for emulation, also didn’t exist."There's no other game console quite like the Pioneer LaserActive, which was released in 1993, sold abysmally and was dead in the ground by 1996. That's not a unique story for a '90s game system, but the LaserActive kinda... wasn't one. It was a LaserDisc player with an expansion bay that owners could slot different modules into. One transformed the LaserActive into a karaoke machine. Another would give it the guts of a PC Engine. And a third added the brains of a Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, able to play Sega CD games as well as about two dozen made for the short-lived Mega LD.The Mega LD format represented a technological leap over early LaserDisc-based arcade games like Dragon's Lair. The mid-'90s promise of FULL MOTION VIDEO GAMEPLAY may be quaint as hell today, but it's the reason the LaserActive has been impossible to emulate for 30 years. And it still would be today, if Nemesis hadn't spent much of the 21st century proactively collecting Sega hardware and Mega LD games with the goal of one day preserving them. Nemesis's history with both games and emulation started with the Genesis (which I will refer to as the Mega Drive for the rest of this issue, out of respect for his native Australia). After owning a Mega Drive, 32X and Mega CD growing up, he played his first emulator, the Nesticle successor Genecyst, on a Pentium 133 circa 1997. That eventually led to contributing to reverse-engineering and emulation efforts."I did a lot of work on the YM2612 FM chip in the Mega Drive back in 2008 in particular, and a lot of Mega Drive emulators finally had decent FM sound after that as a result," he says. "Sharing that research, seeing the results made use of, and finally hearing the games I remembered from my childhood sound right for the first time, was a really good feeling."In 2004, when buying loads of retro consoles was not yet a universal pasttime for nostalgic millenials and Gen Xers, he paid about $200 for one of the approximately 10,000 LaserActives that Pioneer manufactured in its short life, along with the Mega LD "PAC" module. Throughout the rest of the decade he scooped up every bit of Sega hardware he could get his hands on with an eye towards future reverse-engineering projects, but it wasn't until 2009 when he started thinking: Why isn't there an emulator for the LaserActive?So he did what any retro game fan would do in 2009: started a forum thread about it."This system keeps popping into my mind," he wrote in the thread, which is still online today. "I don't think anyone's had a serious crack at emulating it yet, and I really don't think it would be very hard to do."Well. About that."I honestly feel like I've nearly 'solved' this system half a dozen times over by now," Nemesis says here in 2025."The digital side of the system was actually pretty straightforward. When you break it down, the LaserActive is really more like a big oversized add-on to the console hardware. What that add-on provides is a different drive control interface, another audio source, and another video source, with mixing features to combine that video/audio with the console video/audio. That's really about it. On paper, it's pretty simple. In reality though, the LaserActive hardware did present a lot of challenges, mostly due to its inherent unreliability."1: "Some of the internal mods to the player. This was left over from when I was capturing the 8-bit composite video data, from when I was attempting my own capture efforts in 2016." 2: "The 'MegaLDRegEditor' program I wrote running on the LaserActive. This bootstraps the hardware from a flashcart, and allows me to edit the LaserActive registers live using a control pad. This is what I used to reverse engineer the hardware."With prior experience writing a Genesis emulator of his own, Nemesis originally thought he'd be well-positioned to tackle the LaserActive. But the problem started to pile up immediately. First there were the almost 100 capacitors in the Sega PAC that were guaranteed to fail at some point, causing many to have to be replaced on even a mint condition system. Pioneer's cost-cutting inside the LaserDisc player caused other parts to break, too. Learning to fix the LaserActive was a necessary step to figuring out how it worked.2011 was a year of progress. Nemesis: Coded a program to load onto a Mega Drive flash cart that allowed him to "probe" the LaserActive hardwareDisassembled the system BIOS to identify that "ll the interaction with the LaserActive hardware happened over a custom register block"Coded another program that allowed direct read/write access to those registers using a controllerWith the help of other forumites, mapped most of the registers by comparing the system's actions to the code in the disassembldd BIOS and documented what it was doingThe next two years were focused on figuring out how to rip the LaserActive's games. This involved writing multiple more custom programs and using a special USB-to-MD link cable to copy the digital data from the disc, which contained the game code as well as audio tracks. When that didn't prove to be enough to capture the TOC (or table of contents) data that essentially acted as a guide to how all the data on the disc was organized, he had to go deeper."I soldered a bunch of physical tapping wires into my Sega PAC-S10 module, and used a Saleae logic analyzer clone to do a streaming capture of the data lines when the TOC region was being read, which the hardware didn't make directly available. I wrote a program to parse the bus trace and extract the data from the raw capture and reconstruct the lead-in. At this point, I had everything I needed to rip a full bin/cue image of the digital data from a LaserDisc."In 2014, Nemesis started soliciting other members of the forum where he chronicled the project to send him Mega LD games to dump (shout out to doc eggfan, who acquired most of the library including two Myst prototypes; "if he hadn't done that, there's a good chance they would have been lost forever). With a pile of games in hand, he bought a PC video capture card to rip the audio and video from the discs. And this is where the 2-3 people reading this who have an intimate understanding of the LaserActive will probably reflexively say "uh oh."LaserDisc, despite looking like a jumbo DVD, is an analog video medium. No big deal if you're just capturing a movie. But for a game? Big big deal. Here's the long-form breakdown — skip ahead if you don't want to get way deep into analog-to-digital misery."No analog capture cards of the day were actually up to the task of what we were trying to do. ... The LaserActive has one of the fastest, most powerful control systems for LaserDisc playback ever made, and the game has direct, immediate control over it. Rarely is the player just playing back a video normally. Games will often have completely different video footage per field, with only one shown, or skip over every second frame, to mix four or more video streams in the same area of the disc. Many games use this for seamless 'branching' such as whether you go left or right, and this can change constantly and seamlessly during playback. The unit can play faster or slower, even playing in reverse, such as in Rocket Coaster as you speed up, or slide backwards down a slope. The unit can perform rapid nearly instant seeks with seamless looping, and does for games like Myst. In fact, the entire Myst title is basically using the LaserDisc as a set of random, short transitions, and still images, and other titles do this as well to differing degrees. ...Games used the skip play features to further interleave different video streams at half the framerate between each other. Analog capture cards of the day didn't deal with this well. None of them could compress lossless video, everything was encoded to lossy formats. Most of them would assume a 480i image. This would cause the separate video streams in each field to 'bleed into' each other, destroying the image. The same problem occurred between frames when they had separate video streams interleaved together, where inter-frame compression would cause artifacts from the two streams to bleed together.A high end Canopus capture card I had was the only one that was capable of compressing into huffyuv, not in a lossless form, but at least in a format that prevented this bleeding problem. Unfortunately, this card still had a limitation, in that it couldn't capture the VBI data. It was common in the day for special 'control codes' to be encoded into lines normally hidden on a normal TV, which contained information. In the case of LaserDiscs, it contained frame numbers, timecodes, picture stop codes, video TOC information in the lead-in, and other such data. None of that could be captured by capture cards of the day. For cards that had VBI capture features, they didn't work on LaserDiscs, since LaserDiscs used different lines/formats than other sources, and no capture cards in the world expected to be capturing LaserDisc video.At this point, I felt like I'd hit a bit of a dead end. It could, perhaps, have been possible to cobble something together at this point in 2014, but I felt the result would be poor, and the discs would not have been properly preserved. I decided a different approach was needed for the analog video content, but the technology to do what I needed to do at this point, didn't seem to exist."With an increasingly busy home life thanks to two young kids, a long commute and demanding workload at the office, Nemesis did the only thing that made sense at that point. He put the LaserActive on the shelf.Two years later, he took another stab at it by trying to build his own hardware capture setup. By tapping into the LaserActive directly, he was able to capture a full, raw composite video signal — but it was useless unless he could decode it. Back on the shelf it went for another two years.A house move, shorter commute and more balanced work-life, er, balance, later, Nemesis decided to dust off the LaserActive. Enter the Domesday Duplicator — an open source, community-driven hardware project dedicated to ripping LaserDiscs.Surely this was the capture solution he'd been waiting for. Turns out it was... but not in 2018. A key companion to the Domesday Duplicator, ld-decode, was then still "in its infancy." At the time there was no publicly available software solution to decoding composite video; by the time computers were fast enough to do it without dedicated hardware, analog was donezo. Nemesis went down the path of trying to write his own decoder to mixed results, but when he found out kid #4 was on the way, he decided to wait for the broader community effort to mature.And it did mature by a lot, with both the Duplicator and ld-decode improving process of ripping LaserDiscs in the higest possible quality. But there was still a problem when it came to LaserActive discs — they were interactive games, not static films. In 2020 Nemesis started chipping in to ld-decode:"I started pushing for the need to add extra features into the decode process. Until then, focus had been entirely around the requirements of capturing movies on LaserDiscs, as you'd expect. LaserActive games needed more though. I needed a way to capture the full lead-in, which stored the TOC data for both the analog video and the digital data. If you're just ripping a LaserDisc to an mp4, you don't need this info, but we do for emulation. I also needed the full 525 lines of NTSC video, with VBI data. That was stripped by ld-decode, they just cared about the visible region you'd see on a TV. I needed to deal with mixed-mode 'CD' images in the digital data track. They just needed audio tracks to work. I needed to be able to play through picture stop codes seamlessly without corrupting the audio data, they didn't need to worry about that. All kinds of things like this added up, to mean that ld-decode increasingly worked great for regular LaserDiscs, but still wasn't checking all the boxes for LaserActive games."Before he could fully commit to adding those features himself, COVID upended everything and the LaserActive went back into storage."This is from 2019, showing the old digital ripping process where I stream the data over the second control port."2024: 15 years after he'd first suggested emulating the LaserActive didn't seem like it'd be that tricky, set up in a new house with a new workspace, Nemesis finally vowed to finish what he'd started.It was a year of whirlwind activity: Using the LaserActive's test mode and a custom firmware mod he developed to properly capture the lead-in and lead-out from every discRewriting the flaky USB capture code for the Domesday Duplicator's capture program to ensure error-free ripsExpanding the program's capabilities to record more data about the disc itself, the player, and the signal qualityRewriting ld-decode's digital audio decoding, which had issues with drifting out of sync with the video, and finally making it possible to parse the TOC dataImproving the video decoding to output full frame data, with all 525 lines of NTSC video and the VBI data"With all these bits in place, I was now able to rip discs and extract the actual contents in a form suitable for emulation," Nemesis says. 2024 ticked over to 2025, and he began removing LaserActive games from the sleeves they'd rested within for decades undisturbed. Most of them had been bought new and never opened; for years he'd resisted the urge, not wanting to risk even a tiny accidental scratch until everything was ready.After so many years and so many obstacles, the final mile was, at long last, an easy run:"Most of the work reverse engineering the hardware I'd already done and published notes on over 13 years prior. I sat down and implemented the emulation code according to my notes, double checking things on the hardware as I went using the same testing program I'd written all those years ago, and filling the gaps in my notes for parts I hadn't fully mapped out. Space Berserker was quickly running, and after that, as more games finished decoding most of them worked on the first try, with no issues. Since I'd set out to emulate the complete hardware, with all its quirks and unusual features, whatever a game tried to do, it should just work. A few games flushed out some things I'd missed here and there, but mostly it was just fixing bugs in my implementation, until after a few weeks, everything was fully working in the emulator, just the same way it did on the hardware."Nemesis decided to write his LaserActive emulation as a component of multi-system emualtor Ares, partially out of respect for its late creator, Near. Its existing Mega Drive support made for an easy starting point, and current Ares maintainer Luke Usher had actually done some ground work to support the Mega LD in the future by creating a "skeleton" that defined it in relation to the Mega Drive and CD."It was all sitting there, just needed the actual code to be written to emulate the LaserActive hardware," Nemesis says. "I'd never touched the Ares code before, but having this delivered to me is what allowed me to get the basics of drive control to have Mega CD games booting in days, from work over a few evenings. Without that, there's a good chance I wouldn't have started when I did."There's one final wrinkle to LaserActive emulation, and that's the disc image files themselves. Basically, they're huge, in the dozens of gigabytes range. And that, again, is because the way LaserActive games utvi makes them allergic to compression. They may want to jump to specific frames in an instant, play backwards, or interleave frames, all of which means a specific moment in time needs to be a keyframe, not a compressed, modified frame that only contains the small amount of data that's changed from the frame before it, which is how video files are greatly reduced in size. You could still compress a LaserActive game to about 10GB per size with every frame preserved as a keyframe..."That still isn’t suitable though, as heavyweight video codecs are too intensive to decode alongside emulating an entire Mega Drive + MegaCD in realtime without involving hardware decoding," Nemesis says. "In order to keep everything running at 60fps, you have to be able to do everything in under 16ms per frame. Using hardware decoding would take decoding burden off the CPU, but the video mixing with the graphics output from the Mega Drive now becomes more complex, and you also now place specific GPU requirements on any system that’s going to try and play these games."So they stuck to a lossless format that preserves quality and takes the pressure off the CPU (and puts none at all on a graphics card). Any system that can currently run Ares should have no trouble with the LaserActive, with the caveat that you'll definitely want to have these mondo files on an SSD rather than an old spinning platter to avoid any issues with read speeds."This is a fully decoded single frame of video from one of the Myst prototypes. Normally for NTSC video, you'd expect two 'fields' each with half the lines of the full frame, which get interleaved together to make the whole image. For LaserActive titles, often two completely different video streams are stored in each field."Ares v146, released on August 26, marked the first time a Mega LD game has been playable on another system. And it represents a milestone in game preservation that could've easily been missed — due to indifference, the literal string of inventions it took to make it a reality, or the inexorable march of time. "There are other titles I don’t have access to at all, however I’m in discussions with a number of people who have offered to loan discs to help complete the dumping efforts," Nemesis says. "It’s been great to see people step up and offer to help. It’s vital this is done now, because Laserdisc titles don’t last forever. I have one disc in my possession that was a new, sealed copy, pressed in 1994, which is suffering from laser-rot. It’s likely that eventually, all Laserdiscs will be rendered unplayable, so we need to ensure these games are preserved now, while we still can."He's now looking into the prospect of preserving the PC Engine PAC, which will — fingers crossed — not be too much more complicated than plugging Ares' existing PC Engine CD code into the new LaserActive code. But that's a story for another day. For now, the emulation code being out in the wild represents relief most of all. "It was a long journey, with a lot of false starts and wrong turns getting to that point," Nemesis says. "A lot of it was work and time which nobody else had been able to see. I don't keep a blog. I don't tend to share the various steps I take to make something or get something working, I only tend to reach out when I have something to share or when I'm asking for help from other people."A lot of my time and energy had gone into this system over the years, and it was good to finally be able to show something for all that work."💸If you enjoy ROM, I'd love it if you'd consider a small tip to help me cover my monthly costs.

Let's kick the beat: a Cowboy Bebop video game in English at long lastIf there was any anime game you'd think had a sure shot at being released in English in the early 2000s, how could it be anything but Cowboy Bebop? The breakthrough "not every anime is Dragon Ball Z" series was a huge hit on Cartoon Network, channeled the American jazz of Art Blakey, and even saw a then-rare theatrical run for its movie spin-off. But neither its PlayStation 1 or PlayStation 2 games ever made it out of Japan.*Hard bop drum roll*...Until now! I'm delighted that translator Sonicman69, along with an anonymous hacker, has brought the PS2 beat 'em up Cowboy Bebop: Tsuioku no Serenade to English players to celebrate the game's 20th anniversary. Regular ROM readers may remember Sonicman69's translation of a Detective Conan PlayStation 2 game featured last year, both prime examples of a period when games based on popular anime were still far from a sure thing localization-wise.Well, for Conan that may unfortunately still be the case, as I don't know if the boy-sized genius has ever really made it in America. But I'm pretty sure a Cowboy Bebop game released in 2025 would be targeting English-speaking audiences even before Japanese ones. As I theorized earlier this week on PC Gamer, Tsuioku no Serenade's developer Bandai merging with Namco right around the time this game was being released may be the culprit — the ensuing corporate chaos of layoffs and reorganizations could easily have killed it in the cradle.I haven't had a chance to play Tsuioku no Serenade myself despite being lucky enough to track down a (seemingly somewhat rare, now) copy, but general consensus is it's an okay brawler but quite a nice little Bebop sidestory with some handsome late-era PS2 graphics. And there's original Yoko Kanno music, so, like, what else do you really want?I reached out to translator Sonicman69 for a bit of insight into the translation effort, who first watched Bebop around 2014 and learned later that the game had never been released in English. "From that exact moment I felt like I could be the one to do it," he said. "Keep in mind at this time I knew maybe three words in Japanese and was still in high school. Big expectations. I figured someone else would get around to it eventually."But they didn't, so after off-and-on attempts to learn Japanese and gaining some translation and editing experience contributing to the Conan patch, he set sights on Bebop with the aim of finishing the patch by the game's 20th anniversary:I'd say the most challenging thing that people don't really think about is how often text would be reused at different points in the game. Trying to figure out a translation for a sentence that works in one context that also has to work in another — Conan had this a little bit but it was a lot more annoying with Bebop and frankly I don't think I nailed it. Aside from that the interstitials between scenes are poetic and I'm still a Japanese novice and have no poetic ability at all so I had a tough time at those and I think they came out kind of bad.I am admittedly a little apologetic about the quality of the translation, I've received unanimous praise so far but I know I could have done better if I studied more but if I didn't translate the game now it would have never happened at all. What I'm most proud of aside from the fact we actually got it done and released it in time for the 20th anniversary? People keep telling me I did a good job writing the lines for the characters in a way that stays true to how they talked in the English dub of the show. I'm hesitant to accept that since I'm pretty critical of it myself but if I really was able to capture the characters then I did my job."Sonicman69 also argues that the game is "not a simple button mashing beat 'em up due to how deep the combat actually is," but some annoying tutorials and the language barrier made it easy to write off. Take it from the person who's beaten it a dozen times: it's worth playing. "As far as how well the story captures the vibe of the show I think they did a pretty admirable job, but obviously it's never going to get anywhere near the best scenes from the show. Any Bebop fan who wishes there was just a little bit more to chew on should at least enjoy the game a little bit. Especially the bonus mode you unlock after completing the game on normal but I don't want to spoil too much."You can find the English patch on Github and throw a few bucks to Sonicman69 on Ko-fi if you appreciate getting to spend a little more time in the Bebopverse after all these years.Patching InSometimes emudev is all about fixing a texture issue in Colin McRae Rally 2005 – I always try to look into random Github commits with names I don't understand to see what they're all about, and sometimes PCSX2 being update to "Handle texture shuffle with pixel reversals" is just about adding some code to ignore when a game is flipping pixels horizontally and then flipping them back again because it screwed things up. Specifically it screwed up the roads in Colin McRae Rally 2005, and seemingly only Colin McRae Rally 2005.bsnes updated with latest version of SameBoy – I think it's wonderful that Near's Super Nintendo emulator is still being maintained, and this is a nice update. bsnes uses an integrated version of SameBoy for accurate Super Game Boy emulation, but it was out of date with that emulator's continued development. No longer! All synced up.Deeply customizable PC emulator 86Box hits 5.0 – If you want to create a virtual PC down to the motherboard, sound card, and BIOS you had on the family PC back in like 1996, 86Box is your jam. And it's just gotten its first meaty release since September 2024, with version 5.0 including a lengthy list of additions and fixes plus "a preview for one of the most requested 86Box features of all time: an integrated machine manager to organize all your emulated setups." Other highlights: "much smoother" mouse input and display output on high refresh monitors; support for CRT emulation shader effects; new systems including some early Japanese PC-compatibles; and dark mode support on Windows.Core ReportCall me Mr. Turbo CD + Graphics – The MiSTer's PC Engine / Turbografx core just got a notable update with work from contributor David Shadoff that's been gestating for the last few months: support for CD+G, "a special audio CD that contains graphics data in addition to the audio data on the disc," according to Sega Retro. "The disc can be played on a regular audio CD player, but when played on a special CD+G player, can also output a graphics signal. CD+G is most commonly seen used for karaoke and slideshows."The MiSTer's Commodore 64 core now also notably supports writing to Easyflash carts and "Waterloo Structured BASIC and BMP-Data Turbo 2000."Surprise! (Attack) – Jotego dropped a core for this Konami arcade sidescroller for MiSTer and Analogue Pocket this week, along with a bit of deserved braggadocio about nailing some specific graphic effects that aren't correctly emulated in MAME. Sweat those details! Also, I'd just like to point out that Surprise Attack has some absolutely sick flyer artwork.Surprise Attack lands on #MiSTerFPGA and #PocketFPGA with the correct transparency effect implemented.

Translation StationSword & Sorcery & English – You might think Bebop would be a big enough deal that the Translation Station could take the rest of the week off, but nope — trains are still runnin'! Hit the link for a making-of at great fansite Sega Saturn Shiro from one of the contributors to this project for the 1996 JRPG. Note that it's an in-progress patch, rather than a finished one you'll want to leap to play right now; this is more of a "get excited" mention (and a fun read) which I'll no doubt circle back to in the future.Psychic Killer, Fa-fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa-fa – It's a Shiro two-fer this week! This translation of Psychic Killer Taromaru is a 1.0 you can grab on Github and was cranked out in just a month using Saturn emulator Yaba Sanshiro. It's a sidescrilling action game in which you, a ninja, "fire psychic energy at demons to save a kidnapped girl in feudal Japan," says Shiro. The translation was inspired by this video from Dungeon Chill, who called it a hidden gem. Well, it ain't hidden anymore. You can see it right here. Not very subtle, ninja.If you ever wanted to play Clock Tower on the WonderSwan... – Then here's a translation for you. This patch ports the Aeon Genesis team's translation over to the WonderSwan release of the original Super Nintendo horror game. Maybe it's scarier in low-res black and white?Good pixelsEnough already! We're done.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
		
The rapid deployment of large language models (LLMs) has introduced significant security vulnerabilities due to misconfigurations and inadequate access controls. This paper presents a systematic approach to identifying publicly exposed LLM servers, focusing on instances running the Ollama framework. Utilizing Shodan, a search engine for internet-connected devices, we developed a Python-based tool to detect unsecured LLM endpoints. Our study uncovered over 1,100 exposed Ollama servers, with approximately 20% actively hosting models susceptible to unauthorized access. These findings highlight the urgent need for security baselines in LLM deployments and provide a practical foundation for future research into LLM threat surface monitoring.



Introduction



The integration of large language models (LLMs) into diverse applications has surged in recent years, driven by their advanced capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. Widely adopted platforms such as ChatGPT, Grok, and DeepSeek have contributed to the mainstream visibility of LLMs, while open-source frameworks like Ollama and Hugging Face have significantly lowered the barrier to entry for deploying these models in custom environments. This has led to widespread adoption by both organizations and individuals of a broad range of tasks, including content generation, customer support, data analysis, and software development.



Despite their growing utility, the pace of LLM adoption has often outstripped the development and implementation of appropriate security practices. Many self-hosted or locally deployed LLM solutions are brought online without adequate hardening, frequently exposing endpoints due to default configurations, weak or absent authentication, and insufficient network isolation. These vulnerabilities are not only a byproduct of poor deployment hygiene but are also symptomatic of an ecosystem that has largely prioritized accessibility and performance over security. As a result, improperly secured LLM instances present an expanding attack surface, opening the door to risks such as:




Unauthorized API Access — Many ML servers operate without authentication, allowing anyone to submit queries.



Model Extraction Attacks — Attackers can reconstruct model parameters by querying an exposed ML server repeatedly.



Jailbreaking and Content Abuse — LLMs like GPT-4, LLaMA, and Mistral can by manipulated to generate restricted content, including misinformation, malware code, or harmful outputs.



Resource Hijacking (ML DoS Attacks) — Open AI models can be exploited for free computation, leading to excessive costs for the host.



Backdoor Injection and Model Poisoning — Adversaries could exploit unsecured model endpoints to introduce malicious payloads or load untrusted models remotely.




This work investigates the prevalence and security posture of publicly accessible LLM servers, with a focus on instances utilizing the Ollama framework, which has gained popularity for its ease of use and local deployment capabilities. While Ollama enables flexible experimentation and local model execution, its deployment defaults and documentation do not explicitly emphasize security best practices, making it a compelling target for analysis.



To assess the real-world implications of these concerns, we leverage the Shodan search engine to identify exposed Ollama servers and evaluate their security configurations. Our investigation is guided by three primary contributions:




Development of a proof-of-concept tool, written in Python, to detect exposed Ollama servers through Shodan queries



Analysis of identified instances evaluate authentication enforcement, endpoint exposure, and model accessibility



Recommendations for mitigating common vulnerabilities in LLM deployments, with a focus on practical security improvements




Our findings reveal that a significant number of organizations and individuals expose their LLM infrastructure to the internet, often without realizing the implications. This creates avenues for misuse, ranging from resource exploitation to malicious prompt injection and data inference.



Methodology



The proposed system utilizes Shodan, a search engine that indexes internet-connected devices, to identify potentially vulnerable AI inference servers. This approach was selected with privacy and ethical considerations in mind, specifically to avoid the risks associated with directly scanning remote systems that may already be exposed or improperly secured. By relying on Shodan’s existing database of indexed endpoints, the system circumvents the need for active probing, thereby reducing the likelihood of triggering intrusion detection systems or violating acceptable use policies.



In addition to being more ethical, leveraging Shodan also provides a scalable and efficient mechanism for identifying LLM deployments accessible over the public internet. Manual enumeration or brute-force scanning of IP address ranges would be significantly more resource-intensive and potentially problematic from both legal and operational perspectives.



The system operates in two sequential stages. In the first stage, Shodan is queried to identify publicly accessible Ollama servers based on distinctive network signatures or banners. In the second stage, each identified endpoint is programmatically queried to assess its security posture, with a particular focus on authentication and authorization mechanisms. This includes evaluating whether endpoints require credentials, enforce access control, or expose model metadata and functionality without restriction.



An overview of the system architecture is illustrated in Figure 1, which outlines the workflow from endpoint discovery to vulnerability analysis.







Fig. 1: Design of LLM vulnerability checker










Our approach focuses on identifying deployments of popular LLM hosting tools by scanning for default ports and service banners associated with each implementation. Below we provide a list of LLM platforms examined and their associated default ports, which are used as heuristics for identification:




Ollama / Mistral / LLaMA models — Port 11434



vLLM — Port 8000



llama.cpp — Ports 8000, 8080



LM Studio — Port 1234



GPT4All — Port 4891



LangChain — Port 8000




Using the Shodan API, the system retrieves metadata for hosts operating on these ports, including IP addresses, open ports, HTTP headers, and service banners. To minimize false positives, such as unrelated applications using the same ports, the developed system performs an additional filtering step based on banner content. For example, Ollama instances are verified using keyword matching against the service banner (e.g., port:11434 “Ollama”), which increases confidence that the endpoint is associated with the targeted LLM tooling rather than an unrelated application using the same port.



During analysis, we identified an additional signature that enhanced the accuracy of fingerprinting Ollama deployments. Specifically, a significant proportion of the discovered Ollama instances were found to be running the Uvicorn ASGI server, a lightweight, Python-based web server commonly employed for serving asynchronous APIs. In such cases, the HTTP response headers included the field Server: “uvicorn”, which functioned as a valuable secondary indicator, particularly when the service banner lacked an explicit reference to the Ollama platform. Conversely, our research also indicates that servers running Uvicorn are more likely to host LLM applications as this Python-based web server appears to be popular among software used for self-hosting LLMs.



This observation strengthens the resilience of our detection methodology by enabling the inference of Ollama deployments even in the absence of direct product identifiers. Given Uvicorn’s widespread use in Python-based microservice architectures and AI inference backends, its presence, especially when correlated with known Ollama-specific ports (e.g., 11434) substantially increases the confidence level that a host is serving an LLM-related application. A layered fingerprinting approach improves the precision of our system and reduces reliance on single-point identifiers that may be obfuscated or omitted.



The banner-based fingerprinting method draws from established principles in network reconnaissance and is a widely accepted approach in both academic research and penetration testing contexts. According to prior work in internet-wide scanning, service banners and default ports provide a reliable mechanism for characterizing software deployments at scale, albeit with limitations in environments employing obfuscation or non-standard configurations.



By combining port-based filtering with banner analysis and keyword validation, our system aims to strike a balance between recall and precision in identifying genuinely exposed LLM servers, thus enabling accurate and responsible vulnerability assessment.

Authorization and Authentication Assessment



Once a potentially vulnerable Ollama server is identified, we initiate a series of automated API queries to determine whether access controls are in place and whether the server responds deterministically to standardized test inputs. This evaluation specifically assesses the presence or absence of authentication enforcement and the model’s responsiveness to benign prompt injections, thereby providing insight into the system’s exposure to unauthorized use. To minimize operational risk and ensure ethical testing standards, we employ a minimal, non-invasive prompt structure as follows:



A successful HTTP 200 response accompanied by the correct result (e.g., “4”) indicates that the server is accepting and executing prompts without requiring authentication. This represents a high-severity security issue, as it suggests that arbitrary, unauthenticated prompt execution is possible. In such cases, the system is exposed to a broad range of attack vectors, including the deployment and execution of unauthorized models, prompt injection attacks, and the deletion or modification of existing assets.



Moreover, unprotected endpoints may be subjected to automated fuzzing or adversarial testing using tools such as Promptfoo or Garak, which are designed to probe LLMs for unexpected behavior or latent vulnerabilities. These tools, when directed at unsecured instances, can systematically uncover unsafe model responses, prompt leakage, or unintended completions that may compromise the integrity or confidentiality of the system.



Conversely, HTTP status codes 401 (Unauthorized) or 403 (Forbidden) denote that access controls are at least partially enforced, often through default authentication mechanisms. While such configurations do not guarantee full protection, particularly against brute-force or misconfiguration exploits, they substantially reduce the immediate risk of casual or opportunistic exploitation. Nonetheless, even authenticated instances require scrutiny to ensure proper isolation, rate limiting, and audit logging, as part of a comprehensive security posture.



Findings



The results from our scans confirmed the initial hypothesis: a significant number of Ollama servers are publicly exposed and vulnerable to unauthorized prompt injection. Utilizing an automated scanning tool in conjunction with Shodan, we identified 1,139 vulnerable Ollama instances. Notably, the discovery rate was highest in the initial phase of scanning, with over 1,000 instances detected within the first 10 minutes, highlighting the widespread and largely unmitigated nature of this exposure.



Geospatial analysis of the identified servers revealed a concentration of vulnerabilities in several major regions. As depicted in Figure 3, the majority of exposed servers were hosted in the United States (36.6%), followed by China (22.5%) and Germany (8.9%). To protect the integrity and privacy of affected entities, IP addresses have been redacted in all visual documentation of the findings.







Fig. 3: Tool findings on exposed LLM Server Analysis






Out of the 1,139 exposed servers, 214 were found to be actively hosting and responding to requests with live models—accounting for approximately 18.8% of the total scanned population with Mistral and LLaMA representing the most frequently encountered deployments. A review of the least common model names was also conducted, revealing what appeared to be primarily self-trained or otherwise customized LLMs. In some instances, the names alone provided enough information to identify the hosting party. To safeguard their privacy, tha names of these models have been excluded from the findings. These interactions confirm the feasibility of prompt-based interaction without authentication, and thus the risk of exploitation.



Conversely, the remaining 80% of detected servers, while reachable via unauthenticated interfaces, did not have any models instantiated. These “dormant” servers, though not actively serving model responses, remain susceptible to exploitation via unauthorized model uploads or configuration manipulation. Importantly, their exposed interfaces could still be leveraged in attacks involving resource exhaustion, denial of service, or lateral movement.



An additional observation was the widespread adoption of OpenAI-compatible API schemas across disparate model hosting platforms. Among the discovered endpoints, 88.89% adhered to the standardized route structure used by OpenAI (e.g., v1/chat/completions), enabling simplified interoperability but also creating uniformity that could be exploited by automated attack frameworks. This API-level homogeneity facilitates the rapid development and deployment of malicious tooling capable of interacting with multiple LLM providers with minimal modification.



These findings showcase a critical and systemic vulnerability in the deployment of LLM infrastructure. The ease with which these servers can be located, fingerprinted, and interacted with raises urgent concerns regarding operational security, access control defaults, and the potential for widespread misuse in the absence of robust authentication and model access restrictions.



Limitations



While the proposed system effectively identified a substantial number of exposed Ollama servers, several limitations should be acknowledged that may impact the completeness and accuracy of the results.



First, the detection process is inherently limited by Shodan’s scanning coverage and indexing frequency. Only servers already discovered and cataloged by Shodan can be analyzed, meaning any hosts outside its visibility, due to firewalls, opt-out policies, or geographical constraints remain undetected.



Secondly, the system relies on Shodan’s fingerprinting accuracy. If Ollama instances are configured with custom headers, reverse proxies, or stripped HTTP metadata, they may not be correctly classified by Shodan, leading to potential false negatives.



Third, the approach targets default and commonly used ports (e.g., 11434), which introduces a bias toward standard configurations. Servers running on non-standard or intentionally obfuscated ports are likely to evade detection entirely.



Finally, the analysis focuses exclusively on Ollama deployments and does not extend to other LLM hosting frameworks. While this specialization enhances precision within a narrow scope, it limits generalizability across the broader LLM infrastructure landscape.



Mitigation Strategies



The widespread exposure of unauthenticated Ollama servers highlights the urgent need for standardized, practical, and layered mitigation strategies aimed at securing LLM infrastructure. Below, we propose a set of technical and procedural defenses, grounded in best practices and supported by existing tools and frameworks.



Enforce Authentication and Access Control



The most critical step in mitigating unauthorized access is the implementation of robust authentication mechanisms. Ollama instances, and LLM servers in general, should never be publicly exposed without requiring secure API key-based or token-based authentication. Preferably, authentication should be tied to role-based access control (RBAC) systems to limit the scope of what users can do once authenticated.




Recommendation: Enforce API key or OAuth2-based authentication



Tools/References: OAuth 2.0 Framework OWASP API Security Top 10




Network Segmentation and Firewalling



Publicly exposing inference endpoints over the internet, particularly on default ports, dramatically increases the likelihood of being indexed by services like Shodan. LLM endpoints should be deployed behind network-level access controls, such as firewalls, VPCs, or reverse proxies, and restricted to trusted IP ranges or VPNs.




Recommendation: Use security groups, firewalls, and private subnets to isolate LLM services



Tools/References: AWS Security Best Practices, Zero Trust Architecture




Rate Limiting and Abuse Detection



To prevent automated abuse and model probing, inference endpoints should implement rate limiting, throttling, and logging mechanisms. This can hinder brute-force attacks, prompt injection attempts, or resource hijacking.




Recommendation: Integrate API gateways (e.g., Kong, Amazon API Gateway) to enforce limits and monitor anomalous behavior



Tools/References: OWASP Rate Limiting Guide, Grafana for Monitoring




Disable Default Ports and Obfuscate Service Banners



Default ports (e.g., 11434 for Ollama) make fingerprinting trivial. To complicate scanning efforts, operators should consider changing default ports and disabling verbose service banners in HTTP responses or headers (e.g., removing “uvicorn” or “Ollama” identifiers).




Recommendation: Modify default configurations to suppress identifiable metadata



Tools/References: Nginx reverse proxy configuration, systemd hardening




Secure Model Upload and Execution Pipelines



Ollama and similar tools support dynamic model uploads, which, if unsecured, present a vector for model poisoning or backdoor injection. Model upload functionality should be restricted, authenticated, and ideally audited. All models should be validated against a hash or verified origin before execution.




Recommendation: Use content whitelisting, digital signatures, or harsh verification for uploaded models



Tools/References: Model Card Toolkit, Secure Supply Chain principles from SLSA




Continuous Monitoring and Automated Exposure Audits



Operators should implement continuous monitoring tools that alert when LLM endpoints become publicly accessible, misconfigured, or lack authentication. Scheduled Shodan queries or custom scanners can help detect regressions in deployment security.




Recommendation: Use automated tools like Project Discovery’s naabu, or write custom Shodan monitoring scripts



Tools/References: Project Discovery Tools, Shodan Alert API




Conclusion



This study reveals a concerning landscape of insecure large language model deployments, with a particular focus on Ollama-based servers exposed to the public internet. Through the use of Shodan and a purpose-built detection tool, we identified over 1,100 unauthenticated LLM servers, a substantial proportion of which were actively hosting vulnerable models. These findings highlight a widespread neglect of fundamental security practices such as access control, authentication, and network isolation in the deployment of AI systems.



The uniform adoption of OpenAI-compatible APIs further exacerbates the issue, enabling attackers to scale exploit attempts across platforms with minimal adaptation. While only a subset of the exposed servers were found to be actively serving models, the broader risk posed by dormant yet accessible endpoints cannot be understated. Such infrastructure remains vulnerable to abuse through unauthorized model execution, prompt injection, and resource hijacking. Our work underscores the urgent need for standardized security baselines, automated auditing tools, and improved deployment guidance for LLM infrastructure.



Looking ahead, future work should explore the integration of multiple data sources, including Censys, ZoomEye, and custom Nmap-based scanners to improve discovery accuracy and reduce dependency on a single platform. Additionally, incorporating adaptive fingerprinting and active probing techniques could enhance detection capabilities in cases where servers use obfuscation or non-standard configurations. Expanding the system to identify deployments across a wider range of LLM hosting frameworks, such as Hugging Face, Triton, and vLLM, would further increase coverage and relevance. Finally, non-standard port detection and adversarial prompt analysis offer promising avenues for refining the system’s ability to detect and characterize hidden or evasive LLM deployments in real-world environments.

    Some memory corruption bugs are much harder to exploit than others. They can involve race conditions, crash the system, and impose limitations that make a researcher's life difficult. Working with such fragile vulnerabilities demands significant time and effort. CVE-2024-50264 in the Linux kernel is one such hard bug, which received the Pwnie Award 2025 as the Best Privilege Escalation. In this article, I introduce my personal project kernel-hack-drill and show how it helped me to exploit CVE-2024-50264.

Bug collision story

I first found a bug in AF_VSOCK back in 2021 and published the article Four Bytes of Power: Exploiting CVE-2021-26708 in the Linux kernel. In April 2024, I was fuzzing this kernel subsystem with a customized syzkaller and found another crash in AF_VSOCK. I minimized the crash reproducer and disabled KASAN. This resulted in an immediate null-ptr-deref in a kernel worker (kworker). Convinced the path forward would be painful, I shelved the bug. This was a wrong decision.

Later, in autumn 2024, I decided to look at this bug again and got promising results. Then, one calm evening, I realized I'd collided with Hyunwoo Kim (@v4bel) and Wongi Lee (@qwerty): they'd already disclosed the bug as CVE-2024-50264 and used it at kernelCTF. Their patch turned my PoC exploit into a null-ptr-deref:




Anyone who has dealt with a bug collision can imagine what I felt. I was wondering whether to keep digging into this vulnerability or just give it up.

Viktor Vasnetsov: Vityaz at the Crossroads (1882)


The exploit strategy by @v4bel and @qwerty looked very complicated. I had other ideas, so I decided to continue my research. I chose Ubuntu Server 24.04 with a fresh OEM/HWE kernel (v6.11) as the target for my PoC exploit.

CVE-2024-50264 analysis

The vulnerability CVE-2024-50264 was introduced in August 2016 by commit 06a8fc78367d in Linux v4.8. It is a race condition in AF_VSOCK sockets that happens between the connect() system call and a POSIX signals, resulting in a use-after-free (UAF). An unprivileged user can trigger this bug without user namespaces, which makes it more dangerous.

The kernel uses a freed virtio_vsock_sock object. Its size is 80 bytes, which is suitable for the kmalloc-96 slab cache. The memory corruption is a UAF write executed by a kernel worker.

However, this vulnerability also brings a bunch of nasty limitations for exploitation. I can say that it's the worst bug to exploit I've ever seen. The Pwnie Award is well-deserved. I'll outline those constraints shortly.

Reproducing the bug using an "immortal signal"

First, an attacker should create a listening virtual socket (server vsock):
int ret = -1;
int vsock1 = 0;

vsock1 = socket(AF_VSOCK, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
if (vsock1 < 0)
	err_exit("[-] creating vsock");

ret = bind(vsock1, (struct sockaddr *)&addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_vm));
if (ret != 0)
	err_exit("[-] binding vsock");

ret = listen(vsock1, 0); /* backlog = 0 */
if (ret != 0)
	err_exit("[-] listening vsock");


Then the attacker should try to open a connection from a client vsock:
#define UAF_PORT 0x2712

int vsock2 = 0;
struct sockaddr_vm addr = {
	.svm_family = AF_VSOCK,
	.svm_port = UAF_PORT,
	.svm_cid = VMADDR_CID_LOCAL
};

vsock2 = socket(AF_VSOCK, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
if (vsock2 < 0)
	err_exit("[-] creating vsock");

ret = connect(vsock2, (struct sockaddr *)&addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_vm));


To trigger the bug, the attacker should interrupt this connect() system call with a POSIX signal. @v4bel & @qwerty used SIGKILL, but that kills the exploit process. My fuzzer stumbled on a cleaner trick that surprised me:

struct sigevent sev = {};
timer_t race_timer = 0;

sev.sigev_notify = SIGEV_SIGNAL;
sev.sigev_signo = 33;
ret = timer_create(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &sev, &race_timer);


My fuzzer discovered that a timer can fire signal 33 and interrupt connect(). Signal 33 is special. The Native POSIX Threads Library (NPTL) keeps it for internal work and the operating system quietly shields applications from it. As man 7 nptl explains:


  NPTL makes internal use of the first two real-time signals (signal numbers 32 and 33).
One of these signals is used to support thread cancellation and POSIX timers (see timer_create(2));
the other is used as part of a mechanism that ensures all threads in a process always have
the same UIDs and GIDs, as required by POSIX. These signals cannot be used in applications.


True, these signals cannot be used in applications, but they are perfect for my exploit 😉




I use timer_settime() for race_timer, which lets me choose the exact moment signal 33 interrupts connect(). Moreover, the signal is invisible to the exploit process and doesn't kill it.

About memory corruption

The race condition succeeds when a signal interrupts the connect() system call while the vulnerable socket is in the TCP_ESTABLISHED state. The socket then drops into the TCP_CLOSING state:

if (signal_pending(current)) {
	err = sock_intr_errno(timeout);
	sk->sk_state = sk->sk_state == TCP_ESTABLISHED ? TCP_CLOSING : TCP_CLOSE;
	sock->state = SS_UNCONNECTED;
	vsock_transport_cancel_pkt(vsk);
	vsock_remove_connected(vsk);
	goto out_wait;
}


The second attempt to connect the vulnerable vsock to the server vsock using a different svm_cid (VMADDR_CID_HYPERVISOR) provokes memory corruption.

struct sockaddr_vm addr = {
	.svm_family = AF_VSOCK,
	.svm_port = UAF_PORT,
	.svm_cid = VMADDR_CID_HYPERVISOR
};

/* this connect will schedule the kernel worker performing UAF */
ret = connect(vsock2, (struct sockaddr *)&addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_vm));


Under the hood, the connect() system call executes vsock_assign_transport(). This function switches the virtual socket to the new svm_cid transport and frees the resources tied to the previous vsock transport:
if (vsk->transport) {
	if (vsk->transport == new_transport)
		return 0;

	/* transport->release() must be called with sock lock acquired.
	 * This path can only be taken during vsock_connect(), where we
	 * have already held the sock lock. In the other cases, this
	 * function is called on a new socket which is not assigned to
	 * any transport.
	 */
	vsk->transport->release(vsk);
	vsock_deassign_transport(vsk);
}


This procedure closes the old vsock transport in virtio_transport_close() and frees the virtio_vsock_sock object in virtio_transport_destruct(). However, due to the erroneous TCP_CLOSING state of the socket, virtio_transport_close() initiates further communication. To handle that activity, the kernel schedules a kworker that eventually calls virtio_transport_space_update(), which operates on the freed structure:

static bool virtio_transport_space_update(struct sock *sk, struct sk_buff *skb)
{
	struct virtio_vsock_hdr *hdr = virtio_vsock_hdr(skb);
	struct vsock_sock *vsk = vsock_sk(sk);
	struct virtio_vsock_sock *vvs = vsk->trans; /* ptr to freed object */
	bool space_available;

	if (!vvs)
		return true;

	spin_lock_bh(&vvs->tx_lock); /* proceed if 4 bytes are zero (UAF write non-zero to lock) */
	vvs->peer_buf_alloc = le32_to_cpu(hdr->buf_alloc); /* UAF write 4 bytes */
	vvs->peer_fwd_cnt = le32_to_cpu(hdr->fwd_cnt); /* UAF write 4 bytes */
	space_available = virtio_transport_has_space(vsk); /* UAF read, not interesting */
	spin_unlock_bh(&vvs->tx_lock); /* UAF write, restore 4 zero bytes */
	return space_available;
}


The following diagram shows the layout of the UAF in the vulnerable object:




Here in yellow I show the tx_lock field that must be zero. Otherwise, the kernel hangs while trying to acquire the spinlock. In red I show the peer_buf_alloc and peer_fwd_cnt fields that are overwritten after the object is freed. There is no pointer dereference in the freed object.

The value written to virtio_vsock_sock.peer_buf_alloc can be controlled from the userspace:

/* Increase the range for the value that we want to write during UAF: */
uaf_val_limit = 0x1lu; /* can't be zero */
setsockopt(vsock1, PF_VSOCK, SO_VM_SOCKETS_BUFFER_MIN_SIZE,
           &uaf_val_limit, sizeof(uaf_val_limit));
uaf_val_limit = 0xfffffffflu;
setsockopt(vsock1, PF_VSOCK, SO_VM_SOCKETS_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE,
           &uaf_val_limit, sizeof(uaf_val_limit));

/* Set the 4-byte value that we want to write during UAF: */
setsockopt(vsock1, PF_VSOCK, SO_VM_SOCKETS_BUFFER_SIZE,
           &uaf_val, sizeof(uaf_val));


The field virtio_vsock_sock.peer_fwd_cnt tracks how many bytes have been pushed through vsock using sendmsg()/recvmsg(). It is zero by default (four zero bytes).

Not so fast. CVE-2024-50264 has limitations

As I mentioned earlier, this vulnerability has a lot of nasty limitations for the exploitation:


  The vulnerable virtio_vsock_sock client object is allocated together with the server object from the same slab cache. That disturbs cross-cache attacks.
  Reproducing this race condition is very unstable.
  The UAF write occurs in a kworker a few microseconds after kfree(), too quickly for typical cross-cache attacks.
  A null-ptr-deref in the kworker follows the UAF write. That's why I shelved the bug at first.
  Even if that kernel oops is avoided, another null-ptr-deref occurs in the kworker after VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT (eight seconds).
  The kworker hangs in spin_lock_bh() if virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock is not zero, as noted above.


I uncovered each obstacle one by one while developing the PoC exploit for CVE-2024-50264. It remains the worst bug to exploit I've ever seen. I guess that's why it received the Pwnie Award 2025 as the Best Privilege Escalation.




First thoughts on exploit strategy

The exploit strategy by @v4bel and @qwerty was complex:


  A large-scale BPF JIT spray that filled a significant portion of physical memory
  The SLUBStick technique from Graz University of Technology, which allowed to:
    
      Determine the number of objects in the active slab using a timing side channel
      Then, place the client and server virtio_vsock_sock objects in different slabs, landing one at the end of its slab and the other at the start of the next slab
    
  
  The Dirty Pagetable technique, which allowed to use the UAF object for overwriting a page table entry (PTE)
  Modifying a PTE to make it possibly point to a BPF JIT region
  Inserting a privilege-escalation payload into the BPF code
  Communicating via a socket to execute the privilege-escalation payload.





I felt I could make the PoC exploit for CVE-2024-50264 much simpler. My first thought was to steer the UAF write into some victim object and build a useful exploit primitive around it.

I decided not to search victim objects inside the kmalloc-96 slab cache. Ubuntu Server 24.04 ships with kconfig options that neutralize naive heap spraying for UAF exploitation:

  CONFIG_SLAB_BUCKETS=y, which creates a set of separate slab caches for allocations with user-controlled data
  CONFIG_RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES=y. Here's a quote from the kernel documentation about it:
    
      It is a hardening feature that creates multiple copies of slab caches for normal kmalloc allocation and makes kmalloc randomly pick one based on code address, which makes the attackers more difficult to spray vulnerable memory objects on the heap for the purpose of exploiting memory vulnerabilities.
    
  


That's why I decided to perform the cross-cache attack anyway.

The first victim object I decided to try was struct cred. Its size is 184 bytes, and the kernel allocates these objects in slabs of size 192 bytes. That would allow only two possible offsets of the UAF in the victim cred, because slabs for the vulnerable virtio_vsock_sock have size 96 bytes (half of 192). The diagram below shows how two vulnerable virtio_vsock_sock objects overlap the cred object. The memory corruption may happen on one of the virtio_vsock_sock objects.




Unfortunately, struct cred reallocated at the place of the freed virtio_vsock_sock objects doesn't provide anything useful for the attacker:

  If the UAF happened on the first virtio_vsock_sock, the kernel would hang in spin_lock_bh(), because cred has a non-null uid value at the place of virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock.
  If the UAF happened on the second virtio_vsock_sock, writing controlled data to virtio_vsock_sock.peer_buf_alloc would corrupt the cred.request_key_auth pointer. I had no idea how to use it without a prior infoleak.


The cred object didn't work for me, so I started to search for the next candidate. My next victim object for the memory corruption was msg_msg. I like this object: I first used it for heap spraying in 2021 (you can find the details in the article "Four Bytes of Power: Exploiting CVE-2021-26708 in the Linux kernel").

It was a novel approach back then. This time, I set out to create something new again.

I chose a 96-byte msg_msg because the slab allocator would use slabs of the same size for this msg_msg and virtio_vsock_sock. That would allow the UAF write to land at a fixed offset in the victim msg_msg object. The following diagram shows what happens with the msg_msg object allocated at the place of the freed virtio_vsock_sock:




The msg_msg.m_list.prev is the kernelspace pointer to the previous object in the linked list. This pointer is zero when msg_msg is created (see CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON) and then it is initialized with a non-null value when msg_msg is inserted into the message queue. Unfortunately, this non-null pointer is interpreted as virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock. That makes the virtio_transport_space_update() function hang while executing spin_lock_bh().

To bypass this restriction, I needed the kernel to initialize msg_msg.m_list.prev after the UAF write. I looked for a way to postpone placing msg_msg in the message queue and eventually found the solution.

msg_msg spray allowing m_list field corruption (novel technique)


  I filled the message queue almost completely before sending the target msg_msg.
    
      The message queue size is MSGMNB=16384 bytes.
      I sent 2 clogging messages of 8191 bytes each without calling the msgrcv() syscall.
      Only 2 bytes were left in the queue.
      I used mtype = 1 for these messages.
    
  
  Then I performed spraying by calling msgsnd() for the target msg_msg objects.
    
      I called the msgsnd() syscall in separate pthreads and used mtype = 2 for these messages to distinguish them from the clogging messages.
      The kernel allocates target msg_msg and then blocks msgsnd() in ipc/msg.c while it waits for space in the message queue:
    

     	if (msg_fits_inqueue(msq, msgsz))
 		break;
    
 	/* queue full, wait: */
 	if (msgflg & IPC_NOWAIT) {
 		err = -EAGAIN;
 		goto out_unlock0;
 	}
    
 	/* enqueue the sender and prepare to block */
 	ss_add(msq, &s, msgsz);
    
 	if (!ipc_rcu_getref(&msq->q_perm)) {
 		err = -EIDRM;
 		goto out_unlock0;
 	}
    
 	ipc_unlock_object(&msq->q_perm);
 	rcu_read_unlock();
 	schedule();


    
    
  
  
    While the msgsnd() syscalls were waiting for space in the message queue, I performed the UAF write corrupting the m_list, m_type, and m_ts fields of one of the target msg_msg objects.
  
  
    After the UAF write, I called msgrcv() for type 1 clogging messages.
  
  Then the blocked msgsnd() syscall woke up to add the sprayed msg_msg to the queue and the kernel fixed the corrupted m_list field:
     	if (!pipelined_send(msq, msg, &wake_q)) {
 		/* no one is waiting for this message, enqueue it */
 		list_add_tail(&msg->m_list, &msq->q_messages);
 		msq->q_cbytes += msgsz;
 		msq->q_qnum++;
 		percpu_counter_add_local(&ns->percpu_msg_bytes, msgsz);
 		percpu_counter_add_local(&ns->percpu_msg_hdrs, 1);
 	}

  


Cool! This technique is also useful for blind overwriting of msg_msg using the out-of-bounds write. No kernel infoleak is needed. The kernel restores the corrupted m_list pointers. In my particular case, this approach allowed me to avoid virtio_transport_space_update() hanging in spin_lock_bh():




To implement the UAF write into an msg_msg object, I needed to perform cross-cache attack turning virtio_vsock_sock into msg_msg. On Ubuntu Server 24.04, the virtio_vsock_sock objects live in one of 16 kmalloc-rnd-?-96 slab caches enabled by CONFIG_RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES. The msg_msg objects live in a dedicated msg_msg-96 slab cache enabled by CONFIG_SLAB_BUCKETS.

To implement the cross-cache attack, I needed to learn how these attacks work on the latest Ubuntu kernel, but testing exploit primitives together with this crazy race condition was really painful. Then, I got an idea:


  If an unstable race condition creates problems, let's use a testing ground for developing the exploit primitives!




Back in 2017, I created a pet project for my students called kernel-hack-drill. It provides a test environment for learning and experimenting with Linux kernel exploits. I remembered it and decided to use kernel-hack-drill to develop the exploit primitives for CVE-2024-50264.

kernel-hack-drill is an open-source project published under the GPL-3.0 license. It contains the following parts:

  drill_mod.c is a small Linux kernel module that provides the /proc/drill_act file as a simple interface to userspace. This module contains vulnerabilities that you can control and experiment with.
  drill.h is a header file describing the drill_mod.ko interface:
    enum drill_act_t {
	DRILL_ACT_NONE = 0,
	DRILL_ACT_ALLOC = 1,
	DRILL_ACT_CALLBACK = 2,
	DRILL_ACT_SAVE_VAL = 3,
	DRILL_ACT_FREE = 4,
	DRILL_ACT_RESET = 5
};
  
#define DRILL_ITEM_SIZE 95
  
struct drill_item_t {
	unsigned long foobar;
	void (*callback)(void);
	char data[]; /* C99 flexible array */
};
  
#define DRILL_N 10240

  
  drill_test.c is a userspace test for drill_mod.ko that provides the examples of using /proc/drill_act. This test doesn't provoke memory corruptions in drill_mod.ko and it passes if CONFIG_KASAN=y.
  README.md includes a detailed step-by-step setup guide on how to use kernel-hack-drill (kudos to the contributors!).


Fun fact: when I chose the name kernel-hack-drill for this project, I used the word drill to mean training or workout for Linux kernel security. My friends and students read it differently. They thought I meant something like this:




The kernel-hack-drill project is a bit similar to KRWX, but much simpler. Moreover, it ships with ready-made PoC exploits:

  drill_uaf_callback.c: a UAF exploit that invokes a callback inside a freed drill_item_t structure. It hijacks control flow and gains LPE.
  drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c: a UAF exploit that writes into a freed drill_item_t. It uses a cross-cache attack and overwrites msg_msg.m_ts enabling out-of-bounds reading of the kernel memory. I wrote this PoC while working on the bug described in this article.
  drill_uaf_w_pipe_buffer.c: a UAF exploit that writes into a freed drill_item_t. It performs a cross-cache attack and overwrites pipe_buffer.flags to implement the Dirty Pipe technique and gain LPE. This PoC exploit was also developed during my experiments with CVE-2024-50264.


Recent contributions added new variants (kudos to the contributors!):

  drill_uaf_callback_rop_smep.c: an improved version of drill_uaf_callback.c that adds a ROP chain to bypass SMEP on x86_64.
  drill_uaf_w_pte.c: a UAF exploit that writes to a freed drill_item_t. It performs a cross-allocator attack and overwrites a page table entry (PTE) to implement the Dirty Pagetable technique and gain LPE on x86_64.
  drill_uaf_w_pud.c: an improved version of __drill_uaf_w_pte.c__ that overwrites a page upper directory (PUD) instead of a PTE and implements the Dirty Pagetable attack via huge pages.


When I revisited kernel-hack-drill during my CVE-2024-50264 work, this spare-time project hadn't seen an update in years. But now kernel-hack-drill offers a solid set of resources that Linux kernel security researchers can explore.

Experimenting with cross-cache attack using kernel-hack-drill

My first step was to learn how cross-cache attacks behave on the latest Ubuntu kernel with slab allocator hardening turned on.

I implemented a standard cross-cache attack in drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c. You can see the full code in the repository, so I'll sketch the flow here. For background, I highly recommend Andrey Konovalov's talk SLUB Internals for Exploit Developers.

To plan the attack, I pulled the needed info from /sys/kernel/slab. The slab caches that hold virtio_vsock_sock (80 bytes) or drill_item_t (95 bytes) each keep 120 slabs in per-CPU partial lists (cpu_partial=120) and 42 objects in each slab (objs_per_slab=42).

The cross-cache attack algorithm:

  Allocate objs_per_slab objects to create a fresh active slab. Active slab is the slab that will be used by the kernel for the next allocation.
  Allocate objs_per_slab * cpu_partial objects. This creates the cpu_partial number of full slabs that will later populate the partial list at step 6.
  Create a slab that contains the UAF object. Allocate objs_per_slab objects and keep a dangling reference to the vulnerable object in that slab.
  Create a new active slab again: allocate objs_per_slab objects. This step is very important for keeping the cross-cache attack stable. Otherwise, the slab with the vulnerable object remains active and cannot be reclaimed by the page allocator.
  Completely free the slab that holds the UAF object. To do that, free (objs_per_slab * 2 - 1) of the objects allocated just before the last one. The active slab now contains only the last object, and the slab with the UAF object becomes free and moves to the partial list.
  Fill up the partial list: free one of each objs_per_slab objects in the reserved slabs from step 2. That makes the slab allocator clean up the partial list and move the free slab containing the UAF object to the page allocator.
  Reclaim the page that contained the UAF object for another slab cache: spray the target msg_msg objects. As a result, one msg_msg is allocated where the vulnerable object (drill_item_t in my case) used to be.
  Exploit the UAF! Overwrite msg_msg.m_ts to read kernel memory out of bounds.


I've seen plenty of publications that cover cross-cache attack, but none of them explain how to debug it. I'll fill that gap.

Let's examine the attack in drill_uaf_w_msg_msg.c. To watch it in action and debug it, make the following tweaks in your kernel sources:

In __put_partials() I print the address of the slab that returns to the page allocator when discard_slab() runs. In alloc_msg() I print the kernel address of each newly allocated msg_msg object.

When the cross-cache attack succeeds, the slab that held drill_item_t objects is handed back to the page allocator and then reused for msg_msg objects. Running the PoC exploit drill_uaf_w_msg_msg makes this visible, as we observe:

  In the kernel log:
    [   32.719582] drill: kmalloc'ed item 5123 (0xffff88800c960660, size 95)

  
  Then in stdout:

  Then in GDB (using with bata24/gef):

  Finally, in the kernel log:

We see the drill_item_t object 0xffff88800c960660 in slab 0xffffea0000325800 reallocated as msg_msg, which confirms that the cross-cache attack worked.

After experimenting with kernel-hack-drill on Ubuntu Server 24.04, I found that CONFIG_RANDOM_KMALLOC_CACHES and CONFIG_SLAB_BUCKETS block naive UAF exploitation, yet they also make cross-cache attacks absolutely stable. So, in my humble opinion:




It seems that, without a mitigation such as SLAB_VIRTUAL, the Linux kernel remains wide-open to cross-cache attacks.

Adapting the cross-cache attack to CVE-2024-50264

As noted in the limitations, the vulnerable virtio_vsock_sock client object is allocated together with the server object (Limitation #1). That hurts the exploit for two reasons:

  On one hand, leaving the server vsock open stops the slab that holds the UAF object from being freed, which kills the cross-cache attack.
  On the other hand, closing the server vsock disturbs the UAF itself.


How to deal with it? @v4bel and @qwerty used the SLUBStick timing side channel to spot when the allocator switched to a new active slab. I went another way:

  What if I hit the connect() syscall with a signal almost immediately?


In short, I used one more race condition to exploit the main race condition – and it worked:

  I sent the "immortal" signal 33 to the vulnerable connect() syscall after a 10000 ns timeout, far earlier than the delay needed to trigger the UAF.
  Then I verified the early race condition:
    
      The connect() syscall must return "Interrupted system call"
      Another testing client vsock should still connect to the server vsock without trouble
    
  


I discovered that when both checks passed, only a single vulnerable virtio_vsock_sock for the client vsock was created. The interrupting signal arrived before the kernel could create the second virtio_vsock_sock for the server vsock. This bypassed Limitation #1 (paired-object creation). After that, I sent signal 33 again – this time after the normal timeout – to interrupt the vulnerable connect() a second time and provoke the UAF. The cross-cache attack against virtio_vsock_sock was unlocked!

Looping this early race and checking its result was quick. Once the early race succeeded, the main race that triggers the UAF became more stable; I could now hit the UAF about once per second instead of once every several minutes, solving the instability noted in Limitation #2. My race condition "speedrun" also eased Limitation #5: I managed roughly five UAF writes before the kworker hit a null-ptr-deref at VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT (8 seconds).

To address Limitation #4 (the immediate null-ptr-deref in the kworker after UAF), I tried one more race condition, similarly to @v4bel and @qwerty. Right after the UAF-triggering connect(), I called listen() on the vulnerable vsock. If listen() ran before the kworker, it changed the vsock state to TCP_LISTEN, preventing the crash. Unfortunately, this step remains the most unstable part of the whole exploit; the rest is far more stable.

At that point my list of CVE-2024-50264 limitations looked like this:

  The vulnerable virtio_vsock_sock client object is allocated together with the server object from the same slab cache. That disturbs cross-cache attacks.
  Reproducing this race condition is very unstable.
  The UAF write occurs in a kworker a few microseconds after kfree(), too quickly for typical cross-cache attacks.
  A null-ptr-deref in the kworker follows the UAF write. That's why I shelved the bug at first.
  Even if that kernel oops is avoided, another null-ptr-deref occurs in the kworker after VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT (eight seconds).
  The kworker hangs in spin_lock_bh() if virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock is not zero.


With the early-signal trick in place, only two limitations were still blocking my exploit.

Oh so slow! The cross-cache attack shows up late to the party

As noted in Limitation #3, the UAF write in the kworker fires only a few μs after kfree() for the virtio_vsock_sock. A cross-cache attack needs much more time, so the UAF write lands on the original virtio_vsock_sock and never reaches the msg_msg.




I didn't know how to make cross-cache procedure faster, but I knew how to slow down the attacked kernel code instead. That approach is described in Jann Horn's article Racing against the clock. It allowed to make my kworker slower than a sluggish cross-cache attack.

The main idea is to hammer the kworker with a timerfd watched by a huge pile of epoll instances. Here is the short recipe (see Jann's article for full detail):

  Call timerfd_create(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, 0).
  Create 8 forks.
  In each fork, call dup() for the timerfd 100 times.
  In each fork, call epoll_create() 500 times.
  For every epoll instance, use epoll_ctl() to add all duplicated file descriptors to the interest list – each epoll instance now monitors all available timerfd copies.
  Finally, arm the timerfd so the interrupt hits the kworker at just the right moment:
    timerfd_settime(timerfd, TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET, &retard_tmo, NULL)

  


This procedure made my race-condition window around 80 times longer.

I wanted some more time to complete the cross-cache attack with a guarantee, but ran into a limit not mentioned in the original write-up. If you exceed the limit in /proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches, epoll_ctl() fails. From man 7 epoll:

  This specifies a limit on the total number of file descriptors that a user can register across all epoll instances on the system. The limit is per real user ID. Each registered file descriptor costs roughly 90 bytes on a 32-bit kernel, and roughly 160 bytes on a 64-bit kernel. Currently, the default value for max_user_watches is 1/25 (4%) of the available low memory, divided by the registration cost in bytes.


On Ubuntu Server 24.04 with 2 GiB of RAM, /proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches is 431838, which is not huge. I could afford 8 forks × 500 epoll instances × 100 duplicated file descriptors, for a total of 400000 epoll watches.

That was just enough to beat Limitation #3, and I finally got msg_msg data size corruption: the vsock UAF changed msg_msg.m_ts from 48 bytes to 8192 (MSGMAX). Now I could do out-of-bounds reading of the kernel memory using the msgrcv() syscall.

Sorting the loot

The corrupted msg_msg allowed me to read 8 KiB of data from the kernelspace.  I sorted this loot and found a promising infoleak: a kernel address 0xffffffff8233cfa0 [1]. This infoleak was quite stable and worked with high probability, so I decided to investigate it without doing any additional heap feng shui. GDB showed that it was a pointer to the socket_file_ops() kernel function. I was excited to discover that this function pointer is part of struct file, because the file kernel object also contains the f_cred pointer [2], which leaked as well.

Here's how I examined the memory leaked by msg_msg at 0xffff88800e75d600:
gef> p *((struct file *)(0xffff88800e75d600 + 96*26 + 64))
$61 = {
  f_count = {
    counter = 0x0
  },
  f_lock = {
    {
      rlock = {
        raw_lock = {
          {
            val = {
              counter = 0x0
            },
            {
              locked = 0x0,
              pending = 0x0
            },
            {
              locked_pending = 0x0,
              tail = 0x0
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  f_mode = 0x82e0003,
  f_op = 0xffffffff8233cfa0 <socket_file_ops>,    [1]
  f_mapping = 0xffff88800ee66f60,
  private_data = 0xffff88800ee66d80,
  f_inode = 0xffff88800ee66e00,
  f_flags = 0x2,
  f_iocb_flags = 0x0,
  f_cred = 0xffff888003b7ad00,                    [2]
  f_path = {
    mnt = 0xffff8880039cec20,
    dentry = 0xffff888005b30b40
  },
  ...


As a result, my PoC exploit obtained a pointer to struct cred, the structure that stores the current process credentials. The last piece needed for privilege escalation was arbitrary address writing. With that, I could overwrite the exploit process credentials and become root. That would be a data-only attack with no control-flow hijack.

In search of arbitrary address writing primitive

The most interesting and difficult part of the research began here. I was searching for a target kernel object for my UAF write, which could provide an arbitrary address writing exploit primitive. The search was exhausting. I've done the following:

  Looked through dozens of kernel objects,
  Read many kernel exploit write-ups,
  Tried Kernel Exploitation Dashboard by Eduardo Vela and the KernelCTF team.


One idea was to combine my limited UAF write with the Dirty Page Table attack (well described by Nicolas Wu). Tweaking page tables can let an attacker read and write data at arbitrary physical address.

I could combine my UAF with a cross-cache attack (or more accurately, cross-allocator attack) to modify page tables. To overwrite kernel text or heap, though, I still needed to know the physical address of the target memory. Two options came to mind:

  Bruteforcing physical addresses. Not practical here: I could trigger the UAF only about five times before the kworker crashed, nowhere near enough tries.
  Using the KASLR infoleak from my msg_msg out-of-bounds read. I decided to try that.


I ran a quick experiment to see how KASLR behaves on X86_64 with CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE and CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_MEMORY enabled. Booting a virtual machine several times, I compared the virtual and physical addresses of kernel _text.

VM run #1:
gef> ksymaddr-remote
[+] Wait for memory scan
0xffffffff98400000 T _text

gef> v2p 0xffffffff98400000
Virt: 0xffffffff98400000 -> Phys: 0x57400000


VM run #2:
gef> ksymaddr-remote
[+] Wait for memory scan
0xffffffff81800000 T _text

gef> v2p 0xffffffff81800000
Virt: 0xffffffff81800000 -> Phys: 0x18600000


Then I calculated the difference between the virtual and physical addresses:

  VM run #1: 0xffffffff98400000 − 0x57400000 = 0xffffffff41000000
  VM run #2: 0xffffffff81800000 − 0x18600000 = 0xffffffff69200000


Because 0xffffffff41000000 is not equal to 0xffffffff69200000, leaking the virtual KASLR offset doesn't help against physical KASLR.




Thereby to perform Dirty Page Table attack, I needed a way to leak a kernel physical address. Ideally I would do this by mixing some page-allocator feng shui with my out-of-bounds read. That felt messy, and I wanted a cleaner solution.

I kept looking for a target kernel object for my UAF write, which could provide an arbitrary address writing and eventually focused on pipe_buffer.

When a pipe is created with the pipe() system call, the kernel allocates an array of pipe_buffer structures. Each pipe_buffer item in this array corresponds to a memory page that holds data written to the pipe. The diagram below shows the internals of this object:




This object looked like a good UAF target. I could make a pipe_buffer array the same size as virtio_vsock_sock by changing the capacity of the pipe: fcntl(pipe_fd[1], F_SETPIPE_SZ, PAGE_SIZE * 2). The kernel changes the array size to 2 * sizeof(struct pipe_buffer) = 80 bytes, exactly matching the virtio_vsock_sock size.

In addition, 4 attacker-controlled bytes from the vsock UAF write at offset 24 can flip pipe_buffer.flags, just as in Max Kellermann's original Dirty Pipe attack.




The original Dirty Pipe attack doesn't even need an infoleak and grants privilege escalation with a one-shot write. Impressed, I decided to experiment with pipe_buffer in my kernel-hack-drill.

Experimenting with the Dirty Pipe attack

First, I built a Dirty Pipe prototype in kernel-hack-drill; the PoC exploit drill_uaf_w_pipe_buffer.c is in the repository. It:

  performs a cross-cache attack and reclaims the slab that held drill_item_t objects as a slab for pipe_buffer objects
  exploits the UAF write to drill_item_t; the attacker-controlled bytes written to drill_item_t at offset 24, modify pipe_buffer.flags
  implements the Dirty Pipe attack, achieving LPE in one shot without an infoleak, cool!


To use this technique in my CVE-2024-50264 PoC exploit, I still had to bypass the last remaining Limitation #6: the kworker hangs before the UAF write if virtio_vsock_sock.tx_lock is non-zero. I managed to solve that by doing splice() from a regular file to the pipe, starting at offset zero:
	loff_t file_offset = 0;
	ssize_t bytes = 0;

	/* N.B. splice modifies the file_offset value */
	bytes = splice(temp_file_fd, &file_offset, pipe_fd[1], NULL, 1, 0);
	if (bytes < 0)
		err_exit("[-] splice");
	if (bytes != 1)
		err_exit("[-] splice short");


In that case, the pipe_buffer.offset field remains zero, so the kworker does not hang while acquiring the spinlock:




This seemed like a breakthrough – until I noticed that the UAF write also corrupted the pipe_buffer.ops function pointer by four zero bytes of peer_fwd_cnt. That unfortunate side effect provoked kernel crashes on every later operation involving pipe_buffer ☹️:




This brought me to the following line of reasoning:

  Completing the Dirty Pipe attack requires a working pipe_buffer with an unchanged ops pointer value.
  Preserving 0xffffffff in the most significant bytes of the pipe_buffer.ops function pointer requires that same value in peer_fwd_cnt.
  Setting peer_fwd_cnt in virtio_vsock_sock means sending data through the vsock.
  Sending data through a vsock first needs a successful connect().
  However, a successful connect() on the vulnerable vsock makes the UAF impossible ⛔.


Alas!

Pipe buffer entertainment

So the original Dirty Pipe technique wouldn't fit my CVE-2024-50264 PoC exploit. But suddenly an idea struck me:

  What if I create a pipe with capacity PAGE_SIZE * 4 forcing the kernel to allocate four pipe_buffer objects in kmalloc-192?


In that case, the memory object overlapping looked like this: four pipe_buffer objects in one kmalloc-192 slab are allocated at the place of two virtio_vsock_sock objects in two kmalloc-96 slabs. The following diagram illustrates the overlap:




Here, memory corruption can land on either of the two virtio_vsock_sock objects. I'll cover these cases one at a time.

To avoid the kernel hang and crash when the UAF hits virtio_vsock_sock #1, I used two tricks:

  Performed a splice() from a regular file to the pipe with a starting offset of zero. As mentioned earlier, this keeps the offset field of the first pipe_buffer at zero, so the kworker doesn't hang while acquiring the spinlock.
  Discarded that first pipe_buffer before triggering the UAF, leaving its offset field untouched:
     /* Remove the first pipe_buffer without changing the `pipe_buffer.offset` */
 bytes = splice(pipe_fd[0], NULL, temp_pipe_fd[1], NULL, 1, 0);
 if (bytes < 0)
 	err_exit("[-] splice");
 if (bytes == 0)
 	err_exit("[-] splice short");

 /*
  * Let's read this byte and empty the first pipe_buffer.
  * So if the UAF writing corrupts the first pipe_buffer,
  * that will not crash the kernel. Cool!
  */
 bytes = read(temp_pipe_fd[0], pipe_data_to_read, 1); /* 1 spliced byte */
 if (bytes < 0)
 	err_exit("[-] pipe read 1");
 if (bytes != 1)
 	err_exit("[-] pipe read 1 short");

    After this sequence of splice() and read(), the first pipe_buffer becomes inactive. Even if the subsequent UAF overwrites its ops pointer, later pipe operations won't dereference that corrupted pointer, so no kernel crash occurs.
  


I wanted to exploit the UAF on virtio_vsock_sock #2 to overwrite the fourth pipe_buffer. To prevent the kernel hang when the UAF hits this second virtio_vsock_sock, I called the same splice(temp_file_fd, &file_offset, pipe_fd[1], NULL, 1, 0) two more times. These syscalls initialized the second and third pipe_buffer objects, leaving their flags at zero, since this pipe operation doesn't set any PIPE_BUF_FLAG_* bits. Therefore, if the UAF occurs on the second virtio_vsock_sock, the spin_lock_bh() in virtio_transport_space_update() will not hang.

These preparations of the pipe opened a door for corrupting the page pointer of the fourth pipe_buffer:




kernel-hack-drill let me experiment with pipe_buffer objects. Without it, crafting this exploit primitive for the tricky CVE-2024-50264 would have been extremely hard.

AARW and KASLR's last revenge

In a pipe_buffer, the page pointer holds the address of a struct page inside the virtual memory map (vmemmap). vmemmap is an array of these structures that allows the kernel to address physical memory efficiently. It is mentioned in Documentation/arch/x86/x86_64/mm.rst:
____________________________________________________________|___________________________________________________________
                  |            |                  |         |

__________________|____________|__________________|_________|____________________________________________________________


Hence, when I managed to perform a UAF write of controlled data to the pipe_buffer.page pointer, I gained arbitrary address reading and writing (AARW) via the pipe. However, I wasn't able to change the AARW target address many times, as I mentioned in Limitation #5, so I had to choose the target in vmemmap carefully.

My first thought was to overwrite part of the kernel code. But with KASLR enabled, I didn't know the physical address of kernel _text and therefore couldn't determine its location inside vmemmap.

That's why I decided to use the pipe AARW against struct cred in the kernel heap. As I described earlier, I leaked the virtual address of cred using my msg_msg out-of-bounds read. This virtual address looked like 0xffff888003b7ad00, and I understood it was from the direct mapping of all physical memory. So I used the following formula to calculate the offset of the corresponding struct page in vmemmap:
#define STRUCT_PAGE_SZ 64lu
#define PAGE_ADDR_OFFSET(addr) (((addr & 0x3ffffffflu) >> 12) * STRUCT_PAGE_SZ)
uaf_val = PAGE_ADDR_OFFSET(cred_addr);


The idea behind it is simple:

  addr & 0x3ffffffflu gives the offset of the struct cred from the page_offset_base.
  Right shift by 12 gives the number of the memory page containing struct cred.
  Finally, multiplication by 64 (the size of struct page) gives the offset of the corresponding struct page in the vmemmap.


This formula should be adapted if the system has more than 4 GiB of RAM. In that case, ZONE_NORMAL containing kernel allocations usually starts at address 0x100000000. Hence, to calculate the offset of the needed struct page, we should add (0x100000000 >> 12) * STRUCT_PAGE_SZ.

Excellent, the described formula is independent of KASLR for physical addresses, so I could use it to calculate the four lower bytes of the target address for exploiting the pipe AARW against the struct cred. Why I needed only four lower bytes of pipe_buffer.page:

  My UAF write to peer_buf_alloc performed partial overwriting of the first half of the pipe_buffer.page pointer, as I showed at the diagram above.
  x86_64 is little-endian, so the first half of the pointer contains four lower bytes of the address.


But when I tried this approach, KASLR carried out its last revenge. It randomized the vmemmap_base address, and the four lower bytes of the struct page pointers carried two random bits. Ouch!

However, I decided to brute-force those two bits because I could achieve the UAF write around 5 times before the kworker got a null-ptr-deref after VSOCK_CLOSE_TIMEOUT (8 sec).




I found that probing different values of pipe_buffer.page from userspace works perfectly well:

  In case of fail, reading from the pipe simply returns Bad address.
  In case of success, reading from the pipe gives struct cred contents.


Great! I could finally determine a proper AARW target address, write to the pipe, overwrite euid and egid with 0, and get root. See the PoC exploit demo:


  



Conclusion

Bug collisions are painful. Finishing the research anyway is rewarding. Let me quote my good friend:




Working on this hard race condition with multiple limitations allowed me to discover new exploitation techniques and to use and improve my pet project kernel-hack-drill, which provides a testing environment for Linux kernel security researchers. You are welcome to try it and contribute.

Thanks for reading!
