            <description><![CDATA[View recent discussion. Abstract: Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval tasks over the years, with a nascent rise in using them for reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks push embeddings to work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While prior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings, there is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may encounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely simple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the number of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show that this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the test set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the simple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under the existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.]]></description>

            <guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45119103</guid>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
      
      Dave Liepmann
      
        Tufte CSS provides tools to style web articles using the ideas demonstrated by Edward Tufte’s books and handouts. Tufte’s style is known for its simplicity, extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and carefully chosen typography.
        Tufte CSS was created by Dave Liepmann and is now an Edward Tufte project. The original idea was cribbed from Tufte-LaTeX and R Markdown’s Tufte Handout format. We give hearty thanks to all the people who have contributed to those projects.
        If you see anything that Tufte CSS could improve, we welcome your contribution in the form of an issue or pull request on the GitHub project: tufte-css. Please note the contribution guidelines.
        Finally, a reminder about the goal of this project. The web is not print. Webpages are not books. Therefore, the goal of Tufte CSS is not to say “websites should look like this interpretation of Tufte’s books” but rather “here are some techniques Tufte developed that we’ve found useful in print; maybe you can find a way to make them useful on the web”. Tufte CSS is merely a sketch of one way to implement this particular set of ideas. It should be a starting point, not a design goal, because any project should present their information as best suits their particular circumstances.
      

      
        Getting Started
        To use Tufte CSS, copy tufte.css and the et-book directory of font files to your project directory, then add the following to your HTML document’s head block:

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="tufte.css"/>

        Now you just have to use the provided CSS rules, and the Tufte CSS conventions described in this document. For best results, View Source and Inspect Element frequently.
      

      
        Fundamentals
        Sections and Headings
        Organize your document with an article element inside your body tag. Inside that, use section tags around each logical grouping of text and headings.
        Tufte CSS uses h1 for the document title, p with class subtitle for the document subtitle, h2 for section headings, and h3 for low-level headings. More specific headings are not supported. If you feel the urge to reach for a heading of level 4 or greater, consider redesigning your document:
        
          [It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of sentences which then cumulate sequentially into paragraphs, rather than the grunts of bullet points. Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated material, but it didn’t require an elaborate hierarchy to organize.
          
        
        As a bonus, this excerpt regarding the use of headings provides an example of block quotes. In Tufte CSS they are just lightly styled, semantically correct HTML using blockquote and footer elements. See page 20 of The Visual Display of Quantitative Information for an example in print.
        In his later booksBeautiful Evidence, Tufte starts each section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and the first few words of the sentence set in small caps. For this we use a span with the class newthought, as demonstrated at the beginning of this paragraph. Vertical spacing is accomplished separately through <section> tags. Be consistent: though we do so in this paragraph for the purpose of demonstration, do not alternate use of header elements and the newthought technique. Pick one approach and stick to it.

        Text
        Although paper handouts obviously have a pure white background, the web is better served by the use of slightly off-white and off-black colors. Tufte CSS uses #fffff8 and #111111 because they are nearly indistinguishable from their ‘pure’ cousins, but dial down the harsh contrast. We stick to the greyscale for text, reserving color for specific, careful use in figures and images.
        In print, Tufte has used the proprietary Monotype BemboSee Tufte’s comment in the Tufte book fonts thread. font. A similar effect is achieved in digital formats with the now open-source ETBook, which Tufte CSS supplies with a @font-face reference to a .ttf file. In case ETBook somehow doesn’t work, Tufte CSS shifts gracefully to other serif fonts like Palatino and Georgia.
        Also notice how Tufte CSS includes separate font files for bold (strong) and italic (emphasis), instead of relying on the browser to mechanically transform the text. This is typographic best practice.
        If you prefer sans-serifs, use the sans class. It relies on Gill Sans, Tufte’s sans-serif font of choice.
        Links in Tufte CSS match the body text in color and do not change on mouseover or when clicked. Here is a dummy example that goes nowhere. These links are underlined, since this is the most widely recognized indicator of clickable text. ⊕Blue text, while also a widely recognizable clickable-text indicator, is crass and distracting. Luckily, it is also rendered unnecessary by the use of underlining.
        As always, these design choices are merely one approach that Tufte CSS provides by default. Other approaches can also be made to work. The goal is to make sentences readable without interference from links, as well as to make links immediately identifiable even by casual web users.
      

      
        Epigraphs
        
          
            The English language . . . becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.
            
          
          
            For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.
            
          
          I do not paint things, I paint only the differences between things.
        
        If you’d like to introduce your page or a section of your page with some quotes, use epigraphs. Modeled after chapter epigraphs in Tufte’s books (particularly Beautiful Evidence), these are blockquote elements with a bit of specialized styling. Quoted text is italicized. The source goes in a footer element inside the blockquote. We have provided three examples in the epigraph of this section, demonstrating shorter and longer quotes, with and without a paragraph tag, and showing how multiple quotes within an epigraph fit together with the use of a wrapper class.
      

      
        Sidenotes: Footnotes and Marginal Notes
        One of the most distinctive features of Tufte’s style is his extensive use of sidenotes.This is a sidenote. Sidenotes are like footnotes, except they don’t force the reader to jump their eye to the bottom of the page, but instead display off to the side in the margin. Perhaps you have noticed their use in this document already. You are very astute.
        Sidenotes are a great example of the web not being like print. On sufficiently large viewports, Tufte CSS uses the margin for sidenotes, margin notes, and small figures. On smaller viewports, elements that would go in the margin are hidden until the user toggles them into view. The goal is to present related but not necessary information such as asides or citations as close as possible to the text that references them. At the same time, this secondary information should stay out of the way of the eye, not interfering with the progression of ideas in the main text.
        Sidenotes consist of two elements: a superscript reference number that goes inline with the text, and a sidenote with content. To add the former, just put a label and dummy checkbox into the text where you want the reference to go, like so:
        <label for="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle"/>
        You must manually assign a reference id to each side or margin note, replacing “sn-demo” in the for and the id attribute values with an appropriate descriptor. It is useful to use prefixes like sn- for sidenotes and mn- for margin notes.
        Immediately adjacent to that sidenote reference in the main text goes the sidenote content itself, in a span with class sidenote. This tag is also inserted directly in the middle of the body text, but is either pushed into the margin or hidden by default. Make sure to position your sidenotes correctly by keeping the sidenote-number label close to the sidenote itself.
        For optimal readibility of sidenotes, enclose the main text in the section tag.
        If you want a sidenote without footnote-style numberings, then you want a margin note.
          ⊕
          
          
            This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.
           On large screens, a margin note is just a sidenote that omits the reference number. This lessens the distracting effect taking away from the flow of the main text, but can increase the cognitive load of matching a margin note to its referent text. However, on small screens, a margin note is like a sidenote except its viewability-toggle is a symbol rather than a reference number. This document currently uses the symbol ⊕ (&#8853;), but it’s up to you.
        Margin notes are created just like sidenotes, but with the marginnote class for the content and the margin-toggle class for the label and dummy checkbox. For instance, here is the code for the margin note used in the previous paragraph:
        <label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
  This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.
</span>
        Figures in the margin are created as margin notes, as demonstrated in the next section.
      

      
        Figures
        Tufte emphasizes tight integration of graphics with text. Data, graphs, and figures are kept with the text that discusses them. In print, this means they are not relegated to a separate page. On the web, that means readability of graphics and their accompanying text without extra clicks, tab-switching, or scrolling.
        Figures should try to use the figure element, which by default are constrained to the main column. Don’t wrap figures in a paragraph tag. Any label or margin note goes in a regular margin note inside the figure. For example, most of the time one should introduce a figure directly into the main flow of discussion, like so:
        
          ⊕From Edward Tufte, Visual Display of Quantitative Information, page 92.
          
        

        ⊕F.J. Cole, “The History of Albrecht Dürer’s Rhinoceros in Zooological Literature,” Science, Medicine, and History: Essays on the Evolution of Scientific Thought and Medical Practice (London, 1953), ed. E. Ashworth Underwood, 337-356. From page 71 of Edward Tufte’s Visual Explanations. But tight integration of graphics with text is central to Tufte’s work even when those graphics are ancillary to the main body of a text. In many of those cases, a margin figure may be most appropriate. To place figures in the margin, just wrap an image (or whatever) in a margin note inside a p tag, as seen to the right of this paragraph.
        If you need a full-width figure, give it the fullwidth class. Make sure that’s inside an article, and it will take up (almost) the full width of the screen. This approach is demonstrated below using Edward Tufte’s English translation of the Napoleon’s March data visualization. From Beautiful Evidence, page 122-124.
        
          
        
        One obstacle to creating elegant figures on the web is the difficulty of handling different screen sizes, especially on the fly. Embedded iframe elements are particularly troublesome. For these instances we provide a helper class, iframe-wrapper, the most common use for which is probably YouTube videos, e.g.
        <figure class="iframe-wrapper">
  <iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YslQ2625TR4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</figure>
        
          
        
        You can use this class on a div instead of a figure, with slightly different results but the same general effect. Experiment and choose depending on your application.
      

      
        Code
        Technical jargon, programming language terms, and code samples are denoted with the code class, as I’ve been using in this document to denote HTML. Code needs to be monospace for formatting purposes and to aid in code analysis, but it must maintain its readability. To those ends, Tufte CSS follows GitHub’s font selection, which shifts gracefully along the monospace spectrum from the elegant but rare Consolas all the way to good old reliable Courier.
        Extended code examples should live in a code element within a pre element. This adds control over indentation and overflow as well:
        ;; Some code examples in Clojure. This is a comment.

;; applying a function to every item in the collection
(map tufte-css blog-posts)
;;;; if unfamiliar, see http://www.lispcast.com/annotated-map

;; side-effecty loop (unformatted, causing text overflow) - from https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/doseq
(doseq [[[a b] [c d]] (map list (sorted-map :1 1 :2 2) (sorted-map :3 3 :4 4))] (prn (* b d)))

;; that same side-effecty loop, formatted
(doseq [[[a b] [c d]] (map list
                           (sorted-map :1 1 :2 2)
                           (sorted-map :3 3 :4 4))]
  (prn (* b d)))

;; http://howistart.org/posts/clojure/1
      

      
        ImageQuilts
        Tufte CSS provides support for Edward Tufte and Adam Schwartz’s ImageQuilts. See the ET forum announcement thread for more on quilts. Some have ragged edges, others straight. Include these images just as you would any other figure.
        This is an ImageQuilt surveying Chinese calligraphy, placed in a full-width figure to accomodate its girth:
        
        Here is an ImageQuilt of 47 animal sounds over and over, in a figure constrained to the main text region. This quilt has ragged edges, but the image itself is of course still rectangular.
        
      

      
        Epilogue
        Many thanks go to Edward Tufte for leading the way with his work. It is only through his kind and careful editing that this project accomplishes what it does. All errors of implementation are of course mine.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
I'm excited to announce that we're joining OpenAI’s Codex team!
When we started out, Xcode had no AI. Building a "Cursor for Xcode" sounded crazy, but we managed to do it anyway. And, over time, we built the best coding agent for iOS & MacOS apps.
I'm extremely proud of what we accomplished with Alex. Seeing people build software with our work was surreal. It is an honor to continue that work at a much bigger scale at OpenAI, along with the incredibly talented Codex team. Our mission is to help people create, and today that is more possible than ever.
What happens to Alex:
We plan to continue service for existing users, but will stop new downloads of the app on October 1st. As long as you have the app installed, our plan is to continue serving you. But there won’t be any new features released.
Thank you all -- our day 1 beta users, our customers, our amazing investors, and the entire Apple Dev community for helping us Make Something Wonderful ❤️
(P.S. Check out Codex CLI!)

						From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
					
Thomas Nagel argues that while a human might be able to imagine what it is like to be a bat by taking "the bat's point of view", it would still be impossible "to know what it is like for a bat to be a bat".
"What Is It Like to Be a Bat?" is a paper by American philosopher Thomas Nagel, first published in The Philosophical Review in October 1974, and later in Nagel's Mortal Questions (1979). The paper presents several difficulties posed by phenomenal consciousness, including the potential insolubility of the mind–body problem owing to "facts beyond the reach of human concepts", the limits of objectivity and reductionism, the "phenomenological features" of subjective experience, the limits of human imagination, and what it means to be a particular, conscious thing.[1] 
Nagel asserts that "an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism—something it is like for the organism."[2] This assertion has achieved special status in consciousness studies as "the standard 'what it's like' locution".[3] Daniel Dennett, while sharply disagreeing on some points, acknowledged Nagel's paper as "the most widely cited and influential thought experiment about consciousness".[4]: 441 Nagel argues you cannot compare human consciousness to that of a bat.



The paper's author, Thomas Nagel
Nagel challenges the possibility of explaining "the most important and characteristic feature of conscious mental phenomena" by reductive materialism (the philosophical position that all statements about the mind and mental states can be translated, without any loss or change in meaning, into statements about the physical). For example, a reductive physicalist's solution to the mind–body problem holds that whatever "consciousness" is, it can be fully described via physical processes in the brain and body.[5]
Nagel begins by assuming that "conscious experience is a widespread phenomenon" present in many animals (particularly mammals), even though it is "difficult to say [...] what provides evidence of it". Thus, Nagel sees consciousness not as something exclusively human, but as something shared by many, if not all, organisms. Nagel must be speaking of something other than sensory perception, since objective facts and widespread evidence show that organisms with sensory organs have biological processes of sensory perception. In fact, what all organisms share, according to Nagel, is what he calls the "subjective character of experience" defined as follows: "An organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism – something that it is like for the organism."[1]
The paper argues that the subjective nature of consciousness undermines any attempt to explain consciousness via objective, reductionist means. The subjective character of experience cannot be explained by a system of functional or intentional states. Consciousness cannot be fully explained if the subjective character of experience is ignored, and the subjective character of experience cannot be explained by a reductionist; it is a mental phenomenon that cannot be reduced to materialism.[6] Thus, for consciousness to be explained from a reductionist stance, the idea of the subjective character of experience would have to be discarded, which is absurd. Neither can a physicalist view, because in such a world, each phenomenal experience had by a conscious being would have to have a physical property attributed to it, which is impossible to prove due to the subjectivity of conscious experience. Nagel argues that each and every subjective experience is connected with a "single point of view", making it infeasible to consider any conscious experience as "objective".
Nagel uses the example of bats to clarify the distinction between subjective and objective concepts. Because bats are mammals, they are assumed to have conscious experience. Nagel was inspired to use a bat for his argument after living in a home where the animals were frequent visitors. Nagel ultimately used bats for his argument because of their highly evolved and active use of a biological sensory apparatus that is significantly different from that of many other organisms. Bats use echolocation to navigate and perceive objects. This method of perception is similar to the human sense of vision. Both sonar and vision are regarded as perceptual experiences. While it is possible to imagine what it would be like to fly, navigate by sonar, hang upside down and eat insects like a bat, that is not the same as a bat's perspective. Nagel claims that even if humans were able to metamorphose gradually into bats, their brains would not have been wired as a bat's from birth; therefore, they would only be able to experience the life and behaviors of a bat, rather than the mindset.[7]
Such is the difference between subjective and objective points of view. According to Nagel, "our own mental activity is the only unquestionable fact of our experience", meaning that each individual only knows what it is like to be them (subjectivism). Objectivity requires an unbiased, non-subjective state of perception. For Nagel, the objective perspective is not feasible, because humans are limited to subjective experience.
Nagel concludes with the contention that it would be wrong to assume that physicalism is incorrect, since that position is also imperfectly understood. Physicalism claims that states and events are physical, but those physical states and events are only imperfectly characterized. Nevertheless, he holds that physicalism cannot be understood without characterizing objective and subjective experience. That is a necessary precondition for understanding the mind–body problem.


Daniel Dennett has been a vocal critic of the paper's assertions.
Daniel Dennett denied Nagel's claim that the bat's consciousness is inaccessible, contending that any "interesting or theoretically important" features of a bat's consciousness would be amenable to third-person observation.[4]: 442  For instance, it is clear that bats cannot detect objects more than a few meters away because echolocation has a limited range. Dennett holds that any similar aspects of its experiences could be gleaned by further scientific experiments.[4]: 443  He has also pointed out[8] that Nagel's argument and question were not new, but had previously been stated by B. A. Farrell in his 1950 article "Experience", published in the journal Mind.[9]
Kathleen Akins similarly argued that many questions about a bat's subjective experience hinge on unanswered questions about the neuroscientific details of a bat's brain (such as the function of cortical activity profiles), and Nagel is too quick in ruling these out as answers to his central question.[10][11]
Peter Hacker analyzes Nagel's statement as not only "malconstructed" but philosophically "misconceived" as a definition of consciousness,[12] and he asserts that Nagel's paper "laid the groundwork for ... forty years of fresh confusion about consciousness".[13]: 13 
Eric Schwitzgebel and Michael S. Gordon have argued that, contrary to Nagel, normal sighted humans do use echolocation much like bats – it is just that it is generally done without one's awareness. They use this to argue that normal people in normal circumstances can be grossly and systematically mistaken about their conscious experience.[14]

The "Poor Man's Bitemporal Database", in the safety of my local box. No servers were harmed. Yet.

Especially fellow Clojurians trying to realise their Indie B2B SaaS dreams (translation: income and time-poor). Please use a proper professional time-oriented data system. The following are (pithy descriptions mine); and they are available gratis for fledgling commercial use.

Datomic… "the DB as a value" over an immutable log of all facts.
XTDB… "the DB as a value" over an immutable log of all bitemporal facts.
Rama… "any DB as dirt-cheap view" over an immutable log of all events.

Reading Guide / Thinky Thoughts Alert (same thing)
Solitary over-caffeinated temporal database rumination went out of hand. Even The Voices are fed up and want someone to stop us. Furthermore;

Sage friends already gently shook their heads after hearing The Voices.
Their hard-won advice—"Just Use Postgres.", and "Please, for everyone's sake, stick with the relational models."—fell on deaf ears. 1
Obviously, I am also incapable of following my own advice.

Hence this post.
Take what is useful, discard the rest…
The key take-away is: the accountants were right all along. Software engineers will do well, to cleverly copy the accountants 2. Now you may…

View cat pictures instead.
Skip to the reference material. Definitely worth your time; pinky promise.
Skip to Architecture + Code; where the raw rubber tire of one's thinky-thought-ing meets the rough road of relentless Reality.

Or, grab a big beverage to help ingest the ten thousand tokens to follow… Unless you are a Large Language Model. You can't drink. Sucks to be you.
But beware. Once you see, you cannot un-see the fact that…

Any sufficiently complicated data system contains an ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of a bitemporal database.

Factual and Temporal World-Building


Recommended reading (ages 10 to 1,000) for the aspiring temporal data engineer.

Accountants are our exemplary archetype
The cashier at Temporal Convenience Store K9, just handed us our bill. Oi; where is that 10% discount applicable to our bulk purchase of provisions as loyal customers (it's going to be a long trip)?!
Now we think that, but we ask politely, because we know there are many civil ways to sort this snafu without shoplifting or violence. Two universally accepted 3 remedies are:

The cashier has direct authority to fix it, and they may gladly oblige.
The cashier's hands are sadly tied. For ERP reasons, accounts alone has authority to issue refunds for bills over a certain value. But we asked nicely so the cashier kindly nods us to accounts, in the backroom.

Odds are that the store people 4 will fix it by issuing two new transactions.

One transaction to cancel the last bill and reverse the related charge to our spacecard.
Another transaction issuing the corrected bill, including the discounted amount, with a fresh charge made to our spacecard.

Meanwhile, Temporal Convenience Store K9's various ledgers have received corresponding debits and credits too, of course. But enough. A programmer, though Poor, is no Fool. One does not simply trespass The Field of Accountants. There be dragons.
So… Back to the DB.
One way or another, the store's accounting database must tell these facts:

At TxTime-7543, Cashier-Adric at Store-K9 ISSUED bill ID-13579 having value 100 spacecoin, and charged it to SpaceCard-1337.
At TxTime-7587, Cashier-Adric at Store-K9 REVERSED bill ID-13579 having value 100 spacecoin, and refunded it to SpaceCard-1337.

Maaaybe a note about why it was reversed. 5

At TxTime-7715, Accounts-Nyssa at Store-K9 ISSUED bill ID-13579-v2 for 90 spacecoin, with a total value of 100 spacecoin minus 10 spacecoin going to discount, and charged 90 spacecoin to SpaceCard-1337.

We call this a temporal data system because it incorporates the passage of time.

No information is ever modified in-place or deleted.
New information is always appended.
To grok the latest state of the accounts, one must read the sequence of all facts recorded in the database.
Reading a fact updates a separate, current view of the accounts… our "as of now" understanding of the world.
The "current view" can be rebuilt from scratch, up to any point in time, whether it is "as of now", or "as of last week", or "as of next quarter" (which will be useful only if we add synthetic projected-future events into the database).

So… What to think about in order to design a general-purpose temporal data system that does this for us?
All databases record state of entities
People, things, processes etc. State is the discrete value of some attribute of an entity at a specific point in time.

Values are timeless and context free (17).
Attributes provide context ('age'), which we use to suggest and interpret the meaning of a value (= age 17).
Entities are real or imaginary objects ( Adric) having attributes (age).

Thus, the State of Adric can be stated as: Adric's age is 17 as of now.
In a current database—which is just a fancy way of saying database—the as of now is implicit. So is the concept of "age is an attribute of the entity Adric". We just call it Schema, in the abstract.



entity
age




Adric
17



Let's re-state our traditional table as Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) triplets. Let's also add a column for time (as we often do) to answer questions like "when was Adric's age last updated in our database?".



entity
attribute
value
time




Adric
age
17
as-of-date-time



From this kernel shall spring forth our world, wrought of facts and time itself. But first, one must acknowledge that…

All the world’s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages.
— William Shakespeare, As You Like It, Act-II, Scene-VII, Lines 139-143

As my theater gentlefriends like to say…
Everything is Process
We understand the world in terms of processes. All of Reality is a live process which we want to participate in—control, influence, react, adapt. Ergo, all information is part of some process. Yes, even universal constants like c and π, which we can confidently assume to be constant only in our observable universe. Because even these came to be after the moment of the big bang, and will remain only until the eventual heat death of the universe (assuming our universe is ever-expanding, and not a bouncing singularity).
It follows that, to understand the world, we must observe and respond to data; information about various attributes of various meaningful aspects of reality, as we perceive it. Said another way, we understand the world by observing and modifying the state of entities over time—the past, the now, and the later. A person's address, a valve's current position, the remaining free volume of a container, the trajectory of a comet, one's fast-emptying savings account.

The more sophisticated a being is, the more context about entities and entity-relationships it is able to keep alive and/or use simultaneously 6.
The identity of an entity is the complete life it lives
Never-ending process is the beating heart, the whistling wind, the pulsing quasar, the furious procreation, the tectonic Subduction, the whispered good-bye, the thermodynamic survival instinct of all things. Process is the why of being. One could even say that an entity without id can have no identity.
This is why, to properly identify an entity, we must egolessly maintain an up-to-date mental-model about it. For that, we must continually observe, record, and aggregate a succession of states of the entity in question.
Consequently, knowledge of entity-attributes alone is not sufficient (Adric has age, address, belief). Knowledge of attribute-values is required too (age is x, address is y, belief is z). And without a sense of time, we simply cannot complete the picture.
To make it concrete:

Every person's life revolves around their address and we can guess different things about them based on how their address changes.
You know which Adric is being spoken about because you know

Adric's age was 17 last year. Adric's age is 18 as of now. Adric's age will be 319 on <specific date>.
Adric's address was Foo last year. Adric's address is Baz as of now. Adric's address will be Bar after December 2025.
Adric's belief in bitemporality was 1% last year. Adric's belief in bitemporality is 99% as of now.
Adric's temporal innocence level was 99% last year. Adric's temporal innocence level is 1% as of now.

A reader of this set of facts can confidently determine: As-of-now, Adric is an eighteen year old entity that lives at 'Baz', believes strongly in bitemporality, and has nearly no temporal innocence.

Having gained this factual understanding, a dear reader may be tempted to further theorise; Adric lost his temporal innocence and eventually ended up living at 'Bar', where he always is these days. Of course, to prove such an allegation, the dear reader would have to piece together many more facts about Adric, and show causation, not mere correlation.
The dear reader may happily play temporal sleuth. However, the temporal database and temporal data engineer are not here to judge. Our role is simply to record the facts as presented, without ego, without prejudice, with integrity, so that the temporal data sleuth may use it productively to figure out what happened, when, and why.
For there is more to facts than meets the eye.

"I'm not in the judgment business, Mr. Orr. I'm after facts. And the events of the mind, believe me, to me are facts. When you see another man's dream as he dreams it recorded in black and white on the electroencephalograph, as I've done ten thousand times, you don't speak of dreams as 'unreal.' They exist; they are events; they leave a mark behind them."
— Dr. William Haber
The Lathe of Heaven, Ursula K. Le Guin.

A fact can be true or false
The temporal sleuth knows that one must resolve the reality of a fact by asserting whether it is true or false.
Our facts table can be expressed as something like the table below. Aspiring temporal data engineers will do well to avoid speculating why a fact might have been asserted true or false. Our ilk must simply realise that we can assert facts this way; <statement of fact> is <true/false?> as of <time>.
Each state of the Adric entity can thus be re-written as an assertion of a fact.

"Adric's age is 17" is a true fact as of date-last-year.
"Adric's age is 17" is a false fact as of date-now.

With just this information, the temporal sleuth can infer that Adric's age definitely changed at least once sometime between date-last-year and date-now. But how many times, and to what value, is anybody's guess. For that, we need more temporal observations. Which thickens the plot. For now, we might receive conflicting observations.
What happens when fact and fact collide?
You Won't Believe This One Trick Accountants Use To Deal With Changing Facts. They never delete old entries from their ledgers, they simply make new "correcting entries" (We established this in our motivating example.).
Earlier, we were told to record that the Adric entity's age is 17 as of date-last-year. Presently, we are told to make a note that Adric is NOT 17 any more. We have no idea about Adric's birth date creation date, by the way. We just make a note of assertions of facts about Adric's age, as we are told.

At this point, if anyone asks for Adric's age "as of now", the only truth we can tell is "we don't know". Think about this for a moment. How should we interrogate this temporal data store, to make sense of the information it contains? It's subtle. Hopefully all the thinky thoughting to come will build a clearer intuition. But we are out of time right now…
Sixty seconds later, we are interrupted and told that Adric is in fact 18, and oh by the way, he was already 18 as of date-now. And does it bother us that we wrote the earlier thing down already? No it doesn't. We just assert the new fact.
And just like that…
Now if anyone asks for Adric's age "as of now", we can truthfully answer 18. Because now our table looks like…

Adric
{:age [:time :years]}

Similarly, we make note of other facts about Adric as of various dates on the timeline. But let's add one more key detail… the time at which we made note of the information.
Finally, the Two Questions that put the 'bi' in the 'bitemporal'
Events always occur before they can be recorded. It's just how nature works. Therefore, we can only ever make a note of a fact, after the fact. And so it comes to pass, that any self-respecting temporal sleuth naturally begins their temporal interrogation with two questions:
When did it actually happen?
Only a fact-sender may lay claim to the time an event occurred. And this timestamp must always travel with the fact. Whether the claimed timestamp is acceptable or not is between the fact-sender and the temporal sleuth. The temporal data store and engineer just make sure it is written down exactly as given.
When did we officially record it?
Only the temporal data store—not even the temporal data engineer—may lay claim to when this happened. For the temporal data engineer is just a fallible puny human who can screw up in so many ways. Making typos. Misreading the clock. Lazily avoiding recording facts until the auditor comes a-calling. Or even forgetting the fact entirely, upon discovery of which fact, the temporal sleuth gets called in to piece together what might have happened.
So, let's update our temporal data table with the "transaction" time, at which the data store guarantees that it has immutably inscribed a fact.
To ease table-reading life of our fellow our puny humans, we also rearrange the time columns a bit. Now, we can manually read records as follows:

At Transaction Time t02, the table recorded the following fact:

As of dt-now, Adric's :age being 17 stands REDACTED.

At Transaction Time t03, the table recorded the following fact:

As of dt-now, Adric's :age being 18 stands ASSERTED.

This brings us to the absurdity of time travel… For things to get better, they have to get weird first.
Reality versus (data-based) Time-Travel


"TIMELINES" - Time Travel in popular film and TV. (Source: informationisbeautiful.net)


"Why do you think your mother didn't notice that reality had changed since last night?" [Dr. Haber]
"Well, she didn't dream it. I mean, the dream really did change reality. It made a different reality, retroactively, which she'd been part of all along. Being in it, she had no memory of any other. I did, I remembered both, because I was… there… at the moment of the change. This is the only way I can explain it, I know it doesn't make sense. But I have got to have some explanation or else face the fact that I'm insane." [Mr. Orr]
The Lathe of Heaven, Ursula K. Le Guin.

Actual Time Travel is different each time, because the very act of it interacts with and perturbs Reality. Not being higher dimensional beings, we have evolved to get by, by perceiving very little of very little. To us, convenient fictions are good enough Reality.
No temporal database can contain Reality itself
"The Song" is a convenient fiction.
We love to loop a favourite hit single. Yet…

A record is not "The Song". All recordings are lossy 7 because all acts of measurement are lossy. That's just physics.
A replay is not "The Song". Every replay is the same information yet it is new, because Reality is ever-moving, ever-changing. (Ignoring for a moment the fact that every replay degrades the storage medium—vinyl, compact disk, copper plate, SSD—causing further information loss.)
Nor are live performances "The Song". Each rendition is different.

Similarly, temporal databases can only mimic Time Travel.

The experience of Reality can only ever be captured as finite, discrete observations (samples and measurements).
Therefore, a temporal recording or database can only ever contain approximate observations of Reality.
Each time we retrieve the observations, we cannot help but reinterpret them because we ourselves have changed in the interval.

We can only ever sing songs about what we believed happened.
Reality transpires in Dedekind cuts
"This Instant" is a convenient fiction.
Every observation of reality exists somewhere inside of an interval, because our means of measurement can only ever approximate the moment of occurrence of an event. The idea of the Dedekind Cut frames this neatly.

A Dedekind cut is a partition of the rationals Q into two subsets A and B such that

A is nonempty.
A ≠ Q (equivalently, B is nonempty).
If x,y ∈ Q, x < y, and y ∈ A, then x ∈ A. (A is "closed downwards".)
If x ∈ A, then there exists a y ∈ A such that y > x. (A does not contain a greatest element.)

By omitting the first two requirements, we formally obtain the extended real number line.


Dedekind cut at square root of two. (Wikimedia Commons).


Why split such philosophical hairs? Why?
Because, we must record temporal facts with proper temporal resolution. For example, an infinitesimal such as a Femtosecond (10-15s) can be…

Just Right… for that "Femto Laser" Cataract removal or LASIK surgery.
Waaay over the top… for orchestral arrangements where sub-millisecond (< 10-3s) coordination is more than enough.
Or too coarse(!)… for Quantum dynamics studies, where incredible things happen in attoseconds (10-18s). 8

More subtly, because all Temporal Data Processing queries are Interval queries, served by collating facts that happened starting Time X to Time Y.
For example, "Calculate the state of the world as-of some Instant."
To serve this query, we must collate all facts starting from the earliest available ones, right up to whatever as-of time Instant. It could be as-of <some past moment>, or as-of some projected future, or…. as-of this very instant, a.k.a. a now query.
The now query is a special-case as-of query, because now is an expanding query window… ever-increasing "wall-clock time". It means our computer's temporal resolution, which the temporal database relies on, must suit that of incoming facts. My cheap wristwatch will botch your Formula One lap times.
Fun fact: The now query returns a Current Database.
Facts contain observations. Observations are not Reality.
"Facts" are a convenient fiction.
To fact-find, we must observe. Observation requires measurement. Measurements are inherently lossy. Consequently, no collection of facts, no matter how fine-grained can ever capture Reality as it actually happened.
Besides, facts depend on who's observing. Having experienced the world a bit, we have doubtless realised that, routinely…

The same party told us "use this fact", at different times, with no regard to whatever happened in-between.
OR, it's possible that the same party sent us two different facts at the same time, but they were recorded in the table at different times. Maybe the temporal database recorded one fact, but before it could record the other fact, it got waylaid by a VACUUM emergency. It happens.
OOOORRRR, it is possible that two different parties with different vantage points of a shared reality sent their observations independently, without being aware that other party even exists. Our temporal database just says "okay then", and records both claims of facts about observed reality.

As we established in the Adric scenario, multiple facts for the same E-A-V triple, can claim to have occurred at the same time (Adric is NOT 17 as-of-now, and Adric IS 18 as-of-now).
Consequently, though our bitemporal database notes down distinct facts at different times, we cannot presume that the sequence of recording follows Reality.
In other words…
Facts are mutually independent parallel claims that assert or redact some aspect of concurrent real-world events.
In fact, facts are always so. Variables are mutually dependent or independent; correlated or uncorrelated, because variables subsume Real identities, all of which live in the contiguous fabric of the same shared Universe.
What the Fact?!
Materialised "Reality" depends on who's asking.
"Reality" is a convenient fiction.
We simulate alternate reality all the time. Worrying about the future. Worrying about what someone must be thinking about us just now. Questioning past life choices and wondering "what if". Much like financial analysts, weather modelers, chess pros, special ops teams running scenarios and doing retrospectives. Except those other people get paid to imagine worst case scenarios.

If each fact lives on its own conceptual timeline, then we must necessarily reconstruct reality by threading a point of view through a sequence of recorded facts.
Only the temporal sleuth—not the temporal database, nor engineer—get to choose which timeline or timelines (sequence(s) of facts) ought to construct a prospective Reality.
Only the temporal sleuth gets to choose the as-of point in time wherefrom to do so—now, past, future; separately or simultaneously. And gets paid to imagine alternate realities.

Architecture Decisions + Code


Pallet Rack "Living Building" nerdspace & art installation - Freeman Murray et. al., Kochi, Kerala, 2012.

nb. All code snippets are Clojure. All SQL is written specifically for SQLite, using the Honey SQL library (SQL as Clojure data structures).
The Bet
All data systems are, in reality, temporal data systems. Most just don't know it until it's too late. Things—as life teaches inevitably—have a habit of getting real, real fast. Suddenly, one fine day, life will deliver us a forehead-slapping moment because even that tiny-SaaS indie B2B app has manifested "a sufficiently complicated data system". Because complexity is inevitable.
The Architecture: A Vertically Integrated SaaS Machine
Runaway incidental complexity of software is why computers got slower while hardware and networks got faster. This bothers me no end. I want to profit from the glut of compute without taking on systemic complexity. 9
One way is to build software applications as unified vertically integrated computer systems, as a fruit-named company famously does. And, as is true for contemplating complected objects on hammocks, profiting from full-systems vertical integration isn't just for the absurdly rich global conglomerate.
nb. "Vertical Integration" does NOT mean "Being Rigid". Quite the opposite; it means cultivate total adaptability, situational awareness, and mastery over self and environment. 10
The Trade-Off: Hard to design, Easy to Build-Own-Operate-Teach
The main thing to understand is that changing any single detail of a vertically-integrated system could mandate ripple-effect changes through the whole system… and that is okay.
The indie vertically-integrating systems builder should choose an extreme position:

Either go all-in on a single all-encompassing web SaaS stack (application framework, server runtime, tool chain).
Or make a custom system of composable parts. Entirely avoid building on top of pre-designed monolithic frameworks (most Clojure pros).

Either way is fine. Either way demands significant investment from the committed indie SaaS builder. The only real choice one has, is to own it—learn to fit self to it, or make it fit to self. 11
Above All: Aggressively Minimise System-Wide Complexity
The absurdly not-rich local indie SaaS maker must accept the complexity-management limits of their own smol brain. And that is okay. One poor brain can do a lot, if it asks "So, like, how do I build a unified, coherent system specialised to me—my goals, needs, and indeed, to my way of thinking?", which is…

no cloud services lock-in (no VC funding. no funding at all, actually.)
no framework lock-in (a-la-carte pieces)
no tool-bench / process lock-in (design own tools shaped for own brain)
no devops clones (dead-simple deployments, observability, failover etc.)
no (future) customer data lock-in (must be local-first compatible)

Well, I am a grug-brained developer 12 therefore "the system" must be small conceptually, and literally. It is mission-critical to build the system piecemeal, where we intimately know the parts and can fully control interfaces between parts and abstraction boundaries.
In the context of a SaaS web application it means:

Single-server installation

App, db, cache, queue, document store, server, proxy; everything on one box
To scale, beef up server

Unified Application + Database architecture

In-process databases only
Universal, static, zero-migration storage schema
All application-specific materialised views as application code i.e. the application is not "just a DB wrapper".
Optionally, single tenancy. One DB per tenant, for regional compliance, and horizontal scaling as a nice side-benefit.
No write concurrency. All database operations are one-way loops.
No "Distributed Local-first". Local-first mode is unauthenticated single-user. Server-mode is bog standard synchronous SaaS.

Immutability by default

idempotence where immutability gets too involved to implement correctly

in-place mutation only as a rare, purposeful, escape hatch when both immutability and idempotence get too complex or too resource-hungry


One DB Engine to rule them all

Primary store
K/V store
Sessions store
Cache
Document store


Two Wee VMs, please. One to serve, one for failover.
Seriously.
Computers today—even the cheap shared VMs—are stupid-fast. A properly built web app can use the smallest VM below, to support a healthy SaaS business, with room to grow. Add one more box on hot standby for failover.

Feed cheap disks to storage-hungry Temporal Databases
Current Databases terrify the temporal database engineer. A current database is a giant mass of global mutable state. It has no innate sense of time. And current database engineers inevitably have to manage concurrency. Some even have to delve into the dark arts of Multi Version Concurrency Control. 14
This mortal fear causes temporal database designers to copy accountants, who have been doing temporal data engineering for centuries. Why not tackle the far simpler problem of making everything append-only? Make a DB engine which will guarantee that at such-and-such time it faithfully recorded <this set of claimed facts>, as-given, nondestructively.
However, copying accountants isn't free.

For one, temporal databases hoard data; chomping Terabytes for breakfast. The stuff of DB-tuning nightmares of current data engineers.
For another, without the right tools, we risk being Disk-wise but Query-foolish. We mitigate this by copying architects (of software).

Here are some worth copying.
Clojure: Namespaces and Immutability are honking great ideas
We want to constrain all entities to well-known, guaranteed globally-qualified namespaces. So…

world is the only global namespace we permit, and is also the only single-segmented namespace
all other namespaces must be minimum two-segmented, such as com.acmecorp or com.acmecorp.foo-client.
ns_name must only ever be the namespace part (such as com.acmecorp or world) of a fully qualified entity name (of com.acmecorp/user or world/administrator).

All SQL is written for SQLite, using Honey SQL by Sean Corfield.

SQL as Clojure data structures. Build queries programmatically – even at runtime – without having to bash strings together.

SQLite in WAL mode is the poor man's single-computer Datomic—one sequential writer, many concurrent readers, mutually non-blocking, with globally atomic transactions. To be clear, Datomic itself can be the poor man's single-computer Datomic. Ditto for XTDB and Rama. Clojure programmers will do well to study the Clojure agent primitive, to build a good mental model about SQLite in WAL mode.
Code: SaaSy SQLite Configuration
Some recommended PRAGMA settings to use SQLite as a web backend.
{:dbtype "sqlite"
 ;; INCREMENTAL = 2. Set manually. Not supported by xerial.
 :auto_vacuum "INCREMENTAL"
 :connectionTestQuery "PRAGMA journal_mode;" ; used by HikariCP
 :preferredTestQuery "PRAGMA journal_mode;" ; used by C3P0
 ;; :maximumPoolSize max-concurrency ; not supported by Xerial
 :dataSourceProperties
 {:limit_worker_threads 4
  :enable_load_extension true ; disabled by default for security
  :busy_timeout 5000 ; ms, set per connection
  :foreign_keys "ON" ; ON = boolean 1, set per connection
  :cache_size -50000 ; KiB = 50 MiB, set per connection
  :journal_mode "WAL" ; supported by xerial JDBC driver
  ;; NORMAL = 1, set per connection
  :synchronous "NORMAL"}}
* nb. Some PRAGMAS are set at the DB level, and others are set on a per-connection basis. I'm using HikariCP connection pooling library to help me do this cleanly (paired with xerial's JDBC driver for SQLite).
However, I might be able to drop HikariCP… the spirit of "fewer dependencies, better life" is hard to ignore. Just look at Anders Murphy's neato work on hyperlith ("the hypermedia based monolith", using Datastar and Clojure), and sqlite4clj. See the hyperlith examples, particularly OneBillionCells: code, demo. Rad!
XTDB: All facts are bitemporal by design
The full, faithfully recorded, append-only log of world facts, as claimed by any of the pre-registered users, about any of the pre-registered entities, belonging to pre-registered namespaces.
HoneySQL: Our central append-only "World Facts" table


"World Facts".

   ;; Permit facts only from known, pre-registered users.

   ;; Permit facts only about known, pre-registered entities.
   ]]}
Realities are arrows. Time marks flight. UUIDv7 is Time.
Processes are happening. Facts are being recorded. Events occur along a virtual timeline, not a physical one.
Instead of compositing a physical time and a virtual ID into one identifier, why not use a virtual time-is-a-vector style identifier and derive physical time from it for use in our normal day to day SQL queries, in addition to also having an identifier that is a standard requiring no coordination to create, is globally conflict-free, and is SQL DB indexing-friendly as well as query-friendly? In a world where disks are cheap, and data generation is unlimited, we can afford to waste computer resources on giant IDs instead of compact little Integers that overflow.
UUIDv7 helps us express this concept. This is crucial for conflict management.
Our system relies on the guarantee that valid_id is globally unique, even when the UNIX time component of valid-id for multiple colliding facts is the same.
The default decision heuristic is "latest asserted fact wins". The "last write wins" principle is popularly used by the local-first community too (e.g. in CRDTs).
Of course, this thumb rule is not always acceptable. Humans will disagree about the facts for un-computable reasons.
For example, different editors at the publisher Target may lay different claims to the same titular character name: claim conflicting values, and/or different asserted states. Now they have to duke it out and decide which assertion or redaction should apply for that EA pair at a given physical time.

The tie-break may be "We compromise on this particular version of facts""
select * from world_facts
where valid_id = '01978840-4816-787c-8aab-d39bd088754b';"
We break the tie in our world_facts table, using a boolean column, valid_preferred. We allow in-place updates to this field because that makes life simpler. Alternative tie-break choices:

"We hereby decree that such-and-such is the preferred version of the facts to use for all as-of queries."

update world_facts set valid_preferred = 1
where valid_id = '01978840-4816-787c-8aab-d39bd088754b';

"First dibs wins", based on the transaction ID of the E/A pair.

update world_facts set valid_preferred = 1
where e = 'character-id-42' and
      a ='character/name' and
      txn_id = '01978840-4816-787c-8aab-d39bd088754b';

"Only use Charlie's choice names for the character; henceforth and retroactively."

update world_facts set valid_preferred = 1
where e = 'character-id-42' and
      a ='character/name' and
      owner_ref = 'com.target/editor-charlie';
nb. A proper setter query must ensure valid_preferred is set to true for exactly one world_fact, in a set of disputed colliding facts. And it should append a new world_fact, stating for the record, that such-and-such valid_id was set to valid_preferred =
true at such-and-such time, by such-and-such user.
HoneySQL: Current DB is just a VIEW of valid World Facts as-of-now


The Current Database: "World Facts As Of Now".

SQLite's window queries are handy!
{:create-view [:world_facts_as_of_now :if-not-exists]
 :select [:rowid
          :txn_time :valid_time
          :e :a :v
          :ns_user_ref :fact_meta]
 :from {:select [:*
                 [[:over
                   [[:row_number]
                    {:partition-by [:e :a],
                     :order-by [[:valid_preferred :desc]
                                [:txn_id :desc]]}
                    :row_num]]]]
        :from :world_facts}
 :where [:and [:= :row_num 1] [:= :assert 1]]
 :order-by [[:rowid :asc]]}

HoneySQL: Current DB: Indices and Full Text Search for great good
The DDLs are elided because they are boring.
Indices: Basically, we may create reverse indices of Facts, to support query patterns, as needed. Some possible indices for day-to-day "online" use, to be created on the "current world facts" view.

EAV: Entity, Attribute, Value
EAVTx: EAV, TransactionTime
AEVTx
AVETx
VxAETx: ValidTime, AETx

Normally, we wouldn't want to touch our lynchpin "World Facts" table. Indices consume disk space and that table will grow fast. The same indices might be required for retroactive "audit" use cases. Ideally I would do this sort of querying "offline", against a snapshot of the primary DB.
For Full Text Search, I intend to use SQLite's built-in 'FTS5' extension. It requires a bit of SQL writin'—make a Virtual Table, and then write a bunch of Triggers to keep it up-to date. Again, very boring SQL, well documented at the extension's page. It just needs writing, is all.
Something like this…
(defn search-world-facts-as-of-now
  "Run the given search query against the FTS table and
   return a match from the original world_facts table."
  ([where-search-clause-raw-sql]
   (search-world-facts-as-of-now
    (partial format "fts_world_facts_as_of_now MATCH %s")
    where-search-clause-raw-sql))
  ([search-term-formatter where-search-clause-raw-sql]
   (hsql/format
    {:select [:world_facts.*]
     :from [:fts_world_facts_as_of_now]
     :join [:world_facts
            [:=
             :fts_world_facts_as_of_now.rowid
             :world_facts.rowid]]
     :where [:raw (search-term-formatter
                   where-search-clause-raw-sql)]
     :order-by [:rank]}
    {:inline true})))
Rama: Views are just data. Materialize in Clojure. Not in SQL.
The temporal database does not discriminate when storing facts. Consequently, any given temporal database could contain any of…

At least a partial snapshot of at least one Reality,
OR several partial snapshots of one Reality,
OR several partial snapshots of several, possibly alternate and parallel, Realities.

The great power (and great responsibility) to decide the concretely materialised reality of the world resides solely in the hands of the party interrogating the temporal database.
Therefore, the temporal database designer must create interrogation tools (query languages, data storage and access formats etc.) so the temporal data engineer can sift through a veritable multiverse, to figure out what "the world" looked like as of whatever time interests them.
I have been warned that attempting temporal queries with SQL will cause obnoxious joins, strange indexing schemes, finicky triggers, stored procedures from hell, and non-standard shenanigans specific to the database engine in question. 15.
See James Henderson's "Building a Bitemporal Index" series—parts one, two, and three—to get a flavour of temporal query patterns that challenge current databases as well as current data engineers. Haunting questions like Why do you need to use a database with bitemporality baked in anyway?
Fortunately, if we play our cards right, this all-you-can-eat pedantic fact-recording can help us create truly general-purpose data systems. For example, Specter is a critical piece of Rama's query infrastructure, allowing the system to cheaply query materialised views.

A lot of Rama programming revolves around materializing views (PStates), which are literally just data structures interacted with using the exact same Specter API as used to interact with in-memory data structures. This stands in stark contrast with databases, which have fixed data models and special APIs for interacting with them. Any database can be replicated in a PState in both expressivity and performance, since a data model is just a specific combination of data structures (e.g. key/value is a map, column-oriented is a map of sorted maps, document is a map of maps, etc.).

We will embed all on-demand views in code, using plain ol' Clojure transducers and/or Specter's capabilities.
This endows our vertically integrated tiny-SaaS system with the Poor Man's cheap copy of Rama's task model of distributed programming.

Views always travel with the web application.
The database is always in-process.
The data file itself is always machine-local.
Each tenant gets their own dedicated SQLite database.

Further, it means that migrations occur NOT by futzing with database schemas, but by rolling out a new version of application code.
So, if the database architecture and schema never changes, and I don't screw up writing to it, then I should never ever need to run a schema migration. In the off-chance that I do need to physically migrate schema, I will be forced to do it in an append-only way, because that's how SQLite data migrations work the best and safest. Which is a good corner to box oneself into, because it forces us to do nondestructive migrations, be they of schema or of data. This makes gradual roll-outs and complete roll-backs fairly safe.
SQLite has one more compelling feature.
SQLite: Flexible typing for the win
Without this, the Facts table would be rather ungainly. With flexible typing, our 'numeric' values are stored as efficiently as they can be stored. Numbers are stored as numbers. Text is stored as text. Booleans are stored as booleans. In the very same column.
However, it does not protect us the way Datomic, XTDB, and Rama do. We have to make our own guardrails to safely use SQLite as if it were a temporal database.

Work against a strictly constrained world (namespaces, users, entities)
Emulate immutability for the most part (append-only facts).
Use Idempotence (upsert entities -> facts)
Facts must include all actions happening within the world, including addition, removal, updates to namespaces, users, entities, fact meta-data, and set-preferred-fact choices.

Something like this…
Transact Facts: Append-only
(defn append-facts!
  ([tx facts]
   (append-facts! tx facts nil))
  ([tx facts owned-by-ns-user-id]
   (jdbc/execute! tx
                  (-> facts
                      (insert-world-facts-hsql
                       owned-by-ns-user-id)
                      hsql/format))))
Transact Entities, Namespaces, Users Idempotently
And append corresponding facts in the world-facts table too. Yes, it doubles up as an audit log for things that were done to the World itself, in addition to things happened inside the World.
(defn transact-entities->facts
  [tx entity-records fact-data]
  (and (seq (upsert-entities! tx entity-records))
       (append-facts! tx
                      (transduce
                       (record->fact-xf "world_entities"
                                        :ns_entity_id
                                        fact-data)
                       conj []
                       entity-records))))

(defn transact-namespaces->entities->facts
  [tx ns-records fact-data]
  (and (seq (upsert-namespaces! tx ns-records))
       (append-facts! tx
                      (transduce
                       (record->fact-xf "world_namespaces"
                                        :ns_name
                                        fact-data)
                       conj []
                       ns-records))
       (transact-entities->facts tx
                                 (ns-records->entity-records
                                  ns-records)
                                 fact-data)))

(defn transact-users->entities->facts
  [tx user-records fact-data]
  (and (seq (upsert-users! tx user-records))
       (append-facts! tx
                      (transduce
                       (record->fact-xf "world_users"
                                        :ns_user_id
                                        fact-data)
                                    conj []
                                    user-records))
       (transact-entities->facts tx
                                 (user-records->entity-records
                                  user-records)
                                 fact-data)))
One more cool thing about SQLite is that it can totally be used as our "Everything DB Engine" (see: oldmoe/litestack), with purpose-specific database files (queue, cache, sessions, documents, key-value store). SQLite's ability to do cross-database joins will doubtless come handy too.
Git and Local-First: Somehow make all facts merge
A fact is a snapshot of an event in time. If we are careful to send facts around so that they are trivial to merge in a facts table, then we can separate out conflict management. Git shows the way. When we fetch changes, the objects are synced to our computer. If a conflict occurs, then what happens to the objects? They remain cached on disk. Git simply refuses to transact the conflict into the live state of the codebase, until someone a) fixes the conflict manually and b) tells git that the conflict is resolved. Git does not know or care about the conflict resolution mechanism. This is because conflicts occur due to essential tacit and implicit context that never travels with the objects. Disambiguation thus requires converging on shared agreement, which is a squishy non-deterministic process at best, chaotic and interminable at worst. Have you heard of laws and lawmakers?
TODO: Production engineering things one ought to do
Things like…

Tests for write integrity

See if we can use spec / malli to generatively test this

Model an example domain of sufficient complexity

A single example customer (presuming a tenant per DB)
All their users
All their workflows
All their data

Offload complex joins to the app (specter)

But only a pre-filtered subset lifted from the database

The world_facts table is going to grow very fast. Measure latency at various orders of magnitude, for the same example domain complexity, for the same line-of-business read/write pattern (SaaS-y 80% read, 20% write, for example).

1 M facts
10 M facts
100 M facts
1000 M facts

etc…

Basically, try to find out all the ways this will fail to satisfy the "can I get away with it" criterion.
Postamble / Rant As A Recap (same thing)
A gaggle of reasons 16 diverted me onto this long road to a small mangy database 17.

wannabe be an Independent Software Vendor,
specialised in building niche SaaS products,
operating on dirt-cheap server infrastructure,
with super-duper low maintenance overhead,
while being able to extend the SaaS to local-first usage 18

As a consequence:

Most crucially, I must design and build a system that I can hold in my head and explain to anyone. It is a form of buyer investment protection. If any business buys my software, they must have assurance that not just their data, but the whole application will be accessible to any other competent party they wish to transfer operations and upkeep to. It's one thing to transfer software and data custody, but a whole other ballgame to transfer ownership.
All SaaS building blocks must be compact, stable, and composable.
Rework must be designed out.

The following have been sloshing about my skull, in no particular order:

SQLite for web backends
Local First software and private data sovereignty
Entity-Attribute-Value modeling
Bitemporal data systems
The meaning of time
A healthy avoidance of schema migrations
Immutability
Idempotence (often the next-best thing to immutability, and sometimes even better)
Concurrency (especially concurrent read/write independence)

At the end of the road, the specific choice of trying this in SQLite boils down to:

Necessary Frugality
Necessary Archival
Unnecessarily Having a Smol Grug Brain
Unnecessarily Caring Too Much
Unnecessarily Poor Impulse Control

The end customers, in this particular case, survive largely on love and fresh air and the mercurial generosity of arts-supporting sponsors. But that fact is valid for any indie web app I make too. So the SaaS-es must be dirt-cheap to run. And I should be able to trivially power them up and down and up again.
Complete database exports must be made available, on-demand, in a universally query-able, archive-grade format. The database itself must be archive-grade. Only SQLite publicly guarantees availability till 2050. And they are one of a few formats approved by the US Library of Congress for data archival.
Because though We are one, and We are little, and We live like an artist, We care about sovereign data ownership a bit too much, especially when the Sovereign is the poor NPC at the bottom of the B2B food chain.
It must be trivial to store each customer's data in the appropriate geography. And to offer it for download on demand. And to forget it completely, when asked. And to be able to prove that we've done so.
No, we can't use automagic managed services, because that means deep vendor lock-in.
Last but not least, The Whole Thing Must be Single Operator Friendly Especially If Said Operator Will Necessarily Have To Operate Internationally, Meaning They Can Easily Run Afoul Of Data Residency and Privacy Laws That They Cannot Humanly Know Or Keep Abreast Of. Like Ever . 19

We found that they can: our AI-generated Metal kernels were 1.87x faster across 215 PyTorch modules, with some workloads running hundreds of times faster than baseline.Why use AI to generate kernels for Apple devices?AI models execute on hardware via GPU kernels that define each operation. The efficiency of those kernels determines how fast models run (in training and inference). Kernel optimizations like FlashAttention1 show dramatic speedups over baseline, underscoring the need for performant kernels.While PyTorch and tools like torch.compile2 handle some kernel optimizations, the last mile of performance still depends on handtuned kernels. These kernels are difficult to write, requiring significant time and expertise. It gets especially challenging when writing kernels outside of CUDA: expertise in non-CUDA platforms is rarer, and there is less tooling and documentation availableWe set out to answer a simple question: could frontier models implement kernel optimizations automatically, across different backends? Billions of Apple devices rely on Metal kernels that are often under-optimized, so we started with Metal.Our vision: Autonomous kernel optimization for any target platform using frontier models.Across 215 PyTorch modules, our results show the generated kernels ran 87% faster on Apple hardware compared to baseline PyTorch. This approach requires no expertise in kernel engineering and can be done nearly instantly.Here's a preview of what we discovered:Many cases where our approach improved performance by 10-100XCases where models surfaced algorithmically unnecessary work and removed it (that PyTorch didn't catch)The impact of incorporating performance profiling and CUDA reference codeWhy a simple agentic swarm dominates over individual frontier modelsMethodologyWe included 8 frontier models from Anthropic, DeepSeek, and OpenAI in our analysis:Anthropic familyclaude-sonnet-4 (2025-05-14)claude-opus-4 (2025-05-14)OpenAI familygpt-4o (2024-11-20)gpt-4.1 (2025-04-14)gpt-5 (2025-08-07)o3 (2025-04-16)DeepSeek familydeepseek-v3 (2025-03-25)deepseek-r1 (2025-05-28)In terms of test inputs, we used the PyTorch modules defined in the KernelBench3 dataset. KernelBench contains 250 PyTorch modules defining ML workloads of varying complexity. 31 modules contain operations that are currently unsupported in the PyTorch backend for MPS (Metal Performance Shaders), so they were excluded from this analysis. (We ended up excluding 4 additional modules for reasons that will be discussed later.)KernelBench CategoryDescription# of Test CasesLevel 1Simple primitive operations (e.g. matrix multiplication, convolution)91Level 2Sequences of multiple operations from Level 174Level 3Complete model architectures (e.g. AlexNet, VGG)50When evaluating the agent-generated kernels, we need to assess both correctness and performance relative to the baseline PyTorch implementation (at the time of writing, torch.compile support for Metal is still underway, so it could not serve as a comparison point. MLX is also a great framework for Apple devices, but this work focused on pure PyTorch code optimization, whereas MLX is its own framework). We also made sure to carefully clear the cache between runs, otherwise cached results can falsely present as speedups.Experimental VariableSpecificationHardwareMac Studio (Apple M4 Max chip)ModelsClaude Opus 4, Claude Sonnet, DeepSeek r1, DeepSeek v3, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, GPT-5, o3DatasetKernelBenchBaseline ImplementationPyTorch eager modeNumber of shots5First approach: A simple, kernel-writing agent for MetalWe begin with the simplest implementation of the kernel-writing agent for Metal:Receives the prompt and PyTorch codeGenerates Metal kernelsAssesses if they match the baseline PyTorch for correctness4.If they fail to compile or are not correct, an error message is passed back to the agent for another try, with up to 5 tries permitted.It's interesting to see how the correctness increases with the number of attempts. o3, for example, gets a working implementation about 60% of the time on the first try, and reaches 94% working implementations by attempt 5.o3's success rate by generation attempt and kernel level. We limited the agent to 5 tries, which seems sufficient for Level 1 and 2 kernels, but Level 3 kernels may benefit from further shots.Let's look at each of our 8 models correctness rates, broken down by whether or not the implementation was faster than our baseline or not:Kernel correctness, broken down by whether or not the optimized version was faster than the baseline.The reasoning models are pretty good at generating correct kernels across levels, although the non-reasoning models are also capable of doing this sometimes. However, other than GPT-5, these models are more often generating implementations that are slower than the baseline PyTorch. GPT-5's success at generating faster implementations for Level 2 problems is particularly notable.How did the generated kernels do?Every agent produced some kernels that were faster than baseline, and some of them came up with pretty cool stuff. GPT-5 produced a 4.65X speedup for a Mamba 25 state space model, primarily by fusing kernels to reduce the overhead of kernel launch and improve memory access patterns.Mamba2 ExamplePyTorch InputGenerated KernelsSome of the optimizations were surprisingly clever. In one case, o3 improved latency by over 9000X! o3 assessed the code and identified that given the model's configuration, the results would always be 0s, mathematically. This was not a trivial realization, but it did make the implementation itself trivial.There were 4 problems, all from Level 2, where the most optimal implementation showed that the problem could be reduced to a trivial solution. Despite the true cleverness shown by the models, we excluded these from our analysis - but in the real use cases with imperfect code, this type of speedup mechanism would be quite useful.Trivial ExamplePyTorch InputGenerated KernelsOne interesting thing to note is that the AI-generated kernels don't actually have to be faster every single time to be useful. For long running workloads, it makes sense to profile different implementations - this could even happen automatically. So as long as the AI-generated implementation is sometimes faster, it's valuable - we can always fall back to the baseline implementation when the AI-generated implementation doesn't work or is slower.Let's evaluate the average speedup compared to the baseline for each of our 8 agents. Based on our realization above, the minimum speedup is always 1X - this is the case where the generated implementation either doesn't work or is slower than the baseline. We use the geometric mean here rather than the arithmetic mean6.Average speedup by model, broken down by level.We can see that using GPT-5 produces an average speedup of ~20%, with the other models trailing. One possible conclusion: we should use GPT-5 for kernel generation, possibly giving it some additional context. This would make sense if all of the models tended to behave the same way - generally finding the same optimizations on a consistent set of problems, and failing to optimize other problems.This isn't what the data actually shows though! Breaking it down by which model did the best across problems, we see that GPT-5 does the best, at 34% of problems where it generates the best solution. But there are another 30% of problems where another model generated a better solution than GPT-5!Across problem levels, this chart shows which model performed the best (or baseline if none of the models beat the baseline performance).An agentic swarm for kernel generationThis leads to a key insight: kernel generation should use a "Best of N" strategy. Extra generation passes are relatively cheap, it's human effort and the runtime of the model (once deployed) that are expensive.Our flow for optimized kernel generation now looks like an agentic swarm. We have a supervisor, which is simple for now. It assesses the generated kernels across all agents, times them against the baseline, and then selects the optimal implementation for the problem. The ability to time and verify implementations against a baseline makes kernel generation a really good candidate for AI generation - it's much more convenient than some other code generation use cases, because we need minimal supervision to evaluate results on the fly.The architecture of our agentic swarm for kernel generation. In this iteration, the supervisor is simple, but in upcoming work we will extend the supervisor to be more dynamic.Let's see how our agentic swarm performs compared to the standalone models' performance from earlier.Performance of the initial agentic swarm implementation for kernel generation, showing significantly improved results compared to standalone agents.We can see this approach gives us better results than even GPT-5 - an average 31% speedup across all levels, 42% speedup in Level 2 problems. The agentic swarm is doing a pretty good job already with minimal context - just the input problem and prompt. Next, we tried giving more context to the agents in order to get even faster kernels.Adding more context to improve performanceWhat information would a human kernel engineer need to improve the performance of their hand-written kernels? Two key sources come to mind: another optimized reference implementation, and profiling information.As a result, we gave our agents the power to take in two additional sources of information when generating kernels for Metal:A CUDA implementation for those kernels (since optimized CUDA references are often available due to the pervasiveness of Nvidia GPUs)Profiling information from gputrace on the M4.Unfortunately, Apple does not make the Metal kernel profiling information easy to pull programmatically via Xcode… So we had to get creative.We solved the problem by using Bluem's cliclick tool to interact with Xcode's GUI. Our Apple Script capture summary, memory and timeline views for each collected gputrace:Example screenshot from Xcode used for analysis. You can see in the screenshot above that there is a clear pipeline bubble after the ndArrayPooling, resulting in idle time.We could only add profiling information to models that support multimodal inputs. We divided out the screenshot processing into a subagent, whose job it was to provide performance optimization hints to the main model. The main agent took an initial pass at implementation, which was then profiled and timed. Screenshots were then passed to the subagent to generate performance hints. The maximum number of shots remained the same as before - 5 shots total.Subagent architectureSimilar to our previous finding that the best model varied depending on the problem, we also saw that there was no "single best" configuration in terms of context. Sometimes, adding just one piece of information - either the CUDA reference code or the profiling information - produced the best result. Other times, adding both was helpful. There were still cases where the pure agents with no additional context performed better than the agents with more context!Best agent context configuration by problem level. We can see that the baseline PyTorch is now only superior to the best generated kernels in about ~8% of cases.The results are particularly striking for Level 2 kernels. Our assessment is that this is because Level 2 kernels benefit more from fusion than Level 1 kernels. Level 3, on the other hand, may be too complex to generate in a single pass. Stay tuned for some improvements where we break down the problem into more manageable chunks for the agent to handle.That being said, there were still some good kernels for Level 3. DeepSeek-R1 improved on the default implementation with advanced fusion techniques for a VisionAttention problem. It also showed awareness of Metal-specific features, leveraging threadgroups for more efficient shared memory. While there are still further optimization opportunities left on the table, this implementation was over 18X faster than the baseline PyTorch!VisionAttention ExamplePyTorch InputGenerated KernelsNow, let's evaluate the performance of our agentic swarm. Previously, we did Best of N analysis across all frontier models. Now we do Best of N analysis across the different configurations of each frontier model (CUDA only, CUDA plus profiling, etc). Remember that generating multiple candidate implementations and testing them for performance is a lot "cheaper" than human experts manually writing the code, or running less optimized models at high volume - so offloading more generation to the swarm is worthwhile if it delivers noticeably better results.The overall performance of the full agentic swarm at kernel generation for Metal on the problems tested.This is a great speedup - 1.87x better on average than the baseline, nearly instantly, directly from pure PyTorch code. The vanilla agents only saw a 1.31x average speedup, so adding in this additional context almost tripled the improvement we saw!Looking at the distribution of improvements, we see that the median speedup was about 1.35X and 2 kernels were hundreds of times faster than the original implementation. (As mentioned before, we excluded the 4 "trivial" kernels, which were thousands of times faster by cutting out unnecessary work.)The distribution of speedups for the agentic swarm (215 problems total, 4 trivial kernels with large speedups excluded). Median speedup was 1.35X, (geometric) mean 1.87X, with 2 kernels 100X or more faster.Wrapping upThese results show that it's possible to automatically drive significant improvements to model performance by automating the kernel optimization without any user code changes, new frameworks, or porting.AI can take on portions of optimization that a human kernel engineer would do, leaving the human effort focused on the most complex optimizations.Soon, developers can get immediate boosts to their model performance via AI-generated kernels, without low-level expertise or needing to leave pure PyTorch:Dynamically speeding up training workloads as they runAutomatic porting new models to new frameworks/devices (not just Metal)Speeding up large scale inference workloadsWe are hard at work at pushing the envelope further with this technique - smarter agent swarms, better context, more collaboration between agents, and more backends (ROCm, CUDA, SYCL, etc). We're also working on speeding up training workloads, not just inference.With this technique, new models can be significantly faster on every platform on day 0. If you're excited about this direction, we'd love to hear from you: hello@gimletlabs.ai.We can automatically speed up kernels across any target platform using this technique.FootnotesTri Dao, Daniel Fu, Stefano Ermon, Atri Rudra, and Christopher Ré.

          Posted
          August 30, 2023
        
    
    
  
  A few months ago, I set myself the challenge of writing a C compiler in 500 lines of Python1, after writing my SDF donut post.
How hard could it be?
The answer was, pretty hard, even when dropping quite a few features.
But it was also pretty interesting, and the result is surprisingly functional and not too hard to understand!
There's too much code for me to comprehensively cover in a single blog post2, so I'll just give an overview of the decisions I made, things I had to cut, and the general architecture of the compiler, touching on a representative piece of each part.
Hopefully after reading this post, the code is more approachable!

  
Decisions, decisions
The first, and most critical decision, was that this would be a single-pass compiler.
500 lines is too spare to be defining and transforming an abstract syntax tree!
What does that mean?

  
Most compilers: faffing around with syntax trees
Well, most compiler's internals look something like this:



The tokens get lexed, then a parser runs over them and builds pretty little syntax trees:
# hypothetical code, not from anywhere
def parse_statement(lexer) -> PrettyLittleSyntaxTree:
    ...
    if type := lexer.try_next(TYPE_NAME):
        variable_name = lexer.next(IDENTIFIER)

        if lexer.try_next("="):
            initializer = parse_initializer(lexer)
        else:
            initializer = None

        lexer.next(SEMICOLON)

        return VariableDeclarationNode(
            type = type,
            name = variable_name,
            initializer = initializer,
        )
    ...

# much later...
def emit_code_for(node: PrettyLittleSyntaxTree) -> DisgustingMachineCode:
    ...
    if isinstance(node, VariableDeclarationNode):
        slot = reserve_stack_space(node.type.sizeof())
        add_to_environment(node.name, slot)
        if node.initializer is not None:
            register = emit_code_for(node.initializer)
            emit(f"mov {register}, [{slot}]")
    ...

The important thing here is that there's two passes, first the parsing builds up a syntax tree, then a second pass chews that tree up and turns it into machine code.
That's really useful for most compilers!
It keeps the parsing and codegen separate, so each can evolve independently.
It also means that you can transform the syntax tree before using it to generate code—for example, by applying optimizations to it.
In fact, most compilers have multiple levels of "intermediate representations" between the syntax tree and codegen!
This is really great, good engineering, best practices, recommended by experts, etc.
But… it takes too much code, so we can't do it.
Instead, we'll be single-pass: code generation happens during parsing.
We parse a bit, emit some code, parse a bit more, emit a bit more code.
So for example, here's some real code from the c500 compiler for parsing the prefix ~ op:
# lexer.try_next() checks if the next token is ~, and if so, consumes
# and returns it (truthy)
elif lexer.try_next("~"):
    # prefix() parses and generates code for the expression after the ~,
    # and load_result emits code to load it, if needed
    meta = load_result(prefix())
    # immediately start yeeting out the negation code!
    emit("i32.const 0xffffffff")
    emit("i32.xor")
    # webassembly only supports 32bit types, so if this is a smaller type,
    # mask it down
    mask_to_sizeof(meta.type)
    # return type information
    return meta

Notice there's no syntax trees, no PrefixNegateOp nodes.
We see some tokens and immediately spit out the corresponding instructions.
You may have noticed those instructions are WebAssembly, which leads us into the next section...

  
Using WebAssembly, for some reason?
So I decided to make the compiler target WebAssembly.
I honestly don't know why I did this, it really didn't make it easier—I guess I was just curious?
WebAssembly is a really weird target, especially for C.
Besides the somewhat-external issues like spending a lot of time confused before I realized WebAssembly v2 is pretty different than WebAssembly v1, the instruction set itself is weird.
For one, there's no goto.
Instead, you have blocks—structured assembly, imagine that!—and "break" instructions that jump to either the beginning or end of a specific nesting-level of block.
This was basically inconsequential for if and while, but made implementing for extremely cursed, which we'll go over later.
Additionally, WebAssembly doesn't have registers, it has a stack, and is a stack machine.
At first you might think that's awesome, right?
C needs a stack!
We can just use the WebAssembly stack as our C stack!
Nope, because you can't take references to the WebAssembly stack.
So instead, we need to maintain our own in-memory stack anyways, and then shuffle it on and off of the WASM parameter stack.
So in the end, I think I ended up with slightly more code than I would have needed to target a more normal ISA like x86 or ARM.
But it was interesting!
And theoretically, you could run code compiled with c500 in a browser, although I haven't tried (I just use the wasmer CLI).

  
Error handling
It basically doesn't.
There's a function die, which is called when anything weird happens and dumps a compiler stack trace—if you're lucky, you get a line number and a somewhat-vague error message.
------------------------------

  File "...compiler.py", line 835, in <module>
    compile("".join(fi))  # todo: make this line-at-a-time?

  File "...compiler.py", line 14, in die
    traceback.print_stack()

------------------------------

error on line 9: unknown variable c

The Rust compiler, this is not :-)

  
What to drop
Finally, I had to decide what not to support, since it just wasn't feasible to get all of C into 500 lines. (sorry!)
I decided I wanted a really decent sampling of features that tested what the general implementation approach was capable of—for example, if I had skipped pointers, I could have just gotten away with the WASM parameter stack and shed a lot of complexity, but that would have felt like cheating.
I ended up implementing the following features:

arithmetic operations and binary operators, with proper precedence
int, short, and char types
string constants (with escapes)
pointers (of however many levels), including correct pointer arithmetic (incrementing an int* adds 4)
arrays (only single-level, not int[][])
functions
typedefs (and the lexer hack!)

Notably, it doesn't support:

structs :-( would be possible with more code, the fundamentals were there, I just couldn't squeeze it in
enums / unions
preprocessor directives (this would probably be 500 lines by itself...)
floating point. would also be possible, the wasm_type stuff is in, again just couldn't squeeze it in
8 byte types (long/long long or double)
some other small things like pre/post cremements, in-place initialization, etc., which just didn't quite fit
any sort of standard library or i/o that isn't returning an integer from main()
casting expressions

The compiler passes 34/220 test cases in the c-testsuite.
More importantly to me, it can compile and run the following program successfully:
int swap(int* a, int* b) {
  int t;
  t = *a; *a = *b; *b = t;
  return t;
}

int fib(int n) {
  int a, b;
  for (a = b = 1; n > 2; n = n - 1) {
    swap(&a, &b);
    b = b + a;
  }
  return b;
}

int main() {
  return fib(10); // 55
}

OK, enough about deciding things, let's get into the code!

  
Helper types
There's a small collection of helper types and classes that the compiler uses.
None of them are particularly strange, so I'll pass over them fairly quickly.

  
Emitter (compiler.py:21)
This is a singleton helper to emit nicely-formatted WebAssembly code.
WebAssembly, at least the textual format, is formatted as s-expressions, but individual instructions don't need to be parenthesized:
(module
  ;; <snip...>
  (func $swap
    (param $a i32)
    (param $b i32)
    (result i32)
    global.get $__stack_pointer ;; prelude -- adjust stack pointer
    i32.const 12
    i32.sub
    ;; <snip...>
  )
)

Emitter just helps with emitting code with nice indentation so it's easier to read.
It also has a no_emit method, which will be used for an ugly hack later—stay tuned!

  
StringPool (compiler.py:53)
StringPool holds all the string constants so they can be arranged in a contiguous region of memory, and hands out addresses into that for the codegen to use.
When you write char *s = "abc" in c500, what really happens is:

StringPool appends a null terminator
StringPool checks if it's already stored "abc", and if so, just hands that address back
Otherwise, StringPool adds it to a dictionary along with the base address + the total byte length stored so far—the address of this new string in the pool
StringPool hands that address back
When all the code is finished compiling, we create an rodata section with the giant concatenated string produced by StringPool, stored at the string pool base address (retroactively making all the addresses StringPool handed out valid)


  
Lexer (compiler.py:98)
The Lexer class is complex, because lexing C is complex ((\\([\\abfnrtv'"?]|[0-7]{1,3}|x[A-Fa-f0-9]{1,2})) is a real regex in that code for character escapes), but conceptually simple: the lexer marches along identifying what the token at the current position is.
The caller can peek that token, or it can use next to tell the lexer to advance, "consuming" that token.
It can also use try_next to conditionally advance only if the next token is a certain kind—basically, try_next is a shortcut for if self.peek().kind == token: return self.next().
There's some additionally complexity because of something called the "lexer hack".
Essentially, when parsing C you want to know if something is a type name or variable name (because that context matters for compiling certain expressions), but there's no syntactic distinction between them: int int_t = 0; is perfectly valid C, as is typedef int int_t; int_t x = 0;.
To know if an arbitrary token int_t is a type name or a variable name, we need to feed type information from the parsing/codegen stage back into the lexer.
This is a giant pain for regular compilers that want to keep their lexer, parser, and codegen modules pure and plantonically separate, but it's actually not very hard for us!
I'll explain it more when we get to the typedef section, but basically we just keep types: set[str] in Lexer, and when lexing, check if a token is in that set before giving it a token kind:
if m := re.match(r"^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*", self.src[self.loc :]):
    tok = m.group(0)
    ...
    # lexer hack
    return Token(TOK_TYPE if tok in self.types else TOK_NAME, tok, self.line)


  
CType (compiler.py:201)
This is just a dataclass for representing information about a C type, like you'd write in int **t or short t[5] or char **t[17], minus the t.
It contains:

the type's name (with any typedefs resolved), such as int or short
what level of pointer is is (0 = not a pointer, 1 = int *t, 2 = int **t, and so on)
what the array size is (None = not an array, 0 = int t[0], 1 = int t[1], and so on)

Notably, as mentioned before, this type only supports single-level arrays, and not nested arrays like int t[5][6].

  
FrameVar and StackFrame (compiler.py:314)
These classes handle our C stack frames.
As I mentioned before, because you can't take references to the WASM stack, we have to manually handle the C stack, we can't use the WASM one.
To set up the C stack, the prelude emitted in __main__ sets up a global __stack_pointer variable, and then every function call decrements that by however much space the function needs for its parameters and local variables—calculated by that function's StackFrame instance.
I'll go over how that calculation works in more detail when we get to parsing functions, but essentially, each parameter and local variable gets a slot in that stack space, and increases StackFrame.frame_size (and thus the offset of the next variable) depending on its size.
The offset, type information, and other data for each parameter and local variable are stored in a FrameVar instance, in StackFrame.variables, in order of declaration.

  
ExprMeta (compiler.py:344)
This final dataclass is used to track whether the result of an expression is a value or a place.
We need to keep track of this distinction in order to handle certain expressions differently based on how they're used.
For example, if you have a variable x of type int, it can be used in two ways:

x + 1 wants the value of x, say 1, to operate on
&x wants the address of x, say 0xcafedead

When we parse the x expression, we can easily fetch the address from the stack frame:
# look the variable up in the `StackFrame`
var, offset = frame.get_var_and_offset(varname)
# put the base address of the C stack on top of the WASM stack
emit(f"global.get $__stack_pointer")
# add the offset (in the C stack)
emit(f"i32.const {offset}")
emit("i32.add")
# the address of the variable is now on top of the WASM stack

But now what?
If we i32.load this address to get the value, then &x will have no way to get the address.
But if we don't load it, then x + 1 will try to add one to the address, resulting in 0xcafedeae instead of 2!
That's where ExprMeta comes in: we leave the address on the stack, and return an ExprMeta indicating this is a place:
return ExprMeta(True, var.type)

Then, for operations like + that always want to operate on values instead of places, there's a function load_result that turns any places into values:
def load_result(em: ExprMeta) -> ExprMeta:
    """Load a place `ExprMeta`, turning it into a value
    `ExprMeta` of the same type"""
    if em.is_place:
        # emit i32.load, i32.load16_s, etc., based on the type
        emit(em.type.load_ins())
    return ExprMeta(False, em.type)

...
# in the code for parsing `+`
lhs_meta = load_result(parse_lhs())
...

Meanwhile, an operation like & just doesn't load the result, and instead leaves the address on the stack: in an important sense, & is a no-op in our compiler, since it doesn't emit any code!
if lexer.try_next("&"):
    meta = prefix()
    if not meta.is_place:
        die("cannot take reference to value", lexer.line)
    # type of &x is int* when x is int, hence more_ptr
    return ExprMeta(False, meta.type.more_ptr())

Note also that, despite being an address, the result of & isn't a place! (The code returns an ExprMeta with is_place=False.)
The result of & should be treated like a value, since &x + 1 should add 1 (or rather, sizeof(x)) to the address.
That's why we need the place/value distinction, since just "being an address" isn't enough to know whether the result of an expression should be loaded.
OK, enough about helper classes.
Let's move on to the meat of codegen!

  
Parsing and code generation
The general control flow of the compiler goes like this:



The blue rectangles represent the main functions of the compiler—__main__, compile(), global_declaration(), statement(), and expression().
The long chain of squares at the bottom shows the operator precedence—most of those functions are automatically generated by a higher-order function, however!
I'll go through the blue squares one-by-one and explain anything interesting in each.

  
__main__ (compiler.py:827)
This one is pretty short and dull.
Here it is in full:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import fileinput

    with fileinput.input(encoding="utf-8") as fi:
        compile("".join(fi))  # todo: make this line-at-a-time?

Clearly I never finished that TODO!
The only really interesting thing here is the fileinput module, which you may not have heard of.
From the module docs,

Typical use is:
import fileinput
for line in fileinput.input(encoding="utf-8"):
    process(line)

This iterates over the lines of all files listed in sys.argv[1:],
defaulting to sys.stdin if the list is empty.  If a filename is '-' it
is also replaced by sys.stdin and the optional arguments mode and
openhook are ignored.  To specify an alternative list of filenames,
pass it as the argument to input().  A single file name is also allowed.

This means, technically, c500 supports multiple files!
(If you don't mind them all being concatenated and having messed-up line numbers :-) fileinput is actually fairly sophisticated and has a filelineno() method, I just didn't use it for space reasons.)

  
compile() (compiler.py:805)
compile() is the first interesting function here, and is short enough to also include verbatim:
def compile(src: str) -> None:
    # compile an entire file

    with emit.block("(module", ")"):
        emit("(memory 3)")
        emit(f"(global $__stack_pointer (mut i32) (i32.const {PAGE_SIZE * 3}))")

        emit("(func $__dup_i32 (param i32) (result i32 i32)")
        emit("  (local.get 0) (local.get 0))")
        emit("(func $__swap_i32 (param i32) (param i32) (result i32 i32)")
        emit("  (local.get 1) (local.get 0))")

        global_frame = StackFrame()
        lexer = Lexer(src, set(["int", "char", "short", "long", "float", "double"]))
        while lexer.peek().kind != TOK_EOF:
            global_declaration(global_frame, lexer)

        emit('(export "main" (func $main))')

        # emit str_pool data section
        emit(f'(data $.rodata (i32.const {str_pool.base}) "{str_pool.pooled()}")')

This function handles emitting the module level prelude.
First, we emit a pragma for the WASM VM to reserve 3 pages of memory ((memory 3)), and we set the stack pointer to start at the end of that reserved region (it will grow downwards).
Then, we define two stack manipulation helpers __dup_i32 and __swap_i32.
These should be familiar if you've ever used Forth: dup duplicates the item on top of the WASM stack (a -- a a), and swap swaps the position of the top two items on the WASM stack (a b -- b a).
Next, we initialize a stack frame to hold the global variables, initialize the lexer with the built-in typenames for the lexer hack, and chew up global declarations until we run out!
Finally, we export main and dump the string pool.

  
global_declaration() (compiler.py:743)
This function is too long to inline the whole thing, but the signature looks like this:
def global_declaration(global_frame: StackFrame, lexer: Lexer) -> None:
    # parse a global declaration -- typedef, global variable, or function.
    ...

It handles typedefs, global variables, and functions.
Typedefs are cool, since this is where the lexer hack happens!
if lexer.try_next("typedef"):
    # yes, `typedef int x[24];` is valid (but weird) c
    type, name = parse_type_and_name(lexer)
    # lexer hack!
    lexer.types.add(name.content)
    typedefs[name.content] = type

    lexer.next(";")
    return

We reuse a general type-name parsing tool since typedefs inherit all of C's weird "declaration reflects usage" rules, which is convenient for us. (and less so for the perplexed newbie!)
Then we inform the lexer we've discovered a new type name, so that in the future that token will be lexed as a type name instead of a variable name.
Finally for typedefs, we store the type in the global typedef registry, consume the trailing semicolon, and return back to compile() for the next global declaration.
Importantly, the type we store is a whole parsed type, since if you do typedef int* int_p; and then later write int_p *x, x should get a resulting type of int**—the pointer level is additive!
That means we can't just store the base C typename, and instead need to store an entire CType.
If the declaration wasn't a typedef, we parse a variable type and name.
If we find a ; token we know it's a global variable declaration (since we don't support global initializers).
In that case, we add the global variable to the global stack frame and bail.
if lexer.try_next(";"):
    global_frame.add_var(name.content, decl_type, False)
    return

If there's no semicolon, however, we're definitely dealing with a function.
To generate code for a function, we need to:

Make a new StackFrame for the function, named frame
Then, parse all the parameters and store them in the frame with frame.add_var(varname.content, type, is_parameter=True)
After that, parse all the variable declarations with variable_declaration(lexer, frame), which adds them to frame
Now we know how large the function's stack frame needs to be (frame.frame_size), so we can start emitting the prelude!
First, for all the parameters in the stack frame (added with is_parameter=True), we generate WASM param declarations so the function can be called with the WASM calling convention (passing the parameters on the WASM stack):

for v in frame.variables.values():
    if v.is_parameter:
        emit(f"(param ${v.name} {v.type.wasmtype})")


Then, we can emit a result annotation for the return type, and adjust the C stack pointer to make space for the function's parameters and variables:

emit(f"(result {decl_type.wasmtype})")
emit("global.get $__stack_pointer")
# grow the stack downwards
emit(f"i32.const {frame.frame_offset + frame.frame_size}")
emit("i32.sub")
emit("global.set $__stack_pointer")


For each parameter (in reverse order, because stacks), copy it from the WASM stack to our stack:

for v in reversed(frame.variables.values()):
    if v.is_parameter:
        emit("global.get $__stack_pointer")
        emit(f"i32.const {frame.get_var_and_offset(v.name)[1]}")
        emit("i32.add")
        # fetch the variable from the WASM stack
        emit(f"local.get ${v.name}")
        # and store it at the calculated address in the C stack
        emit(v.type.store_ins())


Finally, we can call statement(lexer, frame) in a loop to codegen all the statements in the function, until we hit the closing bracket:

while not lexer.try_next("}"):
    statement(lexer, frame)


Bonus step: we assume the function will always have a return, so we emit("unreachable") so the WASM analyzer doesn't freak out.

Whoof!
That was a lot.
But that's all for functions, and thus for global_declaration(), so let's move on to statement().

  
statement() (compiler.py:565)
There's a lot of code in statement().
However, most of it is fairly repetitive, so I'll just explain while and for, which should give a good overview.
Remember how WASM doesn't have jumps, and instead has structured control flow?
That's relevant now.
First, let's see how it works with while, where it's not too much trouble.
A while loop in WASM looks like this:
block
  loop
    ;; <test>
    i32.eqz
    br_if 1
    ;; <loop body>
    br 0
  end
end

As you can see, there are two types of blocks—block and loop (there's also an if block type, which I didn't use).
Each encloses some number of statements and then ends with end.
Inside a block, you can break with br, or conditionally based on the top of the WASM stack with br_if (there's also br_table, which I didn't use).
The br family takes a labelidx parameter, here either 1 or 0, which is what level of block the operation applies to.
So in our while loop, the br_if 1 applies to the outer block—index 1, while the br 0 applies to the inner block—index 0. (indices are always relative to the instruction in question—0 is the innermost block to that instruction.)
Finally, the last rule to know is that a br in a block jumps forwards, to the end of the block, whereas a br in a loop jumps backwards, to the beginning of the loop.
So hopefully the while loop code makes sense now!
Looking at it again,
block
  loop
    ;; <test>
    i32.eqz

    ;; if test == 0, jump forwards (1 = labelidx of the `block`),
    ;; out of the loop
    br_if 1

    ;; <loop body>

    ;; unconditionally jump backwards (0 = labelidx of the `loop`).
    ;; to the beginning of the loop
    br 0
  end
end

In more normal assembly, this would correspond to:
.loop_start
  ;; <test>
  jz .block_end
  ;; <loop body>
  jmp .loop_start
.block_end

But with jumps, you can express things that you can't (easily) in WASM—for example, you could jump into the middle of a block.
(This mainly is an issue for compiling C's goto, which I didn't even attempt—there's an algorithm that can transform any code using goto into an equivalent program using structured control flow, but it's complicated and I don't think it would work with our single-pass approach.)
But for while loops, this isn't too bad.
All we have to do is:
# `emit.block` is a context manager to emit the first parameter ("block" here),
# and then the second ("end") on exit
with emit.block("block", "end"):
    with emit.block("loop", "end"):
        # emit code for the test, ending with `i32.eqz`
        parenthesized_test()
        # emit code to exit the loop if the `i32.eqz` was true
        emit("br_if 1")
        # emit code for the body
        bracketed_block_or_single_statement(lexer, frame)
        # emit code to jump back to the beginning
        emit("br 0")

With for loops though, it gets nasty.
Consider a for loop like this:
for (i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1) {
    j = j * 2 + i;
}

The order the parts of the for loop will be seen by the lexer/code generator is:

i = 0
i < 5
i = i + 1
j = j * 2 + i

But the order we need to put them in the code, to work with WASM's structured control flow, is:
block
  ;; < code for `i = 0` (1) >
  loop
    ;; < code for `i < 5` (2) >
    br_if 1
    ;; < code for `j = j * 2 + i` (4!) >
    ;; < code for `i = i + 1` (3!) >
    br 0
  end
end

Notice that 3 and 4 are inverted in the generated code, making the order 1, 2, 4, 3.
This is a problem for a single pass compiler!
Unlike a normal compiler, we can't store the advancement statement for later.
Or… can we?
How I ended up handling this is by making the lexer cloneable, and re-parsing the advancement statement after parsing the body.
Essentially, the code looks like:
elif lexer.try_next("for"):
    lexer.next("(")
    with emit.block("block", "end"):
        # parse initializer (i = 0)
        # (outside of loop since it only happens once)
        if lexer.peek().kind != ";":
            expression(lexer, frame)
            emit("drop") # discard result of initializer
        lexer.next(";")

        with emit.block("loop", "end"):
            # parse test (i < 5), if present
            if lexer.peek().kind != ";":
                load_result(expression(lexer, frame))
                emit("i32.eqz ;; for test")
                emit("br_if 1 ;; exit loop")
            lexer.next(";")

            # handle first pass of advancement statement, if present
            saved_lexer = None
            if lexer.peek().kind != ")":
                saved_lexer = lexer.clone()
                # emit.no_emit() disables code output inside of it,
                # so we can skip over the advancement statement for now
                # to get to the for loop body
                with emit.no_emit():
                    expression(lexer, frame)
            lexer.next(")")

            # parse body
            bracketed_block_or_single_statement(lexer, frame)

            # now that we parsed the body, go back and re-parse
            # the advancement statement using the saved lexer
            if saved_lexer != None:
                expression(saved_lexer, frame)

            # jump back to beginning of loop
            emit("br 0")

As you can see, the hack is to save the lexer, then use that to go back and handle the advancement statement later, instead of saving the syntax tree like a normal compiler would.
Not very elegant—compiling for loops is probably the gnarliest code in the compiler—but it works well enough!
The other parts of statement() are mostly similar, so I'll skip over them to get to the last main part of the compiler—expression().

  
expression() (compiler.py:375)
expression() is the last big method in the compiler, and it handles parsing expressions, as you might expect.
It contains many inner methods, one for each precedence level, each returning the ExprMeta struct described earlier (which handle the "place vs value" distinction and can be turned into a value using load_result).
The bottom of the precedence stack is value() (somewhat confusingly named, since it can return ExprMeta(is_place=True, ...)).
It handles constants, parenthesized expressions, function calls, and variable names.
Above that, the basic pattern for a precedence level is a function like this:
 def muldiv() -> ExprMeta:
    # lhs is the higher precedence operation (prefix operators, in this case)
    lhs_meta = prefix()
    # check if we can parse an operation
    if lexer.peek().kind in ("*", "/", "%"):
        # if so, load in the left hand side
        lhs_meta = load_result(lhs_meta)
        # grab the specific operator
        op_token = lexer.next()
        # the right hand side should use this function, for e.g. `x * y * z`
        load_result(muldiv())
        # emit an opcode to do the operation
        if op_token == "*":
            emit(f"i32.mul")
        elif op_token == "/":
            emit(f"i32.div_s")
        else: # %
            emit(f"i32.rem_s")
        # mask down the result if this is a less-than-32bit type
        mask_to_sizeof(lhs_meta.type)
        # we produced a value (is_place=False)
        return ExprMeta(False, lhs_meta.type)
    # if we didn't find a token, just return the left hand side unchanged
    return lhs_meta

In fact, this pattern is so consistent that most operations, including muldiv, aren't written out, but instead defined by a higher-order function makeop:
# function for generating simple operator precedence levels from declarative
# dictionaries of { token: instruction_to_emit }
def makeop(
    higher: Callable[[], ExprMeta], ops: dict[str, str], rtype: CType | None = None
) -> Callable[[], ExprMeta]:
    def op() -> ExprMeta:
        lhs_meta = higher()
        if lexer.peek().kind in ops.keys():
            lhs_meta = load_result(lhs_meta)
            op_token = lexer.next()
            load_result(op())
            # TODO: type checking?
            emit(f"{ops[op_token.kind]}")
            mask_to_sizeof(rtype or lhs_meta.type)
            return ExprMeta(False, lhs_meta.type)
        return lhs_meta

    return op

muldiv = makeop(prefix, {"*": "i32.mul", "/": "i32.div_s", "%": "i32.rem_s"})
...
shlr = makeop(plusminus, {"<<": "i32.shl", ">>": "i32.shr_s"})
cmplg = makeop(
    shlr,
    {"<": "i32.lt_s", ">": "i32.gt_s", "<=": "i32.le_s", ">=": "i32.ge_s"},
    CType("int"),
)
cmpe = makeop(cmplg, {"==": "i32.eq", "!=": "i32.ne"}, CType("int"))
bitand = makeop(cmpe, {"&": "i32.and"})
bitor = makeop(bitand, {"|": "i32.or"})
xor = makeop(bitor, {"^": "i32.xor"})
...

Only a few operations with special behavior need to be defined explicitly, like plusminus which needs to handle the nuances of C pointer math.
And that's it!
That's the last main piece of the compiler.

  
Wrapping up...
That's been our tour of the C compiler in 500 lines of Python!
Compilers have a reputation for being complex—GCC and Clang are massive, and even TCC, the Tiny C Compiler, is tens of thousands of lines of code—but if you're willing to sacrifice code quality and do everything in a single pass, they can be surprisingly compact!
I'd be interested to hear if you write your own single-pass compiler—maybe for a custom language?
I think this kind of compiler could potentially be a great stage0 for a self-hosted language, since it's so simple.
Next time, this blog will be back to regularly-scheduled LLM posting with a post about making a small transformer by hand!

}

2I actually originally set out to explain the entire compiler, line-by-line. I wrote 10,000 words and only got to variable declarations. I wrote an entire literate programming environment. This yak wasn't just shaved, it was skinned, tanned, and constructed into a yurt of my own madness. Needless to say, that draft will not be seeing the light of day.

            <description><![CDATA[Visualizing the internal state of a Transformer model]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        
          
            Introduction
          
          
            The internal mechanisms of Transformer Large Language models (LLMs),
            particularly the flow of information through the layers and the
            operation of the attention mechanism, can be challenging to follow
            due to the vast amount of numbers involved. We humans can hardly
            form a mental model. This article aims to make these workings
            tangible by providing visualizations of a Transformer's internal
            state. Utilizing a minimal dataset and a deliberately simplified
            model, it is possible to follow the model's internal processes
            step-by-step. One can observe how information is transformed across
            different layers and how the attention mechanism weighs different
            input tokens. This approach offers a transparent view into the core
            operations of a Transformer.

          Setup
          
            This article employs a strategy of radical simplification across
            three key components: the training data, the tokenization method,
            and the model architecture. While significantly scaled down, this
            setup allows for detailed tracking and visualization of internal
            states. Fundamental mechanisms observed here are expected to mirror
            those in larger models.
          

          Minimal Dataset
          
            A highly structured and minimal training dataset focused on simple
            relationships between a few concepts: fruits and tastes. Unlike vast
            text corpora, this dataset features repetitive patterns and clear
            semantic links, making it easier to observe how the model learns
            specific connections.
          
          
            A single, distinct sentence is held out as a validation set. This
            sentence tests whether the model has truly learned the semantic link
            between "chili" and "spicy" (which only appear together differently
            in training) or if it has merely memorized the training sequences.
          
          
            Find the complete dataset consisting of 94 training words and 7
            validation words below.
          
          Training Data
          
            English grammar rule violations are intentional for simplification.

            apple tastes sweet
            orange tastes juicy
            chili tastes spicy
            spicy is a chili
            sweet is a apple
            juicy is a orange
            sour is a lemon
            i like the spicy taste of chili
            i like the sweet taste of apple
            i like the juicy taste of orange
            i like the sour taste of lemon
            lemon is so sour
            apple is so sweet
            orange is so juicy
            chili is so spicy
            i like sour so i like lemon
            i like sweet so i like apple
            i like juicy so i like orange
          
          Validation Data
          
            i like spicy so i like chili
          
          Basic Tokenization
          
            Tokenization is kept rudimentary. Instead of complex subword methods
            like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a simple regex splits text primarily
            into words. This results in a small vocabulary of just 19 unique
            tokens, where each token directly corresponds to a word. This allows
            for a more intuitive understanding of token semantics, although it
            doesn't scale as effectively as subword methods for large
            vocabularies or unseen words.
          

          List of all Tokens
          
            [('is', 0),
            ('the', 1),
            ('orange', 2),
            ('chili', 3),
            ('sour', 4),
            ('of', 5),
            ('taste', 6),
            ('apple', 7),
            ('sweet', 8),
            ('juicy', 9),
            ('a', 10),
            ('spicy', 11),
            ('so', 12),
            ('like', 13),
            ('tastes', 14),
            ('i', 15),
            ('lemon', 16),
            ('UNKNOWN', 17),
            ('PADDING', 18)]
          

          
            Simplified Model Architecture
          
          
            The Transformer model itself is a decoder-only model drastically
            scaled down compared to typical Large Language Models (LLMs). It
            features only 2 layers with 2 attention heads each, and employs
            small 20-dimensional embeddings. Furthermore, it uses tied word
            embeddings (the same matrix for input lookup and output prediction,
            also used in Google's Gemma), reducing parameters and linking
            input/output representations in the same vector space which is
            helpful for visualization. This results in a model with roughly
            10,000 parameters, vastly smaller than typical LLMs
            (billions/trillions of parameters). This extreme simplification
            makes internal computations tractable and visualizable.
          

          
            Training and Validation Result
          
          
            After training for 10,000 steps, the model achieves low loss on both
            the training data and the validation sentence. Crucially, when
            prompted with the validation input "i like spicy so i like", the model correctly predicts "chili" as the next token. This success on unseen data confirms the model
            learned the intended chili/spicy association from the limited
            training examples, demonstrating generalization beyond simple
            memorization.
          
        

        
          
            Visualizing the Internals
          
          
            While Transformer implementations operate on multi-dimensional
            tensors for efficiency in order to handle batches of sequences and
            processing entire context windows in parallel, we can simplify our
            conceptual understanding. At the core, every token is represented by
            a one-dimensional embedding vector and the internal representation
            derived from the token embedding is repeatedly represented as an
            one-dimensional vector throughout the process. This property can be
            used for visualization.
          

          Token Embeddings
          
            Our model uses 20-dimensional embeddings, meaning each token is
            initially represented by 20 numbers. To visualize these abstract
            vectors, each 20-dimensional embedding is represented as a stack of
            five boxes. Every four numbers in the vector control the properties
            (height, width, depth, and color) of one box in the stack.
          

          
            Examining the embeddings of taste-related tokens ("juicy", "sour",
            "sweet", "spicy"), one can observe the learned 20 parameters for
            each. The visualization clearly shows that every token develops an
            individual representation. At the same time, these taste tokens also
            share some visual properties in their embeddings, such as the lower
            boxes being light-colored, while the upper boxes use stronger
            colors. Also, the lowest box appears rather high and narrow. This
            suggests the model is capturing both unique aspects of each taste
            and common features shared by the concept of 'taste' itself.
          

          
            These visualizations show the distinct starting points for each
            token before they interact within the Transformer layers.
          

          
            
            
              Learned 20-dimensional embeddings represented as stack of boxes
              for taste tokens ("juicy", "sour", "sweet", "spicy"). While each
              token has a unique appearance, shared visual features (e.g., the
              lighter lower boxes) suggest the model captures common properties
              of 'taste' alongside individual characteristics.
            
          

          Forward Pass
          
            When providing the model with a list of tokens, it will output
            possible next tokens and their likelihoods. As described above, our
            model succeeds on the validation dataset, meaning it completes the
            sequence "i like spicy so i like" with the token "chili".
            Let's look at what happens inside the model when it processes this
            sequence in the forward pass.
          

          
            In a first step, all input tokens are embedded. Examine their
            visualization below. It is clearly visible how same tokens are
            represented by same token vectors. Also, the "spicy" embedding is the same as shown above.
          
          
            
            
              Visualization of input token embeddings. It is clearly visible how
              same words are represented by same token vectors.
            
          

          
            Following the initial embedding, the tokens proceed through the
            Transformer's layers sequentially. Our model utilizes two such
            layers. Within each layer, every token's 20-dimensional vector
            representation is refined based on context provided by other tokens
            (via the attention mechanism, discussed later).
          

          
            
            
              Visualization of the token vectors progressing through the initial
              embedding layer and two Transformer layers. Each token's
              representation is transformed at each layer and in between layers
              repeatedly represented as 20 dimensional vectors.
            
          

          
            Crucially, the final representation of the last input token (in this
            case, the second "like" on
            the right side) after passing through all layers (from front to
            back) is used to predict the next token in the sequence. Because the
            model confidently predicts "chili" should follow this sequence, the vector representation for the
            final "like" token evolves to
            closely resemble the embedding vector for "chili" (shown below) in Transformer Layer 2.
          

          
            Comparing the vectors reveals a visual similarity. Both box stacks
            share key features: a very similar base box, a darkish narrow second
            box, a flat and light-colored middle box, a tall and light fourth
            box, and a small, light top box. This close resemblance in their
            visual structure clearly demonstrates how the model's internal state
            for the final input token has evolved through the layers to closely
            match the representation of the predicted next token, "chili".
          

          
            
            
              The original embedding vector for "chili" (and other food items), shown again for comparison with the
              final prediction vector from the previous figure. Note the visual
              similarities described in the text.
            
          

          
            Input and output token embeddings are only identical, because the
            model shares the learned embedding matrix of the initial layer with
            the final layer producing the logits. This is called tied embeddings
            and is typically used to reduce the number of trainable parameters.
          

          
            Attention in Transformer Layers
          

          
            Within each Transformer layer, the transformation of a token's
            vector representation isn't solely based on the token itself. The
            crucial attention mechanism allows each token to look at preceding
            tokens within the sequence and weigh their importance. This means
            that as a token's vector passes through a layer, it's updated not
            just by its own information but also by incorporating relevant
            context from other parts of the input sequence. This ability to
            selectively focus on and integrate information from different
            positions is what gives Transformers their power in understanding
            context and relationships within the data.
          

          
            Visualizing which tokens the attention mechanism focuses on when
            transforming each token reveals several details about how the model
            processes the sequence.
          

          
            
            
              Visualization including attention connections (colored lines)
              between tokens within each Transformer layer. Different colors
              represent different attention heads. Only connections with weights
              above a threshold are shown.
            

            
              In Transformer layer 1 (middle row), the earliest visible
              attention occurs when processing the third token, "spicy". It attends back to the preceding "i" token. This makes sense because "spicy" appears in multiple contexts within our small training dataset
              (e.g., "chili tastes spicy", "spicy is a chili",
              "chili is so spicy"). To
              correctly predict based on "spicy", the model benefits from looking at the preceding context. In
              contrast, the first token "i" shows no incoming attention lines because there are no prior
              tokens to attend to. The second token, "like", also shows no strong attention from "i". In our dataset, "like"
              consistently follows "i"
              but can precede various tastes ("spicy", "sweet", etc.).
              Therefore, knowing that "i"
              came before "like" provides
              little predictive value for what taste might follow, so the
              attention weight remains low.
            

            
              The next token in the sequence is "so". In Transformer Layer 1 (middle row), this token exhibits
              strong attention towards both the preceding token "spicy" and the initial token "i", indicated by the distinct colored lines connecting them
              (representing different attention heads). The focus on "spicy" is necessary because "so" appears in different contexts in the training data (e.g.,
              "i like sour so i like" and
              "lemon is so sour"), making
              the immediate preceding context crucial. The attention back to the
              initial "i" further helps
              establish the overall sentence structure ("i like ... so i like ...").
            
            
              Finally, let's examine the last token in the input sequence, the
              second "like" on the right.
              In both Transformer Layer 1 (middle row) and Transformer Layer 2
              (back row), this token shows strong attention directed towards the
              token "spicy". This focus
              is crucial for the model's prediction. The training data contains
              similar sentences such as "i like sweet so i like apple" and "i like sour so i like lemon". The key piece of information that distinguishes the current
              sequence and points towards "chili" as the correct completion is the word "spicy". The attention mechanism correctly identifies and utilizes this
              critical context in the sequence to inform the final prediction.
            
          
        

        
          Conclusion
          
            By radically simplifying the dataset, tokenization, and model
            architecture, this article provided a step-by-step visualization of
            a decoder-only Transformer's internal workings. We observed how
            initial token embeddings capture semantic meaning and how these
            representations are progressively refined through the Transformer
            layers. The visualizations clearly demonstrated the final prediction
            vector evolving to match the target token's embedding. Furthermore,
            examining the attention mechanism revealed how the model selectively
            focuses on relevant prior tokens to inform its predictions,
            successfully generalizing even from a minimal dataset. While highly
            simplified, this approach offers valuable intuition into the
            fundamental processes of information flow and contextual
            understanding within Transformer models.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi HN, I’m Danial, co-founder and CTO of Risely AI (https://risely.ai). We're building AI agents that automate operational workflows inside universities. Here’s a demo: https://www.loom.com/share/d7a14400434144c490249d665a0d0499?....Higher ed is full of inefficiencies. Every department runs on outdated systems that don’t talk to each other. Today, advising staff are looking up enrollment data in PeopleSoft or Ellucian, checking grades and assignments in Canvas, and trying to track engagement in a CRM, if they even have one. Often, it’s just spreadsheets and email. One advisor told us they were losing 8+ hours/week just trying to answer: “Which students are struggling?”. During that lag, students slip through the cracks, and every lost student costs a school tuition.I’ve spent the last decade building large-scale systems, but about a year ago, I left my job to build something personal. My time at UC Berkeley reinforced what my parents taught me when we immigrated to the U.S. - that education is the most powerful tool for upward mobility. But nearly 40% of students never graduate. Many of these students are capable and just need support, but the systems meant to support them are overwhelmed and broken.So we built Risely. Our first agent focuses on academic advising and retention. It connects to a school’s systems, unifies the data, flags at-risk students, drafts outreach, and answers natural-language questions about caseloads and course progress. It gives staff leverage and time back, while helping more students stay on track.The harder part is everything under the hood:
- Connecting to archaic SIS, LMS, and CRM systems with inconsistent APIs and data models
- Normalizing messy institutional data into something agents can reason over 
- Handling real policy constraints around FERPA, isolating tenant data, and meeting strict security and privacy standards for student PII 
- Designing agent workflows that are traceable, reviewable, and safe to run in production 
- Building infrastructure that can adapt to different institutional rules, processes, and edge cases.We started with advising because retention ties directly to both revenue and student success. But the same foundation applies to registrar, admissions, financial aid, research administration, and other critical functions. As more agents come online, they can begin to coordinate with each other and hopefully improve the entire operations of a college or university.If you’ve built systems that had to reconcile messy data, inconsistent workflows, or policy constraints using LLMs, we’d love to hear how you approached it.We’d love to hear your thoughts about the above, and anything in this space!]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
		
Physics in high dimensions is becoming the norm in modern dynamics.  It is not only that string theory operates in ten dimensions (plus one for time), but virtually every complex dynamical system is described and analyzed within state spaces of high dimensionality.  Population dynamics, for instance, may describe hundreds or thousands of different species, each of whose time-varying populations define a separate axis in a high-dimensional space.  Coupled mechanical systems likewise may have hundreds or thousands (or more) of degrees of freedom that are described in high-dimensional phase space. 



In high-dimensional landscapes, mountain ridges are much more common than mountain peaks.  This has profound consequences for the evolution of life, the dynamics of complex systems, and the power of machine learning.



For these reasons, as physics students today are being increasingly exposed to the challenges and problems of high-dimensional dynamics, it is important to build tools they can use to give them an intuitive feeling for the highly unintuitive behavior of systems in high-D.



Within the rapidly-developing field of machine learning, which often deals with landscapes (loss functions or objective functions) in high dimensions that need to be minimized, high dimensions are usually referred to in the negative as “The Curse of Dimensionality”.



Dimensionality might be viewed as a curse for several reasons.  First, it is almost impossible to visualize data in dimensions higher than d = 4 (the fourth dimension can sometimes be visualized using colors or time series).  Second, too many degrees of freedom create too many variables to fit or model, leading to the classic problem of overfitting.  Put simply, there is an absurdly large amount of room in high dimensions.  Third, our intuition about relationships among areas and volumes are highly biased by our low-dimensional 3D experiences, causing us to have serious misconceptions about geometric objects in high-dimensional spaces.  Physical processes occurring in 3D can be over-generalized to give preconceived notions that just don’t hold true in higher dimensions.



Take, for example, the random walk.  It is usually taught starting from a 1-dimensional random walk (flipping a coin) that is then extended to 2D and then to 3D…most textbooks stopping there.  But random walks in high dimensions are the rule rather than the exception in complex systems.  One example that is especially important in this context is the problem of molecular evolution.  Each site on a genome represents an independent degree of freedom, and molecular evolution can be described as a random walk through that space, but the space of all possible genetic mutations is enormous.  Faced with such an astronomically large set of permutations, it is difficult to conceive of how random mutations could possibly create something as complex as, say, ATP synthase which is the basis of all higher bioenergetics.  Fortunately, the answer to this puzzle lies in the physics of random walks in high dimensions. 



Why Ten Dimensions?



This blog presents the physics of random walks in 10 dimensions.  Actually, there is nothing special about 10 dimensions versus 9 or 11 or 20, but it gives a convenient demonstration of high-dimensional physics for several reasons.  First, it is high enough above our 3 dimensions that there is no hope to visualize it effectively, even by using projections, so it forces us to contend with the intrinsic “unvisualizability” of high dimensions.  Second, ten dimensions is just big enough that it behaves roughly like any higher dimension, at least when it comes to random walks.  Third, it is about as big as can be handled with typical memory sizes of computers.  For instance, a ten-dimensional hypercubic lattice with 10 discrete sites along each dimension has 10^10 lattice points (10 Billion or 10 Gigs) which is about the limit of what a typical computer can handle with internal memory.



As a starting point for visualization, let’s begin with the well-known 4D hypercube but extend it to a 4D hyperlattice with three values along each dimension instead of two.  The resulting 4D lattice can be displayed in 2D as a network with 3^4 = 81 nodes and 216 links or edges.  The result is shown in Fig. 1, represented in two dimensions as a network graph with nodes and edges.  Each node has four links with neighbors.  Despite the apparent 3D look that this graph has about it, if you look closely you will see the frustration that occurs when trying to link to 4 neighbors, causing many long-distance links.



[See YouTube video for movies showing evolving hyperlattices and random walks in 10D.]

We can also look at a 10D hypercube that has 2^10 = 1024 nodes and 5120 edges, shown in Fig. 2.  It is a bit difficult to see the hypercubic symmetry when presented in 2D, but each node has exactly 10 links.

Extending this 10D lattice to 10 positions instead of 2 and trying to visualize it is prohibitive, since the resulting graph in 2D just looks like a mass of overlapping circles. However, our interest extends not just to ten locations per dimension, but to an unlimited number of locations. This is the 10D infinite lattice on which we want to explore the physics of the random walk.



Diffusion in Ten Dimensions



An unconstrained random walk in 10D is just a minimal extension beyond a simple random walk in 1D.  Because each dimension is independent, a single random walker takes a random step along any of the 10 dimensions at each iteration so that motion in any one of the 10 dimensions is just a 1D random walk.  Therefore, a simple way to visualize this random walk in 10D is simply to plot the walk against each dimension, as in Fig. 3.  There is one chance in ten that the walker will take a positive or negative step along any given dimension at each time point.  



Fig. 3   A single walker taking random unit steps in 10 dimensions.  The position of the walker as a function of time is shown for all ten dimensions.


An alternate visualization of the 10D random walker is shown in Fig. 4 for the same data as Fig. 3.  In this case the displacement is color coded, and each column is a different dimension.  Time is on the vertical axis (starting at the top and increasing downward).  This type of color map can easily be extended to hundreds of dimensions.  Each row is a position vector of the single walker in the 10D space



Fig. 4  Same data as in Fig. 3 for a single 10D random walker on a hyperlattice.  Distance is color coded.  Time is on the vertical axis (increasing downward). Each row is a 10D position vector, and this representation is of a single 10D trajectory.


In the 10D hyperlattice in this section, all lattice sites are accessible at each time point, so there is no constraint preventing the walk from visiting a previously-visited node.  There is a possible adjustment that can be made to the walk that prevents it from ever crossing its own path.  This is known as a self-avoiding-walk (SAW).  In two dimensions, there is a major difference in the geometric and dynamical properties of an ordinary walk and an SAW.  However, in dimensions larger than 4, it turns out that there are so many possibilities of where to go (high-dimensional spaces have so much free room) that it is highly unlikely that a random walk will ever cross itself.  Therefore, in our 10D hyperlattice we do not need to make the distinction between an ordinary walk and a self-avoiding-walk.  However, there are other constraints that can be imposed that mimic how complex systems evolve in time, and these constraints can have important consequences, as we see next.



Random Walk in a Maximally Rough Landscape



In the infinite hyperlattice of the previous section, all lattice sites are the same and are all equally accessible.  However, in the study of complex systems, it is common to assign a value to each node in a high-dimensional lattice.  This value can be assigned by a potential function, producing a high-dimensional potential landscape over the lattice geometry.  Or the value might be the survival fitness of a species, producing a high-dimensional fitness landscape that governs how species compete and evolve.  Or the value might be a loss function (an objective function) in a minimization problem from multivariate analysis or machine learning.   In all of these cases, the scalar value on the nodes defines a landscape over which a state point executes a walk.  The question then becomes, what are the properties of a landscape in high dimensions, and how does it affect a random walker?



As an example, let’s consider a landscape that is completely random point-to-point.  There are no correlations in this landscape, making it maximally rough.  Then we require that a random walker takes a walk along iso-potentials in this landscape, never increasing and never decreasing its potential.  Beginning with our spatial intuition living in 3D space, we might be concerned that such a walker would quickly get confined in some area of the lanscape.  Think of a 2D topo map with countour lines drawn on it — If we start at a certain elevation on a mountain side, then if we must walk along directions that maintain our elevation, we stay on a given contour and eventually come back to our starting point after circling the mountain peak — we are trapped!  But this intuition informed by our 3D lives is misleading.  What happens in our 10D hyperlattice?



To make the example easy to analyze, let’s assume that our potential function is restricted to N discrete values.  This means that of the 10 neighbors to a given walker site, on average only 10/N are likely to have the same potential value as the given walker site.  This constrains the available sites for the walker, and it converts the uniform hyperlattice into a hyperlattice site percolation problem.



Percolation theory is a fascinating topic in statistical physics.  There are many deep concepts that come from asking simple questions about how nodes are connected across a network.  The most important aspect of percolation theory is the concept of a percolation threshold.  Starting with a complete network that is connected end-to-end, start removing nodes at random.  For some critical fraction of nodes removed (on average) there will no longer be a single connected cluster that spans the network.  This critical fraction is known as the percolation threshold.  Above the percolation threshold, a random walker can get from one part of the network to another.  Below the percolation threshold, the random walker is confined to a local cluster.  



If a hyperlattice has N discrete values for the landscape potential (or height, or contour) and if a random walker can only move to site that has the same value as the walker’s current value (remains on the level set), then only a fraction of the hyperlattice sites are available to the walker, and the question of whether the walker can find a path the spans the hyperlattice becomes simply a question of how the fraction of available sites relates to the percolation threshold.



The percolation threshold for hyperlattices is well known.  For reasonably high dimensions, it is given to good accuracy by






where d is the dimension of the hyperlattice.  For a 10D hyperlattice the percolation threshold is pc(10) = 0.0568, or about 6%.  Therefore, if more than 6% of the sites of the hyperlattice have the same value as the walker’s current site, then the walker is free to roam about the hyperlattice.  



If there are N = 5 discrete values for the potential, then 20% of the sites are available, which is above the percolation threshold, and walkers can go as far as they want.  This statement holds true no matter what the starting value is.  It might be 5, which means the walker is as high on the landscape as they can get.  Or it might be 1, which means the walker is as low on the landscape as they can get.  Yet even if they are at the top, if the available site fraction is above the percolation threshold, then the walker can stay on the high mountain ridge, spanning the landscape.  The same is true if they start at the bottom of a valley.  Therefore, mountain ridges are very common, as are deep valleys, yet they allow full mobility about the geography.  On the other hand, a so-called mountain peak would be a 5 surrounded by 4’s or lower.  The odds for having this happen in 10D are 0.2*(1-0.8^10) = 0.18.  Then the total density of mountain peaks, in a 10D hyperlattice with 5 potential values, is only 18%.  Therefore, mountain peaks are rare in 10D, while mountain ridges are common.  In even higher dimensions, the percolation threshold decreases roughly inversely with the dimensionality, and mountain peaks become extremely rare and play virtually no part in walks about the landscape.



To illustrate this point, Fig. 5 is the same 10D network that is in Fig. 2, but only the nodes sharing the same value are shown for N = 5, which means that only 20% of the nodes are accessible to a walker who stays only on nodes with the same values.  There is a “giant cluster” that remains connected, spanning the original network.  If the original network is infinite, then the giant cluster is also infinite but contains a finite fraction of the nodes.



Fig. 5  A 10D cluster that spans the network in Fig. 2 for 1/5 of the nodes sharing the same landscape value.  This cluster represents a mountain ridge that spans the space.  There are four additional co-existing clusters, each of which separately spans the same 10D space.


The quantitative details of the random walk can change depending on the proximity of the sub-networks (the clusters, the ridges or the level sets) to the percolation threshold.  For instance, a random walker in D =10 with N = 5 is shown in Fig. 6.  The diffusion is a bit slower than in the unconstrained walk of Figs. 3 and 4.  But the ability to wander about the 10D space is retained.



Fig. 6  A random walker on the level-set cluster of Fig. 5


This is then the general important result: In high-dimensional landscapes, mountain ridges are much more common than mountain peaks. This has profound consequences for the evolution of life, the dynamics of complex systems, and the power of machine learning.



Consequences for Evolution and Machine Learning



When the high-dimensional space is the space of possible mutations on a genome, and when the landscape is a fitness landscape that assigns a survival advantage for one mutation relative to others, then the random walk describes the evolution of a species across generations.  The prevalence of ridges, or more generally level sets, in high dimensions has a major consequence for the evolutionary process, because a species can walk along a level set acquiring many possible mutations that have only neutral effects on the survivability of the species.  At the same time, the genetic make-up is constantly drifting around in this “neutral network”, allowing the species’ genome to access distant parts of the space.  Then, at some point, natural selection may tip the species up a nearby (but rare) peak, and a new equilibrium is attained for the species.  



One of the early criticisms of fitness landscapes was the (erroneous) criticism that for a species to move from one fitness peak to another, it would have to go down and cross wide valleys of low fitness to get to another peak.  But this was a left-over from thinking in 3D.  In high-D, neutral networks are ubiquitous, and a mutation can take a step away from one fitness peak onto one of the neutral networks, which can be sampled by a random walk until the state is near some distant peak.  It is no longer necessary to think in terms of high peaks and low valleys of fitness — just random walks.  The evolution of extremely complex structures, like ATP synthase, can then be understood as a random walk along networks of nearly-neutral fitness — once our 3D biases are eliminated.



The same arguments hold for many situations in machine learning and especially deep learning.  When training a deep neural network, there can be thousands of neural weights that need to be trained through the minimization of a loss function, also known as an objective function.  The loss function is the equivalent to a potential, and minimizing the loss function over the thousands of dimensions is the same problem as maximizing the fitness of an evolving species.  



At first look, one might think that deep learning is doomed to failure.  We have all learned, from the earliest days in calculus, that enough adjustable parameter can fit anything, but the fit is meaningless because it predicts nothing.  Deep learning seems to be the worst example of this.  How can fitting thousands of adjustable parameters be useful when the dimensionality of the optimization space is orders of magnitude larger than the degrees of freedom of the system being modeled?



The answer comes from the geometry of high dimensions.  The prevalence of neutral networks in high dimensions gives lots of chances to escape local minima.  In fact, local minima are actually rare in high dimensions, and when they do occur, there is a neutral network nearby onto which they can escape (if the effective temperature of the learning process is set sufficiently high).  Therefore, despite the insanely large number of adjustable parameters, general solutions, that are meaningful and predictive, can be found by adding random walks around the objective landscape as a partial strategy in combination with gradient descent.



Given the superficial analogy of deep learning to the human mind, the geometry of random walks in ultra-high dimensions may partially explain our own intelligence and consciousness.

            <guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45116688</guid>
            <description><![CDATA[From the Zed Blog: You asked, and here it is. Use Claude Code in public beta directly in Zed, built on the new Agent Client Protocol.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[You asked for it. A lot.

So we built it: our Claude Code integration is now available in public beta, running natively in Zed through our new Agent Client Protocol (ACP).
For months, developers have been asking us to bring Claude Code into Zed. We didn’t just want to bolt on a one-off integration; we wanted to build something better. ACP is our new open standard that lets any agent connect to Zed (and other editors, too). Claude Code is a perfect example of what’s possible.
Now you can:

Run Claude Code as a first-class citizen in Zed's high-performance editor, not just a terminal interface
Follow along in real-time as it edits across multiple files, with full syntax highlighting and language server support
Review and approve granular changes in a multibuffer - accept or reject individual code hunks
Keep Claude Code's task list anchored in your sidebar, so you always see what the agent is working on
Define custom workflows with Claude Code's custom slash commands for your most common development tasks

Escape the Terminal
A walkthrough of Claude Code in Zed.
Claude Code has gained broad popularity among developers thanks to its powerful code generation and finely tuned tools. While the command-line interface is powerful, when Claude Code is making changes across multiple files or refactoring complex logic, you may want to see the bigger picture and have more control on what code you accept or reject. With Zed, you get the best of both worlds: Claude Code's intelligence, freed from the terminal and deeply integrated into a highly performant editor.
You can now run Claude Code directly in Zed and use it side-by-side with Zed's first-party agent, Gemini CLI, and any other ACP-compatible agent. Make sure you’re on the latest version of Zed and find your available agents in the Plus menu in the Agent Panel.
Built with ACP
Rather than creating a tightly-coupled integration specific to Claude Code, we built this integration using the Agent Client Protocol. We launched ACP as our open standard for connecting any AI agent with any compatible editor.
We built an adapter that wraps Claude Code's SDK and translates its interactions into ACP's JSON RPC format. This adapter bridges between Claude Code and ACP's standardized interface, allowing Claude Code to run as an independent process while Zed provides the user interface.
We are open sourcing the Claude Code adapter under the Apache license, making it freely available for any editor that’s adopted ACP to use; you can find the source code here. Since the popular CodeCompanion plugin for Neovim has already adopted ACP, Claude Code will also be available in Neovim.
We want to thank GitHub user Xuanwo for all his work since the ACP launch in building an ACP implementation for Claude Code - your speed to solution inspired us to work hard to keep up! We appreciate you for your contribution to the protocol's adoption. Give him a follow on GitHub and Twitter/X.
Bring Any Agent to Zed
We want every agent usable in Zed. Gemini CLI and Claude Code are a great start, and we have more on the way, but there are new agents released every week and many great existing ones not yet speaking the protocol. ACP makes it simple to bring any agent into Zed's, Neovim's, or any other ACP-adapted editor's interface!
This beta delivers as much core Claude Code functionality as possible via the SDK. We're adding features like Plan mode in the coming days, and more advanced capabilities as Anthropic expands SDK support; for example, many built-in slash commands are not yet supported by the SDK. From here:

Building an agent? We want to help you integrate with Zed - reach out with questions.
Want more Claude Code features? Join us in asking Anthropic to bring the SDK to parity with Claude Code or adopt ACP directly.
Ready to contribute? Contribute to or discuss ACP and the Claude Code adapter repos.

We're always looking for feedback on ACP, and welcome contributions from other agent (and client) builders. The more agents that work in Zed, the more choice you have as a developer.Looking for a better editor?
You can try Zed today on macOS or Linux. Download now!We are hiring!
