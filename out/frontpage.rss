            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
Here's a vague overview of what just happened:

I recently applied for
Anthropic's Developer Relations role.
My friend who works there gave me a glowing recommendation (thanks again,
dude!).
I completed their secret take-home assignment.
On top of their secret take-home assignment, I independently published
diggit.dev and a companion blogpost
about my [sincerely] positive experiences with Claude. I was hoping that
some unsolicited "extra credit" would make me look like an
exceptional/ambitious candidate.
I
posted diggit.dev to HackerNews
and it hit the frontpage!
I submitted my take-home assignment and my unsolicited extra credit.
They sent me
the "unfortunately" email.

Anthropic obviously didn't do anything wrong. I'm just bummed.
Claude Code truly is one of my favorite dev tools ever, and if you've suffered
through my talks/interviews, you're probably sick of my
enthusiasm for software. I was particularly excited to interview with Anthropic
because I respect their approach to responsible AI adoption. This very blog
is too often a crazed celebration of humans, of software, of AI, of progress, of
sincerity -- I, I felt like I was a perfect fit.
The first time I flunked an Anthropic interview (ca. 2022), I accidentally
clicked a wrong button during their automated coding challenge. It was easy to
swallow that failure. I made an honest mistake; I expect companies to reject
candidates who make honest mistakes during interviews.
This is different. I didn't misclick any buttons. My best wasn't good enough.
I'm not good enough.
This essay started as a fantasy: some hero at Anthropic reads this on HackerNews
and vouches for me and I get the job and I help them guide humanity toward
post-scarity AI abundance, forever and ever, amen. I'm ashamed of these
thoughts. It's the same folly of explaining to an ex-girlfriend why she's wrong
about her own experience.
Dating was difficult for me. I don't mind feeling ugly or low-status or whatever
-- I know my place. But it hurts to feel seen, feel considered, but ultimately
rejected due to mysterious forces: "He's cute, but he's too weird."
Yes, I'm weird. My eccentric habits have been an overall boon for my career, for
my relationships, for my well-being. But it's moments like these when I just
want to turn all my weird off. I want to be a square peg for this square hole
and do honest work and feed my family and help humanity thrive.
I can't turn my weird off, so I think I defensively dial it up sometimes. I
exaggerate my eccentricities. It's easy to swallow criticism when it isn't the
real me, when it isn't my best, when it's honest mistakes -- what a load
of crap. This is me. This is my best. Hello, world.
Now it's all coming back in waves, in gasps -- I spent so much of my life being
an unlikable jerk. Becoming somebody else has been slow/painful and I'm so
deeply afraid of regressing. Over the past decade, I've been striving to spread
joy, to do good, to be better. I'm trying so hard.
And all this keyboard vomit is a promise to myself that I'm not giving up. I
hate this feeling, and I'm staring these nightmares straight in their stupid
eyeballs, and they're not blinking. I am still alive, and I have so much more to
do.
I'm okay. I mean it. I don't need (or deserve) your sympathy. I'm so lucky to be
alive, at this time, at this place, in this body, with these people. My life is
great, and it will get even better if I keep putting in this effort.
Spewing my insides like this onto The Internet is terrifying, but I suspect many
strangers are facing similar feelings. It's rough out there. Whatever it is,
wherever you are, I hope this helps. You've got this. You're not alone, and
we're only human.]]></content:encoded>

        The secrecy battle over the Army’s Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) for Sig Sauer’s P320 has followed Glasscock v. Sig Sauer to the Eighth Circuit. A media intervenor is now asking the appellate court to keep key records open—and their brief places Practical Shooting Insights (this site) squarely in the middle of the story.

What’s new


  The Trace intervenes in the appeal. The newsroom moved to intervene for the limited purpose of opposing sealed filings tied to class certification and the FMECA, arguing the public’s right of access and noting the district court cited the FMECA nine times when it certified the class.





  Sig Sauer says “national security” and asks for deference to the Army. In opposing intervention, Sig Sauer urges the court to leave FMECA-related material sealed and to give the Army time to weigh in, framing the dispute in terms of protecting “military secrets.”







  A second FMECA document emerges. Sig Sauer’s opposition confirms there are two FMECA records in the class-certification exhibits: a FMECA Spreadsheet and a FMECA Memorandum—the latter not previously described in public filings—raising fresh questions about what the memo contains and who authored it.





  PSI’s reporting is part of the record. The Trace’s filing tells the court the unredacted FMECA was found on CourtListener, de‑obscured, and published on Practical Shooting Insights, where it “remains available”—and it recounts Sig Sauer’s own executive discussing it on a podcast while pointing viewers to this website.






The FMECA document was previously published here.



The Trace’s pitch: This isn’t secret anymore

The Trace walks the appellate court through how the FMECA left the bottle: it was posted on this website and then widely republished; a YouTube explainer discussing it surpassed 100,000 views. The filing quotes Sig Sauer’s VP of Consumer Affairs Phil Strader being asked on the Behind the Lens podcast why the FMECA shouldn’t be public and responding, “No, there’s not” (nothing to hide), while directing viewers to this website to see the document and describing its contents.





The reporting regarding Phil Strader’s interview was previously published here

How many times has the unredacted FMECA been “shared”? The filings don’t give a precise share count. What they do document is widespread republication and discussion, including the 100k‑plus video and multiple re‑posts mirroring the PSI copy. In other words, the genie is out of the bottle.

The Trace also points to DoD Instruction 5230.24, the policy Sig Sauer invokes, noting it does not authorize withholding unclassified information about evaluations of performance and reliability of military equipment—and that the PSI‑hosted FMECA bears no DoD distribution markings.





Sig Sauer’s response: Let the Army decide—and keep the lid on

Sig Sauer tells the Eighth Circuit The Trace lacks standing and that parallel briefing is already underway in the district court. Substantively, Sig Sauer leans on military‑secrets concerns, requests time for the Army to opine on release, and characterizes the FMECA as controlled technical information created under the MHS contract. (The company also recounts how the spreadsheet briefly became public in another case before being pulled down.)



Two details in Sig Sauer’s papers matter going forward:

1) The “FMECA Memorandum.” Sig Sauer identifies the memo alongside the previously published spreadsheet. If the memo is Sig Sauer‑authored, it could reveal how the company framed the Army analysis internally—an issue directly relevant to notice, risk mitigation, and marketing claims.

2) Ongoing Army communications. Sig Sauer’s litigation counsel filed a declaration stating he asked the Army about the FMECA’s distribution status and that key Army decision‑makers were unavailable the week of the deadline; Sig Sauer says the Army may submit information and seeks additional time.





The transparency question, distilled


  
    Is the FMECA “national‑security” material? The Trace says no—and points to DoDI 5230.24’s carve‑out: it does not provide authority to withhold unclassified evaluations of performance and reliability—exactly what a FMECA is. It also underscores the lack of any DoD marking on the PSI copy.
  
  
    Is secrecy even possible at this point? The record shows the unredacted spreadsheet is online on this website, has been reposted broadly, and has been discussed by Sig Sauer’s own executive on air—who told listeners where to find it. One video discussing it has 100,000+ views.
  




Why this matters to the class action—and to owners

The district court relied on the FMECA repeatedly when certifying the Missouri class, including on notice and risk‑mitigation questions—the very issues consumers care about. Keeping the heart of that analysis under seal on appeal would blunt the public’s ability to scrutinize a product‑safety fight with real‑world consequences.



My role, plainly

Practical Shooting Insights is an independent site covering the shooting‑sports and firearms industry. The Trace’s filing names PSI as the first publisher of the unredacted spreadsheet and quotes Strader pointing viewers here. I will continue to publish filings and analysis so readers can compare the arguments to the documents themselves.



What to watch next

1) Whether the Eighth Circuit permits intervention and applies the strong presumption of public access to class‑certification records.
2) If the Army weighs in—and on what basis—regarding the FMECA’s distribution status.
3) Disclosure of the FMECA Memorandum. If it’s Sig Sauer-authored, it could illuminate internal framing of hazards and fixes—material at the core of consumer‑protection claims.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[   Why is Facebook cloud-processing my device's camera roll?   Meta is uploading and analyzing your camera roll photos and videos, even ones you haven't posted, in its cloud in order to generate AI-powered suggestions like collages, monthly recaps, themed albums, or AI-restyled versions of your images.      Where is this feature being tested?   Meta has confirmed the feature is a test, saying, "We're exploring ways to make content sharing easier for people on Facebook by testing suggestions of ready-to-share and curated content from a person's camera roll."   The test is currently available in the US and Canada, but it's not available in Illinois or Texas due to those states' privacy laws.      Did Facebook ask for my consent before turning this on?   Meta is showing a pop-up asking users if they want to enable cloud processing, but some users claim they haven't seen it. Instead, they found the toggles in their settings already switched on by default, raising questions about whether clear consent was given.      Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET Can I remove my photos once they've been uploaded? ZDNET's sister site, CNET, reports that Meta pulls from your newer pictures (roughly the last 30 days) and if you disable the feature, your uploaded photos will be deleted after 30 days. The only way to confirm is by downloading your Facebook account data.   Why is this a potential privacy issue?   It expands Meta's reach beyond the content you've chosen to upload and share online -- into your private, unposted photos and videos. For many, that's a major red flag and a line they're not comfortable crossing, understandably so.   Also: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves outEven if Meta is asking for consent to access your camera roll in order to analyze your phone's photos and provide AI-powered suggestions, the company could have done a better job of being clear and explicit about what it's trying to do.   How many users, like me, simply dismissed the consent pop-up without fully realizing what they'd just agreed to?   Editor's note: This article was updated on Aug. 24, 2025 to clarify that Meta's camera roll sharing suggestions are not turned on by default and are entirely opt-in. Still, some users say they never knowingly agreed and are finding the features enabled in their settings.]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[How likely is it that a mistyped Bitcoin address is a valid address? How likely is it that some address is a plausible typo of another?]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
		I heard someone say that Bitcoin is dangerous because you could easily make a typo when entering an address, sending money to the wrong person, and have no recourse. There are dangers associated with Bitcoin, such as losing a private key, but address typos are not a major concern.
Checksums
There are several kinds of Bitcoin addresses. Each is at least 20 bytes (160 bits) long, with at least 4 bytes (32 bits) of checksum. The chances of a typo resulting in a valid checksum are about 1 in 232.
Used addresses
Let’s ignore the checksum for this section.
Because addresses are formed by cryptographic hash functions, we can assume the values are essentially randomly distributed in the space of possible addresses. The addresses are deterministic, but for modeling purposes, random is as random does.
This means a typo of an actual address is no more or less likely to be another actual address than an address typed at random. This is unlike, say, English words: a mistyped English word is more likely to be another English word than random keystrokes would be.
There have been on the order of a billion Bitcoin addresses used, in a space of 2160 possibilities. (Actually more since some addresses have more than 160 bits.) There’s about a 1 in 1039 chance that a random 160-bit sequence corresponds to an address somewhere on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Addresses close in edit distance
Someone with the Caesarean handle Veni Vidi Vici on X asked
What about the odds that out of those 1B addresses, two of them are one character swap away from each other?
That’s an interesting question. Let’s assume the addresses are Base58-encoded strings of length 26. Addresses could be longer, but assuming the minimum length increases the probability of addresses being close.
How many addresses are within one or two character swaps of another? I addressed a similar question here a couple weeks ago. If all the characters were unique, the number of strings within k swaps of each other would be
|S1(26, 26 − k)|
where S1 denotes Stirling numbers of the first kind. For k = 1 this would be 325 and for k = 2 this would be 50,050. This assumes all the characters are unique; I haven’t thought through the case where characters are repeated.
For round numbers, let’s say there are a billion addresses, and for each address there are a million other addresses that are close in some sense, plausible typos of the address. That would be 1012 addresses and typos, spread out in a space of ≈1045 (i.e. 5826) possible addresses.
Now there’s an implicit Birthday Problem here. No particular address is likely to collide with another, even when you allow typos, but what about the likelihood that some address collides?
Say we partition our space of 1045 addresses into N = 1029 addresses with a million possible typos for each address. Then as a rule of thumb, you’d need around √N random draws before you have a 50-50 chance of seeing a collision. Since 109 is a lot less than 1014.5, it’s unlikely that any two addresses collide, even when you consider each address along with a million associated typos.

       Key Question: Can we improve temporal reasoning by learning better representations?
       Method: A novel negative sampling scheme provably enables learning temporal representations.
       Result: CRTR learns representations that enable solving Rubik's Cube without hand-crafted heuristics and improves the success rates overall.
    
  
  
        
            
                CRTR makes representations reflect the structure of combinatorial tasks. t-SNE visualization of representations learned by CRTR (right) and CRL (left) for Sokoban.
                Colors correspond to trajectories; three frames from two trajectories are shown in the center and linked to their representations.
                CRL embeddings cluster tightly within trajectories, failing to capture global structure and limiting their usefulness for planning.
                In contrast, CRTR organizes representations meaningfully across trajectories and time (vertical axis).
              
          
        
  
  
  
            Abstract
            
              In classical AI, perception relies on learning spatial representations,
              while planning—temporal reasoning over action sequences—is typically achieved through search.
              We study whether such reasoning can instead emerge from representations that capture both spatial and temporal structure.
              We show that standard temporal contrastive learning, despite its popularity, often fails to capture temporal structure,
              due to reliance on spurious features. To address this, we introduce Contrastive Representations for Temporal Reasoning (CRTR),
              a method that uses a negative sampling scheme to provably remove these spurious features and facilitate temporal reasoning.
              CRTR achieves strong results on domains with complex temporal structure, such as Sokoban and Rubik’s Cube.
              In particular, for the Rubik’s Cube, CRTR learns representations that generalize across all initial states and allow
              solving the puzzle much faster than BestFS—though with longer solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first
              demonstration of efficiently solving arbitrary Cube states using only learned representations, without hand-crafted search heuristics.
            
        
 

  
          
            Experiments
          
        
    
  




        Correlation Analysis
        
            Distances given by CRTR representations reflect the temporal structure well. Correlation (Spearman's ρ) between the distance induced by learned embeddings and actual distance across the training, CRTR compared with CRL.
          
        
        
      




        Block Building Behavior
        
            CRTR without search exhibits a block-building-like behavior. Intermediate states from solving a randomly scrambled cube, illustrating how the algorithm gradually builds partial structure. The average solve is about 400 moves, and we see similar block building behavior across solves.

After more than two years of development, the Debian Project has released its new stable version, Debian 13 ("trixie"). The release comes with the usual bounty of
upgraded packages and more than 14,000 new packages; it also debuts Advanced Package Tool
(APT) 3.0 as the default package manager and makes 64-bit
RISC-V a supported architecture. There are few surprises with trixie,
which is exactly what many Linux users are hoping for—a free
operating system that just works as expected.

Debian's stable
releases are aptly named; the project prioritizes stability over
shipping the latest software. The freeze
schedule for trixie called for a soft freeze in April, which meant
that (for example) the KDE Plasma 6.4
release in June was too late to make the cut—even though trixie
was not released until August. Users who prefer to live on the edge
will want to run another distribution or follow Debian development by
running the testing release
that previews the next stable version—Debian 14 ("forky"). Truly
adventurous users may take their chances with the unstable ("sid")
release.

That said, trixie is up-to-date enough for many folks; it includes
GNOME 48, KDE Plasma 6.3, Xfce 4.20, GNU
Emacs 30.1, GnuPG 2.4.7, LibreOffice 25.2, and
more. Under the hood, it includes the most recent Linux LTS kernel
(6.12.41), GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) 14.2, GNU C Library (glibc)
2.41, LLVM/Clang 19, Python 3.13, Rust 1.85, and
systemd 257. The release notes have a section
for well-known software that compares the version in Debian 12
against Debian 13. While some of the versions lag a bit behind the
upstream, they are not woefully outdated.

The project now supports
six major hardware architectures: x86-64/amd64, 32-bit Arm with a
hardware FPU (armhf), 64-bit Arm (arm64), IBM POWER8 or newer
(ppc64el), IBM S/390 (s390x), and 64-bit RISC-V. The i386 architecture
is not supported for trixie, though the project continues to
build some i386 packages to run on 64-bit systems; users with i386 systems cannot upgrade to
trixie. The MIPS
architectures (mipsel and mis64el) have also been removed in trixie.

The Arm EABI
(armel) port that targets older 32-bit Arm devices prior to Arm v7 is
still supported with trixie, but this release is the end of the
line. There is no installation media for armel systems, but users who
have bookworm installed can upgrade to trixie if they have supported
hardware: the Raspberry Pi 1, Zero, and Zero W are the
only devices mentioned in
the release notes.

Upgrades from bookworm are supported, of course. The release
notes suggest that users convert APT source files to the DEB822 format
before the upgrade. APT 3.0
includes an "apt modernize-sources" command to convert APT data
source files to DEB822, but that is not available in bookworm. Users are
also expected to remove
all third-party packages prior to running the upgrade. I tested
the upgrade on one of my servers, after taking a snapshot to roll back
to if needed, and all went smoothly. Users who are considering an
upgrade should read the release notes carefully before forging ahead;
in particular, users should be aware that it's possible (but not
certain) for network interface names to change on upgrade.

Installation

For users who want to start fresh, Debian offers a
variety of installer images and download methods; users can choose
a 64MB minimal ISO image with the netboot
installer, all the way up to a set of Blu-ray images. The project
recommends using BitTorrent or Jigsaw
Download (jigdo) for the largest images. BitTorrent probably needs
no introduction, but jigdo is not as well-known. Jigdo is a method of
downloading all of the individual packages for an image from multiple
mirrors and then assembling them into an ISO image on the user's
machine. It was a bit fiddly to use jigdo to download an image, but
not overly so—and the speed of the whole process was comparable
to simply downloading an ISO of the same size.

Debian's network
install ("netinst") image is probably the best option for server
installations and for experienced Linux users; it includes the
packages required for a base install and then fetches the remaining
software from Debian mirrors. Unlike the tiny netboot image, it
includes the option of using either the graphical installer or the
text-based installer.

The installer is a bit of a throwback to an earlier era when users
were expected to know a lot more about the workings of a Linux system. 
Users who have only worked with distributions like Fedora and Ubuntu
will notice that installing Debian requires many more steps than other
popular distributions. For example, many desktop distributions have
eliminated the step of setting a password for the root
user—instead, it is generally assumed that the primary user will
also be the system administrator, so the default is to give the
primary user sudo privileges instead. Debian does not take that
approach; in fact, there is no way to give a user sudo privileges
during installation. Setting up sudo has to be done manually after
the installation is completed Update: Users can skip creation of a root account and the installer will then set up the regular user as an administrator with sudo permissions. Apologies for the error.

For some folks, installing Debian will be a bit of a chore and may
even be confusing for users who are new to Linux. For example, the
text-mode installer requires users to specify the device for GRUB boot
loader installation, without providing a default. If one chooses an
invalid partition, the installer tells the user that the operation has
failed and drops back to a menu listing all the installation
steps. Presumably if one picks the wrong partition it will
happily install GRUB to that and render the system unbootable. This is
not insurmountable for experienced Linux users, but it would no doubt
be a hurdle for many users.

More experienced Linux users are likely to appreciate the
amount of control offered by the installer. For example, Fedora's
recent web-based installer makes it difficult to even find the option to
perform custom partitioning. Debian has a guided partitioning option
for those who do not want to fuss with it, but the option to create
custom partitions is not hidden from the user.

Debian has a better installation option for newer Linux users,
though it is easy to miss: the live install images, which
use the Calamares installer. Its
workflow is more akin to the installation process one finds with
Fedora and Ubuntu; it also sets up the primary user with sudo
privileges rather than creating a root password. Unfortunately,
the live images are not listed on the main page for installer
images—though they are mentioned, briefly, in the release
notes.







The Debian installer also has the option of using a Braille display
and/or speech synthesizer voice for the installation. I have not tried
these options, but they are available for users who need them.

X.org

Many distributions are in the process of phasing out X.org support
for GNOME and KDE as the upstream projects have started doing so.
For example, Fedora will remove X.org session support
for GNOME in Fedora 43, and the plan is for Ubuntu to do the same
in its upcoming 25.10 release. GNOME will be completely removing X.org
support in GNOME 49, which is planned for September.

Much has already been said about this, of course, and there is
likely little new left to be said or that needs to be
said. However, for users who still need or want X.org support,
Debian 13 includes X.org sessions for GNOME and KDE. In testing
trixie, I've spent some time in the GNOME and KDE X.org sessions as
well as the Wayland sessions; if there are any gotchas or horrible
bugs, I haven't encountered them (yet). This might be a compelling
reason for some folks to switch to (or stick with) Debian.

Trying trixie

I use Debian for my personal web site and blogs, but it has been
quite some time since I used it as my primary desktop operating
system. Debian (and Ubuntu) derivatives, such as Linux Mint and Pop!_OS, yes—but it's been
several years since I've used vanilla Debian on the desktop for
more than casual tinkering.

The Debian release announcement boasts about the number of packages
included in trixie: 64,419 packages total, with 14,100 added and more
than 6,000 removed as obsolete
since bookworm. That is quite a few packages, but falls short of some
other distributions. For example, "dnf repoquery --repo=fedora
--available" shows more than 76,000 packages available for
Fedora 42.

After installing Debian, I went to install some of my preferred
software, such as aerc,
Ghostty, niri, and Speech Note. The aerc
packages in trixie are current, but Ghostty and niri are not packaged
for Debian at all. Ghostty is written in Zig, which is also not
available, so users who want to build it from source will need to
install Zig separately and then build Ghostty. Speech Note is packaged
as a Flatpak, but Debian does not enable Flatpaks or Flathub in the
GNOME Software Store by default. Users who want Flatpaks on Debian via
Flathub will need to install the flatpak package and manually
add the Flathub repo:

    flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub \
      https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo


Users will need to add the gnome-software-plugin-flatpak
package for Flatpak support in GNOME Software, and
plasma-discover-backend-flatpak to add it to
KDE Discover.

Trixie ships with the Firefox extended-support release (ESR) by
default: Firefox
128, which was released in July 2024. Happily,
Mozilla offers a Debian
repository for those who want to run more current versions. Even
better, there is a little-advertised utility called extrepo that
has a curated list of external repositories users might want to enable
for Debian. To enable the Mozilla repository, for example, a user only
needs to install extrepo, run
"extrepo enable mozilla" as root (or with
sudo), update the package cache, and look for the regular
Firefox package. In all, extrepo includes more than 160 external
repositories for applications like Docker CE, Signal, and Syncthing. Unfortunately, the
extrepo utility does not have a separate "list" command to show the
available repositories, though running "extrepo search"
with no search parameter will return all of its DEB822-formatted
repository entries. Some of the software is
in an external repository due to a non-free license, other software (like
Firefox) just has a development cycle that outpaces Debian's.

As one might expect, the Debian desktop experience is not
dramatically different from other distributions; GNOME 48 on
Debian is little different than GNOME 48 on Fedora, and the same
is true for KDE, Xfce, etc. The primary difference is that users can
expect more or less the same desktop experience running Debian stable
in two years that they have today, which is not necessarily true for
other distributions.

Miscellaneous

One of the features in Debian 13 is something that most users
won't notice or appreciate at all: a transition to
64-bit time_t on 32-bit architectures, to avoid the Year 2038 problem. The
short version is that 32-bit integers cannot hold a Unix epoch
timestamp for dates after January 19, 2038. That may seem
like a distant concern, even irrelevant for Debian trixie; after all,
Debian 13 is only supported by the project until 2030. However,
the project expects that some 32-bit embedded systems will still be running
trixie in 2038, so Debian developers did the heavy lifting to complete
the transition to 64-bit time_t now. LWN covered the early planning
for this in 2023.

By now, most users have retired their DSA
SSH keys; if not, now is the time to do so. DSA keys were disabled by
default with OpenSSH in 2015, and they are entirely disabled now with
the openssh-client and openssh-server packages in
trixie. If there is a device that can, for some reason, only be
connected to with DSA, users can install the
openssh-client-ssh1 package and use ssh1 to make the
connection.

As we covered in
June 2024, Debian 13 has switched to using a tmpfs
filesystem for the /tmp directory. By default, Debian
allocates up to 50% of memory to /tmp, but this can be
changed by following the instructions
in the release notes. Note that this also applies to systems that
are upgraded to trixie from bookworm.

Forward to forky

Debian Project Leader (DPL) Andreas Tille recently
announced "Debian's 100000th birthday", so clearly the project has a
bit of experience with putting out solid releases. Granted, he was
reporting the number in binary, but even when converted to decimal 
numbers (32 years), it's an impressive track record.

While testing, I installed trixie on a couple of systems, including
a new Framework 12-inch laptop. My original intent was to just see
whether Debian had any problems with the new hardware (it didn't), but
now I'm leaning toward sticking with Debian on this system for a while
to see if stability suits me.

With trixie out the door, the Debian Project has already turned its
attention to working on forky, which has no release date set. Debian has
stuck to a loose schedule of a new stable release roughly every two
years. Most likely we will see Debian 14 sometime in 2027. After
the forky release, trixie will still receive updates from Debian's
security team through 2028, and then from its LTS team through 2030.

As of yet, there are no major new features or changes announced for
forky; it seems likely that those will be coming to light in the
coming months now that the project has trixie out the door. LWN will,
of course, be reporting on those developments as they happen.

  We’ve all sat in those presentations.  A speaker with a stream of slides full of text, monotonously reading them off as we read along.  We’re so used to it we expect it.  We accept it.  We even consider it ‘learning’. As an educator I push against ‘death by PowerPoint’ and I'm fascinated with how we can improve the way we present and teach.  The fact is we know that PowerPoint kills.  Most often the only victims are our audience’s inspiration and interest.  This, however, is the story of a PowerPoint slide that actually helped kill seven people.January 16th 2003.  NASA Mission STS-107 is underway. The Space Shuttle Columbia launches carrying its crew of seven to low orbit.  Their objective was to study the effects of microgravity on the human body and on ants and spiders they had with them.  Columbia had been the first Space Shuttle, first launched in 1981 and had been on 27 missions prior to this one.  Whereas other shuttle crews had focused on work to the Hubble Space Telescope or to the International Space Station this mission was one of pure scientific research.  The launch proceeded as normal.  The crew settled into their mission.  They would spend 16 days in orbit, completing 80 experiments.  One day into their mission it was clear to those back on Earth that something had gone wrong.  As a matter of protocol NASA staff reviewed footage from an external camera mounted to the fuel tank.  At eighty-two seconds into the launch a piece of spray on foam insulation (SOFI) fell from one of the ramps that attached the shuttle to its external fuel tank.  As the crew rose at 28,968 kilometres per hour the piece of foam collided with one of the tiles on the outer edge of the shuttle’s left wing.

  It was impossible to tell from Earth how much damage this foam, falling nine times faster than a fired bullet, would have caused when it collided with the wing.   Foam falling during launch was nothing new.  It had happened on four previous missions and was one of the reasons why the camera was there in the first place.  But the tile the foam had struck was on the edge of the wing designed to protect the shuttle from the heat of Earth’s atmosphere during launch and re-entry.  In space the shuttle was safe but NASA didn’t know how it would respond to re-entry.  There were a number of options.  The astronauts could perform a spacewalk and visually inspect the hull.  NASA could launch another Space Shuttle to pick the crew up.  Or they could risk re-entry.  NASA officials sat down with Boeing Corporation engineers who took them through three reports; a total of 28 slides.    The salient point was whilst there was data showing that the tiles on the shuttle wing could tolerate being hit by the foam this was based on test conditions using foam more than 600 times smaller than that that had struck Columbia.  This is the slide the engineers chose to illustrate this point:

  NASA managers listened to the engineers and their PowerPoint.  The engineers felt they had communicated the potential risks.  NASA felt the engineers didn’t know what would happen but that all data pointed to there not being enough damage to put the lives of the crew in danger.  They rejected the other options and pushed ahead with Columbia re-entering Earth’s atmosphere as normal.  Columbia was scheduled to land at 0916 (EST) on February 1st 2003.  Just before 0900, 61,170 metres above Dallas at 18 times the speed of sound, temperature readings on the shuttle’s left wing were abnormally high and then were lost.  Tyre pressures on the left side were soon lost as was communication with the crew.  At 0912, as Columbia should have been approaching the runway, ground control heard reports from residents near Dallas that the shuttle had been seen disintegrating.  Columbia was lost and with it her crew of seven.  The oldest crew member was 48.  The shuttle programme was on lock down, grounded for two years as the investigation began.  The cause of the accident became clear: a hole in a tile on the left wing caused by the foam let the wing dangerously overheat until the shuttle disintegrated.  The questions to answer included a very simple one: Why, given that the foam strike had occurred at a force massively out of test conditions had NASA proceeded with re-entry?  Edward Tufte, a Professor at Yale University and expert in communication reviewed the slideshow the Boeing engineers had given NASA, in particular the above slide.  His findings were tragically profound.


 Firstly, the slide had a misleadingly reassuring title claiming that test data pointed to the tile being able to withstand the foam strike.  This was not the case but the presence of the title, centred in the largest font makes this seem the salient, summary point of this slide.  This helped Boeing’s message be lost almost immediately.























  Secondly, the slide contains four different bullet points with no explanation of what they mean.  This means that interpretation is left up to the reader.  Is number 1 the main bullet point?  Do the bullet points become less important or more?  It’s not helped that there’s a change in font sizes as well.  In all with bullet points and indents six levels of hierarchy were created.  This allowed NASA managers to imply a hierarchy of importance in their head: the writing lower down and in smaller font was ignored.  Actually, this had been where the contradictory (and most important) information was placed.  


Thirdly, there is a huge amount of text, more than 100 words or figures on one screen.   Two words, ‘SOFI’ and ‘ramp’ both mean the same thing: the foam.  Vague terms are used.  Sufficient is used once, significant or significantly, five times with little or no quantifiable data.  As a result this left a lot open to audience interpretation.  How much is significant?  Is it statistical significance you mean or something else?  
























Finally the single most important fact, that the foam strike had occurred at forces massively out of test conditions, is hidden at the very bottom.  Twelve little words which the audience would have had to wade through more than 100 to get to.  If they even managed to keep reading to that point.  In the middle it does say that it is possible for the foam to damage the tile.  This is in the smallest font, lost. 























  NASA’s subsequent report criticised technical aspects along with human factors.  Their report mentioned an over-reliance on PowerPoint: “The Board views the endemic use of PowerPoint briefing slides instead of technical papers as an illustration of the problematic methods of technical communication at NASA.”  Edward Tufte’s full report makes for fascinating reading. Since being released in 1987 PowerPoint has grown exponentially to the point where it is now estimated than thirty million PowerPoint presentations are made every day.  Yet, PowerPoint is blamed by academics for killing critical thought.  Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos has banned it from meetings.   Typing text on a screen and reading it out loud does not count as teaching.  An audience reading text off the screen does not count as learning.  Imagine if the engineers had put up a slide with just: “foam strike more than 600 times bigger than test data.”  Maybe NASA would have listened.  Maybe they wouldn’t have attempted re-entry.  Next time you’re asked to give a talk remember Columbia. Don’t just jump to your laptop and write out slides of text.  Think about your message.  Don’t let that message be lost amongst text.  Death by PowerPoint is a real thing.  Sometimes literally.Thanks for reading - Jamie
