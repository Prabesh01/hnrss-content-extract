            <description><![CDATA[Even if you can’t stop Flock’s use entirely, you can still help protect civil liberties in your community.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
	  From Pasadena, California to Lexington, Kentucky to Menasha, Wisconsin, to Newark, New Jersey, the surveillance company Flock Safety is blanketing American cities with dangerously powerful and unregulated automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) cameras. While license plate readers have been around for some time, Flock is the first to create a nationwide mass-surveillance system out of its customers’ cameras.
Working with police departments, neighborhood watches, and other private customers, Flock not only allows private camera owners to create their own “hot lists” that will generate alarms when listed plates are spotted, but also runs all plates against state police watchlists and the FBI’s primary criminal database, the National Crime Information Center (NCIC). Flock’s goal is to expand to “every city in the United States,” and its cameras are already in use in over 2,000 cities in at least 42 states.
Unlike a targeted ALPR camera system that is designed to take pictures of license plates, check the plates against local hot lists, and then flush the data if there’s no hit, Flock is building a giant camera network that records people’s comings and goings across the nation, and then makes that data available for search by any of its law enforcement customers. Such a system provides even small-town sheriffs access to a sweeping and powerful mass-surveillance tool, and allows big actors like federal agencies and large urban police departments to access the comings and goings of vehicles in even the smallest of towns. And every new customer that buys and installs the company’s cameras extends Flock’s network, contributing to the creation of a centralized mass surveillance system of Orwellian scope. Motorola Solutions, a competitor to Flock, is pursuing a similar business model.
If the police or government leaders are pushing for Flock or another centralized mass-surveillance ALPR system in your community, we urge you to oppose it, full stop. You can do this by urging your local councilperson or other elected representatives to adopt our recommendations into law, attending public meetings and hearings, and raising the profile of the issue by writing letters to the editor and op-eds. You can also use social media to highlight the issues — be sure to tag your elected officials — including by sharing this blog post. If you’re an elected official or community leader, you may also be able to engage directly with your police department — we have found that some departments are willing to do so.
In a few places, residents concerned about privacy and over-policing have successfully blocked their police departments’ acquisition of Flock or other ALPR systems. But, in many other cities, those efforts have been thwarted. In communities where such systems can’t be stopped entirely, we can still help protect our and our neighbors’ civil liberties by working with our local police department and elected officials to ensure that local ALPR cameras do not feed into a mass surveillance system that lets potentially every law enforcement department in the world spy on the residents and visitors of any city in America.
We don’t find every use of ALPRs objectionable. For example, we do not generally object to using them to check license plates against lists of stolen cars, for AMBER Alerts, or for toll collection, provided they are deployed and used fairly and subject to proper checks and balances, such as ensuring devices are not disproportionately deployed in low-income communities and communities of color, and that the “hot lists” they are run against are legitimate and up to date. But there’s no reason the technology should be used to create comprehensive records of everybody’s comings and goings — and that is precisely what ALPR databases like Flock’s are doing. In our country, the government should not be tracking us unless it has individualized suspicion that we’re engaged in wrongdoing. We more fully lay out our concerns with this technology in a March 2022 white paper on Flock, and in a 2013 report on law enforcement use.
  
	  Many police departments neither understand nor endorse Flock’s nationwide, mass surveillance-driven approach to ALPR use, but are adopting the company’s cameras simply because other police departments in their region are doing so. As such, they may be amenable to compromise. That might even include using another vendor that does not tie its cameras into a mass-surveillance system. In other cases, you may be able to get your police department or local legislators to add addendums to Flock’s standard contract that limit its ALPR system’s mass surveillance capabilities and highly permissive data sharing.
In those situations, the three most important areas for regulation and negotiation are how long the data is retained, who the data is shared with, and how that data is used by law enforcement. We obtained samples of Flock’s Government Agency Customer Agreements with the Greensboro, North Carolina Police Department and other Flock contracts with local police. Below is suggested contract language across these three areas, based on these agreements, that you can use in your local advocacy efforts.
  
	  Whether ALPRs are being used for Amber Alerts, toll collection, or to identify stolen vehicles, a license plate can be run against a watchlist in seconds. The police do not need records of every person’s coming and goings, including trips to doctor’s offices, religious institutions, and political gatherings.
New Hampshire state law, which requires law enforcement to delete non-hit license plate capture data within three minutes, is a good model. But you should get the shortest retention period you can in your community. From worst to best, here are three approaches that can be taken to the retention of ALPR data:
  
	  One of the most important privacy-protective steps you can take is to restrict your community’s ALPR system to local use, meaning local ALPR scans are only checked against locally developed watch lists. Allowing local ALPR data to be used by outside law enforcement creates significant risks. Your local ALPR data could be used to enforce anti-abortion or anti-immigrant laws from other jurisdictions, or even to assist foreign, authoritarian regimes in hunting down political opponents and refugees living in America (Flock’s default provisions give the company a “worldwide” license to use its customers’ APLR data).
These risks are simply not worth taking, especially since there are many other companies that sell locally focused systems. From worst to best, here are three data sharing and use approaches:
  As much as we might hope that all police watchlists were 100 percent reliable, we know they are not. In fact, the largest and most commonly used national watch list — the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database — does not even comply with the 1974 United States Privacy Act’s basic accuracy, reliability, and completeness requirements. That means allowing your ALPR data to be run against such databases will subject anyone living in or visiting your town to unjustified arrest and detention, which is an especially dangerous proposition for members of vulnerable, already overpoliced communities. Again, from worst to best, here are three database use approaches:In the end, neither local police departments, nor government officials, nor residents should blindly accept Flock’s model simply because it advances Flock’s bottom line, or because other jurisdictions have unwisely chosen to do so. We continue to believe that using Flock cameras should be opposed outright. But where that battle can’t be won, then any system should at least be confined to the community itself and not made part of a national and international mass-surveillance system.]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[The Cache interface provides a persistent storage mechanism for Request / Response object pairs that are cached in long lived memory. How long a Cache object lives is browser dependent, but a single origin's scripts can typically rely on the presence of a previously populated Cache object. Note that the Cache interface is exposed to windowed scopes as well as workers. You don't have to use it in conjunction with service workers, even though it is defined in the service worker spec.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
            
            
    Instance methods
    
Cache.match()

Returns a Promise that resolves to the response associated with the first matching request in the Cache object.

Cache.matchAll()

Returns a Promise that resolves to an array of all matching responses in the Cache object.

Cache.add()

Takes a URL, retrieves it and adds the resulting response object to the given cache. This is functionally equivalent to calling fetch(), then using put() to add the results to the cache.

Cache.addAll()

Takes an array of URLs, retrieves them, and adds the resulting response objects to the given cache.

Cache.put()

Takes both a request and its response and adds it to the given cache.

Cache.delete()

Finds the Cache entry whose key is the request, returning a Promise that resolves to true if a matching Cache entry is found and deleted. If no Cache entry is found, the promise resolves to false.

Cache.keys()

Returns a Promise that resolves to an array of Cache keys.


  
    Examples
    This code snippet is from the service worker selective caching sample. (see selective caching live) The code uses CacheStorage.open() to open any Cache objects with a Content-Type header that starts with font/.
The code then uses Cache.match() to see if there's already a matching font in the cache, and if so, returns it. If there isn't a matching font, the code fetches the font from the network and uses Cache.put() to cache the fetched resource.
The code handles exceptions thrown from the fetch() operation. Note that an HTTP error response (e.g., 404) will not trigger an exception. It will return a normal response object that has the appropriate error code.
The code snippet also shows a best practice for versioning caches used by the service worker. Though there's only one cache in this example, the same approach can be used for multiple caches. It maps a shorthand identifier for a cache to a specific, versioned cache name. The code also deletes all caches that aren't named in CURRENT_CACHES.
In the code example, caches is a property of the ServiceWorkerGlobalScope. It holds the CacheStorage object, by which it can access the CacheStorage interface.
Note:
In Chrome, visit chrome://inspect/#service-workers and click on the "inspect" link below the registered service worker to view logging statements for the various actions the service-worker.js script is performing.

        });

        // error code set.
        console.error("  Error in fetch handler:", error);

        throw error;
      }),
  );
});

  
    Cookies and Cache objects
    The Fetch API requires Set-Cookie headers to be stripped before returning a Response object from fetch(). So a Response stored in a Cache won't contain Set-Cookie headers, and therefore won't cause any cookies to be stored.

            A little game by the name of Hollow Knight: Silksong just released, and it has thrown platforms into chaos.
As you can see from images captured by the Eurogamer team, the likes of Steam was brought to a grinding halt as many flocked to get their hands on the highly-anticipated sequel.
Meanwhile, several of us have been unable to add the game to our carts across Xbox, PlayStation and Switch. The PS store, for example, is stuck on Wishlisted at the time of writing.

In the words of our Connor: "Steam it looks like every step has issues, trying to pay with Paypal is leading to error messages."
Are you having more luck than us?

            <description><![CDATA[OpenAI and Perplexity both reportedly looked at acquiring the startup.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Mike Cannon-Brookes, co-founder and CEO of Atlassian, speaks at the National Electrical Vehicle Summit in Canberra, Australia, on Aug. 19, 2022. Cannon-Brookes is urging Australia to show more ambition on climate action, even as the new government legislates plans to strengthen the country's carbon emissions cuts.Hilary Wardhaugh | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAtlassian said it has agreed to acquire The Browser Co., a startup that offers a web browser with artificial intelligence features, for $610 million in cash.The companies aim to close the deal in Atlassian's fiscal second quarter, which ends in December.Established in 2019, The Browser Co. has gone up against some of the world's largest companies, including Google, with Chrome, and Apple, which includes Safari on its computers running MacOS.The startup debuted Arc, a customizable browser with a built-in whiteboard and the ability to share groups of tabs, in 2022. The Dia browser, a simpler option that allows people to chat with an AI assistant about multiple browser tabs at once, became available in beta in June.Atlassian co-founder and CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes said he sees shortcomings in the most popular browsers for those who do much of their work on computers."Whatever it is that you're actually doing in your browser is not particularly well served by a browser that was built in the name to browse," he said in an interview. "It's not built to work, it's not built to act, it's not built to do."Cannon-Brookes said Arc has helped him feel like he can manage his work, with its ability to organize tabs and automatically archive old ones.But only a small percentage of people who used The Browser Co.'s Arc adopted the program's special features."Our metrics were more like a highly specialized professional tool (like a video editor) than a mass-market consumer product, which we aspired to be closer to," Josh Miller, The Browser Co.'s co-founder and CEO, said in a newsletter update. The startup stopped building new features for Arc, leading to questions of whether it would release the browser under an open-source license.Read more CNBC tech newsHuawei launches second trifold smartphone at $2,500 as it looks to cement comebackC3 AI reports declining revenue, announces new CEO to replace SiebelOpenAI boosts size of secondary share sale to $10.3 billionApple has survived Trump's tariffs so far. It might raise iPhone prices anywayAI search startup Perplexity, which offered Google $34.5 billion for Chrome, talked with The Browser Co. about a possible acquisition in December, The Information reported. OpenAI also held deal talks with The Browser Co., according to the report.Cannon-Brookes wouldn't specify whether Atlassian considered buying Google's browser. Last year, the U.S. Justice Department proposed a divestiture after a federal judge ruled that the company enjoyed an internet search monopoly."I'm not even sure if there is a bidding competition for Chrome," Cannon-Brookes said. "I didn't see Google putting up an auction just yet. Look, I think we focus on actually getting acquisitions done and actually making those products a part of a coherent whole and delivering value for our customers. I'm not sure that stunt PR acquisition offers are really our thing, but we'll leave that for them to do."Perplexity has been providing early access to its own AI browser, which is named Comet.The Browser Co. was valued at $550 million last year. Investors include Atlassian Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, Figma co-founder Dylan Field and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.The browser is central for those using Atlassian products, such as the Jira project management software, which shows existing support requests on the web. But the plan isn't simply to make it nicer to work with Atlassian products online."It's really about taking Arc's SaaS application experience and power user features, and Dia's AI and elegance and speed and sort of svelte nature, and Atlassian's enterprise know-how, and working out how to put all that together into Dia, or into the AI part of the browser," Cannon-Brookes said.watch now]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Managers and supervisors brace yourselves: calling the boss a dickhead is not necessarily a sackable offence, a tribunal has ruled.The ruling came in the case of an office manager who was sacked on the spot when – during a row – she called her manager and another director dickheads.Kerrie Herbert has been awarded almost £30,000 in compensation and legal costs after an employment tribunal found she had been unfairly dismissed.The employment judge Sonia Boyes ruled that the scaffolding and brickwork company she worked for had not “acted reasonably in all the circumstances in treating [her] conduct as a sufficient reason to dismiss her”.“She made a one-off comment to her line manager about him and a director of the business,” Boyes said. “The comment was made during a heated meeting.“Whilst her comment was not acceptable, there is no suggestion that she had made such comments previously. Further … this one-off comment did not amount to gross misconduct or misconduct so serious to justify summary dismissal.”The hearing in Cambridge was told Herbert started her £40,000-a-year role at the Northampton firm Main Group Services in October 2018. The business was run by Thomas Swannell and his wife, Anna.The tribunal heard that in May 2022 the office manager had found documents in her boss’s desk about the costs of employing her, and became upset as she believed he was going to let her go.When Swannell then raised issues about her performance, she began crying, the hearing was told.She told the tribunal that she said: “If it was anyone else in this position they would have walked years ago due to the goings-on in the office, but it is only because of you two dickheads that I stayed.”She said Swannell retorted: “Don’t call me a fucking dickhead or my wife. That’s it, you’re sacked. Pack your kit and fuck off.”Herbert said she asked if he was really firing her and he answered: “Yes I have, now fuck off.”The office manager then sued the firm for unfair dismissal.The hearing was told that under the terms of her contract, she could be fired for “the provocative use of insulting or abusive language”.However, this required she be given a prior warning. Only more serious breaches such as “threatening and intimidating language” would be gross misconduct and warrant summary dismissal.Boyes found that Herbert was summarily fired because of her use of the word “dickheads” and ruled that the company had failed to follow proper disciplinary procedures.She concluded that calling her bosses dickheads was not sufficient to fire Herbert and ordered the firm to pay £15,042.81 in compensation.In her latest judgment she also ruled it had to pay £14,087 towards her legal fees.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ As I add more data to the NYC Chaos Dashboard, a website that maps live urban activity, I have been looking for a more efficient way to render the map.
Since I collect all of the data in one process and return the Dashboard as one HTML file, I kept wondering how I could
optimize the map’s loading time by pre-processing the data as much as possible in the backend. This is where vector tiles come in.
The code shown in this post is written in Go.
Why generate tiles?
Initially, all of the map’s data was passed to the rendering library in GeoJSON format (embedded directly in the HTML file).
For those who don’t know, GeoJSON is a JSON based standard to represent geographic information. You can go see the full RFC here,
but here’s a quick preview of what it looks like so you can get an idea:
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [-74.04452395542852, 40.68987850656795]
  },
  "properties": {
    "name": "Statue of Liberty",
    "status": "open"
  }
}
Now, I’m definitely not JSON’s greatest fan. It’s all text, meaning that a number is stored in a base 10 ASCII representation, where a number like 42 gets stored as "4" and "2".
I could go on, but I think you see the problem: it’s not the most efficient way to store data. Nonetheless, JSON has a lot of merits: it’s human-readable and easy to share between systems, so I find myself using it more
than I’d like to - more often than not, simplicity is the way to go, and a simple format like GeoJSON just gets the job done, and that alone makes it a worthy geographic standard.
So what happens when I start adding more layers to the map? It gets slow. I’m working on adding flood sensor data (thank you Floodnet for granting me access to the API), LIRR and MetroNorth data, NYISO power data,
and many more datasets which will start adding a lot of layers to the map. I can already see that the HTML file, at the time of writing, is 4.5Mb (once decompressed) and takes ~770ms to transfer from Cloudflare’s CDN to my browser.
This seems pretty reasonable for now, but it won’t scale as the future datasets are much larger, and running a quick check on the website, chrome is already telling me that the site has performance issues:

And if I look more closely, I can see that it’s the result of a long rendering (over 2s!), which I can see here:

Now, I suspect this is the result of a few things:

As mentioned above, all of the embedded data is GeoJSON. This means the rendering library (MapLibre GL JS) needs to parse the JSON. There’s a lot, with a lot of properties, so this takes time.
MapLibre GL needs to then take the coordinates and then place the lines, points and polygons on the map accordingly. This takes time, and it all happens on your browser.

I don’t like this - I want a map that people can use to check on the status of their city, and not a bloated HTML page that gets slower as more data gets onboarded, ironically making it less and less usable.
So, how can I display many large datasets on a map?
An obvious, and honestly wise, solution would be to simply load the GeoJSONs separately, via a GET request. You can do this simply in MapLibre:
map.addSource('resurfacing', {
    type: 'geojson',
    data: 'https://dash.hudsonshipping.co/data/resurfacing.geojson'
});
This is so much better than my current solution:
map.addSource('resurfacing', {
    type: 'geojson',
    data: {{.Geo.Resurfacing}}
});
{{.Geo.Resurfacing}} is the code in my HTML template that gets rendered in my Go process.
Loading GeoJSONs via a GET request will result in a lighter HTML file and a faster rendering of the Dashboard (the non-map components at least), but MapLibre still needs to parse that JSON and figure out how and where to plot the geometries.
This is still not optimal.
So how do big companies handle this? To display large amounts of data on map at scale and with performance, they use Vector Tiles, loading geometries sector by sector.
What are Vector Tiles?
Vector Tiles are small files that also represent geographic features, similar to GeoJSON. The key difference is that they represent a specific sector, a tile (thus the name), at a specific zoom.
That means if I want to display a map of the world with Vector Tiles, it will actually be a collection of square tiles pieced together.
Imagine taking a globe and cutting it up in multiple squares - that’s what vector tiles are (we’ll ignore distortion and projections for now, that’ll be a post for another time).
You may already be familiar with them when interacting with online maps, like Google Maps, where you can notice your features contained in squares, with some squares loaded before others:

MapTiler made a great demonstration of Tiles, showing the tile coordinates at different zoom levels.

Unlike GeoJSON where all features (point, line or polygon) of a layer are stored in one file, Vector Tiles (MVT) store features in smaller files that represent a specific area (at a specific zoom, or resolution).
In the above image, the points from the GeoJSON file are split into 3 tiles (tile 4 being empty).
So this is just a raster, then?
No, and this is where vector tiles get even more interesting. Like rasters, they represent data in a specific part of the world. But unlike rasters,
vector tiles don’t store an image, they store instructions. This is very, very similar (you’ll see just how much in the next section) to a JPEG vs an SVG.
This means vector tiles contain commands to draw layers and features that can then be customized in the rendering library:

Have a road you want to display as congested? Just set the line-color to red
Have a live event you want to display? Go for it, just add some custom animation to make the point pulsate


AS you can see in the above illustration, an Vector Tile file contains commands on how to plot the data using a local coordinate system, and not just a grid of pixels.
Ok, so how do I create one of these tiles and load it on a map?
Ok, this is the fun part - and it’s a lot easier than I first thought it would be. We’ll use the current
standard for vector tiles, which you may have glimpsed in the previous sections: Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT). MapLibre can handle this natively, and the documentation seems
pretty easy:
map.addSource('some id', {
    type: 'vector',
    tiles: ['https://dash.hudsonshipping.co/{z}/{x}/{y}/tile.mvt'],
    minzoom: 6,
    maxzoom: 14
});
So I need to have an endpoint that serves up MVT files for a given tile (x,y) at a given zoom z. That part isn’t too hard,
it’s a simple HTTP endpoint. So now, I need to actually be able to generate the MVT file.
Mapbox has done a great job documenting the spec, you can find it here.
I used this as the main reference for the project, as it contains everything you need to construct a vector tile. For all transformations, I simply used
the code made available my MapTiler.
An MVT represents information in binary format - this means it’s not human-readable, unlike GeoJSON. To generate the binary output,
Mapbox has opted for Protobuf. If you don’t know Protobuf, it’s Google’s standard to normalize structured data in a binary format with predefined fields and datatypes described in a .proto file. If you want to learn more about the project, I recommend checking this out. This is what the MVT proto file looks like:
message Tile {
        enum GeomType {
             UNKNOWN = 0;
             POINT = 1;
             LINESTRING = 2;
             POLYGON = 3;
        }

        message Value {
                optional string string_value = 1;
                optional float float_value = 2;
                optional double double_value = 3;
                optional int64 int_value = 4;
                optional uint64 uint_value = 5;
                optional sint64 sint_value = 6;
                optional bool bool_value = 7;

                extensions 8 to max;
        }
        message Feature {
                optional uint64 id = 1 [ default = 0 ];
                repeated uint32 tags = 2 [ packed = true ];
                optional GeomType type = 3 [ default = UNKNOWN ];
                repeated uint32 geometry = 4 [ packed = true ];
        }

        message Layer {
                required uint32 version = 15 [ default = 1 ];
                required string name = 1;
                repeated Feature features = 2;
                repeated string keys = 3;
                repeated Value values = 4;
                optional uint32 extent = 5 [ default = 4096 ];

                extensions 16 to max;
        }

        repeated Layer layers = 3;
        extensions 16 to 8191;
}
Ok, so looking at the proto, we can see that a tile is essentially an array of layers, each layer being able to contain multiple features.
To make this more understandable, here’s an example of what you could put in a tile:


Layer 1: Monuments

Feature 1: Statue of Liberty (type: Point)
Feature 2: Eiffel Tower (type: Point)



Layer 2: Airports

Feature 1: JFK (type: Point)
Feature 2: CDG (type: Point)



We’ll use this example throughout this section to construct a tile, and specifically focus on the Statue of Liberty. We can see that a layer represents a dataset you want to display on a map,
and a feature is a datapoint in that dataset. A tile can contain multiple layers, and thus multiple datasets. At a certain resolution,
we expect the Statue of Liberty to be in the same tile as the JFK airport, same for the Eiffel Tower and CDG, meaning they’ll be in the same MVT file.
Ok, so now we understand what’s contained in a tile. But how do you actually construct it?
Here are the steps required:

For a given zoom level, identify what tile (x, y) a feature belongs to
Create the tile and add the geometry
Add properties via tags
Return the tile via HTTP

1. Identifying the tiles
Let’s restate the problem we’re trying to solve: we have a GeoJSON file that we want to convert into multiple MVT tiles for performance reasons.
As stated earlier, to use MVT tiles in MapLibre we need to be able to return a response for:
https://dash.hudsonshipping.co/{z}/{x}/{y}/tile.mvt
So, this means I need to have multiple tiles generated in the backend, and return the correct one. But how do I know what tile each feature belongs to?
For example, when I am currently at zoom level 9, I can see that the the Statue of Liberty will be in the tile x = 150, y = 192:

And if I zoom to level 10, I can see that the Statue of Liberty will be in the tile
x = 301, y = 385:

To properly identify the tile, we need to do a few conversions. At this point, all of my geographic data is normalized to use EPSG:4326, a format most people are familiar with to represent coordinates. For example,
the Statue of Liberty’s coordinates in EPSG:4326, expressed in degrees, are:
longitude:-74.04452395542852, latitude: 40.68987850656795.
For vector tiles, the coordinate system used is called Web Mercator (EPSG:3857). In this system, expressed in meters, the
Statue is Liberty is located at:
x = -8242598.70274865, y = 4966705.869136138
So we need to convert the Statue of Liberty’s coordinates from degrees to meters, and then identify which square it belongs to at a specific
zoom level. This is pretty straight forward, so let’s get right to it.
Let’s finally get our hands dirty and write some code (please add proper error handling, this code is only for demonstration purposes).
First off, I want to convert my coordinates from EPSG:4326 (lon/lat) to EPSG:3857 (meters):
// We will use these constants throughout
const (
	EarthRadius = 6378137 // meters
	TileSize    = 512 // pixels
	OriginShift = 2 * math.Pi * EarthRadius / 2.0
)

func LonLatToMeters(lon float64, lat float64) (x float64, y float64) {
	mx := lon * OriginShift / 180.0
	my := math.Log(math.Tan((90 + lat) * math.Pi / 360.0)) / (math.Pi / 180.0)
	my = my * OriginShift / 180.0
	return mx, my
}
The spec refers to 4096 tile sizes, but MapLibre seems to use 512 pixels, so we’ll stick with this.
Once we’ve successfully written the function to convert our coordinates, we can now write the code to get the appropriate tile:
func Resolution(zoom int) float64 {
	// Returns meters / pixel
	initialResolution := 2 * math.Pi * EarthRadius / TileSize
	return initialResolution / (math.Pow(2, float64(zoom)))
}

func MetersToTile(mx float64, my float64, zoom int) (x int, y int) {
	res := Resolution(zoom) // meters / pixel
	px := (mx + OriginShift) / res
	py := (my + OriginShift) / res

	tx := int(math.Ceil(px / float64(TileSize)) - 1)
	ty := int(math.Ceil(py / float64(TileSize)) - 1)
	return tx, ty
}

func GoogleTile(tx int, ty int, zoom int) (x int, y int) {
	ty = int(math.Pow(2, float64(zoom))-1) - ty
	return tx, ty
}
Once we have these utility functions, determining the appropriate tile only requires a few lines of code:
mx, my   := LonLatToMeters(lon, lat)
tx, ty   := MetersToTile(mx, my, zoom)
gtx, gty := GoogleTile(tx, ty, zoom)
We use GoogleTile() because it seems MapLibre uses this standard (simply shift the origin to the top left). I couldn’t find documentation on it,
but I was able to see this behavior during my tests. I’ll update this part if I find the relevant documentation.
Here is what we now have:

mx and my are the point’s coordinates in meters, using the Web Mercator projection.
tx and ty are the tile coordinates in TMS format.
gtx and gty are the tile coordinates in Google format (also known as the XYZ format).

Great, we know what tile our feature belongs to for a given zoom. Let’s go create the tile.
2. Create the tile and add the geometry
Now that we know which tile a feature belongs to, let’s create the MVT file. You’ll need to install protoc for Go:
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
Go ahead and get the official .proto here: https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/blob/master/2.1/vector_tile.proto
Generate the struct:
protoc --go_out=./path/to/dir/mvt ./path/to/dir/mvt/vector_tile.proto
This will generate a vector_tile.pb.go that will look something like this:
// Code generated by protoc-gen-go. DO NOT EDIT.
// versions:
// 	protoc-gen-go v1.36.8
// 	protoc        v3.21.12
// source: internal/geo/mvt/vector_tile.proto

package mvt // Make sure to use the correct package here

import (
	protoreflect "google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect"
	protoimpl "google.golang.org/protobuf/runtime/protoimpl"
	reflect "reflect"
	sync "sync"
	unsafe "unsafe"
)

const (
	// Verify that this generated code is sufficiently up-to-date.
	_ = protoimpl.EnforceVersion(20 - protoimpl.MinVersion)
	// Verify that runtime/protoimpl is sufficiently up-to-date.
	_ = protoimpl.EnforceVersion(protoimpl.MaxVersion - 20)
)

// GeomType is described in section 4.3.4 of the specification
type Tile_GeomType int32

const (
	Tile_UNKNOWN    Tile_GeomType = 0
	Tile_POINT      Tile_GeomType = 1
	Tile_LINESTRING Tile_GeomType = 2
	Tile_POLYGON    Tile_GeomType = 3
)
// ...
Once we have generated the protobuf class, we can create an empty tile like this:
func NewTile(layerName string) *Tile {
    // The Tile struct comes from the generated protobuf
	version := uint32(0)
	extent := uint32(TileSize)
	layers := []*Tile_Layer{
	    {
	        Name:     &layerName,
	        Version:  &version,
	        Features: make([]*Tile_Feature, 0),
	        Extent:   &extent,
	    },
	}
	return &Tile{Layers: layers}
}
t = NewTile("monuments")
Great, we now have an empty tile. Let’s add our monument to ut, as a feature in the first layer called monuments.
A feature is defined by a few things:

A geometry type, in our case a Point
Tags (properties for that feature, which we’ll add in the next section)
A geometry

As mentioned earlier, a vector tile behaves similarly to an SVG file: you specify instructions to move a cursor. And that’s
exactly what goes into the geometry field: a series of instructions for a cursor.
Since our monument is a Point, we only have one instruction: move to location (x, y):

As you can see in the above example, we’re telling the cursor to move from the Origin to a specific part of the tile.
In this case, we’re letting MapLibre GL know to move the cursor 200 pixels to the right (x axis) and 75 pixels down (y axis).
But how do we get these instructions? Instructions are relative to the Origin of the tile, which is located at the top-left corner.
Coordinates go from 0 to 512 (the Extent of the tile, which we defined above).:

This means we need a few things:

Get the Web Mercator coordinates of the tile’s Origin
Calculate the offset, dx and dy for a given Point
Convert the offset in meters to an offset in pixels

Getting the tile’s origin is pretty straight forward:
func GetTileOrigin(tx int, ty int, zoom int) (minx int64, maxy int64) {
	res := Resolution(zoom)
	minX := int64(float64(tx) * TileSize * res - OriginShift)
	maxY := int64(float64(ty + 1) * TileSize * res - OriginShift)
	return minX, maxY
}
originX, originY := TileBounds(tx, ty, zoom)
Now that we have the Origin’s coordinates in meters, let’s calculate the offsets dx and dy:
dx := mx - originX
dy := originY - my
Finally, let’s divide the offsets by the resolution, expressed in meters / pixel, to get the parameters for the instruction:
res := Resolution(zoom)
shiftX := uint32(math.Floor(float64(dx) / res))
shiftY := uint32(math.Floor(float64(dy) / res))
We now have everything we need to construct our feature:
geomType := Tile_POINT
feature := Tile_Feature{
    Type: &geomType,
    Geometry: []uint32{
        1 & 0x7 | 1 << 3, // Command 1 (moveTo), count of 1
        (shiftX << 1) ^ (shiftX >> 31),
        (shiftY << 1) ^ (shiftY >> 31),
    },
}
The geometry is a little odd, but here’s what’s happening:

We pass in a slice of instructions, which is made up of a command followed by parameters
To place a Point, we use the command moveTo, to move the cursor
This command expects two parameters, dX and dY, which we pass in using zigzag encoding

We can go ahead and add this feature to our tile:
t.Layers[0].Features = append(t.Layers[0].Features, &feature)
3. Add properties
We now have a tile that meets the basic requirements:

1 layer
1 feature in the layer with a valid geometry

I now want to add the properties defined in the GeoJSON, in this case, the name and the status for the Statue of Liberty.
As with GeoJSON, you can store properties for each feature. So here, the status could be one of three:

open: Open for visit.
closed: Closed for visit.
maintenance: Closed for maintenance.

Adding the status open to the Statue of Liberty in GeoJSON looks like this:
{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [-74.04452395542852, 40.68987850656795]
  },
  "properties": {
    "name": "Statue of Liberty",
    "status": "open"
  }
}
So, if I have 10’000 monuments, I’ll have 10,000 dictionaries like this:
"properties": {
    "name": "<Monument Name>",
    "status": "<Monument Status>"
  }
That means repeating open, closed or maintenance 10,000 times. Best case scenario, that’s 40,000 bytes (open 10,000 times),
and you probably want a unique name for your monument, so add another 10,000 strings to your file.
You can definitely improve this by shortening the status to something like o for open, and s for status, but this will only
get you so far as you scale (especially if you’re dealing with numbers, where these tricks won’t work) and add more properties and features.
Vector Tiles use a different approach: tags. In each layer, you define a set of keys and a set of values.
In our previous example, the keys would be [name, status] and the values would be [Statue of Liberty, open, closed, maintenance]:

So let’s add the known keys and values to our layer:
t.Layers[0].Keys = []string{"name", "status"}

SoLName := "Statue of Liberty"
StatusOpen := "open"
StatusClosed := "closed"
StatusMaintenance := "maintenance"
t.Layers[0].Values = []*Tile_Value{
    {StringValue: &SoLName},           // 0
    {StringValue: &StatusOpen},        // 1
    {StringValue: &StatusClosed},      // 2
    {StringValue: &StatusMaintenance}, // 3
}
Now that our layer knows what keys and values to expect, we can go ahead and set the property for the Statue of Liberty:
t.Layers[0].Features[0].Tags = []uint32{0, 0, 1, 1} // name: Statue of Liberty, status: open
If we wanted to update the status to inform users the Statue of Liberty is closed for maintenance, we would simply update the tags to:
t.Layers[0].Features[0].Tags = []uint32{0, 0, 1, 3} // name: Statue of Liberty, status: maintenance
4. Return the tile via HTTP
Our tile t isready to be returned to the frontend via an HTTP GET request.
To convert our tile to the MVT binary, simply use:
import 	"github.com/gogo/protobuf/proto"

out, _ := proto.Marshal(t)
out contains the []byte data that represents the .mvt file. Be sure to set the following header in your HTTP response:
"Content-Type" : "application/vnd.mapbox-vector-tile"
And there it is - a vector tile built entirely from scratch, using geographic information contained in a GeoJSON file.
When you’re using a map, you’ll almost always be visualizing more than one tile at a time, and zooming in and out. This means
each feature will be on multiple tiles, one per zoom level, so you’ll need to design a strategy to handle this. The below code is
a quick snippet of the implementation used for the Dashboard (some of the HTTP code is using an internal library, it can easily be replaced with
your own HTTP server implementation / library):
type TileMap struct {
	Tiles map[int]map[int]map[int]*Tile // [z][x][y]Tile
}

func NewTileMap() *TileMap {
	tiles := make(map[int]map[int]map[int]*Tile)
	for _, zoom := range Zooms {
		tiles[zoom] = make(map[int]map[int]*Tile)
	}
	return &TileMap{Tiles: tiles}
}

func (tm *TileMap) GetTile(z int, x int, y int) *Tile {
	if xyMap, zExists := tm.Tiles[z]; zExists {
		if yMap, xExists := xyMap[x]; xExists {
			if tile, yExists := yMap[y]; yExists {
				return tile
			}
		}
	}
	return nil
}
tm := NewTileMap()

// Generate the tiles here and populate the tile map using the above code
// ...

h.PublicHandler("GET", "/layer/potholes/{z}/{x}/{y}/tile.mvt", func(r *http.Request) web.HttpResp {
		z := r.PathValue("z")
		x := r.PathValue("x")
		y := r.PathValue("y")
		zInt, _ := strconv.Atoi(z)
		xInt, _ := strconv.Atoi(x)
		yInt, _ := strconv.Atoi(y)
		var out []byte
		if tm == nil {
			out, _ = proto.Marshal(mvt.NewTile("empty"))
		} else {
			tile := tm.GetTile(zInt, xInt, yInt)
			out, err = proto.Marshal(tile)
			if err != nil {
				// Generate an empty tile
				out, _ = proto.Marshal(mvt.NewTile("empty"))
			}
		}
		return web.HttpResp{
			Data:        out,
			StatusCode:  http.StatusOK,
			ContentType: "application/vnd.mapbox-vector-tile",
		}
	})
We’ve now created an HTTP server that returns MVT files on demand, as a user explores the map.
Did the performance improve?
After deploying the MVT tile server for my GeoJSON layers that contain points, this is what we get:

File size decreased to 3.7Mb (I mean, we removed GeoJSON data, so no surprise there), meaning the site now loads in 500ms
The paint time has decreased (by about 200ms, not bad for migrating just 2 datasets over), and the performance score went up by 8% according to Lighthouse:


I’m running this process off of a server in my office, and I use Cloudflare Tunnels to expose the site, which unfortunately means
the tiles don’t return very fast. This means I’m going to have to move this over to AWS, something I’ve been meaning to do, and I expect
the tiles to return a lot faster, hopefully sub 100ms.
I still have to move over the non-Point layers that are still GeoJSON, so I expect a big gain in performance there. More soon!
What’s next?
This simple example only focuses on Points. Implementing lines and polygons requires more work, as they can span multiple tiles.
I’ll put out a new post once I’ve implemented these, along with performance metrics of the Dashboard.
I’m also looking forward to seeing MapLibre tiles ready for production use, so I can generate MapLibre tiles
and get some additional performance gain and contribute to the MapLibre ecosystem.
I’m working on making the Go code open source in a small geographic library, which I’ll put on Hudson Shipping Co’s github.
Thank you!

Attention is something we “have to protect.” And we have to “pay”1 attention—like a tribute.But we shouldn’t forget how interesting and overpoweringly pleasurable sustained attention can be. Slowing down makes reality vivid, strange, and hot.Let me start with the most obvious example.As anyone who has had good sex knows, sustained attention and delayed satisfaction are a big part of it. When you resist the urge to go ahead and get what you want and instead stay in the moment, you open up a space for seduction and fantasy. Desire begins to loop on itself and intensify.I’m not sure what is going on here, but my rough understanding is that the expectation of pleasure activates the dopaminergic system in the brain. Dopamine is often portrayed as a pleasure chemical, but it isn’t really about pleasure so much as the expectation that pleasure will occur soon. So when we are being seduced and sense that something pleasurable is coming—but it keeps being delayed, and delayed skillfully—the phasic bursts of dopamine ramp up the levels higher and higher, pulling more receptors to the surface of the cells, making us more and more sensitized to the surely-soon-to-come pleasure. We become hyperattuned to the sensations in our genitals, lips, and skin.And it is not only dopamine ramping up that makes seduction warp our attentional field, infusing reality with intensity and strangeness. There are a myriad of systems that come together to shape our feeling of the present: there are glands and hormones and multiple areas of the brain involved. These are complex physical processes: hormones need to be secreted and absorbed; working memory needs to be cleared and reloaded, and so on. The reason deep attention can’t happen the moment you notice something is that these things take time.What’s more, each of these subsystems update what they are reacting to at a different rate. Your visual cortex can cohere in less than half a second. A stress hormone like cortisol, on the other hand, has a half-life of 60–90 minutes and so can take up to 6 hours to fully clear out after the onset of an acute stressor. This means that if we switch what we pay attention to more often than, say, every 30 minutes, our system will be more or less decohered—different parts will be “attending to” different aspects of reality.2 There will be “attention residue” floating around in our system—leftovers from earlier things we paid attention to (thoughts looping, feelings circling below consciousness, etc.), which crowd out the thing we have in front of us right now, making it less vivid.Inversely, the longer we are able to sustain the attention without resolving it and without losing interest, the more time the different systems of the body have to synchronize with each other, and the deeper the experience gets.Locked in on the same thing, the subsystems begin to reinforce each other: the dopamine makes us aware of our skin, and sensations on the skin ramp up dopamine release, making us even more aware of our skin. A finger touches our belly, and we start to fantasize about where that finger might be going; and so now our fantasies are locked in, too, releasing even more dopamine and making us even more aware of our skin. The more the subsystems lock in, the more intense the feedback loops get. After twenty minutes, our sense of self has evaporated, and we’re in a realm where we do, feel, and think things that would seem surreal in other contexts.Similar things happen when we are able to sustain our attention to things other than sex, too. The exact mechanics differ, I presume, but the basic pattern is that when we let our attention linger on something, our bodily systems synchronize and feed each other stimuli in an escalatory loop that restructures our attentional field.Almost anything that we are able to direct sustained attention at will begin to loop on itself and bloom.To take a dark example, if you focus on your anxiety, the anxiety can begin to loop on itself until you hyperventilate and get tunnel vision and become filled with nightmarish thoughts and feelings—a panic attack.And you do the same thing with joy. If you learn to pay sustained attention to your happiness, the pleasant sensation will loop on itself until it explodes and pulls you into a series of almost hallucinogenic states, ending in cessation, where your consciousness lets go and you disappear for a while. This takes practice. The practice is called jhanas, and it is sometimes described as the inverse of a panic attack. I have only ever entered the first jhana, once while spending an hour putting our four-year-old to sleep and meditating on how wonderful it is to lie there next to her. It was really weird and beautiful. If you want to know more about these sorts of mental states, I recommend José Luis Ricón Fernández de la Puente’s recent write-up of his experiences, Nadia Asparouhova on her experiences, and her how-to guide.Here is José, whose blog is normally detailed reflections on cell biology and longevity and metascience, describing the second evening of a jhana retreat:So I went down to the beach. “Kinda nice”, I thought. The sky had a particularly vibrant blue color, the waves had ‘the right size’, their roar was pleasant. I started to walk around trying to continue meditating. I focused my awareness on an arising sensation of open heartedness and then I noticed my eyes tearing up (“Huh? I thought”). I looked again at the ocean and then I saw it. It was fucking amazing. So much color and detail: waves within waves, the fractal structure of the foamy crests as they disintegrate back into the ocean. The feeling of the sun on my skin. I felt overwhelmed. As tears ran down my face and lowkey insane grin settled on my face I found myself mumbling “It’s... always been like this!!!!” “What the fuck??!” followed by “This is too much!! Too much!!!”. The experience seemed to be demanding from me to feel more joy and awe than I was born to feel or something like that. In that precise moment I felt what “painfully beautiful” means for the first time in my life.The fact that we can enter fundamentally different, and often exhilarating, states of mind by learning how to sustain our attention is fascinating. It makes you wonder what other states are waiting out there. What will happen if you properly pay attention to an octopus?3 What about your sense of loneliness?4 A mathematical idea?5 The weights of a neural net?6 The footnotes here take you to examples of people who have done that. There are so many things to pay attention to and experience.One of my favorite things to sustain attention toward is art.There was a period in my twenties when I didn’t get art. I thought artists were trying to say something, but I felt superior because I thought there had to be better ways of getting their ideas across (and also, better ideas). But then I realized that good art—at least the art I am spontaneously drawn to—has little to do with communication. Instead, it is about crafting patterns of information that, if you feed them sustained attention, will begin to structure your attentional field in interesting ways. Art is guided meditation. The point isn’t the words, but what happens to your mind when you attend to those words (or images, or sounds). There is nothing there to understand; it is just something to experience, like sex. But the experiences can be very deep and, sometimes, transformative.In 2019, for example, I saw a performance of Jean Sibelius’s 5th Symphony at the University Hall in Uppsala.Before the concert began, I spent a few minutes with my eyes closed, doing a body scan, to be fully present when the music began. As the horns at the opening of the piece called out, I decided to keep my eyes closed, so I wouldn’t be distracted by looking at the hands of the musicians. Then… a sort of daydream started up. The mood suggested to me the image of a cottage overlooking a sloping meadow and a thick wood of pines, a few hours from Helsinki. It was a pretty obvious image, since I knew that Sibelius wrote the piece at Aniola, which is 38 km north of Helsinki. But then I saw an old man walking up the meadow and into the house. The camera cut. Through an open door, I saw the man, alone, working at a desk. I saw it as clearly as if it had been projected on a screen before me: the camera moved slowly toward the back of the man.Through the window above his desk, I could see a light in the distance. Perhaps it was Helsinki? No, it felt alive, like a being—something alive and growing, something that was headed here. But then again, if you were to see a city from space, watching it sped up by 100,000x, it would look like a being moving through the landscape, spreading, getting closer. The old man sat there for a hundred years, watching the light. There was a sinking feeling in my body.One spring, birds fell dead from the sky. They littered the fields, whole droves of them filled the ditches—blue birds, red birds, and black. The man carried them into his woodshed and placed them in waist-high piles.The film kept going, and the emotional intensity and complexity gradually ramped up. For the thirty minutes that it took the orchestra to play the three movements of the symphony, I experienced what felt like two or three feature films, all interconnected by some strange emotional logic. In the third movement, a group of hunter-gatherers was living in a cave that reminded me of the entrance to a nuclear waste facility. A girl hiding behind a tree saw men with cars arrive…The structure of the music was such that it gave me enough predictability and enough surprise to allow my attention to deeply cohere. The melody lines and harmonies dredged up memories and images from my subconscious, weaving them into a rich cinematic web of stories. Guided by the music, my mind could tunnel into an attentional state where I was able to see things I had never seen before and where I could work through some deep emotional pain that seemed to resolve itself through the images.When the music stopped, I barely knew where I was.I opened my eyes and remembered that my brother was sitting next to me.“What did you think?” I said.“I don’t know,” he said. “I felt kind of restless.”Like always, the research for this essay was funded by the contribution of paying subscribers.

The image of the University Hall is by Ann-Sofi Cullhed.If you liked this essay, you might also like:Becoming perceptive·September 10, 2024This is the second part of an essay series that began with “Everything that turned out well in my life followed the same design process.” There is also a third part. It can be read on its own.1In Spanish, you “lend” attention. In Swedish, you “are” attention.2It is not like 30 minutes is some ideal. Attention can, under the right conditions, keep getting deeper and more coherent for much longer, as attested by people who meditate for weeks. Inversely, you can, if you have a well developed dorsal attention network and low cortisol level etc, cohere to a high degree in a few minutes. (Though if you have a lot of stress hormones, thirty minutes will not be nearly enough to get out of a flighty mode of attention.) In other words, I don’t think you can put a precise number at it.Time to coherence depends on your starting place (mood, hormones, chemical make up in the brain), your skill, and the level of coherence you want to pursue. There is a famous study saying it takes people 23 minutes to get to full productivity after an interruption, which seems like it is correlated to the time it takes them to deeply cohere their attentional field. On the other hand, there is also an upper limit at how long you can cohere, which also depends on a bunch of factors. If I’m working on an essay, I notice that the quality of my thinking drops after about 20 minutes of sustained attention and I need to pause for a few minutes and walk around to get back up to full focus. So in my case, my deepest thinking seem to decohere before I even reach that infamous 23 minute mark! And after 3-4 hours, the quality of my attention goes down so much that everything I write ends up being deleted the day after. For more relaxed attention, like meditation, I haven’t reached the limit for how long I can deepen my coherence—after an hour, which is the longest I’ve gone, I’m still shifting deeper into attention.3Charles Darwin:[During our stay in Porto Praya,] I was much interested, on several occasions, by watching the habits of an Octopus, or cuttle-fish. Although common in the pools of water left by the retiring tide, these animals were not easily caught. By means of their long arms and suckers, they could drag their bodies into very narrow crevices; and when thus fixed, it required great force to remove them. At other times they darted tail first, with the rapidity of an arrow, from one side of the pool to the other, at the same instant discolouring the water with a dark chestnut-brown ink. These animals also escape detection by a very extraordinary, chameleon-like power of changing their colour. They appear to vary their tints according to the nature of the ground over which they pass: when in deep water, their general shade was brownish purple, but when placed on the land, or in shallow water, this dark tint changed into one of a yellowish green.The colour, examined more carefully, was a French grey, with numerous minute spots of bright yellow: the former of these varied in intensity; the latter entirely disappeared and appeared again by turns. These changes were effected in such a manner, that clouds, varying in tint between a hyacinth red and a chestnut-brown, were continually passing over the body. Any part, being subjected to a slight shock of galvanism, became almost black: a similar effect, but in a less degree, was produced by scratching the skin with a needle. These clouds, or blushes as they may be called, are said to be produced by the alternate expansion and contraction of minute vesicles containing variously coloured fluids.This cuttle-fish displayed its chameleon-like power both during the act of swimming and whilst remaining stationary at the bottom. I was much amused by the various arts to escape detection used by one individual, which seemed fully aware that I was watching it. Remaining for a time motionless, it would then stealthily advance an inch or two, like a cat after a mouse; sometimes changing its colour: it thus proceeded, till having gained a deeper part, it darted away, leaving a dusky train of ink to hide the hole into which it had crawled.While looking for marine animals, with my head about two feet above the rocky shore, I was more than once saluted by a jet of water, accompanied by a slight grating noise. At first I could not think what it was, but afterwards I found out that it was this cuttle-fish, which, though concealed in a hole, thus often led me to its discovery. That it possesses the power of ejecting water there is no doubt, and it appeared to me that it could certainly take good aim by directing the tube or siphon on the under side of its body. From the difficulty which these animals have in carrying their heads, they cannot crawl with ease when placed on the ground. I observed that one which I kept in the cabin was slightly phosphorescent in the dark.from:  https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9444Sasha Chapin writes: In late winter 2024, I noticed that I wasn’t living up to my stated policy of trying to accept every emotion passing through my system. There were certain shades of existential loneliness that I was pushing away. This was causing some friction. Solitude is simply part of my current life chapter, since Cate is more independent than any of my previous partners, and Berkeley is a place where I don’t feel at home socially.As a response, I made feelings of solitude the central focus of my practice. I tried to become like a sommelier, going out of my way to appreciate all the shades of loneliness that colored my afternoons, trying to zoom in on every micro-pixel and embrace rather than reject.Again—normal. This is what, for me, long-term practice often consists of: noticing when my reactions don’t line up with my principles, and seeing if I can bring myself into deeper alignment.However, I noticed something odd. Dropping the resistance to loneliness allowed me to slip into deeper sensations of flow. It was almost as if the emotional resistance had been preventing the emergence of a more intuitive part of my will. There were a few memorable walks I took where the feeling of solitude felt like a portal into an exquisitely smooth parallel world. When I allowed my emotions to pierce me more deeply, I fell into a different degree of cooperation with reality. Every step felt precise and necessary, like a choreographed dance.5Michael Nielsen writes about this in an essay where he describes the experience of pushing himself to go deeper than usual in understanding a mathematical proof:I gradually internalize the mathematical objects I’m dealing with [using spaced repetition]. It becomes easier and easier to conduct (most of) my work in my head. [. . .] Furthermore, as my understanding of the objects change – as I learn more about their nature, and correct my own misconceptions – my sense of what I can do with the objects changes as well. It’s as though they sprout new affordances, in the language of user interface design, and I get much practice in learning to fluidly apply those affordances in multiple ways. [. . .]After going through the [time-consuming process of deeply understanding a proof,] I had a rather curious experience. I went for a multi-hour walk along the San Francisco Embarcadero. I found that my mind simply and naturally began discovering other facts related to the result. In particular, I found a handful (perhaps half a dozen) of different proofs of the basic theorem, as well as noticing many related ideas. This wasn’t done especially consciously – rather, my mind simply wanted to find these proofs.6Chris Olah writes: Research intimacy is different from theoretical knowledge. It involves internalizing information that hasn’t become part of the “scientific cannon” yet. Observations we don’t (yet) see as important, or haven’t (yet) digested. The ideas are raw.(A personal example: I’ve memorized hundreds of neurons in InceptionV1. I know how they behave, and I know how that behavior is built from earlier neurons. These seem like obscure facts, but they give me powerful, concrete examples to test ideas against.)Research intimacy is also different from research taste. But it does feed into it, and I suspect it’s one of the key ingredients in beating the “research taste market.”As your intimacy with a research topic grows, your random thoughts about it become more interesting. Your thoughts in the shower or on a hike bounce against richer context. Your unconscious has more to work with. Your intuition deepens.I suspect that a lot of “brilliant insights” are natural next steps from someone who has deep intimacy with a research topic. And that actually seems more profound.No posts]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[A new technique can reshape your vision without lasers. Learn how electricity might change future eye surgeries.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[A new, promising technique has the potential to replace laser surgeries in ophthalmologists’ offices in the future, for a fraction of the cost. Called electromechanical reshaping (EMR), the technique offers a gentler approach to correcting the cornea than Laser-Assisted in Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK), today’s gold standard for treating vision issues including nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism.The eye develops these and other conditions when the cornea’s curvature is off—too steep, too flat, or too uneven. To solve the problem, surgeons generally use laser techniques such as LASIK to “sculpt” the eye surface by cutting away small parts of corneal tissue. The results can be life-changing, but the procedure has its risks, as LASIK permanently reduces corneal strength, raising the risk of new vision problems.Alternative nonsurgical methods such as specially designed contact lenses can temporarily mold the cornea, but these require nightly wear and can cause infection. Now, engineers and eye doctors are trying to find a way to permanently reshape collagen-rich tissues like the cornea without cutting, burning, or removing material.Brian Wong, a surgeon-engineer at the University of California, Irvine, stumbled upon a possible solution about a decade ago. He had long worked with thermal techniques for reshaping cartilage tissues—which include the cornea—but found a puzzling “Goldilocks problem” during his research: The heating needed to change shapes often killed too many tissue cells. Then a “happy accident” opened a different perspective, he says. “My postdoctoral fellow connected a pair of electrodes and a Coke can to a power supply…and out of spite, fried a piece of cartilage,” Wong recalls. The cartilage began to bubble, which the postdoc thought was from heat. “But it wasn’t hot. We touched it and thought, this is getting a shape change. This must be electrolysis,” he says. That surprise pointed to electrochemistry rather than heat as the mechanism. To explore further, Wong partnered with Michael Hill, a chemist at Occidental College. Together, they began exploring the chemistry behind EMR and testing it in different tissues. In mid-August, they presented results from their most recent tests at the American Chemical Society’s fall meeting that took place in Washington, D.C. How Electricity Reshapes TissueEMR uses small electrical pulses to split water at the tissue surface into hydrogen and oxygen, releasing protons that spread into the part of the corneal tissue that gives it structural integrity, the ability to hydrate, and other mechanical properties. Once protons are spread throughout the cornea’s surface, they disrupt the chemical bonds that hold collagen fibers in place, also changing the corneal tissue’s pH. This, Wong explains, is the moment when the cornea becomes moldable. Once shaped with a metal contact lens–like mold, it “locks in” to the new shape as the electric pulses are turned off and the body’s natural physiological response returns the cornea’s pH back to its normal value. In 2023, Wong and Hill coauthored a proof-of-concept paper in ACS Biomaterials Science & Engineering, showing that EMR could reshape rabbit corneas without compromising transparency. “That paper was really about asking, is it even possible? Can we change the shape of a cornea without gross damage?” Hill says. “Now, after two more years of work, we’ve systematically gone through the parameters—and we can say yes, it is possible, and we can do it safely,” he adds.Their team built custom platinum contact lenses, press-molded to precise curvatures, and connected them to electrodes. Mounted onto rabbit eyes immersed in a saline solution, the electrodes delivered pulses of around 1.5 volts. X-ray imaging tests confirmed the corneas had indeed matched the mold’s shape. Microscopy tests also confirmed the collagen tissue remained organized post-surgery. “Fine control is the key,” Wong observes. The cost of procedures using the new technique can be significantly lower than laser eye surgery, according to Wong. That’s because, unlike LASIK, EMR doesn’t rely on “laser platforms that cost as much as luxury cars.” The new technique could also be more affordable for clinics and regions priced out of LASIK. While the technique has a long way to go before being used in eye surgeries, the research is advancing to in-vivo animal tests to prove safety and durability—and for long-term tracking to ensure the results last. “Nobody’s getting this at the optometrist next year,” Hill cautions. “Now comes the hard work—refining parameters, confirming long-term viability, and making sure treated eyes don’t revert back,” he adds.That hard work, Hill adds, depends a lot on funding for basic science. EMR was born not from a targeted medical-device program but from curiosity-driven experiments in electrochemistry. “You don’t always know where basic research will lead,” Hill says. “We were looking at electroanalytical chemistry, not eye surgery. But those foundational insights are what made this possible. If you cut off that basic research, you don’t get these kinds of unexpected, transformative opportunities,” he adds.]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[A history of blue 🦋]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[La Gare Saint-Lazare, arrivée d'un train, by Claude Monet (1877)My favorite color has changed throughout my life, cycling through the entire spectrum of visible light and beyond. I don’t remember when blue was the chosen one, exactly; maybe when I was 13 or so. After that, yellow, purple, orange, green, and pink occupied the top spot for various periods. Blue never made a comeback. I saw it as a banal, common color. After all, the sky is made of it, and the sky is everywhere. Then I realized when compiling the tech tree that blue is the most fascinating color, because it is the hardest of the common colors to create artificially.1 You can’t just take a piece of the sky and put it into a painting. And blue pigments are fairly rare in minerals, plants, and animals. So blue had to be invented, time and time again, from 4000 BC to the 21st century. It is the most technological color, and I’m willing to claim that this is why it is usually, in science fiction and elsewhere, used to represent the future.The story of blue starts with indigo. It is an organic dye made from plants in the Indigofera genus, which grow throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The first known traces of indigo dye come from the New World, in ancient Peru, 6,000 years ago, using Indigofera suffruticosa, or anil.2 In the Old World, it was known from Africa to East Asia, but became particularly associated with India (hence indi-go), where Indigofera tinctoria was domesticated. Indigo soon became a luxury, traded from India to Greco-Roman and then medieval Europe, where the same blue dye could only be made from a less productive plant, woad or Isatis tinctoria. Eventually the “blue gold” became an important colonial crop in the Caribbean and was part of the story of slavery, next to sugar, tobacco, and cotton. A bucket  of indigo in China (source)Before indigo was a thing in the Old World (that started circa 2400 BC), the Egyptians had already become obsessed with the color blue. Besides the sky, it was available in the form of semiprecious stones like turquoise and lapis lazuli, cobalt oxide (more on that later), as well as the mineral azurite, which they mined in Sinai and the Eastern Desert.Azurite geode from Sweden (source)Azurite would later enjoy a fruitful career as the main blue pigment in European painting, but to the Egyptians it was costly, and besides it isn’t the most stable blue color: it degrades and fades when in contact with air. And so they created the first synthetic pigment in history: Egyptian blue. The oldest evidence of it is in a bowl dated to 3250 BC. Egyptian blue is a calcium copper silicate with formula CaCuSi4O10 or CaOCuO(SiO2)4. Its method of manufacturing, in a rare example of lost technology, was forgotten towards the end of antiquity, but has been plausibly reconstructed. It likely involved heating together quartz sand (silica) and some source of copper (either copper ores or scraps from the bronze industry), together with an alkali (like natron) and a calcium oxide (unintentionally added as impurities in the other materials).  Various Egyptian blue objects from the British Museum (source)In another cradle of civilization, a very similar story unfolded from about 800 BC. So similar, in fact, that it has been speculated that knowledge of Egyptian blue spread along the early silk road, all the way to China, where Han blue (together with Han purple) makes an appearance during the Zhou dynasty. Han blue has almost the same chemical formula as Egyptian blue, but replaces calcium with barium: BaCuSi4O10. It may also have been an independent invention, perhaps the work of Taoist alchemists and glassmakers. Its use declined after the Han dynasty, and few examples survive.Almost the only example of Han blue and purple found on the internet, from a Han dynasty tomb in Luoyang (source)Much later, China would become famous for another application of blue: the “blue and white” porcelain style. The blue here comes from cobalt oxide, which had colored Egyptian faience since at least 1500 BC, though nobody at the time knew what cobalt was. You could make cobalt blue in the form of glass and then grind it into a pigment called smalt. Despite porcelain originating in China, it seems that the use of smalt for the blue and white style began in Iraq. It spread from the Middle East to China, and then from China to the rest of the world including Europe, would eventually allow Swedish chemist Georg Brandt to identify cobalt as an element in 1735, the first time a new metal was discovered since antiquity.3 Vase from the Ming dynasty, between 1403 and 1424 (source)Meanwhile, in the New World, the local indigo dye was being combined with a clay called palygorskite to create what became known as Maya blue, which was the main blue pigment in Mesoamerican art from about 800, and was still used as late as the 19th century, though it, too, was forgotten about for a while.Mural from Bonampak in what is now Chiapas, Mexico (source)But none of the pigments mentioned so far, not azurite, not cobalt blue, not Egyptian blue, could rival with the purest and deepest of blues, the one that came from grinding the rare lapis lazuli stone into a powder. Lapis lazuli had been extracted from mines in what is now Afghanistan since ancient times, but began being used for paint around the 5th to 7th centuries, for use in Zoroastrian and Buddhist religious art. This pigment became known to medieval and Renaissance Europeans as ultramarine, meaning “beyond the sea,” since it had to be imported at great cost from central Asia (which, to the Venetian merchants who mostly controlled this trade, was beyond the Mediterranean sea, I suppose). Nobody has written about this more eloquently than Scott Alexander:Here is the process for getting ultramarine. First, go to Afghanistan. Keep in mind, you start in England or France or wherever. Afghanistan is four thousand miles away. Your path takes you through tall mountains, burning deserts, and several dozen Muslim countries that are still pissed about the whole Crusades thing. Still alive? Climb 7,000 feet through the mountains of Kuran Wa Munjan until you reach the mines of Sar-i-Sang. There, in a freezing desert, the wretched of the earth work themselves to an early grave breaking apart the rocks of Badakhshan to mine a few hundred kilograms per year of blue stone - the only lapis lazuli production in the known world.Buy the stone and retrace your path through the burning deserts and vengeful Muslims until you’re back in England or France or wherever. Still alive? That was the easy part. Now you need to go through a chemical extraction process that makes the Philosopher's Stone look like freshman chem lab. “The lengthy process of pulverization, sifting, and washing to produce ultramarine makes the natural pigment … roughly ten times more expensive than the stone it came from.”Finally you have ultramarine! How much? I can’t find good numbers, but Claude estimates that the ultramarine production of all of medieval Europe was around the order of 30 kg per year - not enough to paint a medium-sized wall. Ultramarine had to be saved for ultra-high-value applications.In practice, the medievals converged on a single use case - painting the Virgin Mary’s coat.The Virgin in Prayer by Giovanni Battista Salvi da Sassoferrato (c. 1654)By the beginning of the 18th century, Egyptian blue had been long forgotten, and painters in Europe relied on indigo, smalt, azurite, and when they could get their hands on it, ultramarine. But this was the modern, enlightened era of European science. Great things were to come.It began with a chance discovery. In Berlin around 1706, a paintmaker, Johann Jacob Diesbach, was trying to prepare red dye from cochineal.4 The details of the story are not totally ascertained, but it seems that his intended mix of cochineal insects, ferric sulfate, and potash had been tainted by another substance, perhaps bone oil from the alchemist Johann Konrad Dippel. The result was a deep blue pigment, soon to be known as Prussian blue, since Berlin was the capital of Prussia. It immediately found its niche in the art market: a deep blue, like ultramarine, but which unlike ultramarine didn’t cost more than literal gold. Within a couple of years, painters were already depicting the Virgin Mary’s robes with Prussian blue.Entombment of Christ, by Pieter van der Werff (1709). The first known painting to use Prussian blueThus Prussian blue became the first modern synthetic pigment. It spread far and wide, even to isolationist Japan. Large quantities of Prussian blue began entering the country around 1829, through the single trading post the Japanese allowed with Westerners, at Dejima, and very soon after, revolutionized the woodblock printing art of ukiyo-e. As early as 1831, one of the most famous works in art history was created with abundant Prussian blue. The author, plagiarizing Hokusai with some blue ben that probably doesn’t contain Prussian bluePrussian blue is also the blue of blueprints, created with the cyanotype process, one of the first ways to make many copies of a document. The blueprint was invented in 1842 by John Herschel and became the standard for engineering drawings; it was also used abundantly to duplicate photographs. Though it has become obsolete (replaced by whiteprint and then xerography, the currently dominant photocopying technique), it survives as the word to describe any technical, detailed plan.Blueprint for a whaling boat, 1911 (source)Prussian blue was only the first of a series of synthetic blue pigments that span the history of industrial civilization. In 1789, cerulean appears, the creation of Albrecht Höpfner in Switzerland. It is another compound of cobalt, but combined with tin: a cobalt stannate (Co2SnO4). It would become available to artists in paint form only in the middle of the 19th century.Around the same period, in 1799 or 1802 (sources differ), the French chemist Louis Jacques Thénard reinvented cobalt blue. It was a commission from another chemist, Jean-Antoine Chaptal, who happened to be a minister in the government of the First French Republic. Thénard investigated the pigments at the Sèvres porcelain factory, but used a different method than the originators of smalt pigments in Egypt, Iraq, or China, using aluminium (formula: CoAl2O4). By the middle of the 19th century, the leader in the production of cobalt aluminate was Blaafarveværket, a large industrial enterprise in Norway.In this golden age of blue pigment synthesis, would it be possible to create even synthetic ultramarine? Goethe, already, had noticed the blue deposits on lime kilns when visiting Sicily in 1787. The locals used it for decoration as if it were lapis lazuli. The same phenomenon was observed in limeworks in France in the 1810s, and in 1824, the Société d’encouragement pour l’industrie nationale — a government organization dedicated to further French industry in response to the industrial revolution in Britain, and led by the aforementioned Jean-Antoine Chaptal — announced a prize of 6,000 francs to anyone who could make ultramarine for much cheaper than the price of lapis lazuli. In 1826, Jean-Baptiste Guimet succeeded in Lyon. He won the prize and established a thriving business, though he kept his methods secret and, as a result, forever has to share credit with Christian Gmelin in Tübingen, who did publish the process. It involves heating up clay, sodium hydroxide, and coal together.5 Like many painters of the second half of the 19th century (including Monet), Berthe Morisot uses all three of cerulean, cobalt blue, and synthetic ultramarine in Summer's Day (1879)Artists and decorators now had their main blue pigments. Soon, industry and science would extend the use of blue to other domains. In 1897, it became practical to prepare artificial indigo in industrial quantities, eventually replacing all use of the plant. Today 80,000 tonnes are produced per year, mostly for the purpose of dying textiles, primarily denim.Around the turn of the 20th century, artificial food colorings became widespread, derived primarily from coal tar. One of them would become known as brilliant blue FCF or Blue No. 1. Together with Blue No. 2, which is made from indigo, it is one of the two main blue colorings, and has a strong association with the familiar-yet-mysterious blue raspberry flavor.The 1920s saw the introduction of another synthetic pigment, phthalo blue (also known as copper phthalocyanine), perhaps in a way harking back to the copper-derived compounds of ancient Egypt. It has grown to be most widely produced blue. Though the discovery of new pigments is a rare occurrence, it still happens. In 2009, a serendipitous discovery at the Oregon State University led to YInMn Blue, so named because it contains yttrium, indium, and manganese, and pronounced “yinmin.” It is a near-perfect blue that furthermore avoids the toxicity and environmental problems of the pre-existing pigments. I have this half-baked theory that science fiction is associated with blue because of blue LEDs. Consider this chart, which I wrote about in an old post: Dominant color of computer interfaces as shown in science fiction movies from selected years between 1968 and 2011 (source). The analysis ultimately comes from Chris Noessel and Nathan Shedroff’s book Make It So: Interaction Design Lessons From Science Fiction. Noessel has a long-running blog about sci fi interfaces.Examples of fictional sci fi user interfaces, from the same sourceThere are a number of competing hypotheses for why science fiction movie directors and video game designers overwhelmingly choose blue as the color of fictional user interfaces. They include:Accidental reasons from filmmaking considerations (from Mark Coleran):Using simple interfaces with primary RGB colors on black looks better in film than ordinary liquid-crystal screens, so most UIs in video media is either red, green, or blue Red is associated with weapons, and green with vintage electronics (which commonly used green-phosphor monochrome monitors), leaving blue as the generic and/or futuristic choice Blue is easier to color-correct: a lot of filmed material tends to look blue before color correction, but you don’t need this when the image is supposed to be blue Cultural associations:Blue fits well with science fiction thanks to associations like coldness, knowledge, otherworldliness, and creative transcendence (found in some academic paper in Korean thanks to Elicit)Something something near-far Robin Hanson something something6Blue is rare in nature except the for sea and sky, so “there’s something fundamentally mystical, unnatural, and inhuman about it” (from Noessel, cited in ‘Future Screens are Mostly Blue’)Most science fiction creators simply copy the tropes of existing science fiction, so they choose blue because it already is the “science fiction color.” (And picking something else is likely to be interpreted as an intentional deviation for a specific purpose.)I’d guess that the actual, immediate reason for most blue in science fiction is the last one. Unless creators make a conscious artistic choice to deviate, they tend to copy what’s typical and expected in their chosen genre. Yet those norms and expectations have to come from somewhere. It’s possible that the items in the first part of the list, about decisions having to do with the techniques of filmmaking rather than with the artistic meaning of blue, are the actual cause for some early shows that snowballed into the ubiquity of blue interfaces today, but that seems a bit like post-hoc justification to me unless we can find evidence of those decisions being made. So it’s probably cultural associations, but most of them also just kick the can further. Overall I suppose I somewhat agree with Noessel: it may well come down to the difficulty in finding blue in nature. Or finding it in technology, considering the history of blue pigments that we just went over.And not just pigments. There is another realm in which blue has proven incredibly difficult to produce: light. In fact we found the solution so recently that it is why, I speculate, the future is still strongly associated with blue. The story of how we produce light is a fun one, spanning all of our technological history and involving dozens of solutions, from prehistoric oil lamps to candles to coal gas to cold-cathode tubes. But most of those solutions have produced light somewhere between white and the reddish yellow of flames or black-body radiation. If you wanted blue light, you could make a bulb out of blue glass (with cobalt!) and put an incandescent filament in it. This worked okay, but blue light bulbs did tend to be less satisfying than the other colors, or at least that’s what I remember from Christmas lights when I was a kid.7 There were other strategies for blue lights: construct a tube like the familiar red-glowing neon ones, and put mercury vapor in it. Low-brightness phosphors for RGB screens. Greenish-blue vacuum fluorescent displays. So, blue light was not an unsolved problem. But it wasn’t as conclusively solved as light in the other spectral colors. In the 1960s, light-emitting diodes started becoming practical. LEDs are the most efficient way of creating light by far, but the properties of the materials they are made of — semiconductors that emit light when traversed with an electrical current — make it much easier to generate radiation in the less energetic part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Thus the first practical LED emitted infrared light, by Texas Instruments in 1962. Later that same year, the first visible-light LED was made at General Electric, in red. Displays made of red LEDs soon became widespread in electronic devices (replacing Nixie tubes, also reddish) after some further advances by Hewlett-Packard circa 1968.For a while, the future was red. Now something like this display seems rather vintage (image source)Humanity then gradually conquered the rest of the visible light spectrum, with orange, yellow, and green LEDs being developed in the 1970s. But blue remained elusive. A practical, bright blue LED would not be made, despite much research being poured into it by electronics companies around the world, until a breakthrough by Shuji Nakamura in Japan in 1993. This completed the color spectrum and enabled us to create white LEDs, which are now quickly replacing nearly every lighting technology since they cost so little and are so customizable. We can say we have essentially “solved” lighting. Blue LEDs also enabled the first blue lasers in the mid-1990s.This is a very recent development! For a very long time, blue would have been the color that only “future tech” could create. Then, for a brief period, it would have been the color of cutting-edge tech. Now, 30 years later, the tech exists and is widespread, but we still have the memory of that time. And furthermore no other color can take its place as the inaccessible one; we’ve conquered the entire spectrum.8Sometimes people post pictures of Chinese cities at night (this is Shenzhen) to show how futuristic they look, especially compared to Western cities. But really it all comes down to adding blue LED strips all over the place! (image source)Does the futuristic quality of blue really come from LEDs? Maybe, maybe not. I’m not sure there’s a direct causal link. But given the full history of blue pigments, I wouldn’t be surprised to find some truth in this speculative scenario: that there were just enough innovations in blue, a steady trickle of serendipitous discoveries and long-term research efforts to produce better versions of it, to keep it in the mind of humans as the color of the artificial and the cutting-edge. If you wore indigo-dyed clothes in ancient India, you were one step more removed from nature than the person who wore plain cotton. If you used blue pottery in Egypt or Iraq or China, you were clearly cooler than the people who used plain terracotta. If you hired an engineer or architect at the peak of the Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century, they’d be way more efficient at their job if they duplicated their drawings with Prussian blue instead of copying them by hand. And if you want to make your city a herald of the high-tech future, you decorate everything with programmable blue LEDs. No other color would do.La Gare Saint-Lazare, by Claude Monet (1877)This post was written as part of the Roots of Progress Institute’s Blog-Building Intensive, and I thank the fellows who provided feedback: Allison Lehman, Kelly Vedi.1One could say the same about purple, which has its own history of being a super expensive pigment, Tyrian purple, and holds the distinction of being one of the first synthetic dyes, mauveine. But purple is less common and important than blue. Besides, it doesn’t really exist.While we’re here, let’s note that Tyrian purple, made from sea snails, may be related to a blue dye of great significance in Jewish culture, tekhelet. It has been speculated that tekhelet comes from Hexaplex trunculus snails. I didn’t mention it in the main text because its origin is uncertain.2From which we derive the word aniline, a common industrial chemical that is nowadays used to make indigo and various other dyes.3Fun fact: cobalt is named after kobolds, mischievous spirits from German folklore, because miners in Germany would attribute to them the unusual properties of the ore containing the metal. 4As an aside, the history of cochineal dye, made from insects grown on cactus according to secret ancestral techniques of the Zapotec people, and the second-highest valued export from New Spain after silver, is fascinating in its own right. By the way it’s still used as food coloring, so if you eat artificially red foods, you probably eat insects. 5Synthetic ultramarine is also (in)famous for being the main component (together with a resin) of International Klein Blue, the creation of artist Yves Klein, who painted large monochrome paintings with it.6Specifically posts like ‘Is Blue Far?’ and ‘Near Far in Science Fiction’. Blue might be associated with “far” in terms of construal level theory and likewise for science fiction, which makes an association natural. I thought this was a mind blowing point when I first encountered it some years ago but now it seems rather unconvincing, which is why I’m relegating it to a footnote.7I think it’s because the filaments glow yellow, and a lot of the light is filtered by the blue glass, leaving dim light bulbs. But also the blue glass tended to become discolored, and then you’d just get a plain white bulb.8There can’t be a purple LED since purple isn’t a spectral color, with the exception of violet. And violet LEDs appeared about the same time as the blue ones. There is active development of ultraviolet LED, especially for disinfecting lamps, but of course we won’t be able to see them.I suppose one intriguing possibility would be if we were to invent new colors altogether, by modifying the biology of color perception. Then maybe the color of the future would become octarine or something.No posts]]></content:encoded>

These relationships are called “bonding” social capital—a term popularized by Robert Putnam in his landmark 2000 book, Bowling Alone. 
But Putnam also pointed out that what we’re missing is “bridging” social capital—relationships with people unlike us. Most of our friends are of the same race and class as we are. We have the same political views as most of our friends. And the number of people who say they trust others has been decreasing for generations:

In 2014 study, researchers conducted a series of experiments on Illinois trains and buses. 
Some commuters were told to keep to themselves during their trip; these participants predicted the isolation would give them a positive experience. 
Other commuters were told to talk to strangers; these participants predicted they would have a negative experience. They assumed strangers wouldn’t want to talk to them, that strangers wouldn’t like them, and that they would have trouble maintaining a conversation. 
After all, what if the person you approach gets angry? What if they accuse you of harassing them? What if they just think you’re weird? 8m 11s8m 12s8m 13s8m 14s8m 15s8m 16s8m 17s8m 18s8m 19s8m 20s8m 21s8m 22s8m 23s8m 24s8m 25s8m 26s8m 27s8m 28s8m 29s8m 30s Hank, 38, held a beer and vaped during this conversation.

What these participants reported back was almost no rejections, pleasant conversations, and an overall positive experience.
This phenomenon has been replicated in several experiments. Whether it’s interacting with strangers in a scavenger hunt, meeting new people in a college dorm, or chatting up a barista, researchers have repeatedly found that people don’t think they’ll enjoy interacting with strangers. 
But after the interaction, participants tend to say it was a positive experience.
Early in the pandemic, the activity people missed most were things like going to restaurants, the gym, church, and the barbershop—places where we’re around strangers and acquaintances, or “weak ties.” We normally have between 11 and 16 interactions with weak ties each day, but devoid of these spontaneous opportunities, only 15% of Americans said they made a new acquaintance during the pandemic. 19m 31s19m 32s19m 33s19m 34s19m 35s19m 36s19m 37s19m 38s19m 39s19m 40s19m 41s19m 42s19m 43s19m 44s19m 45s19m 46s19m 47s19m 48s19m 49s19m 50s I watched the entirety of many conversations.

But those interactions were rare.

In a 2021 study, researchers looked at why social trust has decreased on an individual level. What they found was that income dissatisfaction, our experience of losing a job, and our decreasing confidence in political institutions account for most of the decline in trust. In short, we’ve created a world that is precarious and unstable for most people.
I feel this, too. I’m scared by the big and small things happening in our world. I feel my environment crumbling around me, my sense of safety waning. I’ve looked at homes for sale in remote areas where I can disappear with my friends and family—where I don’t have to rely on strangers. 27m 51s27m 52s27m 53s27m 54s27m 55s27m 56s27m 57s27m 58s27m 59s28m 0s28m 1s28m 2s28m 3s28m 4s28m 5s28m 6s28m 7s28m 8s28m 9s28m 10s28m 11s28m 12s28m 13s28m 14s28m 15s28m 16s28m 17s28m 18s28m 19s28m 20s By the end of these conversations, several participants seemed to realize that they may never see their conversation partner again, and had to say their bittersweet goodbyes.28m 21s28m 22s28m 23s28m 24s28m 25s28m 26s28m 27s28m 28s28m 29s28m 30s28m 31s28m 32s28m 33s28m 34s28m 35s28m 36s28m 37s28m 38s28m 39s28m 40s28m 41s28m 42s28m 43s28m 44s28m 45s28m 46s28m 47s28m 48s28m 49s28m 50s28m 51s28m 52s28m 53s28m 54s28m 55s28m 56s28m 57s28m 58s28m 59s29m 0s29m 1s29m 2s29m 3s29m 4s29m 5s29m 6s29m 7s29m 8s29m 9s29m 10s29m 11s29m 12s29m 13s29m 14s29m 15s29m 16s29m 17s29m 18s29m 19s29m 20s29m 21s29m 22s29m 23s29m 24s29m 25s29m 26s29m 27s29m 28s29m 29s29m 30s29m 31s29m 32s29m 33s29m 34s29m 35s29m 36s29m 37s29m 38s29m 39s29m 40s29m 41s29m 42s29m 43s29m 44s29m 45s29m 46s29m 47s29m 48s29m 49s29m 50s29m 51s29m 52s29m 53s29m 54s29m 55s29m 56s29m 57s29m 58s29m 59s30m 0s A few months ago, I was taking the subway to work when a 16-year-old boy slipped on the subway platform and hit his chin on the ground. He stumbled onto the train and stood next to me. I kept my earbuds in and tried to convince myself this wasn’t my problem. Then out of the corner of my eye I saw that he’d split open his chin; blood and tears were gushing down his face. I looked around the train for someone else to help—maybe someone who works with kids. No one even looked up. So I grabbed some tissues from my backpack, turned to him, and told him to hold it against his chin. He was in shock. I tried to calm him down and told him to go to the nurse’s office when he got to school. 
All I could think was: What if that was me? Who would help me? Would everyone stand around like they’re doing now?
But when I ran out of tissues to stop this kid’s bleeding, people on the train noticed and handed me disinfectant wipes, paper towels, and bandages. We were able to stop the bleeding. When I got off the train, another stranger got up and stood by his side.
When we’re wounded, we don’t trust the people around us. We shelter away because we think it’s the only way to be safe. We let strangers suffer because, in this emotional state, everyone is a threat. That means it’s hard to work with others to build the world we want. We’re left to hunker down for the inevitable dystopia that is to come. 
But I don’t want to live in that world. I want to feel safe. I want to help others to feel safe. And I want people to do the same for me—regardless of whether I’m a stranger or not.

            <guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45123034</guid>
            <description><![CDATA[DataFrames for the new era]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ After working hard since our Polars Cloud announcement last February, we are pleased to officially launch Polars Cloud.
Polars Cloud is now Generally Available on AWS. Beyond that, we also launched our novel Distributed Engine in Open Beta on Polars Cloud.
You can immediately get started at https://cloud.pola.rs/.
After that you can fire a remote distributed query:
import polars_cloud as pc
import polars as pl
from datetime import date

with pc.ComputeContext(
    workspace="<my-workspace>",
    cpus=2,
    memory=8,
    cluster_size=8,
) as ctx:
    in_progress = (
        pl.scan_parquet("s3://polars-cloud-samples-us-east-2-prd/pdsh/sf100/lineitem/",
            storage_options={
                "aws_request_payer": "true",
            })
        .filter(pl.col("l_shipdate") <= date(1998, 9, 2))
        .group_by("l_returnflag", "l_linestatus")
        .agg(
            count_order=pl.len()
        )
        .remote(ctx)
        .distributed()
        .execute()
    )

    print(in_progress.await_result().head)
Closing the DataFrame scale gap
The General Availability of Polars Cloud on AWS marks a major milestone in closing the DataFrame scale gap—the historic divide between the ease of pandas locally and the scalability of PySpark remotely. By making Polars Cloud broadly accessible, we bring to life our mission of delivering fast, flexible and open-source data tools that run everywhere, giving users a single API that seamlessly scales from a laptop to the cloud.
Equally significant is the Open Beta of our Distributed Engine, which leverages Polars’ novel streaming architecture to offer not just horizontal but also vertical and diagonal scaling strategies. This design directly addresses the cost, complexity and performance tradeoffs users face today, while making high-performance compute broadly accessible.
Together, these launches represent a step-change: remote execution that feels native, distribution without friction, and an architecture built to meet the future of large-scale data processing head-on.
1. What is Polars Cloud
Polars Cloud is a managed data platform that enables you to run Polars queries remotely in the cloud at scale. We will manage the cloud infrastructure and the scaling. Besides remote execution, Polars Cloud offers different scaling strategies, where distributed is most important. Our distributed engine uses our OSS streaming engine on the workers. This ensures we stay committed in making OSS Polars better as we will become one of the direct users. Because of Polars’ strength in vertical compute, Polars’ distributed offers not only horizontal, but also diagonal scaling strategies. Here we have a single big worker for tasks that would be better off on a beefy single node and would not benefit from the shuffling overhead. Polars Cloud will allow you to choose the best scaling strategy that fits your use case, offering one API for any scale, meaning you can reduce cost, time, and complexity.
Learn more about Polars Cloud in our initial announcement post.
2. Polars Distributed Engine in Public Beta
Our distributed engine is available in Public Beta. We are confident that we achieved a state where our distributed engine is useful and in some cases even one of the best options available. There are of course features we haven’t supported in a distributed manner yet, in that case we will automatically fall back to a single node for that operation. Among many other operations, we can run our PDS-H benchmark fully distributed. If you want to stay updated of what our distributed engine is capable of, keep an eye on the tracking issue here.
Where I think our distributed engine shines, is combining partitionable queries with order dependent data processing like in this query below.
result = (
    trades.group_by_dynamic(
        "time",
        every="1m",
        group_by="symbol"
    ).agg(
        avg_price=pl.col("price").mean(),
        total_size=pl.col("size").sum(),
        interval_start=pl.col("time"),
    ).join_asof(
        fairs,
        left_on="interval_start",
        right_on="time",
        by="symbol",
        strategy="backward"
    ).select(
        "symbol",
        "interval_start",
        "avg_price",
        "total_size",
        "fair_value"
    )
)
This query really combines the power of Polars’ single node execution with the scalability of Polars’ distributed. It can horizontally partition over symbols and then utilize Polars’ fast query engine to process the partitions on powerful workers.
3. Near future
Features that will land soon are:


On premise support
We have begun working on supporting the Polars Cloud distributed architecture on premise. We expect to onboard the first clients in the coming months. Are you interested in on-premise Polars Cloud, contact us via the form below.


Live cluster dashboard
The current version of Polars Cloud has a dashboard that shows you summaries of your queries, clusters, vCPU etc. The cluster dashboard we are building will have a direct connection to your cluster, allowing us to show much more information. And because Polars streaming executor is written from scratch, we can add custom tracing that can give you deep insights in the operations that your queries spend time and how much utilization it has at any point in time. The possibilities here are very exciting to me as our vertical integration means we have access to all the information in the stack.


Orchestration
As we are building a data platform, as minimal version of task orchestration cannot be left out. We don’t aim to replace tools like Airflow or Prefect, but we do want to offer you the option to schedule your queries with Polars Cloud alone. Note that we believe in strong integration with other tools and have therefore chosen for a Polars Cloud client that can directly be used with Polars OSS and popular orchestration tools.


Autoscaling
As we can scale both vertically and horizontally with heterogenous worker sizes, we have unique scaling opportunities. We plan to land vertical and diagonal (where the big worker scales) autoscaling soon. Later we will expand that to horizontal autoscaling as well.


Catalog support
Our early design partners informed us that most users were using iceberg to load their data. Since then we’ve made a large effort to make our iceberg support native and distributed. Besides the iceberg table format, we will also expose a catalog so that users can organize their datasets easier.


Multi-region
Initially we launched in the US East region only. This gives us acceptable latencies for the US and western Europe. We are going to launch multi-region as soon as possible so that all regions will experience minimal latencies.

		Project Goals

Our goal is to create a user environment designed from the ground up around the things people do with computers: create, collaborate, and learn.

Without implementation details like files and operating-system processes polluting the computer's UI, Étoilé users will be able to:


have revision history for all objects in the system
collaborate with other people on any type of document (text, drawing, code, etc.)
shape their own workflow by combining the provided Services
use a system that is closer to their mental model of how computers should work


Étoilé is open-source (MIT/BSD licensed) and built on GNUstep—it should be portable to most operating systems.

                                Extending Nvim



Using Vim packages




A Vim "package" is a directory that contains plugins.  Compared to normal
plugins, a package can...
 be downloaded as an archive and unpacked in its own directory, so the files
  are not mixed with files of other plugins.
 be a git, mercurial, etc. repository, thus easy to update.
 contain multiple plugins that depend on each other.
 contain plugins that are automatically loaded on startup ("start" packages,
  located in "pack/*/start/*") and ones that are only loaded when needed with
  :packadd ("opt" packages, located in "pack/*/opt/*").



                                                        runtime-search-path
Nvim searches for :runtime files in:
 2. all "pack/*/start/*" dirs



Note that the "pack/*/start/*" paths are not explicitly included in
'runtimepath', so they will not be reported by ":set rtp" or "echo &rtp".
Scripts can use nvim_list_runtime_paths() to list all used directories, and
nvim_get_runtime_file() to query for specific files or sub-folders within
the runtime path. Example:" List all runtime dirs and packages with Lua paths.
:echo nvim_get_runtime_file("lua/", v:true)
Using a package and loading automatically



Let's assume your Nvim files are in "~/.local/share/nvim/site" and you want to
add a package from a zip archive "/tmp/foopack.zip":% mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/foo
% cd ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/foo
% unzip /tmp/foopack.zip
The directory name "foo" is arbitrary, you can pick anything you like.



You would now have these files under ~/.local/share/nvim/site:pack/foo/README.txt
pack/foo/start/foobar/plugin/foo.vim
pack/foo/start/foobar/syntax/some.vim
pack/foo/opt/foodebug/plugin/debugger.vim
On startup after processing your config, Nvim scans all directories in
'packpath' for plugins in "pack/*/start/*", then loads the plugins.



To allow for calling into package functionality while parsing your vimrc,
:colorscheme and autoload will both automatically search under 'packpath'
as well in addition to 'runtimepath'.  See the documentation for each for
details.



In the example Nvim will find "pack/foo/start/foobar/plugin/foo.vim" and load
it.



If the "foobar" plugin kicks in and sets the 'filetype' to "some", Nvim will
find the syntax/some.vim file, because its directory is in the runtime search
path.



Nvim will also load ftdetect files, if there are any.



Note that the files under "pack/foo/opt" are not loaded automatically, only the
ones under "pack/foo/start".  See pack-add below for how the "opt" directory
is used.



Loading packages automatically will not happen if loading plugins is disabled,
see load-plugins.



To load packages earlier, so that plugin/ files are sourced:
    :packloadall
This also works when loading plugins is disabled.  The automatic loading will
only happen once.



If the package has an "after" directory, that directory is added to the end of
'runtimepath', so that anything there will be loaded later.



Using a single plugin and loading it automatically



If you don't have a package but a single plugin, you need to create the extra
directory level:% mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/foo/start/foobar
% cd ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/foo/start/foobar
% unzip /tmp/someplugin.zip
You would now have these files:pack/foo/start/foobar/plugin/foo.vim
pack/foo/start/foobar/syntax/some.vim
From here it works like above.



Optional plugins
                                                        pack-add
To load an optional plugin from a pack use the :packadd command::packadd foodebug
This searches for "pack/*/opt/foodebug" in 'packpath' and will find
~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/foo/opt/foodebug/plugin/debugger.vim and source
it.



This could be done if some conditions are met.  For example, depending on
whether Nvim supports a feature or a dependency is missing.



You can also load an optional plugin at startup, by putting this command in
your config::packadd! foodebug
The extra "!" is so that the plugin isn't loaded if Nvim was started with
--noplugin.



It is perfectly normal for a package to only have files in the "opt"
directory.  You then need to load each plugin when you want to use it.



Where to put what



Since color schemes, loaded with :colorscheme, are found below
"pack/*/start" and "pack/*/opt", you could put them anywhere.  We recommend
you put them below "pack/*/opt", for example
"~/.config/nvim/pack/mycolors/opt/dark/colors/very_dark.vim".



Filetype plugins should go under "pack/*/start", so that they are always
found.  Unless you have more than one plugin for a file type and want to
select which one to load with :packadd.  E.g. depending on the compiler
version:if foo_compiler_version > 34
  packadd foo_new
else
  packadd foo_old
endif
The "after" directory is most likely not useful in a package.  It's not
disallowed though.



Creating Vim packages                                   package-create




This assumes you write one or more plugins that you distribute as a package.



If you have two unrelated plugins you would use two packages, so that Vim
users can choose what they include or not.  Or you can decide to use one
package with optional plugins, and tell the user to add the preferred ones with
:packadd.



Decide how you want to distribute the package.  You can create an archive or
you could use a repository.  An archive can be used by more users, but is a
bit harder to update to a new version.  A repository can usually be kept
up-to-date easily, but it requires a program like "git" to be available.
You can do both, github can automatically create an archive for a release.



Your directory layout would be like this:start/foobar/plugin/foo.vim          " always loaded, defines commands
start/foobar/plugin/bar.vim          " always loaded, defines commands
start/foobar/autoload/foo.vim        " loaded when foo command used
start/foobar/doc/foo.txt             " help for foo.vim
start/foobar/doc/tags                " help tags
opt/fooextra/plugin/extra.vim        " optional plugin, defines commands
opt/fooextra/autoload/extra.vim      " loaded when extra command used
opt/fooextra/doc/extra.txt           " help for extra.vim
opt/fooextra/doc/tags                " help tags



This allows for the user to do:mkdir ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack
cd ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack
git clone https://github.com/you/foobar.git myfoobar
Here "myfoobar" is a name that the user can choose, the only condition is that
it differs from other packages.



In your documentation you explain what the plugins do, and tell the user how
to load the optional plugin::packadd! fooextra
You could add this packadd command in one of your plugins, to be executed when
the optional plugin is needed.



Run the :helptags command to generate the doc/tags file.  Including this
generated file in the package means that the user can drop the package in the
pack directory and the help command works right away.  Don't forget to re-run
the command after changing the plugin help::helptags path/start/foobar/doc
:helptags path/opt/fooextra/doc
Dependencies between plugins
                                                        packload-two-steps
Suppose you have two plugins that depend on the same functionality. You can
put the common functionality in an autoload directory, so that it will be
found automatically.  Your package would have these files:



pack/foo/start/one/plugin/one.vimcall foolib#getit()
pack/foo/start/two/plugin/two.vimcall foolib#getit()
pack/foo/start/lib/autoload/foolib.vimfunc foolib#getit()
This works, because start packages will be searched for autoload files, when
sourcing the plugins.



Plugin manager                                                      vim.pack




WORK IN PROGRESS built-in plugin manager! Early testing of existing features
is appreciated, but expect breaking changes without notice.



Manages plugins only in a dedicated vim.pack-directory (see packages):
$XDG_DATA_HOME/nvim/site/pack/core/opt. $XDG_DATA_HOME/nvim/site needs to
be part of 'packpath'. It usually is, but might not be in cases like --clean
or setting $XDG_DATA_HOME during startup. Plugin's subdirectory name matches
plugin's name in specification. It is assumed that all plugins in the
directory are managed exclusively by vim.pack.



Uses Git to manage plugins and requires present git executable of at least
version 2.36. Target plugins should be Git repositories with versions as named
tags following semver convention v<major>.<minor>.<patch>.



Example workflows



Basic install and management:
 Add vim.pack.add() call(s) to 'init.lua':
vim.pack.add({
  -- Install "plugin1" and use default branch (usually `main` or `master`)
  'https://github.com/user/plugin1',
  -- Same as above, but using a table (allows setting other options)
  { src = 'https://github.com/user/plugin1' },
  -- Specify plugin's name (here the plugin will be called "plugin2"
  -- instead of "generic-name")
  { src = 'https://github.com/user/generic-name', name = 'plugin2' },
  -- Specify version to follow during install and update
  {
    src = 'https://github.com/user/plugin3',
    -- Version constraint, see |vim.version.range()|
    version = vim.version.range('1.0'),
  },
  {
    src = 'https://github.com/user/plugin4',
    -- Git branch, tag, or commit hash
    version = 'main',
  },
})
-- Plugin's code can be used directly after `add()`
plugin1 = require('plugin1')


 Restart Nvim (for example, with :restart). Plugins that were not yet
  installed will be available on disk in target state after add() call.
 To update all plugins with new changes:
 Execute vim.pack.update(). This will download updates from source and
    show confirmation buffer in a separate tabpage.
 Review changes. To confirm all updates execute :write. To discard
    updates execute :quit.



Switch plugin's version:
 Update 'init.lua' for plugin to have desired version. Let's say, plugin
  named 'plugin1' has changed to vim.version.range('*').
:restart. The plugin's actual state on disk is not yet changed.
 Execute vim.pack.update({ 'plugin1' }).
 Review changes and either confirm or discard them. If discarded, revert any
  changes in 'init.lua' as well or you will be prompted again next time you
  run vim.pack.update().



Freeze plugin from being updated:
 Update 'init.lua' for plugin to have version set to current commit hash.
  You can get it by running vim.pack.update({ 'plugin-name' }) and yanking
  the word describing current state (looks like abc12345).



Unfreeze plugin to start receiving updates:
 Update 'init.lua' for plugin to have version set to whichever version you
  want it to be updated.



Remove plugins from disk:
 Use vim.pack.del() with a list of plugin names to remove. Make sure their
  specs are not included in vim.pack.add() call in 'init.lua' or they will
  be reinstalled.



Available events to hook into
PackChangedPre - before trying to change plugin's state.
PackChanged - after plugin's state has changed.



Each event populates the following event-data fields:
kind - one of "install" (install on disk), "update" (update existing
  plugin), "delete" (delete from disk).
spec - plugin's specification with defaults made explicit.
path - full path to plugin's directory.




Fields:
{src}       (string) URI from which to install and pull updates. Any
                    format supported by git clone is allowed.
{name}     (string) Name of plugin. Will be used as directory name.
                    Default: src repository name.
{version}  (string|vim.VersionRange) Version to use for install and
                    updates. Can be:
nil (no value, default) to use repository's default
                      branch (usually main or master).
 String to use specific branch, tag, or commit hash.
 Output of vim.version.range() to install the
                      greatest/last semver tag inside the version constraint.
{data}     (any) Arbitrary data associated with a plugin.



add({specs}, {opts})                                          vim.pack.add()
    Add plugin to current session
 For each specification check that plugin exists on disk in
      vim.pack-directory:
 If exists, do nothing in this step.
 If doesn't exist, install it by downloading from src into name
        subdirectory (via git clone) and update state to match version
        (via git checkout).
 For each plugin execute :packadd (or customizable load function)
      making it reachable by Nvim.



    Notes: Installation is done in parallel, but waits for all to finish before
      continuing next code execution.
 If plugin is already present on disk, there are no checks about its
      present state. The specified version can be not the one actually
      present on disk. Execute vim.pack.update() to synchronize.
 Adding plugin second and more times during single session does nothing:
      only the data from the first adding is registered.



Parameters:
{specs}  ((string|vim.pack.Spec)[]) List of plugin specifications.
                 String item is treated as src.
{opts}   (table?) A table with the following fields:
{load}
                   (boolean|fun(plug_data: {spec: vim.pack.Spec, path: string}))
                   Load plugin/ files and ftdetect/ scripts. If false,
                   works like :packadd!. If function, called with plugin
                   data and is fully responsible for loading plugin. Default
                   false during startup and true afterwards.
{confirm} (boolean) Whether to ask user to confirm
                   initial install. Default true.



del({names})                                                  vim.pack.del()
    Remove plugins from disk



Parameters:
{names}  (string[]) List of plugin names to remove from disk. Must
                 be managed by vim.pack, not necessarily already added to
                 current session.



get()                                                         vim.pack.get()
    Get data about all plugins managed by vim.pack



Return:
        (table[]) A list of objects with the following fields:
{spec} (vim.pack.SpecResolved) A vim.pack.Spec with defaults
          made explicit.
{path} (string) Plugin's path on disk.
{active} (boolean) Whether plugin was added via vim.pack.add()
          to current session.



update({names}, {opts})                                    vim.pack.update()
    Update plugins
 Download new changes from source.
 Infer update info (current/target state, changelog, etc.).
 Depending on force:
 If false, show confirmation buffer. It lists data about all set to
        update plugins. Pending changes starting with > will be applied
        while the ones starting with < will be reverted. It has special
        in-process LSP server attached to provide more interactive features.
        Currently supported methods:
 'textDocument/hover' (K via lsp-defaults or
          vim.lsp.buf.hover()) - show more information at cursor. Like
          details of particular pending change or newer tag.
        Execute :write to confirm update, execute :quit to discard the
        update.
 If true, make updates right away.



    Notes: Every actual update is logged in "nvim-pack.log" file inside "log"
      stdpath().



Parameters:
{names}  (string[]?) List of plugin names to update. Must be managed
                 by vim.pack, not necessarily already added to current
                 session. Default: names of all plugins added to current
                 session via vim.pack.add().
{opts}   (table?) A table with the following fields:
{force} (boolean) Whether to skip confirmation and make
                   updates immediately. Default false.

About DepotDepot is a build acceleration and developer productivity platform that saves companies like PostHog, Wistia, Semgrep, and Secoda thousands of hours in build time every week.
We are developers. We started Depot because we were frustrated with the constant pain of slow build performance. We were fed up waiting for builds and annoyed by the lack of tooling and providers that actually made builds performant. So, we went and built the solution we had always wanted.
Slow builds are the dam standing in the way between mediocrity and innovation. They’re wasteful, expensive, and a drain on developer happiness & productivity. They slow down innovation.
Taking a 40-minute build down to a minute, changes everything. We help folks save literal years in build time every single week.
And we’re just getting started. For us, it’s all about iteration speed and keeping developers in their flow state. Our mission is to be relentless in accelerating software development.

What is this?
nuclear is a free music streaming program that pulls content from free sources all over the internet.
If you know mps-youtube, this is a similar music player but with a GUI.
It's also focusing more on audio. Imagine Spotify which you don't have to pay for and with a bigger library.
What if I am religiously opposed to Electron?
See this.

            <link>https://zed.dev/blog/claude-code-via-acp</link>
            <guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45116688</guid>
            <description><![CDATA[From the Zed Blog: You asked, and here it is. Use Claude Code in public beta directly in Zed, built on the new Agent Client Protocol.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[You asked for it. A lot.

So we built it: our Claude Code integration is now available in public beta, running natively in Zed through our new Agent Client Protocol (ACP).
For months, developers have been asking us to bring Claude Code into Zed. We didn’t just want to bolt on a one-off integration; we wanted to build something better. ACP is our new open standard that lets any agent connect to Zed (and other editors, too). Claude Code is a perfect example of what’s possible.
Now you can:

Run Claude Code as a first-class citizen in Zed's high-performance editor, not just a terminal interface
Follow along in real-time as it edits across multiple files, with full syntax highlighting and language server support
Review and approve granular changes in a multibuffer - accept or reject individual code hunks
Keep Claude Code's task list anchored in your sidebar, so you always see what the agent is working on
Define custom workflows with Claude Code's custom slash commands for your most common development tasks

Escape the Terminal
A walkthrough of Claude Code in Zed.
Claude Code has gained broad popularity among developers thanks to its powerful code generation and finely tuned tools. While the command-line interface is powerful, when Claude Code is making changes across multiple files or refactoring complex logic, you may want to see the bigger picture and have more control on what code you accept or reject. With Zed, you get the best of both worlds: Claude Code's intelligence, freed from the terminal and deeply integrated into a highly performant editor.
You can now run Claude Code directly in Zed and use it side-by-side with Zed's first-party agent, Gemini CLI, and any other ACP-compatible agent. Make sure you’re on the latest version of Zed and find your available agents in the Plus menu in the Agent Panel.
Built with ACP
Rather than creating a tightly-coupled integration specific to Claude Code, we built this integration using the Agent Client Protocol. We launched ACP as our open standard for connecting any AI agent with any compatible editor.
We built an adapter that wraps Claude Code's SDK and translates its interactions into ACP's JSON RPC format. This adapter bridges between Claude Code and ACP's standardized interface, allowing Claude Code to run as an independent process while Zed provides the user interface.
We are open sourcing the Claude Code adapter under the Apache license, making it freely available for any editor that’s adopted ACP to use; you can find the source code here. Since the popular CodeCompanion plugin for Neovim has already adopted ACP, Claude Code will also be available in Neovim.
We want to thank GitHub user Xuanwo for all his work since the ACP launch in building an ACP implementation for Claude Code - your speed to solution inspired us to work hard to keep up! We appreciate you for your contribution to the protocol's adoption. Give him a follow on GitHub and Twitter/X.
Bring Any Agent to Zed
We want every agent usable in Zed. Gemini CLI and Claude Code are a great start, and we have more on the way, but there are new agents released every week and many great existing ones not yet speaking the protocol. ACP makes it simple to bring any agent into Zed's, Neovim's, or any other ACP-adapted editor's interface!
This beta delivers as much core Claude Code functionality as possible via the SDK. We're adding features like Plan mode in the coming days, and more advanced capabilities as Anthropic expands SDK support; for example, many built-in slash commands are not yet supported by the SDK. From here:

Building an agent? We want to help you integrate with Zed - reach out with questions.
Want more Claude Code features? Join us in asking Anthropic to bring the SDK to parity with Claude Code or adopt ACP directly.
Ready to contribute? Contribute to or discuss ACP and the Claude Code adapter repos.

We're always looking for feedback on ACP, and welcome contributions from other agent (and client) builders. The more agents that work in Zed, the more choice you have as a developer.Looking for a better editor?
You can try Zed today on macOS or Linux. Download now!We are hiring!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Use Thunk to build your Rust program to support old Windows platforms
中文自述文件
Thunk uses VC-LTL5 and YY-Thunks to build programs that support even Windows XP. So, how does it work?

Add VC-LTL to the library search path
Use YY-Thunks to remedy API that old platform that does not exist

Note: Thunk does not guarantee the compiled program work or work accurately on old platforms. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
Usage (As Command line tool)
Preparation
Download VC-LTL5 and YY-Thunks Binary, unzip them and add environment variable:



Binary
Environment Variable




VC-LTL-XXX-Binary.7z
VC_LTL


YY-Thunks-XXX-Binary.zip
YY_THUNKS



Then add Thunk to run path.
Install Thunk
cargo install thunk-cli

Sample 1. Build for Windows XP
cargo new build_for_xp
cd build_for_xp
thunk --os xp --arch x86 -- --release

Sample 2. Build a shared library for Windows XP
cargo new build_for_xp
cd build_for_xp
thunk --os xp --arch x86 --lib -- --release

Show help
Use the following command to show help:
thunk.exe --help

Note: In order to distinguish the program build by Thunk, Thunk builds the release in ./target/*_build.
Usage (As Library)
Step1: Ensure command line tools curl and 7z could be found in PATH. (Needed if VC_LTL and YY_THUNKS not found in environment variables)
Step2: Add thunk as a build dependency:
cargo add thunk-rs --build

Step3: Create a build script build.rs:
fn main() {
    thunk::thunk();
}

Then, your program should run on Windows XP. See thunk-rs.

						You know how sometimes you start a game of Minesweeper and immediately get stuck?

Like maybe there are some cells that you know are mines, but there aren’t any places that are safe to click.

In this example there are five different ways you could fill in the mines in the neighbouring cells. Note that there’s no cell which is safe in every possibility, so there’s nowhere we can safely click to get more information.

So in order to plan our next click, it would be good to know how likely it is that each cell is safe. You might think that each of the five possibilities is equally likely, in which case the probability that a cell is safe would be the proportion of them in which it isn’t a mine:
But it’s important to notice that the five possible arrangements have different numbers of mines. One has $5$ mines, three have $6$ and the last has $7$ (in addition to the $5$ mines we already found).
Let’s say for example that we’re playing the ‘expert’ version of Minesweeper: a $30\times 16$ board with $99$ mines. That means that outside the solved region there are $444$ remaining cells and $94$ remaining mines. So for each possibility the total number of ways to arrange the mines in the rest of the board is one of the following.$$\binom{444}{94-5}=1.930\times 10^{95}$$ $$\binom{444}{94-6}=0.483\times 10^{95}$$ $$\binom{444}{94-7}=0.119\times 10^{95}$$
Different versions of Minesweeper randomise the mines slightly differently, but after your first click it’s a good approximation that every possibility is equally likely. So the possibility with only $5$ mines is about $16.2$ times as likely as the possibility with $7$ mines!
This means we should calculate how safe each cell is by finding the proportion of the possibilities in which it’s safe, but weighted by the above numbers. That gives us the following probabilities:
Previously we thought that the six best cells each had a $40\%$ chance of safety. Now we see that some of them have a $69.0\%$ chance of safety, and some of them only have $17.2\%$!

In statistical mechanics, the Boltzmann distribution is a law that tells you how likely a physical system is to be in a particular state. It works in the context that your system is in equilibrium with a larger environment that acts as a ‘heat bath’, holding it at a particular temperature $T$. Each of the states of your system has some amount of energy $E$, and Boltzmann’s formula says that the probability to find it in a given state is proportional to$$\exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT}\right)$$where $k$ is Boltzmann’s constant.

A typical application might be something like a grid of atoms that can each be in either an excited or unexcited state. The Boltzmann distribution lets us calculate how many atoms are excited. But I want to apply it to Minesweeper.
The idea is that our little corner of the Minesweeper grid is like a physical system within a larger environment; a ‘mine bath’. The probability of the corner being in each possible state is determined by the number of mines, which we want to treat like the energy.
Above we saw that the probability of a possibility with $m$ mines is proportional to$$\binom{C}{M-m}$$where there are $C$ cells and $M$ mines remaining. In order to make our analogy precise, we would have to express this in a form matching Boltzmann’s law,$$\binom{C}{M-m}\propto\exp\left(-\frac{m}{T}\right)$$where $T$ is some sort of ‘mine temperature’ defined in terms of $C$ and $M$.
When we rewrite the binomial coefficient in terms of factorials, we get$$\frac{C!}{(M-m)!(C-M+m)!}.$$If we increase $m$ by $1$ then the $(M-m)!$ term will decrease by a factor of $M-m$ while the $(C-M+m)!$ term increases by a factor of $C-M+m+1$. So the overall probability will change by a factor of $(M-m)/(C-M+m+1)$.
At the start of the game the number of remaining mines is large compared to the number of mines that we’re worrying about at the boundary of the solved region. So $m$ is small compared to $M$ and $C$. So we can use the approximation $(M-m)/(C-M+m+1) \approx M/(C-M)$. This suggests that for small $m$ the probability of a possibility with $m$ mines is proportional to$$\left(\frac{M}{C-M}\right)^m.$$
This can then be rewritten in the form$$\exp\left(\frac{m}{1/\log\left(\frac{M}{C-M}\right)}\right).$$ So we can indeed pretend that Boltzmann’s law applies to this situation, with a ‘mine temperature’ of $1/\log\left(\frac{M}{C-M}\right)$.
How good is this approximation? Well in our case $M/(C-M) = 94/(444-94) = 0.269\dots$. So the possibility with $5$ mines would be $1/(0.269\dots)^2 = 13.86\dots$ times as likely as the possibility with $7$ mines. But we saw above that this ratio was actually about $16.2$. So it has the right order of magnitude, but it’s not a very accurate estimate.
Statistical physics is often applied to macroscopic physical systems, where the number of particles is in the region of Avogadro’s number. If Minesweeper’s expert mode had $6\times 10^{23}$ mines then our approximation would be much better!
