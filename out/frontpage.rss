                    Microsoft is sending employees back to the office at least three days a week.
                    The first phase will be for employees who live near its Seattle-area headquarters in February.
                    Business Insider reported last month that Microsoft's was considering a stricter RTO policy.
                
              
      
            
            
            
            
            
            
                One of Big Tech's last remaining RTO holdouts is officially sending employees back to the office.Microsoft is mandating employees work from offices at least three days a week, according to an internal email the company sent to staff on Tuesday.The mandate will happen in three phases, beginning at the end of February 2026, with Seattle-area employees who live within 50 miles of a Microsoft office. It will then expand to other US offices and eventually internationally, according to the email from Microsoft HR chief Amy Coleman. February 23 was one of the start dates Microsoft considered, but it hasn't been decided yet.Employees can request an exception by September 19. Coleman's email didn't include details about how such exceptions may work.Business Insider reported in August that Microsoft was considering a stricter RTO policy mandating three days a week in the office.Microsoft sells software that enables remote work, such as its popular Teams workplace chat and meeting app. It remained relatively lax compared to some other Big Tech companies when it comes to RTO, especially cross-town rival Amazon. Even Zoom sent its employees back to the office part-time in 2023.Microsoft first introduced a flexible work policy when it brought employees back to the office in late 2020 after pandemic-forced closures. That policy officially allowed employees to work from home at least half of the time without approval, but in practice it was even more flexible and most employees worked remotely most of the time.Now its policy is evolving to be similar to guidelines at Meta and Google, which generally require most employees to work in offices three days a week.Microsoft's new approach is the latest sign of the company increasing performance pressure on employees. It has fired thousands of employees deemed low performers this year and introduced a new performance improvement plan meant to exit low performers more quickly.While working on the new RTO policy, Microsoft appears to have scrubbed a blog post that once heralded the benefits of remote work for retaining employees and boosting their productivity.
              
              
              
            "Hybrid work is more than a change in technology—it's a change in mindset, a change in culture, and a change in the way you think about physical and virtual spaces to enable an inclusive and productive environment for all," Microsoft wrote, according to a snapshot of the blog retained by the Internet Archive. "The change isn't easy, but it's worth it. If you make the time to do it right, your employees will be more engaged, more productive, and more connected, even when they're miles away. And they'll be far less likely to leave for a competitor who has a more sophisticated and flexible model than you do."The link to that blog post now redirects to one published on July 31 calling out how "hybrid work created new challenges for employee engagement" and how AI can solve them.Read the full memo:"How we work has forever changed. I remember starting at Microsoft in the late '90s, always in the office, no laptops, and primarily working with the people right down the hall. As technology evolved and our business expanded, we became more open, more global, and able to scale in ways we couldn't have imagined. Then the pandemic reshaped everything. It pushed us to think differently about work, to connect like never before (thank you Teams!), reminded us of how much we value being together, and gave us focus and autonomy in the traditional workday. We're not going back, and we shouldn't. Instead, we should take the best of what we've learned and move forward.In the AI era, we are moving faster than ever, building world class technology that changes how people live and work, and how organizations everywhere operate. If you reflect on our history, the most meaningful breakthroughs happen when we build on each other's ideas together, in real time.We've looked at how our teams work best, and the data is clear: when people work together in person more often, they thrive—they are more energized, empowered, and they deliver stronger results. As we build the AI products that will define this era, we need the kind of energy and momentum that comes from smart people working side by side, solving challenging problems together.With that in mind, we're updating our flexible work expectations to three days a week in the office.We'll roll this out in three phases: 1) starting in Puget Sound at the end of February; 2) expanding to other US locations; 3) and then launching outside the US.Our goal with this change is to provide more clarity and consistency in how we come together, while maintaining the flexibility we know you value. We want you to continue to shape your schedule in ways that work best for you, making in-person time intentional and impactful. Importantly, this update is not about reducing headcount. It's about working together in a way that enables us to meet our customers' needs.For some of you, this is not a change. For others this may be a bigger adjustment, which is exactly why we're providing time to plan thoughtfully. As part of these updates, we're also enhancing our workplace safety and security measures so we can continue to provide a workplace where every employee can do their best work.What you need to know:Puget Sound-area employees: If you live within 50 miles of a Microsoft office, you'll be expected to work onsite three days a week by the end of February. You'll receive a personalized email today with more details. Please connect with your manager and team to understand your organization's plans. If needed, you can request an exception by Friday, September 19.Managers: You'll find actions to take, and the resources to support both you and your team on the Managers@Microsoft SharePoint.All employees: You'll hear from your EVP or organizational leadership today with specific guidance. Each business will do what is best for their team, which means some groups will deviate from our company-wide expectations. If you are outside of the Puget Sound area, you do not need to take any action at this time unless your EVP communicates otherwise.Timelines and details for additional US office locations will be announced soon. For employees outside the United States, we will begin planning in 2026. More information is available on the Flexible Work at Microsoft SharePoint.As always, we'll keep learning together to ensure Microsoft is the best place for you to grow and have a great career. Let's keep moving forward together.Thank you,Amy"Have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at astewart@businessinsider.com or Signal at +1-425-344-8242.

It’s been some time since Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been seen using a tool known as a Stingray, or a cell-site simulator, in its attempts to find and remove undocumented immigrants. The tool tricks a phone into thinking it’s a cell tower, and when a suspect’s device connects, the cops can trace its location. Its use is controversial because anyone in the same area as the target is at risk of having their information exposed.

In a recently-unsealed search warrant reviewed by Forbes, ICE used such a cell-site simulator in an attempt to track down an individual in Orem, Utah. The suspect had been ordered to leave the U.S. in 2023, but is believed to still be in the country. Investigators learned last month that before going to Utah, he’d escaped prison in Venezuela where he was serving a sentence for murder, according to the warrant. He’s also suspected of being linked to gang activity in the country, investigators said.

When the government got the target’s number, they first got a warrant to get its location. However, the trace wasn’t precise–it only told law enforcement that the target was somewhere in an area covering about 30 blocks. That led them to asking a court for a Stingray-type device to get an accurate location.

The warrant was issued at the end of last month and it’s not yet known if the fugitive was found.
But the case shows that, despite having been criticized by civil rights groups for using Stingrays during the last Trump administration, ICE continues to use the technology. Earlier this year, new media publication Straight Arrow News said it had analysed “mobile network anomalies” around a Washington state protest against ICE raids that were consistent with Stingray use.
Forbes found contract records showing ICE purchased nearly $1 million worth of “cell site simulator vehicles” in May this year, indicating it’s taking the surveillance tool fully mobile. That was part of a contract first signed under the Biden administration in 2024.
ICE also has an active contract worth up to $4.4 million with the original Stingray manufacturer, Harris Corporation, for unspecified “equipment to determine the location of targeted mobile handsets.” That deal was also signed during the Biden years.

THE BIG STORY:
This Billionaire’s AI Was Supposed To Speed Up Policing. It’s Not Going Well.Tom Siebel, chief executive officer of C3.AI, during a panel session at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland. Photographer: Stefan Wermuth/Bloomberg© 2025 Bloomberg Finance LP
San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office spent $12 million on a sprawling AI surveillance system called Sherlock, designed to stitch together surveillance streams across as many as 16 different agencies in the jurisdiction.
Made by billionaire Tom Siebel’s C3 AI, it was supposed to drastically speed up police work, but three years into the project, cops tell Forbes they’re yet to see the benefits.
Per one staffer in 2023, “We’ve been working with them for two years and they have a barely functional product.” Since then, it’s unclear just how much the tech has progressed.
Stories You Have To Read Today
In a Forbes profile, Flock Safety shows off its drones, car tracking and AI-powered surveillance tools, all part of an effort to dislodge police tech giant Axon from the top of the market. “I plan to go take them out,” says CEO Garrett Langley.
ICE signed a contract with facial recognition company Clearview AI last week, worth nearly $10 million. It’ll be used, in part, to identify people assaulting ICE officers.
Former WhatsApp security lead Attaullah Baig has filed a lawsuit alleging Meta ignored big privacy and security problems within the messaging app. He claims thousands of Meta employees were able to view WhatsApp users’ profile pictures, location, group memberships and contact lists. Meta rejected the claims saying Baig was dismissed for poor performance and that his allegations were “distorted.”
Winner of the Week
Signal has launched encrypted backups for user chats. The feature will first be made available for Android phones, before being slowly rolled out to iPhone users. The archive requires a 64-character recovery key to access, but keep that code safe: Signal warns that if it’s lost, there’s no way to get it back.
Loser of the Week
Amnesty International claims that Pakistan is running one of the world’s most expansive domestic surveillance operations outside of China, using both Chinese and Western technology providers, who are enabling both mass snooping via the nation’s telecoms companies as well as widespread internet censorship.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Summary
Here at Huntress, we love exposing adversary tradecraft, and we also love when threat actors make blunders. So imagine our delight when a threat actor installed Huntress onto their operating machine—after finding us via one of our advertising campaigns and starting a trial— giving us a sprawling inside look at how they’re using AI to build workflows, searching for tools like Evilginx, and more.
------------------------
We all know that security products are often downloaded by attackers for “evaluation,” but often we can only guess as to how they decided to target a particular technology, or the actions taken while trying out such software. We recently had the pleasure of getting a front seat view into what one attacker did, simply because they installed our agent and let us collect information directly from them. Here, we will cover this strange tale.

How did we get here?
Like most good stories, this one starts in the middle and works its way back and forth. Let’s start with how this person of interest got our attention. One of the tricks of the trade to get people interested in your products is through advertising. As such, we run ads to help lead potential customers to our products. An adverse effect here might be garnering some “unwanted” attention as well. Such is the setting for the beginning of this adventure: it all started with a nicely placed Google ad.
The attacker tripped across our ad while researching another security solution. We confirmed this is how they found us by examining their Google Chrome browser history. An example of how this may have appeared to them in the moment may be seen in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Google search for Bitdefender, leading to a Huntress ad

It appears that the attacker became interested in Huntress while simultaneously trying out Bitdefender. After hitting our comparison page, they could hardly contain themselves and started a trial immediately. We are able to follow their journey through their Chrome history, as seen in Figure 2 below.


    Figure 2: Browser history showing how a search for Bitdefender led to a Huntress trial





It’s no secret that threat actors may install security products for research purposes or even for legitimate use—and in fact, the adversary was interested in other security products in addition to Bitdefender and Huntress. We found evidence that they had bought a Malwarebytes subscription (including the Malwarebytes browser guard extension).

Threat actor red flags—and our response
We knew this was an adversary, rather than a legitimate user, based on several telling clues. The standout red flag was that the unique machine name used by the individual was the same as one that we had tracked in several incidents prior to them installing the agent. Further investigation revealed other clues, such as the threat actor’s browser history, which appeared to show them trying to actively target organizations, craft phishing messages, find and access running instances of Evilginx, and more. We also have our suspicions that the operating machine where Huntress was installed is being used as a jump box by multiple threat actors—but we don’t have solid evidence to draw firm conclusions at this time.
Huntress analysts went to work evaluating the outstanding indicators of compromise found on the adversary’s host and how they related to data found within authentications to identities at Huntress. Retroactive hunts disclosed a further 20 identities which were compromised; many of which had been accessed by the adversary prior to Huntress’ deployment against the identity, whose activity was limited to refreshing session tokens to maintain access.
Overall, analysis of the adversary’s primary operating infrastructure, hosted on Autonomous System (AS) “12651980 CANADA INC.” (now known as VIRTUO) disclosed a pattern of access of over 2471 unique identities spanning the last two weeks– many of which were preemptively caught by additional detection capabilities such as malicious mail rule creation, or session token theft.
The intelligence gathered by the above has resulted in detections of high confidence against the adversary’s infrastructure; and equipped our systems and analysts to respond to these incidents in significantly less time and with extreme confidence in malice, eliminating adversarial attempts to evade our detections. 
All in all, we were able to see the threat actor’s specific day-to-day activities—from their methodologies to the specific types of organizations (and even individuals) they were interested in. We also saw them begin to tinker with tools and search for tutorials, attempting to learn more. For instance, after installing the Huntress agent, the threat actor took steps to better understand Autoruns.
Figure 4: The threat actor attempting to better understand Autoruns






Overall, over the course of three months we saw an evolution in terms of how the threat actor refined their processes, incorporated AI into their workflows, and targeted different organizations and vertical markets, as outlined in Figure 5 below.

Figure 5: An overview of some of the threat actor’s activities that we saw over the months


Below are some of the specific methodologies that we saw. 

Attacker methodologies
Use of AI for operational efficiency 
The Chrome browser history gave a first-hand look at how the adversary is using AI tools to increase the operational efficiency of their workflows. While there have previously been many reports on how cybercriminals are using AI (based on indicators in phishing messages or landing page content), this is the first time that we have a close-up view of a threat actor embedding AI into their operations in order to automate—and speed up—their workflow.
On May 25, the threat actor signed up for Make.com, which is legitimate workflow automation software, before researching the platform’s Telegram Bot integration feature as a way to launch automated processes (as seen in Figure 6 below). The threat actor then poked around several FAQ sites to better understand how Telegram Bot APIs work and how to set up webhooks.

Figure 6: Signing up for Make.com 



Figure 7: Digging deeper into Telegram Bot APIs


Over time, the threat actor started to get a better grasp of how they could use Make.com for specific workflows, and their browser history shows them starting to rely more heavily on the platform. By the time June 29 rolled around, the threat actor had fully developed their workflow with Make. As seen in Figure 8, the threat actor would first identify the organization of interest (typically after receiving a “tip” from Telegram) before using Google Translate to translate or craft messages related to these organizations. While we don’t have detailed insight into how the threat actor was using Make for these specific workflows, we can see that it was part of the process to automate specific functions. 



        Figure 8: Threat actor starts to rely on automated workflows
        The threat actor also appeared to be interested in other AI tools to help with data generation and writing. We saw multiple Google searches for “free ai no signup” and for “csv generator ai.” We also saw the threat actor using Toolbaz AI, which is a writing assistant; the CSV spreadsheet generator feature of DocsBot AI, which is an AI chatbot tool; and the AI data generator feature of Explo AI, which is an embedded analytics tool.
        
        Finding running instances of Evilginx
        We saw evidence of the threat actor searching for running instances of the Evilginx man-in-the-middle attack framework using Censys, and then attempting to access those instances.

        Figure 9: Using Censys to search for running instances of Evilginx

        
        
        Figure 10: One example of the Evilginx instance that the attacker tried to access

        
        In addition to Evilginx, we also found evidence of multiple installed tools on the threat actor’s system—or, in some cases, an interest in tools based on the threat actor browser history. These tools included recon and attack tool GraphSpy, open source tool Bloodhound, the TeamFiltration framework used for enumeration and exfiltration, and more.  

        Figure 11: Various tools that the attacker may have used


        
        Interest in residential proxy services
        The Chrome browser history also revealed visits by the threat actor to multiple residential proxy webpages, including LunaProxy and Nstbrowser (which bills itself as an anti-detect browser and supports the use of residential proxies). The threat actor visited the pricing plan page for LunaProxy, researched specific products, and looked up quick start guides throughout May, June, and July. Residential proxy services have become increasingly popular with threat actors as a way to route their traffic through residential IP addresses, allowing them to obscure malicious activity, like avoiding suspicious login alerts while using compromised credentials.

        Figure 12: A VirusTotal lookup of LunaProxy.exe, which was in the Chrome history


        
        Research and recon methods
        The Chrome browser history entries also gave us a close view of the attacker’s reconnaissance methods. The threat actor spent a lot of time researching companies across different sectors, from specific banks to “top real estate companies in the US” (also looking up “real estate agents in California”). 
        The threat actor didn’t just search for individual companies—they also looked at all parts of the ecosystem surrounding organizations of interest, from their customer bases to associated third-party companies across the supply chain. For example, the threat actor appeared to start targeting software companies in early July, searching for these types of companies via Google Search and using database marketing tools like ReadyContacts and InfoClutch to scope out how many customers they had and their market share. 
        The threat actor also used the BuiltWith platform, which lets users identify and analyze the technology stacks used by websites. On July 8, browser entries show the attacker conducting an extensive level of research on a prominent ecommerce vendor for managing payments and subscriptions, including a list of its customers, contacts, and market share. The threat actor then used BuiltWith to search for the websites relying on that vendor, before navigating to the BuiltWith sign up page, presumably to access that list.
        The threat actor conducted a fair amount of research into tools used to scrape Telegram group data, including looking at scraper tools like Apify, the Axiom Chrome extension, and the RapidAPI platform (Figure 13).

        Figure 13: While researching data scraping tools the threat actor came across RapidAPI  


        
        Use of Google Translate
        The threat actor used Google Translate extensively, and Chrome browser shows them first visiting bank websites, and then using the translation platform, likely to assist in crafting phishing-related messages, as seen in Figure 14. 

        Figure 14: The threat actor used Google Translate services extensively 



        The attacker often used urlscan to get information about various websites. Tips appear to have come in via Telegram using the getUpdates method.

        Figure 15: Part of the Chrome history around a particular tip

        
        
        Figure 16: Google Translate message

        
        
        Figure 17: Google Translate message: username and password

        
        
        Figure 18: Google Translate message: username and password

        
        There were several entries in the browser history that showed use of Google Translate to translate messages from Portuguese to English alongside browsing banks in Brazil, then evidence of crafting messages later on in their history. 

        
        


        


        
        
        Dark web: STYX market
        We also saw the threat actor express interest in STYX Market, a dark web forum that’s been around since 2023, and was recently called a “rising star for stealer logs, stolen creds, and laundering services” by researchers. After doing some initial research on STYX—as well as other Telegram chat groups and channels—they decided to check out the site for themselves, registering for an account before perusing the catalog of VoIP accounts, stealer logs, SIM cards, and more.

        Figure 19: The threat actor showed an interest in STYX Market


        
        Figure 20: A post from SOCRadar on STYX Market caught the threat actor’s attention 


        
        EDR activities
        Rarely do you ever get the chance to actually shoulder surf a real threat actor. We had such an opportunity when they installed our agent. It starts out mundane enough. We don’t know what they must have dreamed about after ending their shift at 2am UTC the previous night, but as mentioned earlier, you can see them start a trial, download the agent, and install it.

        Figure 21: At 2am UTC, after about 10 hours of inactivity, the threat actor suddenly showed an interest in Bitdefender, which led them to Huntress




        
        The most interesting activity for the start of their day on July 9, 2025 was browsing to urlscan.io to inspect login.incipientcroop[.]com. Shortly after, they logged into Make.com and began working on a project called Voltage_Office356bot (notice the typo). 

        Figure 22: Timeline of EDR and browser histories

        
        
        Figure 23: urlquery info for login.incipientcroop[.]com 

        
        
        Figure 24: Further down on the urlquery page for login.incipientcroop[.]com, there is evidence of Voltage_Office356bot

        
        There is evidence that the threat actor had access to cookie data for two different individuals, and accessed them via Notepad++. They proceeded to open the first file:
        C:\Program Files\Notepad++\notepad++.exe C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\Telegram Desktop\Cookies_[victim1]@[redacted1][.].com.json
        Then they started looking around to see what they can find, with a Google search for “email osint”.

        Figure 25: Looking for “email osint”

        
        Next, they opened the second cookie file:
        C:\Program Files\Notepad++\notepad++.exe C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\Telegram Desktop\Cookies_[victim2]@[redacted2][.].com.json
        They then started up Nstbrowser.exe and LunaProxy:
        C:\Program Files\Nstbrowser\Nstbrowser.exeC:\Program Files (x86)\LunaProxy_cata\socks5\LunaProxyDivert.exe  SOCK5 [snip]
        They browsed to an article titled Say Hello to your new cache flow by Synacktiv covering WHFB and Entra ID, followed by a Google search for “whfb prt”, which landed them on the website of a well-known researcher, Dirk-Jan Mollema. 
        They checked their IP address after this:
        C:\Windows\system32\curl.exe ipinfo[.]io
        And then checked their IP address again:
        C:\Windows\system32\curl.exe ipinfo[.]io
        They then tried to use a tool called ROADtools Token eXchange (roadtx):

        C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Scripts\roadtx.exe prtauth -r msgraph -c msteams
        And then erroneously tried to run the same tool (as an executable) via Python:
        C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe  C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Scripts\roadtx.exe prtauth -r msgraph -c msteams
        Then ran it again:
        C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Scripts\roadtx.exe describe
        And then tried to run it again, erroneously, using Python:
        C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe  C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Scripts\roadtx.exe describe
        They seemed to be having trouble. At this point they browsed to Dirk-jan Mollema’s post on Phishing for Microsoft Entra primary refresh tokens. 

        Figure 26: Searching for an answer with keyword whfb prt 

        
        While there, they gained some new inspiration, and discovered a handy little script that could make their life easier:

        Figure 27: Excerpt from Dirk-jan’s blog, pointing to a nifty little script

        
        At this point they went back to their Voltage_Office356bot project before running this new script they’ve downloaded.

        Figure 28: Accessing the Voltage_Office356bot project and running the attack script

        
        They started trying to run the Python script:
        C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe main.py -f roadtx.prt --wfb
        They checked the usage again:
        C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe main.py --wfb
        C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe main.py -h
        Then, they started to run it against the original victim whose cookie file we saw earlier:
        C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe main.py --wfb -u [victim2]@[redacted2][.]com 
        They returned to the first victim’s cookie file:C:\Program Files\Notepad++\notepad++.exe C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\Telegram Desktop\Cookies_[victim1]@[redacted1][.].com.json
        This is where our EDR data drops off, as they may have become aware of us and uninstalled the agent.
        
        Hours worked in a day
        The attacker’s browser history gives us an unprecedented level of insight into their everyday activity, searches, workflows, research, and more. The browser history shows the threat actor working intensively almost every day between the period of May 29, 2025 through July 9, 2025. 

        Figure 29: Chart of the number of hours per day (label alternates dates) worked based on browser activities


        On many of these days, the browser entries were seen across most hours of the day, logging 12 to 14 hours. But there was some variation, as seen in Figure 29, above: on several days, the threat actor worked as little as one to two hours.
        When we hone in on a few of the days when the most hours were put in, we can see some of the things that piqued the attacker’s interest in those days. We analyzed the urls to see what businesses, or categories they might have fallen into, and then looked to see how many times the attacker visited these sites. 
        We can see a few trends. During these days, the attacker spent a lot of time researching various banking entities and bank personnel. To further expand on some of the graph labels:
        
            
                Attack infra: Malicious websites or servers set up by an attacker (maybe not this one) hosting frameworks like Evilginx and other known tools.
            
            
                Banking: Various banking websites
            
            
                Browser extension: Various browser extensions like ad blockers, etc. installed by the attacker to protect themselves.
            
            
                Corporate & Business: Various business websites not housed under a different category.
            
            
                Crypto: Various cryptocurrency and blockchain websites.
            
            
                Cybersecurity: Various cybersecurity vendor websites. The attacker often signed up for trials at various vendors to test things.
            
            
                Government & military: Various official government or military websites.
            
            
                News, media & information: Various news websites like CNN etc.  The attacker often read articles related to various breaches.
            
            
                OSS: Open source projects, often housed at github or gitlab.
            
            
                Recon: Activities where the attacker was using Censys, Urlscan, Google, etc., to do reconnaissance for a particular target.
            
            
                Research: When the attacker was researching a particular vulnerability, tool, or attack.
            
            
                Sandbox: The attacker often seemed interested in various types of malware that were on VirusTotal, Joe’s Sandbox, and other online sandboxes.
            
            
                Social media: Various telegram, X, and other social media posts read by the attacker.
            
            
                Software: Various legitimate software, like 7zip.
            
            
                Telecommunications: A telecommunication website, like Verizon.
            
            
                Web & IT infrastructure: Various online hosting services, like Mega, Amazon AWS, and Azure. 
            
        

        Figure 30: Activities on May 29, 2025

        
        We can see that from May 29 to June 1, 2025, the attacker was mostly looking at various banking websites. Digging further into their activities, you see them researching various banks, reading about Telegram Bots, then downloading a blueprint from Make.

        Figure 31: A deeper look at some of the activities on May 29, 2025

        
        The next day, it seems that the attacker spent a little more time researching various attack infrastructure, in addition to focusing on banks, and similar activities seen previously.

        Figure 32: Activities on May 30, 2025

        
        On May 31, 2025 and June 1, 2025, the attacker switched their focus back to mostly researching banking websites.

        Figure 33: Activities on May 31, 2025

        
        
        Figure 34: Activities on June 1, 2025

        
        
        Figure 35: Regions Focused on by the Attacker from May 29 - June 1, 2025

        
        The other interesting thing was that the attacker was mostly focused on banks and sites that were in Nigeria during this time period, even looking for things like:“No. 1 regulated crypto exchange in Nigeria.”
        “top crypto companies nigeria”
        “Best Crypto Exchanges in Nigeria”“Top Cryptocurrency Companies in Nigeria”
        While we don’t know where the attacker is based, the machine they had installed our agent upon appeared to be based in the United States, on the West Coast, based on the machine’s internal time zone and IP address.

        Figure 36: Activities on July 9, 2025

        
        It seems that the attacker had spent quite some time looking at our various capabilities after they had started a trial with us. Figure 36 above shows just how much more time they spent interacting with the Huntress website, and particularly the account dashboard once they had started the trial.
        
        Lessons learned
        This incident gave us in-depth information about the day-to-day activities of a threat actor, from the tools they were interested in to the ways they conducted research and approached different aspects of attacks. 
        Upon confirming that the machine name was one used by an adversary, we decided to release these details because they give an invaluable understanding into the mindset and behaviors of threat actors behind attacks. For other defenders, we hope that this information can help add context around the ways that threat actors conduct research and launch attacks at the backend—and the different types of organizations, tools, and platforms that interest them.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[September 8, 2025 • 12 minutesDOOMQL: A DOOM-like multiplayer shooter in pure SQLI recently stumbled across Patrick’s excellent DOOM clone running in a browser powered by DuckDB-WASM.
Ever since I’ve read that, I wanted to push his awesome idea to the logical extreme: Build a multiplayer DOOM-like shooter entirely in SQL with CedarDB doing all the heavy lifting.
During a month of parental leave (i.e., a lot of sleepless nights), I tried exactly that.Here’s a sneak peek at DOOMQL:
Your browser does not support the video tag.DOOMQL in actionOkay, with the flashy demo out of the way, let’s talk about details.
What follows is a tour of the architecture, the SQL rendering pipeline, the game loop, and the fun metagame of cheating by issuing SQL commands against the database.Why even do this?Playing DuckDB DOOM in your browser is fun, but some things bugged me:
First of all, having parts of the rendering pipeline in Javascript felt like cheating. It worked well for DuckDB-Doom where everything is contained in a single HTML page, but I wanted to see if I could do everything in SQL. DuckDB-Doom is also a little bit stuttery with just 8 frames per second and has a pretty tiny viewport. I wanted to see if I could speed that up by switching over to CedarDB. I also wanted real sprites with transparency and they should move around believably in 3D space.
And most importantly, making the game multi-player should not just be possible, but easy, right? I got nerd-sniped by the perceived similarity of a database server to a traditional game server: Databases exist to synchronize shared state across clients. Thanks to transaction isolation, each player has a consistent view of the game world, no matter what the other clients are doing. Why not lean into that?
I would love to lie to you and claim I did it all to push CedarDB as an awesome database system but to be honest the database nerd in me just wanted to turn all knobs up to 11 and see what breaks.Architectural overviewAt a high levelState lives in tables (map, players, mobs, inputs, configs, sprites, …)Rendering is a stack of SQL views that implement raycasting and sprite projectionThe game loop is a tiny shell script that executes a SQL file ~ 30 times per second.The client is ~ 150 lines of Python: It polls for input and queries the database for your 3D view.You can play, observe other players and even cheat (by sending raw SQL).Game state, or: Let’s store everything in the databaseWith a database at hand, it’s natural to store all game configuration, state, and static data in the database:Config:CREATE TABLE config(
  player_move_speed NUMERIC DEFAULT 0.3, 
  player_turn_speed NUMERIC DEFAULT 0.2,
  ammo_max INT DEFAULT 10,
  ammo_refill_interval_seconds INT DEFAULT 2
  );
Map:CREATE TABLE map(x INT, y INT, tile CHAR);
Players and inputs:CREATE TABLE players (
  id INT REFERENCES mobs(id),
  score INT DEFAULT 0,
  hp INT DEFAULT 100,
  ammo INT DEFAULT 10,
  last_ammo_refill int default EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (now()))::INT
);

CREATE TABLE inputs(
  player_id INT PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES players(id),
  action CHAR(1), -- 'w', 'a', 's', 'd', 'x' for shooting
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
Because everything is data, modding a running match is trivial:-- Change a setting
update config set ammo_max = 20;

 -- Add a player
insert into players values (...);

-- Move forward
update input set action = 'w' where player_id = <your_id>;

 -- Cheat (pls be smarter about it)
update players set hp = 100000 where player_id = <your_id>;

-- Ban cheaters (that weren't smart about it)

Renderer: When a VIEW becomes your 3D viewIf you squint enough, in DOOM, a 3D (or more correct: 2.5D) view is just a view over 2D state (i.e., the level map and any players/enemies on it).
Well, we’ve got VIEWS in SQL as well. They’re also just views on our (2D) state tables.
What’s stopping us from quite literally building a 3D “view” of our 2D map
using a simple raycasting algorithm?The pipeline:Send a set of rays from each player’s eye into the world, and see which map tiles are visibleCheck which walls the player sees, rendering them at the correct height and more or less solid based on the distanceProject mobs into the player’s camera spaceSelect sprite LODs based on depthExpand sprites into pixels, scaled to screen spaceOcclude against walls and other spritesAssemble frame buffer rows with string_aggBuild a minimap reusing the visible tiles calculation from earlierCombine the 3D view with minimap and HUD (HP/bullets/players) into a game viewLet’s take a more in-depth look at steps 2, 7, and 8.RaycastingThe recursive ray‑marching logic is adapted from Patrick’s DuckDB DOOM post. Here is a simplified excerpt, adapted for multiplayer:CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW visible_tiles AS  
WITH RECURSIVE raytrace AS (  
  -- Starting at the player's eye ...
  SELECT r.player_id, r.col, 1 AS step_count,  
         r.player_x + COS(r.angle)*s.step AS fx,  
         r.player_y + SIN(r.angle)*s.step AS fy,  
         r.angle, 0 AS dist  
  FROM rays r, settings s  -- rays are built in an earlier step
  UNION ALL  
  -- ... we recursively march along the rays, 1 "step" at a time ...
  SELECT rt.player_id, rt.col, rt.step_count + 1,  
         rt.fx + COS(rt.angle)*s.step,  
         rt.fy + SIN(rt.angle)*s.step,  
         rt.angle,  
         step_count * s.step * COS(rt.angle - m.dir) AS dist  
  FROM raytrace rt, settings s, players p, mobs m  
  WHERE rt.step_count < s.max_steps   -- ... stopping after our max render distance
    AND rt.player_id = p.id  
    AND m.id = p.id  
    AND NOT EXISTS (  -- or if we hit a wall
      SELECT 1 FROM map m  
      WHERE m.x = CAST(rt.fx AS INT) AND m.y = CAST(rt.fy AS INT)  
        AND m.tile = '#')  -- wall
)  
-- We then determine per player:
--  a) which tiles we hit
--  b) how far away these tiles are
--  c) the column of the screen each tile should correspond to
SELECT player_id, tile, CAST(fx AS INT) AS tile_x, CAST(fy AS INT) AS tile_y, col, MIN(dist) AS dist  
FROM raytrace rt, map m  
WHERE m.x = CAST(rt.fx AS INT) AND m.y = CAST(rt.fy AS INT)  -- We might hit the same tile multiple times, so we take the closest hit
GROUP BY player_id, tile_x, tile_y, tile, col;  
And that’s just the first step in the pipeline. For the rest, take a look at the code.Final frame assemblyAfter all the heavy lifting, the payoff is surprisingly simple:SELECT player_id, y, string_agg(ch, '' ORDER BY x) AS row  
FROM framebuffer  
GROUP BY player_id, y;  
This glues together character pixels into text rows.HUD + minimapThe same trick builds the HUD and minimap. Here is the health bar:'HP: [' ||
repeat('█', LEAST(20, ROUND(20 * GREATEST(0, LEAST(p.hp,100))::numeric / 100)::int)) ||
repeat(' ', GREATEST(0, 20 - ROUND(20 * GREATEST(0, LEAST(p.hp,100))::numeric / 100)::int)) ||
'] ' || GREATEST(0, p.hp)
Add ammo dots with repeat('•', p.ammo) and you’ve got a HUD entirely in SQL: 1: Lukas      (L) score: 1   HP: [█████████           ] 50    AMMO: ••••••••••
 2: Foobar     (F) score: 0   HP: [████████████████████] 100   AMMO: ••••••••  
We can also re-use our earlier visible_tiles view to build a minimap with a view cone:select * from minimap where player_id = 1 order by y;

 player_id | y  |                               row

The surprisingly elegant game loopThe loop is just a shell script running raw SQL against the database:# Game loop @ 30 ticks per second
while true; do
  psql -qtAX -U "$DB_USER" -d "$DB_NAME" -h "$DB_HOST" -p "$DB_PORT" -f gameloop.sql
  sleep 0.03
done
Inside gameloop.sql, actions like bullet movement, collisions, kills, and respawns run in a single transaction, which keeps state consistent even if something fails mid-tick.Here’s the part processing interactions with bullets:-- Process all bullets
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Move bullets forward
UPDATE mobs 
SET x = x + cos(dir) * 0.5, y = y + sin(dir) * 0.5 
WHERE kind = 'bullet';

-- Delete bullets that are out of bounds
DELETE FROM mobs 
WHERE (x < 0 
OR x >= (select max(x) from map) 
OR y < 0 
OR y >= (select max(y) from map))
AND kind = 'bullet';

-- Delete bullets that hit walls
DELETE FROM mobs b 
WHERE EXISTS 
    (SELECT 1 
    FROM map m 
    WHERE m.x = CAST(b.x AS INT) 
    AND m.y = CAST(b.y AS INT) 
    AND m.tile = '#') 
AND kind = 'bullet';


-- Players hit by a bullet loses 50 HP
UPDATE players p SET hp = hp - 50
FROM collisions c
WHERE p.id = c.player_id;

-- If a player has 0 or less HP, the player killing them gets a point
UPDATE players p SET score = score + 1
FROM collisions c
WHERE p.id = c.bullet_owner
AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM players p2 WHERE p2.id = c.player_id AND p2.hp <= 0);

-- Delete bullets that hit players
DELETE FROM mobs m
USING collisions c
WHERE m.id = c.bullet_id;

-- Respawn players whose HP is 0 or less
UPDATE mobs m
SET x = r.x, y = r.y, dir = 0
FROM players p
CROSS JOIN (
  SELECT x, y
  FROM map
  WHERE tile = 'R'
  ORDER BY random()
  LIMIT 1
) AS r
WHERE m.id = p.id
  AND p.hp <= 0;

-- Reset players' HP to 100 and ammo to 10 after respawn
UPDATE players p SET
  hp = 100,
  ammo = 10
FROM mobs m
WHERE p.id = m.id
AND p.hp <= 0;

COMMIT;
On my machine, the game loop takes about 1 ms, so we could defintely improve the tick rate.
That might be a way to get the Counterstrike snobs who scoff at everything below 128 Hz.
It would require some refactoring on my part since I tied the movement speed to the game loop - a big no no in game design!While only someone insane could think a pure SQL raycasting renderer is a good idea in an actual game, I’ll happily defend this transactional game loop.
I don’t think this part would be much more concise or less brittle in a real game engine.Make it multiplayer in two queriesThe game client’s job description is simple:RenderSELECT full_row FROM screen WHERE player_id = <your_id> ORDER BY y
Send inputINSERT INTO inputs(player_id, action)
    VALUES (<your_id>, <pressed_key>)
    ON CONFLICT(player_id)
    DO UPDATE SET action = EXCLUDED.action
The game loop periodically checks the input table and moves all players accordingly - inside a transaction, of course, so we don’t run into any race conditions.That’s it (well, plus a one-time “create player” on first connect). The ~150 lines of Python in the client mostly handle keyboard input and reducing terminal flicker.
Bonus: The client provides an observer mode. All it has to do is swap the <player_id> in the render call.PerformanceAt 128 x 64 pixels, a single player view takes ~33 ms on my machine, which is enough for a breezy ~30 FPS, compared to DuckDB DOOM’s 8 FPS at just 32 x 16 pixels.
I’m actually quite proud of that performance and quite happy with CedarDB here.
I don’t think any other database system can keep up with that.
Let me know if you find one!You might worry that rendering the views of all players and filtering late would be very wasteful.
CedarDB’s query optimizer pushes the where player_id = <...> predicate through view boundaries, avoiding unncessary work.
You can easily check by running:select * from screen order by y; -- render both users
-- Time: 57,907 ms (~2x single player 33ms)
Because clients send raw SQL as superusers (I didn’t bother setting up any role based access control or row level security, don’t do that!), there’s an emergent metagame: Cheat creatively and try not to get caught.Low effort:update players set score = 0 where id != <your_id>;
update players set hp = 0 where id != <your_id>;
Mischievous:update inputs set action = null where player_id != <your_id>;
Steal kills:update mobs set owner = <your_id> where kind = 'bullet';
Attempted but didn’t work:DELETE FROM mobs m
USING collisions c
WHERE m.id = c.bullet_id AND c.player_id = <your_id>;
This doesn’t work because moving bullets, checking for collisions, and respawn happens in the same transaction.
As transactions are atomic, you either see everything being applied at once, or nothing. By the time you see the hit, you’re already dead.
A property that’s very useful for database systems (and not just to prevent cheating).What I learnedI set out to see if I could push Patrick’s demo to an extreme: Doing the entire rendering pipeline in SQL.
And while it works, I have to admit that it is a pretty… bad idea? Fast enough, but horrible to maintain and debug.The surprise was how natural it felt to express game state and logic in SQL.
It even felt like accidentally re-invented the entity-component-system pattern.And multiplayer “just worked” because the database system which handles all the nasty concurrency is the source of truth.Try it yourself!All the code is on Github: DOOMQL RepoRun:docker pull cedardb/cedardb:latest
docker run --rm -p 5432:5432 -e CEDAR_PASSWORD=postgres --detach cedardb/cedardb:latest
# Wait a few seconds for CedarDB to start
./server.sh

# in a second terminal window, zoom way out to have no line wraping issues

Introduction
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
is a simple data interchange format. Almost 15 years ago,
we wrote about support for JSON in Go,
which introduced the ability to serialize and deserialize Go types to and from JSON data.
Since then, JSON has become the most popular data format used on the Internet.
It is widely read and written by Go programs,
and encoding/json now ranks as the 5th most imported Go package.
Over time, packages evolve with the needs of their users,
and encoding/json is no exception. This blog post is about Go 1.25’s new
experimental encoding/json/v2 and encoding/json/jsontext packages,
which bring long-awaited improvements and fixes.
This post argues for a new major API version,
provides an overview of the new packages,
and explains how you can make use of it.
The experimental packages are not visible by default and
may undergo future API changes.
Problems with encoding/json
Overall, encoding/json has held up well.
The idea of marshaling and unmarshaling arbitrary Go types
with some default representation in JSON, combined with the ability to
customize the representation, has proven to be highly flexible.
However, in the years since its introduction,
various users have identified numerous shortcomings.
Behavior flaws
There are various behavioral flaws in encoding/json:


Imprecise handling of JSON syntax: Over the years, JSON has seen
increased standardization in order for programs to properly communicate.
Generally, decoders have become stricter at rejecting ambiguous inputs,
to reduce the chance that two implementations will have different
(successful) interpretations of a particular JSON value.


encoding/json currently accepts invalid UTF-8,
whereas the latest Internet Standard (RFC 8259) requires valid UTF-8.
The default behavior should report an error in the presence of invalid UTF-8,
instead of introducing silent data corruption,
which may cause problems downstream.


encoding/json currently accepts objects with duplicate member names.
RFC 8259 does not specify how to handle duplicate names,
so an implementation is free to choose an arbitrary value,
merge the values, discard the values, or report an error.
The presence of a duplicate name results in a JSON value
without a universally agreed upon meaning.
This could be exploited by attackers in security applications
and has been exploited before (as in CVE-2017-12635).
The default behavior should err on the side of safety and reject duplicate names.




Leaking nilness of slices and maps: JSON is often used to communicate with
programs using JSON implementations that do not allow null to be unmarshaled
into a data type expected to be a JSON array or object.
Since encoding/json marshals a nil slice or map as a JSON null,
this may lead to errors when unmarshaling by other implementations.
A survey
indicated that most Go users prefer that nil slices and maps
are marshaled as an empty JSON array or object by default.


Case-insensitive unmarshaling: When unmarshaling, a JSON object member name
is resolved to a Go struct field name using a case-insensitive match.
This is a surprising default, a potential security vulnerability, and a performance limitation.


Inconsistent calling of methods: Due to an implementation detail,
MarshalJSON methods declared on a pointer receiver
are inconsistently called by encoding/json. While regarded as a bug,
this cannot be fixed as too many applications depend on the current behavior.


API deficiencies
The API of encoding/json can be tricky or restrictive:


It is difficult to correctly unmarshal from an io.Reader.
Users often write json.NewDecoder(r).Decode(v),
which fails to reject trailing junk at the end of the input.


Options can be set on the Encoder and Decoder types,
but cannot be used with the Marshal and Unmarshal functions.
Similarly, types implementing the Marshaler and Unmarshaler interfaces
cannot make use of the options and there is no way to plumb options down the call stack.
For example, the Decoder.DisallowUnknownFields option loses its effect
when calling a custom UnmarshalJSON method.


The Compact, Indent, and HTMLEscape functions write to a bytes.Buffer
instead of something more flexible like a []byte or io.Writer.
This limits the usability of those functions.


Performance limitations
Setting aside internal implementation details,
the public API commits it to certain performance limitations:


MarshalJSON: The MarshalJSON interface method forces the implementation
to allocate the returned []byte. Also, the semantics require that
encoding/json verify that the result is valid JSON
and also to reformat it to match the specified indentation.


UnmarshalJSON: The UnmarshalJSON interface method requires that
a complete JSON value be provided (without any trailing data).
This forces encoding/json to parse the JSON value to be unmarshaled
in its entirety to determine where it ends before it can call UnmarshalJSON.
Afterwards, the UnmarshalJSON method itself must parse the provided JSON value again.


Lack of streaming: Even though the Encoder and Decoder types operate
on an io.Writer or io.Reader, they buffer the entire JSON value in memory.
The Decoder.Token method for reading individual tokens is allocation-heavy
and there is no corresponding API for writing tokens.


Furthermore, if the implementation of a MarshalJSON or UnmarshalJSON method
recursively calls the Marshal or Unmarshal function,
then the performance becomes quadratic.
Trying to fix encoding/json directly
Introducing a new, incompatible major version of a package is a heavy consideration.
If possible, we should try to fix the existing package.
While it is relatively easy to add new features,
it is difficult to change existing features.
Unfortunately, these problems are inherent consequences of the existing API,
making them practically impossible to fix within the Go 1 compatibility promise.
We could in principle declare separate names, such as MarshalV2 or UnmarshalV2,
but that is tantamount to creating a parallel namespace within the same package.
This leads us to encoding/json/v2 (henceforth called v2),
where we can make these changes within a seperate v2 namespace
in contrast to encoding/json (henceforth called v1).
Planning for encoding/json/v2
The planning for a new major version of encoding/json spanned years.
In late 2020, spurred on by the inability to fix issues in the current package,
Daniel Martí (one of the maintainers of encoding/json) first drafted his
thoughts on what a hypothetical v2 package should look like.
Separately, after previous work on the Go API for Protocol Buffers,
Joe Tsai was disapppointed that the protojson package
needed to use a custom JSON implementation because encoding/json was
neither capable of adhering to the stricter JSON standard that the
Protocol Buffer specification required,
nor of efficiently serializing JSON in a streaming manner.
Believing a brighter future for JSON was both beneficial and achievable,
Daniel and Joe joined forces to brainstorm on v2 and
started to build a prototype
(with the initial code being a polished version of the JSON serialization logic from the Go protobuf module).
Over time, a few others (Roger Peppe, Chris Hines, Johan Brandhorst-Satzkorn, and Damien Neil)
joined the effort by providing design review, code review, and regression testing.
Many of the early discussions are publicly available in our
recorded meetings and
meeting notes.
This work has been public since the beginning,
and we increasingly involved the wider Go community,
first with a
GopherCon talk and
discussion posted in late 2023,
formal proposal posted in early 2025,
and most recently adopting encoding/json/v2 as a Go experiment
(available in Go 1.25) for wider-scale testing by all Go users.
The v2 effort has been going on for 5 years,
incorporating feedback from many contributors and also gaining valuable
empirical experience from use in production settings.
It’s worth noting that it’s largely been developed and promoted by people
not employed by Google, demonstrating that the Go project is a collaborative endeavor
with a thriving global community dedicated to improving the Go ecosystem.
Building on encoding/json/jsontext
Before discussing the v2 API, we first introduce the experimental
encoding/json/jsontext package
that lays the foundation for future improvements to JSON in Go.
JSON serialization in Go can be broken down into two primary components:

syntactic functionality that is concerned with processing JSON based on its grammar, and
semantic functionality that defines the relationship between JSON values and Go values.

We use the terms “encode” and “decode” to describe syntactic functionality and
the terms “marshal” and “unmarshal” to describe semantic functionality.
We aim to provide a clear distinction between functionality
that is purely concerned with encoding versus that of marshaling.
This diagram provides an overview of this separation.
Purple blocks represent types, while blue blocks represent functions or methods.
The direction of the arrows approximately represents the flow of data.
The bottom half of the diagram, implemented by the jsontext package,
contains functionality that is only concerned with syntax,
while the upper half, implemented by the json/v2 package,
contains functionality that assigns semantic meaning to syntactic data
handled by the bottom half.
The basic API of jsontext is the following:
package jsontext

type Encoder struct { ... }
func NewEncoder(io.Writer, ...Options) *Encoder
func (*Encoder) WriteValue(Value) error
func (*Encoder) WriteToken(Token) error

type Decoder struct { ... }
func NewDecoder(io.Reader, ...Options) *Decoder
func (*Decoder) ReadValue() (Value, error)
func (*Decoder) ReadToken() (Token, error)

type Kind byte
type Value []byte
func (Value) Kind() Kind
type Token struct { ... }
func (Token) Kind() Kind

The jsontext package provides functionality for interacting with JSON
at a syntactic level and derives its name from
RFC 8259, section 2
where the grammar for JSON data is literally called JSON-text.
Since it only interacts with JSON at a syntactic level,
it does not depend on Go reflection.
The Encoder and
Decoder
provide support for encoding and decoding JSON values and tokens.
The constructors
accept variadic options
that affect the particular behavior of encoding and decoding.
Unlike the Encoder and Decoder types declared in v1,
the new types in jsontext avoid muddling the distinction between syntax and
semantics and operate in a truly streaming manner.
A JSON value is a complete unit of data and is represented in Go as
a named []byte.
It is identical to RawMessage in v1.
A JSON value is syntactically composed of one or more JSON tokens.
A JSON token is represented in Go as the opaque Token type
with constructors and accessor methods.
It is analogous to Token in v1
but is designed represent arbitrary JSON tokens without allocation.
To resolve the fundamental performance problems with
the MarshalJSON and UnmarshalJSON interface methods,
we need an efficient way of encoding and decoding JSON
as a streaming sequence of tokens and values.
In v2, we introduce the MarshalJSONTo and UnmarshalJSONFrom interface methods
that operate on an Encoder or Decoder, allowing the methods’ implementations
to process JSON in a purely streaming manner. Thus, the json package need not
be responsible for validating or formatting a JSON value returned by MarshalJSON,
nor would it need to be responsible for determining the boundaries of a JSON value
provided to UnmarshalJSON. These responsibilities belong to the Encoder and Decoder.
Introducing encoding/json/v2
Building on the jsontext package, we now introduce the experimental
encoding/json/v2 package.
It is designed to fix the aforementioned problems,
while remaining familiar to users of the v1 package.
Our goal is that usages of v1 will operate mostly the same if directly migrated to v2.
In this article, we will primarily cover the high-level API of v2.
For examples on how to use it, we encourage readers to
study the examples in the v2 package or
read Anton Zhiyanov’s blog covering the topic.
The basic API of v2 is the following:
package json

func Marshal(in any, opts ...Options) (out []byte, err error)
func MarshalWrite(out io.Writer, in any, opts ...Options) error
func MarshalEncode(out *jsontext.Encoder, in any, opts ...Options) error

func Unmarshal(in []byte, out any, opts ...Options) error
func UnmarshalRead(in io.Reader, out any, opts ...Options) error
func UnmarshalDecode(in *jsontext.Decoder, out any, opts ...Options) error

The Marshal
and Unmarshal functions
have a signature similar to v1, but accept options to configure their behavior.
The MarshalWrite
and UnmarshalRead functions
directly operate on an io.Writer or io.Reader,
avoiding the need to temporarily construct an Encoder or Decoder
just to write or read from such types.
The MarshalEncode
and UnmarshalDecode functions
operate on a jsontext.Encoder and jsontext.Decoder and
is actually the underlying implementation of the previously mentioned functions.
Unlike v1, options are a first-class argument to each of the marshal and unmarshal functions,
greatly extending the flexibility and configurability of v2.
There are several options available
in v2 which are not covered by this article.
Type-specified customization
Similar to v1, v2 allows types to define their own JSON representation
by satisfying particular interfaces.
type Marshaler interface {
    MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error)
}
type MarshalerTo interface {
    MarshalJSONTo(*jsontext.Encoder) error
}

type Unmarshaler interface {
    UnmarshalJSON([]byte) error
}
type UnmarshalerFrom interface {
    UnmarshalJSONFrom(*jsontext.Decoder) error
}

The Marshaler
and Unmarshaler interfaces
are identical to those in v1.
The new MarshalerTo
and UnmarshalerFrom interfaces
allow a type to represent itself as JSON using a jsontext.Encoder or jsontext.Decoder.
This allows options to be forwarded down the call stack, since options
can be retrieved via the Options accessor method on the Encoder or Decoder.
See the OrderedObject example
for how to implement a custom type that maintains the ordering of JSON object members.
Caller-specified customization
In v2, the caller of Marshal and Unmarshal can also specify
a custom JSON representation for any arbitrary type,
where caller-specified functions take precedence over type-defined methods
or the default representation for a particular type.
func WithMarshalers(*Marshalers) Options

type Marshalers struct { ... }
func MarshalFunc[T any](fn func(T) ([]byte, error)) *Marshalers
func MarshalToFunc[T any](fn func(*jsontext.Encoder, T) error) *Marshalers

func WithUnmarshalers(*Unmarshalers) Options

type Unmarshalers struct { ... }
func UnmarshalFunc[T any](fn func([]byte, T) error) *Unmarshalers
func UnmarshalFromFunc[T any](fn func(*jsontext.Decoder, T) error) *Unmarshalers

MarshalFunc and
MarshalToFunc
construct a custom marshaler that can be passed to a Marshal call
using WithMarshalers to override the marshaling of particular types.
Similarly,
UnmarshalFunc and
UnmarshalFromFunc
support similar customization for Unmarshal.
The ProtoJSON example
demonstrates how this feature allows serialization of all
proto.Message types
to be handled by the protojson package.
Behavior differences
While v2 aims to behave mostly the same as v1,
its behavior has changed in some ways
to address problems in v1, most notably:


v2 reports an error in the presence of invalid UTF-8.


v2 reports an error if a JSON object contains a duplicate name.


v2 marshals a nil Go slice or Go map as an empty JSON array or JSON object, respectively.


v2 unmarshals a JSON object into a Go struct using a
case-sensitive match from the JSON member name to the Go field name.


v2 redefines the omitempty tag option to omit a field if it would have
encoded as an “empty” JSON value (which are null, "", [], and {}).


v2 reports an error when trying to serialize a time.Duration,
which currently has no default representation,
but provides options to let the caller decide.


For most behavior changes, there is a struct tag option or caller-specified option
that can configure the behavior to operate under v1 or v2 semantics,
or even other caller-determined behavior.
See “Migrating to v2” for more information.
Performance optimizations
The Marshal performance of v2 is roughly at parity with v1.
Sometimes it is slightly faster, but other times it is slightly slower.
The Unmarshal performance of v2 is significantly faster than v1,
with benchmarks demonstrating improvements of up to 10x.
In order to obtain greater performance gains,
existing implementations of
Marshaler and
Unmarshaler should
migrate to also implement
MarshalerTo and
UnmarshalerFrom,
so that they can benefit from processing JSON in a purely streaming manner.
For example, recursive parsing of OpenAPI specifications in UnmarshalJSON methods
significantly hurt performance in a particular service of Kubernetes
(see kubernetes/kube-openapi#315),
while switching to UnmarshalJSONFrom improved performance by orders of magnitude.
For more information, see the
go-json-experiment/jsonbench
repository.
Retroactively improving encoding/json
We want to avoid two separate JSON implementations in the Go standard library,
so it is critical that, under the hood, v1 is implemented in terms of v2.
There are several benefits to this approach:


Gradual migration: The Marshal and Unmarshal functions in v1 or v2
represent a set of default behaviors that operate according to v1 or v2 semantics.
Options can be specified that configure Marshal or Unmarshal to operate with
entirely v1, mostly v1 with a some v2, a mix of v1 or v2,
mostly v2 with some v1, or entirely v2 semantics.
This allows for gradual migration between the default behaviors of the two versions.


Feature inheritance: As backward-compatible features are added to v2,
they will inherently be made available in v1. For example, v2 adds
support for several new struct tag options such as inline or format and also
support for the MarshalJSONTo and UnmarshalJSONFrom interface methods,
which are both more performant and flexible.
When v1 is implemented in terms of v2, it will inherit support for these features.


Reduced maintenance: Maintenance of a widely used package demands significant effort.
By having v1 and v2 use the same implementation, the maintenance burden is reduced.
In general, a single change will fix bugs, improve performance, or add functionality to both versions.
There is no need to backport a v2 change with an equivalent v1 change.


While select parts of v1 may be deprecated over time (supposing v2 graduates from being an experiment),
the package as a whole will never be deprecated.
Migrating to v2 will be encouraged, but not required.
The Go project will not drop support for v1.
Experimenting with jsonv2
The newer API in the encoding/json/jsontext and encoding/json/v2 packages are not visible by default.
To use them, build your code with GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2 set in your environment or with the goexperiment.jsonv2 build tag.
The nature of an experiment is that the API is unstable and may change in the future.
Though the API is unstable, the implementation is of a high quality and
has been successfully used in production by several major projects.
The fact that v1 is implemented in terms of v2 means that the underlying implementation of v1
is completely different when building under the jsonv2 experiment.
Without changing any code, you should be able to run your tests
under jsonv2 and theoretically nothing new should fail:
GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2 go test ./...

The re-implementation of v1 in terms of v2 aims to provide identical behavior
within the bounds of the Go 1 compatibility promise,
though some differences might be observable such as the exact wording of error messages.
We encourage you to run your tests under jsonv2 and
report any regressions on the issue tracker.
Becoming an experiment in Go 1.25 is a significant milestone on the road to
formally adopting encoding/json/jsontext and encoding/json/v2 into the standard library.
However, the purpose of the jsonv2 experiment is to gain broader experience.
Your feedback will determine our next steps, and the outcome of this experiment,
which may result in anything from abandonment of the effort, to adoption as stable packages of Go 1.26.
Please share your experience on go.dev/issue/71497, and help determine the future of Go.

            <description><![CDATA[This technology review explains hpw 2T0C IGZO-based DRAM opens doors to high-density 3D DRAM and embedded DRAM.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[A novel DRAM memory cell with two IGZO-based transistorsThe bit cell of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), the main memory within traditional compute architectures, is conceptually very simple. It consists of one capacitor (1C) and one silicon (Si)-based transistor (1T). While the capacitor’s role is to store a charge, the transistor is used to access the capacitor, either to read how much charge is stored or to store a new charge.Over the years, bit cell density scaling allowed the industry to introduce subsequent generations of DRAM technology and cope with the growing demand for DRAM. But since about 2015, DRAM memory technology has struggled to keep pace with the performance improvement of the processor’s logic part: scaling, cost, and power efficiency issues form the building blocks of a rising ‘memory wall’. The large capacitor constrains scalability and 3D integration of the 1T1C bit cell, the ultimate path towards high-density DRAM. In addition, as the access transistor gets smaller, it provides an increasingly large leakage path for the capacitor’s charge to drain away. This lowers the data retention time and requires DRAM cells to be refreshed more frequently – impacting the power consumption.In 2020, imec reported a novel DRAM bit cell concept that can solve these two issues in one go: a bit cell made up of two thin-film transistors (2T, one for read, one for write) and no capacitor (0C) [1]. The conduction channel of the thin-film transistors is composed of an oxide semiconductor, such as indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (IGZO). Due to its wide bandgap, IGZO-based transistors have an extremely low off current, benefitting the memory’s retention time, refresh rate, and power consumption. The longer retention time also relaxes the requirement for the storage capacitance, allowing the parasitic capacitance of the read transistor to take over the role of the storage element.In addition, fabricating an IGZO 2T0C bit cell is simpler and more cost-effective than traditional cells. Other than Si, IGZO material can be deposited at relatively low temperatures, making it compatible with back-end-of-line (BEOL) processing. This opens doors to new DRAM architectures. First, it allows the DRAM periphery – the logic transistors that enable the full functionality of the DRAM chip – to be moved under the DRAM memory array instead of residing next to it. This reduces the footprint of the DRAM memory chip and makes connections between the array and periphery more efficient. In this configuration, the 2T0C DRAM bit cells are integrated into the peri’s BEOL, which is allowed by the properties of the IGZO material.Second, the novel bit cell paves the way for stacked configurations, providing an additional increase in density. Either ‘2D’ or ‘true 3D’ stacking can be envisioned. With 2D stacking, several layers with ‘planar’ DRAM memory arrays are stacked on top of each other. With 3D stacking, the transistors that make up the 2T0C bit cell are stacked and monolithically integrated into vertically aligned plugs inspired by 3D NAND technology. The ability to deposit IGZO conformally in these high-aspect-ratio plugs, enabled by the technique of atomic layer deposition (ALD), is a key enabler of this 3D structure. These stacked configurations will help tear down the memory wall, allowing DRAM memories to continue playing a crucial role in data-intensive applications such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Implementing the two transistors on different levels (stacked 2T0C) has an additional benefit. A low-off-current oxide semiconductor channel is only fundamental in the write transistor to ensure long retention. For the read transistor, on current is the critical parameter, as it drives the read time, and high-mobility channel materials can be considered. The two transistors can thus be optimized separately.First ‘conceptual’ demonstration of an IGZO 2T0C DRAM bit cellAfter pioneering the concept, imec provided the first experimental demonstration of a functional 2T0C DRAM cell at the 2020 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) [1]. Thanks to a low (extracted) off current of 3x10-19A/µm, these first 2T0C DRAM cells exhibited a retention time >400s, about 1,000 times longer than typical DRAM refresh times. The results were obtained after scaling and optimizing IGZO-based thin-film transistors processed on 300mm wafers. Optimizations were directed towards suppressing the impact of oxygen and hydrogen defects, one of the main challenges for developing good-performing IGZO-based transistors. Optimized transistors with a 45nm gate length were then integrated into a 2T0C DRAM bit cell architecture, where the parasitic capacitance of the read transistor served as the storage element.Improving performance through bit cell engineering: an overviewNext, imec started to explore the knobs that allow the boosting of 2T0C DRAM density and improve performance and reliability metrics such as off current, data retention, endurance, on current, and threshold voltage (stability). In 2021 at IEDM, imec researchers presented a much-improved IGZO-based 2T0C DRAM bit cell with >1000s retention time and practically unlimited endurance (>1011 read and write cycles) with <10ns write time [2].These breakthrough results followed an optimization of the IGZO transistor’s material stack and integration scheme: a gate-last approach with buried oxygen tunnel and self-aligned contacts combined with a scaled gate dielectric (Al2O3) thickness. Implementing the buried oxide tunnel in combination with an anneal in an O2 ambient reduced the oxygen-vacancy concentration in the IGZO channel, benefitting on and off currents.This IGZO-DRAM technology set the stage for more aggressive DRAM scaling. The gate length of the IGZO transistor was scaled down to 14nm while still preserving >100s retention. The researchers also showed a variant of the 2T0C DRAM cell with much reduced IGZO layer thickness (5nm). This eliminated the need for an oxygen tunnel and O2 anneal step, leading to a simplified process flow. Imec also demonstrated functional transistors with conformally deposited thin IGZO channels (5nm, through ALD), a stepping stone towards 3D DRAM integration. [2]More recently, imec used the reactive ion etch (RIE) technique instead of the commonly used ion beam etch (IBE) for patterning the active module of the 2T0C transistor. RIE allows for patterning at tiny dimensions (sub-100nm) with limited damage, further reducing area consumption. Moreover, using these transistors in 2T0C DRAM bit cells led to a much-improved retention time of >4.5 hours, thanks to an effective suppression of extrinsic leakage paths on the sidewalls of the transistor [3].The potential of imec’s disruptive DRAM concept triggered interest from universities, research institutes, and companies worldwide. Several research groups started investigating other bit cell configurations, transistor performance ‘boosters,’ and alternative oxide semiconductor materials. For example, IMECAS (Institute of Microelectronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences), publishing about 2T0C IGZO DRAM since 2021, demonstrated an alternative 2T0C configuration to benefit multibit operation [4]. Later, they were the first to show transistors with a vertically integrated IGZO channel. The ability to monolithically stack the ‘vertical’ read and write transistors enables area-efficient 4F2 2D DRAM cell configurations (F being the minimum feature size for a given technology node) [5]. Macronix also implemented a 3D 2T0C bit cell with gate-around (GA) and channel-all-around (CAA) IGZO FETs [6]. Peking University optimized IGZO transistors based on material stack engineering, which enhanced 2T0C DRAM cell performance [7].Thin-film transistors with oxide semiconductor channel materials other than IGZO are also being considered. One promising material is W-doped indium oxide (IWO), as showcased by Notre Dame University [8]. Stanford University initially considered indium-tin-oxide (ITO) for 2T0C implementation [9]. In 2024, in collaboration with TSMC, they also used IWO to build an n-type thin-film transistor. In addition, they were the first to combine the IWO n-type transistor with a p-type transistor also made of an oxide semiconductor (tin-oxide (SnO) in this case) for improved performance and reduction of coupling effects [10]. Most oxide semiconductor transistors are inherently n-type, which is why 2T0C DRAM bit cells usually implement two n-type transistors, for reading and writing.The path to industry-viable IGZO-based 3D DRAM2T0C IGZO-DRAM has recently been added to the long-term DRAM technology roadmap, according to a 2024 report of Yole Intelligence. The technology is envisioned as one of the possible approaches toward a much-desired 3D DRAM. Moreover, the demand for AI on edge devices is expected to surge in the coming years, generating the need for high-density embedded DRAM (eDRAM). The capacitor-less IGZO-DRAM technology is a very attractive candidate for this application. Building on its pioneering activities, imec started developing BEOL-compatible eDRAM implementations.Yet, one key concern has made the memory industry hesitant to adopt IGZO-based DRAM technology: reliability. The n-type IGZO transistors mainly degrade because of the positive bias temperature instability (PBTI), which is manifested as an undesirable shift of the device threshold voltage and a decrease in the drain current. Worrisome is the hydrogen-related contribution to PBTI, a problem less familiar to the chip industry. Through the years, imec has made considerable progress in assessing, understanding, and modeling reliability failure, paving the way to building reliable IGZO transistors with a target lifetime of five years [11,12].This work has been enabled in part by the NanoIC pilot line. The acquisition and operation are jointly funded by the Chips Joint Undertaking, through the European Union’s Digital Europe (101183266) and Horizon Europe programs (101183277), as well as by the participating states Belgium (Flanders), France, Germany, Finland, Ireland and Romania.

			SANTA FE — Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and the New Mexico Early Childhood Education and Care Department announced a historic milestone on Monday: New Mexico will become the first state in the nation to guarantee no-cost universal child care starting Nov. 1.
This groundbreaking new initiative will make child care available to all New Mexicans, regardless of income, by removing income eligibility requirements from the state’s child care assistance program and continuing the waiver of family copayments.
“Child care is essential to family stability, workforce participation, and New Mexico’s future prosperity,” said Lujan Grisham. “By investing in universal child care, we are giving families financial relief, supporting our economy, and ensuring that every child has the opportunity to grow and thrive.”
This announcement fulfills the promise made by the governor and the New Mexico Legislature when they created the Early Childhood Education and Care Department in 2019. Since then, New Mexico has expanded access to no-cost child care to families with incomes at or below 400% of the federal poverty level, reducing financial strain on tens of thousands of families.
With Monday’s announcement universal child care will be extended to every family in the state, regardless of income. This amounts to an average annual family savings of $12,000 per child.
“New Mexico is creating the conditions for better outcomes in health, learning, and well-being,” said Neal Halfon, professor of pediatrics, public health and public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles, and director of the Center for Healthier Children, Families, and Communities. “Its approach is rooted in data, driven by communities, and becoming a model for the nation.
“By prioritizing public investments in early childhood educators, families, and children, New Mexico continues to lead the way in building a sustainable, affordable, and quality child care and early learning system that helps its communities and economy thrive,” said Michelle Kang, president and CEO of the National Association of the Education of Young Children (NAEYC). “Achieving universal child care will make a huge difference for the state’s children, families, businesses, and educators—and for all of us, by showing that it can be done.”
Families who receive child care assistance report greater financial stability, more time to focus on their children, and the ability to choose higher-quality care settings. Now, every family in New Mexico will have the same opportunity. New Mexico is also taking decisive action to build the supply of infant and toddler care statewide:

Establishing a $12.7 million low-interest loan fund to construct, expand, and renovate child care facilities, with an additional $20 million requested in the Fiscal Year 2027 budget.
Targeting growth to focus on care for infants, toddlers, low-income families, and children with special needs.
Partnering with employers and school districts to expand child care options for working families.
Launching a statewide campaign to recruit licensed and registered home providers.
To support providers, reimbursement rates will rise to reflect the true cost of care.

Programs that commit to paying entry-level staff a minimum of $18 per hour and offer 10 hours of care per day, five days a week, will receive an incentive rate. New Mexico estimates an additional 5,000 early childhood professionals are needed to fully achieve a universal system.
“Early childhood care and education is a public good,” said ECECD Sec. Elizabeth Groginsky. “By providing universal access and improving pay for our early childhood workforce, we are easing financial pressure on families, strengthening our economy, and helping every child learn in safe, nurturing environments. This is the kind of investment that builds equity today and prosperity for the future.”
With universal child care, New Mexico is leading the nation by showing that what is best for children and families is also the smartest investment for long-term prosperity—building a stronger future for every community in the state.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[20 min read20 hours ago--In late 2024, the head of the UN’s Gaza aid agency made a disturbing discovery: when people searched for his organization on Google, the top result wasn’t the agency’s own site — it was a paid ad placed by the Israeli government. The ad mimicked a UN website but actually linked to an Israeli government page accusing the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) of supporting terroists (wired.com). “The spread of misinformation & disinformation continues to be used as a weapon in the war in Gaza,” UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini warned, calling for investigations and stricter regulation of online propaganda (aljazeera.com). His alarm highlights a troubling new reality: digital advertising platforms have become battlefields for influence, where governments and political groups pay to sway public opinion in wars and crises.Traditional propaganda , think radio broadcasts, posters, state TV, has now gone high-tech. Platforms like Google Ads and Facebook (Meta) Ads allow paries to target specific audiences with tailored messages at massive scale. In theory, these companies have policies against hate speech or blatant lies. In practice, recent case studies show that sophisticated misinformation campaigns can exploit loopholes and lax enforcement, reaching millions of people with government-funded narratives. From the Israel–Palestine conflict to Russian and domestic political meddling, paid ads are being weaponized to promote war efforts, demonize opponents, and even undermine institutions like the UN. This article examines how it’s happening, why the platforms permit it, and what ethical and policy questions arise.Digital Propaganda via Paid Ads: A New Front in Information WarfarePaid advertising on Google and Facebook has become a potent tool for political persuasion or manipulation. Unlike organic social media posts (which rely on shares or algorithms), ads can guarantee visibility: if you pay, you reach your target. And the targeting can be extremely granular. Google Ads lets advertisers bid on search keywords or place banner/video ads on websites and YouTube, often filtered by geography or audience interests. Facebook/Meta’s ad system enables micro-targeting by demographics, location, and user interests, while requiring a “paid for by” disclaimer on political ads for transparency. In theory, this gives legitimate political campaigns a way to reach supporters , but it equally gives propagandists a direct channel to the eyeballs of a chosen populace.Researchers note that this capacity can be abused by partisan or state actors to “manipulate or distract citizens with misinformation and government propaganda,” posing serious challenges to democracy (academic.oup.com). A notorious early example was Russia’s Internet Research Agency, which in 2016 created hundreds of fake Facebook accounts and purchased at least $100,000 worth of divisive ads to influence the U.S. election (abcnews.go.com). Many of those ads didn’t mention candidates directly; instead they amplified polarizing messages on issues like immigration and race to inflame social tensions. At the time, Facebook admitted that most of these propaganda ads “did not violate any company policies or laws,” underscoring how unprepared the platform’s rules were (abcnews.go.com). The incident sparked global awareness that paid media ads could be used as a propaganda weapon , and led to new transparency measures like Facebook’s Ads Library.Yet, increased transparency hasn’t prevented the tactic from evolving. Recent conflicts show governments openly turning to ad campaigns as part of their information warfare strategy. Paid ads can be launched rapidly, scaled globally, and tailored to undermine an opponent or shape public perception of a war. Crucially, they also allow a state to influence foreign publics, beyond its own borders, often skirting the line of platform policies and international norms. The sections below explore a timely case study and the broader implications.Case Study: Israel’s Paid Propaganda Campaign in the Gaza WarOne of the clearest illustrations of war propaganda via paid ads is the Israeli government’s online advertising blitz during the 2023–2025 Gaza war. Israel has long engaged in hasbara (Hebrew for “explanation”), a term for state public relations efforts or propaganda (smex.org). But since the war in Gaza, Israel’s use of digital ads has intensified to unprecedented levels (smex.org).Targeting the UN: Google Ads to Discredit HumanitariansIn mid-January 2024, staff at UNRWA USA (a U.S.-based fundraising affiliate of the UN agency) noticed something strange: Google searches for “UNRWA” were yielding an ad that looked like it was from UNRWA, but actually led to an Israeli government site (wired.com). Upon investigation, they discovered a months-long Google Ads campaign by the Israeli Government Advertising Agency to discredit UNRWA (wired.com). The Israeli ads, which were clearly labeled as such in Google’s transparency data, appeared on searches for over 300 related keywords, from “UNRWA” to “Gaza aid”, effectively hijacking traffic from people seeking the UN agency (wired.com). The content of the ads and the landing pages was unmistakably propagandistic: the Israeli site alleged that UNRWA was “inseparable from Hamas” and even employed terrorists (wired.com). One ad bluntly asked, “Paychecks for terrorists or humanitarian aid?”, suggesting money given to UNRWA would fund armed militants (abc.net.au).The aim of this campaign was clear: to cut off support and donations to the UN’s relief agency in Gaza. It came at a critical time, as UNRWA was providing life-saving food, water, and medical care to Palestinians under siege. UNRWA’s chief, Philippe Lazzarini, blasted Israel’s actions as a “deliberate disinformation campaign” to “dismantle the agency”, warning that smearing a humanitarian organization not only hurts its reputation but “puts the lives of our colleagues on the frontline at serious risk” (abc.net.au). In essence, Israeli authorities were using Google’s advertising system to undermine a UN institution in the middle of a humanitarian crisis.Google’s response was relatively hands-off. When UNRWA representatives appealed to Google to stop what they saw as a dangerous misinformation campaign, the company did not immediately take down the ads (wired.com). A Google spokesperson defended that any government may run ads on Google as long as they adhere to our policies, and stated that Google enforces those rules “consistently and without bias” (wired.com). In other words, because the Israeli ads did not overtly violate Google’s ad policies, they were allowed to run. Notably, Google’s ad policies do prohibit misrepresentation, but they do not have a blanket ban on misinformation unless it relates to specific sensitive areas like election integrity (gomixte.com). As Wired reported, Google generally permits questionable claims in ads “unless it undermines participation or trust in an electoral process” (gomixte.com). This loophole meant that propaganda undermining a humanitarian agency , while arguably unethical , wasn’t against the rules.The result: Israel’s anti-UNRWA ads often outcompeted the agency’s own Google ads. From May through July 2024, in head-to-head bidding, the Israeli ads won the top slot 44% of the time (versus UNRWA USA’s ads showing 34% of the time) (wired.com). UNRWA’s team had to spend tens of thousands of donor dollars trying to outbid Israel for visibility (wired.com). This “insidious” campaign, as UNRWA called it, exposed countless Americans and others to one-sided allegations just as they were searching for facts about Gaza relief (wired.com). “I want the public to know what’s happening,” said UNRWA USA director Mara Kronenfeld, “especially at a time when civilian lives are under attack in Gaza” (wired.com).By late 2024, news investigations across the world had caught on. ABC News in Australia found that those same Israeli ads linking UNRWA to Hamas were appearing on major Australian news sites, served via Google’s display network (abc.net.au). The ads featured a masked militant wearing both the Hamas emblem and an UNRWA headband, visually equating the UN agency with a terror group (abc.net.au). Captions like “UNRWA has alternatives, it must be replaced” were shown next to news articles (abc.net.au). ABC confirmed at least eight such ad variants were targeted specifically at Australian audiences (in English) and noted the campaign ran in multiple languages including German, Italian, French, and Spanish (abc.net.au). This truly was a global propaganda ad campaign, orchestrated by a government via Google’s platforms.UNRWA officials, upon learning of the global ads, reiterated that these tactics were “a wider disinformation campaign” by Israel to cripple the agency (abc.net.au). Despite criticism from UN allies (Australia’s Foreign Minister called Israel’s actions “reprehensible” and urged them to stop undermining UNRWA (abc.net.au), the Israeli government showed no signs of relenting. It even escalated measures offline, banning UNRWA operations in Israel, as the online ad offensive continued (abc.net.au)A coordinated ad push against the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF)Alongside the UNRWA campaign, the Israeli Government Advertising Agency has also targeted the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF), an EU-based human-rights nonprofit founded in 2024 to pursue accountability for alleged war crimes in Gaza and named in honor of five-year-old Hind Rajab, whose death became emblematic of the conflict (Hind Rajab Foundation). In Google’s Ads Transparency Center, the agency’s account shows creatives such as “Hind Rajab Foundation — HRF’s disturbing reality” that click through to a government microsite titled “Unmasking the Hind Rajab Foundation,” which portrays HRF as a pseudo-legal front with “extremist” ties (Ads Transparency Center, 2025; Government of Israel). Reporting on Israel’s recent $45 million placement with Google further notes that several ads explicitly link to this “Unmasking” report, indicating a coordinated effort to discredit HRF across search and display (Drop Site News). For context, HRF’s public materials frame the organization as a legal accountability initiative, while the story of Hind Rajab has gained global visibility through Kaouther Ben Hania’s Venice-premiering film The Voice of Hind Rajab, backed by high-profile producers including Brad Pitt, Joaquin Phoenix, Rooney Mara, and Jonathan Glazer, which has amplified awareness of the case well beyond activist circles (Reuters).Flooding Social Media with War NarrativesThe attack on UNRWA was just one facet of Israel’s broader digital PR war. Israeli agencies and allied groups pumped out hundreds of ads across Google/YouTube, Facebook/Instagram, and even children’s gaming apps to influence public opinion about the Gaza conflict. David Saranga, head of the Israeli Foreign Ministry’s digital bureau, confirmed that “the footage is part of a larger advocacy drive” in which the ministry spent $15 million on internet ads in just the first few weeks after October 7, 2023 (smex.org). Those ads often contained graphic and emotional imagery, for example, violent scenes and frightened Israeli families, even appearing as pop-ups in kids’ online games, where they left children “shocked and disturbed” (smex.org). Reuters journalists observed some of these graphic video ads playing in European video games used by children, raising serious questions about appropriateness and consent (business-humanrights.org).On Meta’s platforms (Facebook and Instagram), pro-Israel advertising also spiked dramatically. One effort led by a group calling itself “Facts for Peace” spent over $370,000 on Facebook/Instagram ads in a single month (November 2023) to push viral videos framing all support for Palestine as support for Hamas (business-humanrights.org). These ads, which amassed over 21 million views, were crafted to equate the Palestinian cause with barbaric violence. Despite the obviously misleading and inflammatory nature of such content, it spread widely: it was even promoted by right-wing influencers like Ben Shapiro and shared by official Israeli government social media (e.g. the Israeli embassy in Chile) (business-humanrights.org). Meta’s Ad Library showed 213 ads from Facts for Peace, of which only 3 were taken down for policy violations (business-humanrights.org). Meta told investigators that the campaign did not technically break their rules on transparency, since the ads carried a “Paid for by Facts for Peace” disclaimer and the page was authorized for political advertising. However, nowhere did the group disclose its true funding sources or organizers. (Journalists later linked it to a U.S. billionaire funding pro-Israel messaging (business-humanrights.org.) This case shows how easy it is for a new, opaque group to launch a massive political ad campaign and reach millions before anyone can fully scrutinize it.Israeli government entities themselves also ran extensive campaigns on social media. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs launched at least 75 distinct ads on YouTube alone in the first months of the war (smex.org). Some of these ads featured what observers called incitement to violence. In one video ad, a menacing message declared: “Israel will take every measure necessary to protect our citizens against these barbaric terrorists,” which borders on a call to collective violence (smex.org). YouTube’s political ads policy forbids content that “encourages others to commit violent acts,” yet this ad apparently slipped through (smex.org). On X (formerly Twitter), the Israeli government and military accounts also placed promoted posts with graphic images (e.g. charred buildings and victims), urging support for their military actions (smex.org). Such ads would seem to violate X’s pre-existing ban on state-affiliated media buying ads (a policy originally aimed at propaganda from outlets like Russia’s RT). Nonetheless, these promotions ran, and some critics questioned if Elon Musk’s open support for Israel influenced X’s lax enforcement (smex.org).By early 2025, reports revealed that Israel had even formalized a multi-million dollar contract with Google to sustain its global propaganda offensive. According to investigative reporting by Drop Site News (and cited by outlets like TRT World), the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office signed a $45 million, six-month deal with Google in June 2025 to run a worldwide advertising blitz downplaying the humanitarian crisis in Gaza (trtworld.com). The campaign kicked off just after Israeli authorities imposed a siege cutting off food, fuel, and medicine to Gaza in March 2025, and as officials worried about “the public relations fallout”. Leaked documents described Google as a “key entity” in Netanyahu’s PR strategy (trtworld.com). Sure enough, soon after, YouTube and display ads proclaiming “there is food in Gaza. Any other claim is a lie” flooded the internet, with one such video, produced by Israel’s Foreign Ministry, racking up over 6 million views via paid promotion (trtworld.com). In effect, Google was being directly paid to broadcast the message that reports of starvation in Gaza were false, despite widespread documentation of severe hunger by the UN and NGOs. Israeli propaganda officials openly characterized these efforts as “hasbara” — literally “propaganda” — in internal communications (trtworld.com). Alongside Google, Israel spent another $3 million on ads on X (Twitter) and $2.1 million on other ad networks to bolster its narrative (trtworld.com).The impact of Israel’s ad campaign is hard to quantify, but it undoubtedly reached broad swathes of the global public with the government’s perspective. By framing its military operations as justified self-defense and its critics (even humanitarian agencies) as terrorist sympathizers, Israel’s paid ads sought to shore up international support and neutralize opposition. Given that Israel’s security and billions in military aid depend on Western public opinion (smex.org), this digital influence strategy was a logical extension of the war itself. However, it came at the cost of injecting misinformation and extreme bias into the information ecosystem, potentially skewing public perceptions and policy debates. As we’ll see next, this case also exposes worrying gaps in platform policies and ethical oversight.Policy Gaps, Double Standards, and Ethical DilemmasThe use of paid ads for propaganda raises a blunt question: Are Google and Meta actually enforcing their own rules when it comes to wartime disinformation? The evidence from the above case suggests significant gaps and inconsistencies. Despite formal policies against harmful or misleading content, both companies’ systems enabled, and profited from, campaigns that arguably violate the spirit, if not the letter, of those rules.Google’s laissez-faire approach to misinformation: Google’s advertising policies forbid certain categories of content (hate speech, explicit incitement to violence, etc.) and ban misrepresenting who you are. But they do not outright ban false or misleading claims in ads except in narrow contexts like election integrity or COVID-19 info (gomixte.com). This is why blatant propaganda, e.g. accusing a UN agency of abetting terror with scant evidence, can pass muster on Google Ads. Google relied on users or affected parties to report problematic ads, and stated it would “take swift action” if actual policy violations were found (wired.com). But in practice, Google did not pro-actively vet the truth of Israeli government claims. The company was, after all, in a business relationship with Israel (not to mention the formal $45M deal) and may have been reluctant to police a powerful client’s messaging beyond basic checks. This hands-off stance highlights a moral gray area: allowing a paying customer to spread potentially dangerous misinformation because it doesn’t fit neatly into a prohibited category. It suggests that platform policy enforcement can be very literal and reactive, leaving ethical judgment by the wayside.Meta’s inconsistent enforcement and transparency issues: Facebook/Meta, on paper, has more expansive rules for political ads. They require identity verification for political advertisers and mandate a “Paid for by [Name]” disclosure on each ad. Certain types of violent or hateful content are disallowed even in ads. In the Israel–Gaza context, however, these rules were enforced unevenly. Meta’s own Ads Library data shows a bias: when ads violated policies (e.g. contained hate speech or graphic violence), pro-Palestinian ads were taken down faster and more frequently than pro-Israeli ads (smex.org). SMEX’s analysis of thousands of ads found that Israeli war-cheerleading ads often remained live longer despite breaking rules, whereas ads calling for Gaza humanitarian aid got removed with stricter urgency (smex.org). For example, the “Facts for Peace” videos that implied all Palestinian supporters endorse terror arguably constituted hateful generalization, yet most stayed up until their paid run ended. Meanwhile, at least one civil society test in late 2023 found that Facebook approved ads containing explicit hate speech calling for violence against Palestinians, indicating failures in the automated moderation system (business-humanrights.org). Meta responded that it prioritizes transparency — pointing to the existence of the Ad Library — but researchers found the library frustratingly opaque. Some ads that clearly ran were missing from public search, and crucial data like why an ad was removed or who exactly was targeted were absent (smex.org). Meta shut down useful tools like CrowdTangle (which helped monitor content virality) in 2024, hampering independent oversight (smex.org). All of this suggests that Meta’s professed neutrality masks a deeply flawed system, where enforcement can be influenced by political sensitivities or errors, and where the company’s profit motive in selling ads may conflict with taking decisive action against harmful content.Double standards for different conflicts: A striking contrast can be seen in how platforms treated Russian state propaganda versus Israeli state propaganda. During Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western tech firms took an unusually hard line against Russia’s online influence operations. Meta banned Russian state media outlets from running ads or monetizing content on its platform and demoted their posts (smex.org). It also aggressively labeled or removed Russian disinformation about the war, under heavy pressure from governments and public opinion. Google similarly demonetized Russian state-affiliated channels (like RT) and limited their reach. These steps were lauded as Big Tech taking a stand against wartime disinformation. Yet, when it came to Israel, engaging in similar behavior, the response was far more lenient. No blanket bans or demonetization were applied to Israeli state entities pushing propaganda, even though some of their content arguably violated the same principles (for instance, denying documented human suffering in Gaza, or using dehumanizing language about “barbaric terrorists” broadly). Observers have pointed out this double standard, noting that platforms seemed willing to bend rules or look the other way for a U.S.-aligned government (smex.org). This inconsistency not only undermines the credibility of platform policies but also raises geopolitical questions: are ethical standards being applied universally, or only when convenient?Violations of international norms: Beyond platform rules, there’s an argument that some of these ad campaigns tread on international ethical standards or even laws. For example, deliberately spreading false information to obstruct humanitarian aid (as Israel’s anti-UNRWA ads aimed to do) could be seen as running counter to International Humanitarian Law, which seeks to protect aid efforts and civilians during conflict. Incitement to violence against a population is outlawed under the Genocide Convention and other treaties — and while social media ads we’ve discussed stop short of explicit incitement, they foment hatred and misunderstanding that can fuel violence. The UN Secretary-General and other officials have repeatedly condemned the weaponization of disinformation in conflict settings, calling it “destructive” and urging tech companies to clamp down (wired.com) (aljazeera.com). Allowing a state to pay to propagate one-sided or false narratives undermining a UN agency could be seen as abetting an attack on that international institution’s integrity. These are largely uncharted waters, there’s no clear international law for “information warfare”, but the ethical condemnation is growing. As Lazzarini implored, such campaigns “should stop and be investigated”, and social media firms must do more to combat disinformation and hate speech in war (aljazeera.com).All these issues point back to the central dilemma: What responsibility do the tech giants have when their advertising tools are used to spread propaganda or inflame conflicts? If they act as neutral carriers, they risk facilitating harm; if they intervene, they become arbiters of truth in explosive political situations. The next section looks at how Google, Meta, and others have responded, or failed to respond, and what more could be done.The Responsibility of Tech Companies in Wartime PropagandaMajor tech companies often insist they are platforms, not publishers, they provide the space, but aren’t responsible for every message that advertisers choose to push. However, the extreme examples we’ve explored put that claim to the test. When a company is paid millions to disseminate content that may be false or harmful, can it really wash its hands of accountability? Here are some considerations and responses from the companies and experts:Official stances and defenses: Google’s official line, as noted, is that it applies its ad policies equally to all, including governments, and will remove ads that violate those policies (wired.com). Implicit in that statement is that Google does not see itself as the arbiter of factual truth in ads, unless a lie crosses certain predefined lines, Google will host it for a paying client. Meta, for its part, touts the transparency of its system. A Meta spokesperson, responding to concerns about the “Facts for Peace” campaign, emphasized that the ads were “clearly labeled with a ‘paid by’ disclaimer” and publicly archived in the Ads Library, implying that this level of transparency exceeds that of TV or print political ads (business-humanrights.org). Meta also points out that it has an Ad Standards enforcement team and that ads violating policies (when caught) are taken down and documented. In practice, as we saw, that enforcement can lag or falter — but the company’s message is that shining light on ads is the solution, rather than heavy-handed censorship.Profit vs. principle: Critics argue that a big reason these platforms struggle to self-regulate is that they make money from every ad impression. When conflict-related content goes viral, ad spending surges. A joint analysis by CalMatters and The Markup found that after war broke out in Gaza on Oct 7, 2023, Meta saw a major increase in ad revenue related to the conflict (calmatters.org). In October 2023 alone, an estimated $3.1 million was spent on Facebook ads about the Israel–Gaza war, a huge spike compared to previous months (calmatters.org). This includes not just state propaganda but also ads for fundraising, merchandise, and advocacy around the crisis. The point is that war and political violence can become lucrative business for social media companies, something Meta’s own employees have acknowledged internally (Facebook famously admitted that outrage and misinformation drive engagement, which in turn drives ad revenue (calmatters.org). This profit motive can create a perverse disincentive to crack down on borderline content. While $3 million is a drop in the bucket of Meta’s $100+ billion annual revenue, it’s still revenue. And for Google, a $45 million contract from Israel’s government is significant. The companies risk accusations of “conflict profiteering” if they appear to take money to propagate one side’s propaganda. This has led to calls for them to refuse or refund ad buys that clearly aim to deceive or stoke conflict, though such moves remain rare.Calls for stronger policies: Human rights organizations and digital rights groups are urging the platforms to develop special policies for ads in conflict zones or on politically sensitive issues. For instance, SMEX and others have suggested that in the context of an armed conflict, platforms should implement tailored rules to prevent the spread of hate speech and misinformation via ads, given the real-world stakes (smex.org). Concretely, this could mean temporarily banning state-run or state-funded advertising in active conflict situations, or at least subjecting them to human review and fact-checking. It could also mean disallowing ads that target foreign populations with war propaganda, treating it akin to foreign election interference. Another idea floated by experts is a “circuit breaker” approach: if a sudden war or crisis erupts, platforms might pause all political and issue-based ads in the affected regions until they can ramp up oversight. (Notably, Meta has recently decided to halt all political, electoral, and social issue ads in the entire EU starting in 2025, in response to new regulations (about.fb.com). This broad-brush ban is a compliance move for Europe, but it shows that turning off political ads is technically feasible when mandated.)Transparency and researcher access: Many observers argue that if companies won’t ban propaganda ads outright, they should at least empower watchdogs to track and expose them. This means improving their ad transparency tools. Meta’s shutting down of CrowdTangle and the limitations of the Ads Library have drawn heavy criticism (smex.orgsmex.org). Experts like Sam Jeffers of Who Targets Me advocate for more robust disclosures — for example, revealing detailed targeting parameters of political ads (so we know who governments are trying to influence) and keeping archives of removed ads including why they were removed (business-humanrights.org) (smex.org). There are also calls for independent audits of platform algorithms and ad delivery, to see if certain viewpoints are getting amplified unfairly. Ultimately, greater transparency can help civil society and journalists “police” the propaganda if the platforms themselves are slow to do so.Regulatory pressure and international standards: Governments and international bodies are starting to weigh in. The European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) and upcoming regulations on political advertising put legal requirements on big platforms to prevent misuse. For example, the DSA requires rapid removal of illegal content (which could include illegal hate speech or incitement in ads) and hefty fines for non-compliance. The EU is also pushing for strict transparency on political ads and even contemplating banning microtargeting for political messages. These rules, though EU-specific, often end up being adopted globally by platforms for simplicity’s sake. Outside of Europe, the lack of regulation has been evident, which is why UN officials like Lazzarini are directly calling for “more regulations for companies… to combat disinformation and hate speech” online (aljazeera.com). We may see moves in the UN or other international forums to establish norms against certain propaganda techniques. In the long run, if self-regulation fails, tech companies might face binding rules prohibiting them from accepting money for ads that undermine peace and truth, a challenging rule to draft, but an increasingly pertinent conversation.ConclusionThe era of governments weaponizing Google and Facebook ads is upon us, raising thorny questions about truth, free speech, and corporate responsibility in the digital age. The case of Israel’s advertising blitz in the Gaza war demonstrates how easily paid platforms can be turned into tools of war propaganda, blasting millions with biased or false narratives at the click of a button. It also shows the real harms at stake: humanitarian aid blocked, democratic institutions undermined, and public discourse polluted. And Israel is not alone, from superpowers to militant groups, many actors have tested the boundaries of online ads to sway hearts and minds.For the platforms, this is a moment of reckoning. Can Google and Meta continue to say “we’re just the middleman” while cashing checks for propaganda campaigns? Critics argue that neutrality is not neutral when it enables deception and violence. Yet, deciding where to draw the line is complex. Mistakes or overreach in moderation could themselves be seen as partisan interference. The tightrope between allowing robust political advocacy and preventing harmful propaganda is a difficult one to walk, especially under global scrutiny.What is clear is that doing nothing is no longer tenable. Sunlight and accountability are the minimum: users deserve to know who is behind the political ads they see and to have confidence that egregious lies or incitements won’t be promoted by the world’s most powerful information platforms. Moving forward, it will likely require a mix of solutions , improved self-governance by tech firms, independent oversight, and smart regulation, to ensure that the tools of modern advertising are not abused to foment conflict or erode democracy. As the saying goes, “In war, truth is the first casualty.” In our digital world, we must decide how much we are willing to let paid algorithms hasten that casualty, or whether we can find ways to uphold truth even amid the fog of online war.Sources:Google involved in $45M deal with Netanyahu’s office to advertise Israeli hasbara — report — TRT World https://www.trtworld.com/world/article/538017f344e5Israel Is Buying Google Ads to Discredit the UN’s Top Gaza Aid Agency | WIRED https://www.wired.com/story/israel-unrwa-usa-hamas-google-search-ads/UNRWA head accuses Israel of buying Google ads to block donations to agency | UNRWA News | Al Jazeera https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/31/unrwa-head-accuses-israel-of-buying-google-ads-to-block-donations-to-agencyMass Political Information on Social Media: Facebook Ads … https://academic.oup.com/jeea/article/22/4/1678/7607367Facebook says it sold $100,000 in ads to fake Russian accounts during presidential election — ABC News https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/facebook-sold-100000-ads-fake-russian-accounts-presidential/story?id=49667831Inside the Israeli occupation’s propaganda ad factory — SMEX https://smex.org/inside-the-israeli-occupations-propaganda-ad-factory/Google ads linking UNRWA with Hamas appearon Australian news websites as part of a global campaign — ABC News https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-12-05/unrwa-hamas-google-ads-published-on-australian-news-sites/104685074How Google Ads Are Weaponized — Mixte Communications https://gomixte.com/blog/how-google-ads-are-weaponized/Palestine/Israel: Viral campaign ads attacking proPalestine movement points to concerning gaps in Meta rules; incl. co. comment — Business & Human Rights Resource Centre https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/palestineisrael-viral-campaign-ads-attacking-pro-palestine-movementpoints-to-concerning-gaps-in-meta-rules-incl-co-comment/When Transparency Fails: Meta’s Political Ad Policy During Israel’s War on Gaza — SMEX https://smex.org/when-transparency-fails-metas-political-ad-policy-during-israels-war-on-gaza/How Meta brings in millions off political violence — CalMatters https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2024/10/how-meta-brings-in-millions-off-political-violence/Ending Political, Electoral and Social Issue Advertising in the EU in … https://about.fb.com/news/2025/07/ending-political-electoral-and-social-issue-advertising-in-the-eu/Ads Transparency Center.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hallucination Risk Calculator & Prompt Re-engineering Toolkit (OpenAI-only)
Post-hoc calibration without retraining for large language models. This toolkit turns a raw prompt into:

a bounded hallucination risk using the Expectation-level Decompression Law (EDFL), and
a decision to ANSWER or REFUSE under a target SLA, with transparent math (nats).

It supports two deployment modes:

Evidence-based: prompts include evidence/context; rolling priors are built by erasing that evidence.
Closed-book: prompts have no evidence; rolling priors are built by semantic masking of entities/numbers/titles.

All scoring relies only on the OpenAI Chat Completions API. No retraining required.

Install & Setup
pip install --upgrade openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

The module uses openai>=1.0.0 and the Chat Completions API (e.g., gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini).


Core Mathematical Framework
The EDFL Principle
Let the binary event $\mathcal{A}$ be the thing you want to guarantee (e.g., Answer in decision mode, or Correct for factual accuracy).
Build an ensemble of content-weakened prompts (the rolling priors) ${S_k}_{k=1}^m$. For the realized label $y$, estimate:


Information budget:
$$\bar{\Delta} = \tfrac{1}{m}\sum_k \mathrm{clip}_+(\log P(y) - \log S_k(y), B)$$
(one-sided clipping; default $B=12$ nats to prevent outliers while maintaining conservative bounds).


Prior masses: $q_k = S_k(\mathcal{A})$, with:


$\bar{q}=\tfrac{1}{m}\sum_k q_k$ (average prior for EDFL bound)

$q_{\text{lo}}=\min_k q_k$ (worst-case prior for SLA gating)



By EDFL, the achievable reliability is bounded by:
$$\bar{\Delta} \ge \mathrm{KL}(\mathrm{Ber}(p) | \mathrm{Ber}(\bar{q})) \Rightarrow p\le p_{\max}(\bar{\Delta},\bar{q})$$
Thus the hallucination risk (error) is bounded by $\overline{\mathrm{RoH}} \le 1 - p_{\max}$.
Decision Rule (SLA Gating)
For target hallucination rate $h^*$:


Bits-to-Trust: $\mathrm{B2T} = \mathrm{KL}(\mathrm{Ber}(1-h^*) | \mathrm{Ber}(q_{\text{lo}}))$


Information Sufficiency Ratio: $\mathrm{ISR} = \bar{\Delta}/\mathrm{B2T}$


ANSWER iff $\mathrm{ISR}\ge 1$ and $\bar{\Delta} \ge \mathrm{B2T} + \text{margin}$ (default margin≈0.2 nats)


Why two priors? The gate uses worst-case $q_{\text{lo}}$ for strict SLA compliance. The RoH bound uses average $\bar{q}$ per EDFL theory. This dual approach ensures conservative safety while providing realistic risk bounds.


Understanding System Behavior
Expected Behavioral Patterns
The toolkit exhibits different behaviors across query types, which is mathematically consistent with the framework:
Simple Arithmetic Queries
Observation: May abstain despite apparent simplicity
Explanation:

Models often attempt answers even with masked numbers (pattern recognition)
This yields low information lift $\bar{\Delta} \approx 0$ between full prompt and skeletons
Despite potentially low EDFL risk bound, worst-case prior gate triggers abstention (ISR < 1)

Named-Entity Factoids
Observation: Generally answered with confidence
Explanation:

Masking entities/dates substantially reduces answer propensity in skeletons
Restoring these yields large $\bar{\Delta}$ that clears B2T threshold
System answers with tight EDFL risk bound

This is not a bug but a feature: The framework prioritizes safety through worst-case guarantees while providing realistic average-case bounds.
Mitigation Strategies


Switch Event Measurement

Use Correct/Incorrect instead of Answer/Refuse for factual QA
Skeletons without key information rarely yield correct results → large $\bar{\Delta}$




Enhance Skeleton Weakening

Implement mask-aware decision head that refuses on redaction tokens
Ensures skeletons have strictly lower "Answer" mass than full prompt



Calibration Adjustments

Relax $h^*$ slightly (e.g., 0.10 instead of 0.05) for higher answer rates
Reduce margin for less conservative gating
Increase sampling ($n=7-10$) for stability



Provide Evidence

Adding compact, relevant evidence increases $\bar{\Delta}$ while preserving bounds




Two Ways to Build Rolling Priors
1) Evidence-based (when you have context)

Prompt contains a field like Evidence: (or JSON keys)
Skeletons erase the evidence content but preserve structure and roles; then permute blocks deterministically (seeded)
Decision head: "Answer only if the provided evidence is sufficient; otherwise refuse."

Example
from scripts.hallucination_toolkit import OpenAIBackend, OpenAIItem, OpenAIPlanner

backend = OpenAIBackend(model="gpt-4o-mini")
prompt = (
    """Task: Answer strictly based on the evidence below.
Question: Who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2019?
Evidence:
- Nobel Prize press release (2019): James Peebles (1/2); Michel Mayor & Didier Queloz (1/2).
Constraints: If evidence is insufficient or conflicting, refuse.
"""
)
item = OpenAIItem(
    prompt=prompt, 
    n_samples=5, 
    m=6, 
    fields_to_erase=["Evidence"], 
    skeleton_policy="auto"
)
planner = OpenAIPlanner(backend, temperature=0.3)
metrics = planner.run(
    [item], 
    h_star=0.05, 
    isr_threshold=1.0, 
    margin_extra_bits=0.2, 
    B_clip=12.0, 
    clip_mode="one-sided"
)
for m in metrics: 
    print(f"Decision: {'ANSWER' if m.decision_answer else 'REFUSE'}")
    print(f"Rationale: {m.rationale}")
2) Closed-book (no evidence)

Prompt has no evidence
Skeletons apply semantic masking of:

Multi-word proper nouns (e.g., "James Peebles" → "[…]")
Years (e.g., "2019" → "[…]")
Numbers (e.g., "3.14" → "[…]")
Quoted spans (e.g., '"Nobel Prize"' → "[…]")


Masking strengths: Progressive levels (0.25, 0.35, 0.5, 0.65, 0.8, 0.9) across skeleton ensemble
Mask-aware decision head refuses if redaction tokens appear or key slots look missing

Example
from scripts.hallucination_toolkit import OpenAIBackend, OpenAIItem, OpenAIPlanner

backend = OpenAIBackend(model="gpt-4o-mini")
item = OpenAIItem(
    prompt="Who won the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics?",
    n_samples=7,  # More samples for stability
    m=6,          # Number of skeletons
    skeleton_policy="closed_book"
)
planner = OpenAIPlanner(backend, temperature=0.3, q_floor=None)
metrics = planner.run(
    [item], 
    h_star=0.05,           # Target max 5% hallucination
    isr_threshold=1.0,     # Standard ISR gate
    margin_extra_bits=0.2, # Safety margin in nats
    B_clip=12.0,          # Clipping bound
    clip_mode="one-sided" # Conservative clipping
)
for m in metrics: 
    print(f"Decision: {'ANSWER' if m.decision_answer else 'REFUSE'}")
    print(f"Δ̄={m.delta_bar:.4f}, B2T={m.b2t:.4f}, ISR={m.isr:.3f}")
    print(f"EDFL RoH bound={m.roh_bound:.3f}")
Tuning knobs (closed-book):


n_samples=5–7 and temperature≈0.3 stabilize priors

q_floor (Laplace by default: $1/(n+2)$) prevents worst-case prior collapse to 0
Adjust masking strength levels if a task family remains too answerable under masking


API Surface
Core Classes

OpenAIBackend(model, api_key=None) – wraps Chat Completions API
OpenAIItem(prompt, n_samples=5, m=6, fields_to_erase=None, skeleton_policy="auto") – one evaluation item
OpenAIPlanner(backend, temperature=0.5, q_floor=None) – runs evaluation:

run(items, h_star, isr_threshold, margin_extra_bits, B_clip=12.0, clip_mode="one-sided") -> List[ItemMetrics]
aggregate(items, metrics, alpha=0.05, h_star, ...) -> AggregateReport



Helper Functions

make_sla_certificate(report, model_name) – creates formal SLA certificate
save_sla_certificate_json(cert, path) – exports certificate for audit
generate_answer_if_allowed(backend, item, metric) – only emits answer if decision was ANSWER

ItemMetrics Fields
Every ItemMetrics includes:


delta_bar: Information budget (nats)

q_conservative: Worst-case prior $q_{\text{lo}}$


q_avg: Average prior $\bar{q}$


b2t: Bits-to-Trust requirement

isr: Information Sufficiency Ratio

roh_bound: EDFL hallucination risk bound

decision_answer: Boolean decision

rationale: Human-readable explanation

meta: Dict with q_list, S_list_y, P_y, closed_book, etc.


Calibration & Validation
Validation Set Calibration
On a labeled validation set:


Sweep the margin parameter from 0 to 1 nats
For each margin, compute:

Empirical hallucination rate among answered items
Wilson upper bound at 95% confidence



Select smallest margin where Wilson upper bound ≤ target $h^*$ (e.g., 5%)

Freeze policy: $(h^*, \tau, \text{margin}, B, \text{clip_mode}, m, r, \text{skeleton_policy})$


Portfolio Reporting
The toolkit provides comprehensive metrics:

Answer/abstention rates
Empirical hallucination rate + Wilson bound
Distribution of per-item EDFL RoH bounds
Worst-case and median risk bounds
Complete audit trail


Practical Considerations
Choosing the Right Event
The default event is the decision $\mathcal{A} = {\text{Answer}}$. However:



Task Type
Recommended Event
Rationale




Factual QA
Correct/Incorrect
Directly measures hallucination


Decision Support
Answer/Refuse
Measures confidence to respond


Creative Writing
Answer/Refuse
Correctness often undefined



For tasks where skeletons still trigger answers frequently (causing $\bar{\Delta}\approx0$), switching to Correctness event with task-specific grading dramatically improves performance.
Common Issues & Solutions
Issue: $\bar{\Delta} = 0$ with $\overline{\mathrm{RoH}} \approx 0$

Not a contradiction! The gate uses worst-case $q_{\text{lo}}$; the bound uses average $\bar{q}$.

Solution: Increase n_samples, lower decision temperature, ensure skeletons truly weaken the event

Issue: Hit a low $\bar{\Delta}$ ceiling
Cause: Clipping may be too aggressive

Solution: Increase B_clip (default 12) and use clip_mode="one-sided"

Issue: Arithmetic still refuses
Cause: Pattern recognition allows answers even with masked numbers

Solutions:

Switch to Correctness event
Reduce masking strength for numbers on subset of skeletons
Provide worked examples as evidence



Issue: Prior collapse ($q_{\text{lo}} \to 0$)
Cause: All skeletons strongly refuse


Solution: Apply prior floor (default Laplace: $1/(n+2)$) or use quantile prior

Use $n \ge 5$ samples per variant
Keep temperature $\in [0.2, 0.5]$ for decision head
Lower temperature → more stable priors



Skeleton ensemble:

Use $m \ge 6$ skeletons
Ensure diversity in masking strengths
Verify skeletons are meaningfully weaker



Clipping strategy:

Always use one-sided clipping for conservative bounds
Set $B \ge 10$ nats to avoid artificial ceilings
Monitor clipping frequency in logs

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[You too can run malware from NPM (I mean without consequences)
Phishing NPM package authors continues, unsurprisingly.
The stakes are not high enough to switch from phishing to anything more advanced (like https://xkcd.com/538/) but seeing article blurbs say "Supply chain Attack" next to "These packages generally receive 2-3 billion downloads per week." might finally be enough to make an impression, one hopes.
This is not a detailed analysis of the attack, there's plenty of that already. If you're looking for one, visit our friends at https://socket.dev/blog/npm-author-qix-compromised-in-major-supply-chain-attack
Instead, let's look at how you could have a compromised dependency like that get into your app and be stopped.
One of the compromised packages was is-arrayish and I'll use that as an example going forward.
What the malware does
So if an app uses is-arrayish in the browser, it will override fetch, XMLHttpRequest and window.ethereum.request and whenever it finds a transaction being sent, it'll replace the target address with one of the malware author's addresses that looks most alike.
I won't go into this either, but you can take a look at the summary of "donations" some other friends linked to here: https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/61fbc095-f19b-479d-a037-5469aba332ab
Pretty low impact for an attack this big. Some of it seems to be people mocking the malware author with worthless transfers.
Let's see it in action
Say we have an app.
The app allows the user to send a meaningless transaction to themselves. Don't expect it to make sense.
It also uses is-arrayish because otherwise we'd have nothing to demo.
const isArrayish = require("is-arrayish");

const button = document.createElement("button");
button.textContent = "Send ETH Transaction";
document.body.appendChild(button);

button.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({
    method: "eth_requestAccounts",
  });
  if (!isArrayish(accounts)) {
    throw new Error("Accounts response must be array-like");
  }
  const myAddr = accounts[0];

  const txHash = await window.ethereum.request({
    method: "eth_sendTransaction",
    params: [
      {
        value: "0x5af3107a4000",
        from: myAddr,
        to: myAddr,
      },
    ],
  });
  console.log("Transaction sent:", txHash);
});
This is what it looks like:

Now after you update is-arrayish to 0.3.3 and rebuild the project, you might notice a slight difference.

Enter LavaMoat
If your project was set up with LavaMoat, you'd be using a policy to decide which package is allowed access to what. More about policies in the guide
With LavaMoat, all is-arrayish can do is fail:

TypeError: Cannot define property fetch, object is not extensible

BTW, If the malware was written a little better to avoid detection and fail silently, the functionality of the app would be fully restored.
LavaMoat Webpack Plugin
To protect the project, @lavamoat/webpack was used.
In short, what it does is: it puts modules from every dependency in a separate lexical global context that we call Compartment and only allows access to globals that the policy lists. I also controls which packages can import which other packages.
If the project dependency gets updated to contain malicious code, the policy will not allow it to access any globals or imports it didn't use before.

    CRDTs. Data structures that can be replicated across multiple nodes, edited independently, merged back together, and it all just works. But collaborative document editing and multiplayer TODO lists are just the tip of the iceberg - I believe the big application is distributed databases, and for that we need to talk about consistency.
CRDTs are a tool for Strong Eventual Consistency. Let's start with the definition of normal Eventual Consistency1:

  Eventual Delivery
  An update delivered to one node will eventually reaches all nodes
  
  Eventual Convergence
  If two nodes have seen all the same updates, they will eventually have the same state.


Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC) replaces Eventual Convergence with Strong Convergence:

  Strong Convergence
  If two nodes have seen all the same updates, they will have the same state.


Spot the difference! In SEC two replicas have the same state as soon as the updates are processed, not eventually. If multiple nodes are updated independently, there will be conflicts - this is inevitable. What SEC guarantees is that these conflicts are solved automatically and deterministically.
This has massive implications. SEC means low latency, because nodes don't need to coordinate to handle reads and writes. It means incredible fault tolerance - every single node in the system bar one could simultaneously crash, and reads and writes could still happen normally. And it means nodes still function properly if they're offline or split from the network for arbitrary time periods.
Strong Eventual Consistency is Eventual Consistency that works. If you're doing local first, or low latency geo-replicated systems - accept no substitute. This is the context I think we should see CRDTs in - building blocks of Strongly Eventually Consistent systems. CRDTs as application state as one thing, CRDTs as entire databases are quite another.
