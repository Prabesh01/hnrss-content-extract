            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
                    From a tender wrapper of human life, the placenta, comes the extraction of a protein that points to a solution for something that, until now, science had no clear path to—and never one so celebrated: restoring the spinal cord in people who suffered injuries and lost body movement.Brazilian researcher Tatiana Coelho de Sampaio, PhD professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, has quietly worked with a team of biologists for the past 25 years on the repairing and multiplying power of the protein laminin, which acts on the nervous system.

The studies ultimately produced the current drug polylaminin, a world first, presented on Tuesday (9) by Cristália laboratory as capable of regenerating the spinal cord in people who suffered organ rupture in accidents of various kinds, leading to paraplegia—paralysis of the lower limbs—or quadriplegia—paralysis of both lower and upper limbs.






During the experimental phase of the antidote, which is applied directly to the spine, patients experienced full recovery of their conditions, with no aftereffects and resuming a routine without restrictions.

    UTF-8 is a Brilliant Design
    2025-09-12
    


The first time I learned about UTF-8 encoding, I was fascinated by how well-thought and brilliantly it was designed to represent millions of characters from different languages and scripts, and still be backward compatible with ASCII.
Basically UTF-8 uses 32 bits and the old ASCII uses 7 bits, but UTF-8 is designed in such a way that:

Every ASCII encoded file is a valid UTF-8 file.
Every UTF-8 encoded file that has only ASCII characters is a valid ASCII file.

Designing a system that scales to millions of characters and still be compatible with the old systems that use just 128 characters is a brilliant design.

Note: If you are already aware of the UTF-8 encoding, you can explore the UTF-8 Playground utility that I built to visualize UTF-8 encoding.

How Does UTF-8 Do It?
UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding designed to represent every character in the Unicode character set, encompassing characters from most of the world's writing systems.
It encodes characters using one to four bytes. 
The first 128 characters (U+0000 to U+007F) are encoded with a single byte, ensuring backward compatibility with ASCII, and this is the reason why a file with only ASCII characters is a valid UTF-8 file.
Other characters require two, three, or four bytes. The leading bits of the first byte determine the total number of bytes that represents the current character. These bits follow one of four specific patterns, which indicate how many continuation bytes follow.



1st byte Pattern
# of bytes used
Full byte sequence pattern



0xxxxxxx
1
0xxxxxxx(This is basically a regular ASCII encoded byte)


110xxxxx
2
110xxxxx 10xxxxxx


1110xxxx
3
1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx


11110xxx
4
11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx


Notice that the second, third, and fourth bytes in a multi-byte sequence always start with 10. This indicates that these bytes are continuation bytes, following the main byte.
The remaining bits in the main byte, along with the bits in the continuation bytes, are combined to form the character's code point. A code point serves as a unique identifier for a character in the Unicode character set. A code point is typically represented in hexadecimal format, prefixed with "U+". For example, the code point for the character "A" is U+0041.
So here is how a software determines the character from the UTF-8 encoded bytes:

Read a byte. If it starts with 0, it's a single-byte character (ASCII). Show the character represented by the remaiing 7 bits on the screen. Continue with the next byte.
If the byte didn't start with a 0, then:
If it starts with 110, it's a two-byte character, so read the next byte as well.
If it starts with 1110, it's a three-byte character, so read the next two bytes.
If it starts with 11110, it's a four-byte character, so read the next three bytes.


Once the number of bytes are determined, read all the remaining bits except the leading bits, and find the binary value (aka. code point) of the character.
Look up the code point in the Unicode character set to find the corresponding character and display it on the screen.
Read the next byte and repeat the process.

Example: Hindi Letter "अ" (open in UTF-8 Playground)
The Hindi letter "अ" (officially "Devanagari Letter A") is represented in UTF-8 as:
11100000 10100100 10000101
Here:
The first byte 11100000 indicates that the character is encoded using 3 bytes.
The remaining bits of the three bytes:
xxxx0000 xx100100 xx000101 
are combined to form the binary sequence 00001001 00000101 (0x0905 in hexadecimal). This is the code point of the character, represented as U+0905.
The code point U+0905 (see official chart) represents the Hindi letter "अ" in the Unicode character set.
Example Text Files
Now that we understood the design of UTF-8, let's look at a file that contains the following text:
1. Text file contains: Hey👋 Buddy
The text Hey👋 Buddy has both English characters and an emoji character on it. The text file with this text saved on the disk will have the following 13 bytes in it:
01001000 01100101 01111001 11110000 10011111 10010001 10001011 00100000 01000010 01110101 01100100 01100100 01111001
Let's evaluate this file byte-by-byte following the UTF-8 decoding rules:



Byte
Explanation



01001000
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1001000 represent the letter 'H'. (open in playground)


01100101
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1100101 represent the letter 'e'. (open in playground)


01111001
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1111001 represent the letter 'y'. (open in playground)


11110000
Starts with 11110, indicating it's the first byte of a four-byte character.


10011111
Starts with 10, indicating it's a continuation byte.


10010001
Starts with 10, indicating it's a continuation byte.


10001011
Starts with 10, indicating it's a continuation byte.The bits from these four bytes (excluding the leading bits) combine to form the binary sequence 00001 11110100 01001011, which is 1F44B in hexadecimal, corresponds to the code point U+1F44B. This code point represents the waving hand emoji "👋" in the Unicode character set (open in playground).


00100000
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 0100000 represent a whitespace character. (open in playground)


01000010
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1000010 represent the letter 'B'. (open in playground)


01110101
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1110101 represent the letter 'u'. (open in playground)


01100100
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1100100 represent the letter 'd'. (open in playground)


01100100
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1100100 represent the letter 'd'. (open in playground)


01111001
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1111001 represent the letter 'y'. (open in playground)


Now this is a valid UTF-8 file, but it doesn't have to be "backward compatible" with ASCII because it contains a non-ASCII character (the emoji). Next let's create a file that contains only ASCII characters.
2. Text file contains: Hey Buddy
The text file doesn't have any non-ASCII characters. The file saved on the disk has the following 9 bytes in it:
01001000 01100101 01111001 00100000 01000010 01110101 01100100 01100100 01111001
Let's evaluate this file byte-by-byte following the UTF-8 decoding rules:



Byte
Explanation



01001000
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1001000 represent the letter 'H'. (open in playground)


01100101
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1100101 represent the letter 'e'. (open in playground)


01111001
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1111001 represent the letter 'y'. (open in playground)


00100000
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 0100000 represent a whitespace character. (open in playground)


01000010
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1000010 represent the letter 'B'. (open in playground)


01110101
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1110101 represent the letter 'u'. (open in playground)


01100100
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1100100 represent the letter 'd'. (open in playground)


01100100
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1100100 represent the letter 'd'. (open in playground)


01111001
Starts with 0, so it's a single-byte ASCII character. The remaining bits 1111001 represent the letter 'y'. (open in playground)


So this is a valid UTF-8 file, and it is also a valid ASCII file. The bytes in this file follows both the UTF-8 and ASCII encoding rules. This is how UTF-8 is designed to be backward compatible with ASCII.
Other Encodings
I did a quick research on any other encoding that are backward compatible with ASCII, and there are a few, but they are not as popular as UTF-8, for example GB 18030 (a Chinese government standard). Another one is the ISO/IEC 8859 encodings are single-byte encodings that extend ASCII to include additional characters, but they are limited to 256 characters.
The siblings of UTF-8, like UTF-16 and UTF-32, are not backward compatible with ASCII. For example, the letter 'A' in UTF-16 is represented as: 00 41 (two bytes), while in UTF-32 it is represented as: 00 00 00 41 (four bytes).
Bonus: UTF-8 Playground
When I was exploring the UTF-8 encoding, I couldn't find any good tool to interactively visualize how UTF-8 encoding works. So I built UTF-8 Playground to visualize and play around with UTF-8 encoding. Give it a try!.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Launching Dear Greenpeace back in 2023When I launched Dear Greenpeace with my fellow youth climate activists alongside WePlanet two years ago, I had no idea just how quickly the anti-nuclear dominoes would fall across Europe. In 2023, and what seems like a lifetime ago, Austria launched their legal action against the European Commission for the inclusion of nuclear energy in the EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy. At the time they were supported by a bulwark of EU countries and environmental NGOs that opposed nuclear energy. Honestly, it looked like they might win.But today, that whole landscape has changed.Germany, long a symbol of anti-nuclear politics, is beginning to shift. The nuclear phase-outs or bans in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, and Italy are now history. Even Fridays for Future has quietened its opposition, and in some places, embraced nuclear power.This moment matters.It shows what’s possible when we stick to the science. The evidence only gets clearer by the day that nuclear energy has an extremely low environmental impact across its lifecycle, and strong regulations and safety culture ensure that it remains one of the safest forms of energy available to humanity. The European Court of Justice has now fully dismissed Austria’s lawsuit. That ruling doesn’t just uphold nuclear energy’s place in EU green finance rules. It also signals a near-certain defeat for the ongoing Greenpeace case – the very lawsuit that inspired me to launch Dear Greenpeace in the first place.But instead of learning from this, Greenpeace is doubling down. Martin Kaiser, Executive Director of Greenpeace Germany, called the court decision “a dark day for the climate”.Let that sink in. The highest court in the EU just reaffirmed that nuclear energy meets the scientific and environmental standards to be included in sustainable finance, and Greenpeace still refuses to budge.Meanwhile, the climate crisis gets worse. Global emissions are not falling fast enough. Billions of people still lack access to clean, reliable electricity. And we are forced to spend time defending proven solutions instead of scaling them.Announcing our inclusion in the case between Greenpeace and the EU CommissionIt’s now up to the court whether we will get our time in court to outline the evidence in support of nuclear energy and the important role it can play in the global clean energy transition. Whether in court, on the streets, or in the halls of parliaments across the globe, we will be there to defend the science and ensure that nuclear power can spread the advantages of the modern world across the planet in a sustainable, reliable and dignified way.Austria stands increasingly isolated among a handful of countries that still cling to their opposition to nuclear energy. Their defeat in this vital high stakes topic is a success not just for the nuclear movement, but for the global transition as a whole. We have made real progress. Together, we’ve helped defend nuclear power in the EU, overturned outdated policies at the World Bank, and secured more technology-neutral language at the UN. These wins are not abstract. They open the door to real investment, real projects, and real emissions cuts.But the work is not done.We still need to overturn national nuclear bans, unlock more funding, and push democratic countries to support clean energy development abroad: especially where it is most needed to compete with Russia’s growing influence.The fight will not be done until every single country in the world can boast a clean, reliable energy grid, ready to maintain a modern dignified standard of living, for everyone, everywhere.This is a great success for the movement and it would not have been possible without the financial support, time and energy given by people like you.In Solidarity,

The last 10 days have brought a string of patent wins for Nintendo. Yesterday, the company was granted US patent 12,409,387, a patent covering riding and flying systems similar to those Nintendo has been criticized for claiming in its Palworld lawsuit (via Gamesfray). Last week, however, Nintendo received a more troubling weapon in its legal arsenal: US patent 12,403,397, a patent on summoning and battling characters that the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted with alarmingly little resistance.According to videogame patent lawyer Kirk Sigmon, the USPTO granting Nintendo these latest patents isn't just a moment of questionable legal theory. It's an indictment of American patent law."Broadly, I don't disagree with the many online complaints about these Nintendo patents," said Sigmon, whose opinions do not represent those of his firm and clients. "They have been an embarrassing failure of the US patent system." 


(Image credit: Nintendo, USPTO)Sigmon, who we spoke with last year about the claims and potential consequences of Nintendo's Palworld lawsuit, said both this week's '387 patent and last week's '397 represent procedural irregularities in the decisionmaking of US patent officials. And thanks to those irregularities, Nintendo has yet more tools to bully its competitors.The '387 patent granted this week, Sigmon told PC Gamer, "got a bit of push-back, but barely." After its initial application was deemed invalid due to similarities to existing Tencent and Xbox-related patents, Nintendo amended its claims based on interviews with the USPTO, which then determined that the claims were allowable "for substantially the same reasons as parent application(s).""That parent case," Sigmon said, "had an even weirder and much less useful prosecution history." 


(Image credit: Nintendo, USPTO)Most of the claims made in the '387 patent's single parent case, US Pat. No. 12,246,255, were immediately allowed by the USPTO, which Sigmon said is "a very unusual result: most claims are rejected at least once." When the claims were ultimately allowed, the only reasoning the USPTO offered was a block quote of text from the claims themselves."This seems like a situation where the USPTO essentially gave up and just allowed the case, assuming that the claims were narrow or specific enough to be new without evaluating them too closely," Sigmon said. "I strongly disagree with this result: In my view, these claims were in no way allowable."Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.To Sigmon, an IP attorney with extensive experience in prosecuting and teaching patent law, the '387 patent and its parent case rely on concepts and decisions that would have been obvious to a "Person of Ordinary Skill in the Art"—a legal construct that holds if a patent's claims would reasonably occur to a practitioner in the relevant field based on prior art, those claims aren't patentable. 


(Image credit: Nintendo, USPTO)The '397 patent granted last week is even more striking. It's a patent on summoning and battling with "sub-characters," using specific language suggesting it's based on the Let's Go! mechanics in the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet games. Despite its relevance to a conceit in countless games—calling characters to battle enemies for you—it was allowed without any pushback whatsoever from the USPTO, which Sigmon said is essentially unheard of."Like the above case, the reasons for allowance don't give us even a hint of why it was allowed: the Examiner just paraphrases the claims (after block quoting them) without explaining why the claims are allowed over the prior art," Sigmon said. "This is extremely unusual and raises a large number of red flags."According to Sigmon, USPTO records show that the allowance of the '397 patent was based on a review of a relatively miniscule number of documents: 16 US patents, seven Japanese patents, and—apparently—one article from Pokemon.com. 


(Image credit: Nintendo, USPTO)"I have no earthly idea how the Examiner could, in good faith, allow this application so quickly," Sigmon said.Admittedly, the '397 case was originally filed as a Japanese patent application, which would allow the Examiner to use the existing progress in the Japanese case as a starting point for their review. But, Sigmon said, "even that doesn't excuse this quick allowance.""This allowance should not have happened, full stop," he said.On paper, the patent might not seem like a threat to Nintendo's competitors: The claims as constructed in the '397 outline a very specific sequence of events and inputs, and patent claims must be met word-for-word to be infringed."Pragmatically speaking, though, it's not impossible to be sued for patent infringement even when a claim infringement argument is weak, and bad patents like this cast a massive shadow on the industry," Sigmon said.For a company at Nintendo's scale, the claims of the '397 patent don't need to make for a strong argument that would hold up in court. The threat of a lawsuit can stifle competition well enough on its own when it would cost millions of dollars to defend against. 


(Image credit: Nintendo, USPTO)"In my opinion, none of the three patents I've discussed here should have been allowed. It's shocking and offensive that they were," Sigmon said. "The USPTO dropped the ball big time, and it's going to externalize a lot of uncertainty (and, potentially, litigation cost) onto developers and companies that do not deserve it."Sigmon, who says he's helped inventors protect their inventions from IP theft perpetrated by major companies, insists that the patent system still has merit. "That's the kind of thing that patents are meant to do," he said. "They were not made to allow a big player to game the system, get an overly broad patent that they should have never received in the first place, and then go around bullying would-be competition with the threat of a legally questionable lawsuit."Unfortunately, Nintendo has gained these patents at a moment when the USPTO has made challenging bad patents more difficult. Currently, US patent officials under USPTO Acting Director Coke Morgan Stewart have been refusing to hear a huge number of Inter Partes Review cases—special proceedings in which parties can argue that a patent should never have been granted—for "discretionary" reasons."Realistically, this means that patent validity issues are being relegated to lawsuits: not a good situation, as that often entails millions of dollars in costs and a lot of risk," Sigmon said. "In practice, this means that bad patents get to fester on the market for longer and provide a bigger threat for the industry as a whole."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
				Even if you’ve been doing JavaScript for a while, you might be surprised to learn that setTimeout(0) is not really setTimeout(0). Instead, it could run 4 milliseconds later:
const start = performance.now()
setTimeout(() => {
  // Likely 4ms
  console.log(performance.now() - start)
}, 0)

Nearly a decade ago when I was on the Microsoft Edge team, it was explained to me that browsers did this to avoid “abuse.” I.e. there are a lot of websites out there that spam setTimeout, so to avoid draining the user’s battery or blocking interactivity, browsers set a special “clamped” minimum of 4ms.
This also explains why some browsers would bump the throttling for devices on battery power (16ms in the case of legacy Edge), or throttle even more aggressively for background tabs (1 second in Chrome!).
One question always vexed me, though: if setTimeout was so abused, then why did browsers keep introducing new timers like setImmediate (RIP), Promises, or even new fanciness like scheduler.postTask()? If setTimeout had to be nerfed, then wouldn’t these timers suffer the same fate eventually?
I wrote a long post about JavaScript timers back in 2018, but until recently I didn’t have a good reason to revisit this question. Then I was doing some work on fake-indexeddb, which is a pure-JavaScript implementation of the IndexedDB API, and this question reared its head. As it turns out, IndexedDB wants to auto-commit transactions when there’s no outstanding work in the event loop – in other words, after all microtasks have finished, but before any tasks (can I cheekily say “macro-tasks”?) have started.
To accomplish this, fake-indexeddb was using setImmediate in Node.js (which shares some similarities with the legacy browser version) and setTimeout in the browser. In Node, setImmediate is kind of perfect, because it runs after microtasks but immediately before any other tasks, and without clamping. In the browser, though, setTimeout is pretty sub-optimal: in one benchmark, I was seeing Chrome take 4.8 seconds for something that only took 300 milliseconds in Node (a 16x slowdown!).
Looking out at the timer landscape in 2025, though, it wasn’t obvious what to choose. Some options included:

setImmediate – only supported in legacy Edge and IE, so that’s a no-go.
MessageChannel.postMessage – this is the technique used by afterframe.
window.postMessage – a nice idea, but kind of janky since it might interfere with other scripts on the page using the same API. This approach is used by the setImmediate polyfill though.
scheduler.postTask – if you read no further, this was the winner. But let’s explain why!

To compare these options, I wrote a quick benchmark. A few important things about this benchmark:

You have to run several iterations of setTimeout (and friends) to really suss out the clamping. Technically, per the HTML specification, the 4ms clamping is only supposed to kick in after a setTimeout has been nested (i.e. one setTimeout calls another) 5 times.
I didn’t test every possible combination of 1) battery vs plugged in, 2) monitor refresh rates, 3) background vs foreground tabs, etc., even though I know all of these things can affect the clamping. I have a life, and although it’s fun to don the lab coat and run some experiments, I don’t want to spend my entire Saturday doing that.

In any case, here are the numbers (in milliseconds, median of 101 iterations, on a 2021 16-inch MacBook Pro):



Browser
setTimeout
MessageChannel
window
scheduler.postTask




Chrome 139
4.2
0.05
0.03
0.00


Firefox 142
4.72
0.02
0.01
0.01


Safari 18.4
26.73
0.52
0.05
Not implemented




Don’t worry about the precise numbers too much: the point is that Chrome and Firefox clamp setTimeout to 4ms, and the other three options are roughly equivalent. In Safari, interestingly, setTimeout is even more heavily throttled, and MessageChannel.postMessage is a tad slower than window.postMessage (although window.postMessage is still janky for the reasons listed above).
This experiment answered my immediate question: fake-indexeddb should use scheduler.postTask (which I prefer for its ergonomics) and fall back to either MessageChannel.postMessage or window.postMessage. (I did experiment with different priorities for postTask, but they all performed almost identically. For fake-indexeddb‘s use case, the default priority of 'user-visible' seemed most appropriate, and that’s what the benchmark uses.)
None of this answered my original question, though: why exactly do browsers bother to throttle setTimeout if web developers can just use scheduler.postTask or MessageChannel instead? I asked my friend Todd Reifsteck, who was co-chair of the Web Performance Working Group back when a lot of these discussions about “interventions” were underway.
He said that there were effectively two camps: one camp felt that timers needed to be throttled to protect web devs from themselves, whereas the other camp felt that developers should “measure their own silliness,” and that any subtle throttling heuristics would just cause confusion. In short, it was the standard tradeoff in designing performance APIs: “some APIs are quick but come with footguns.”
This jives with my own intuitions on the topic. Browser interventions are usually put in place because web developers have either used too much of a good thing (e.g. setTimeout), or were blithely unaware of better options (the touch listener controversy is a good example). In the end, the browser is a “user agent” acting on the user’s behalf, and the W3C’s priority of constituencies makes it clear that end-user needs always trump web developer needs.
That said, web developers often do want to do the right thing. (I consider this blog post an attempt in that direction.) We just don’t always have the tools to do it, so instead we grab whatever blunt instrument is nearby and start swinging. Giving us more control over tasks and scheduling could avoid the need to hammer away with setTimeout and cause a mess that calls for an intervention.
My prediction is that postTask/postMessage will remain unthrottled for the time being. Out of Todd’s two “camps,” the very existence of the Scheduler API, which offers a whole slew of fine-grained tools for task scheduling, seems to point toward the “pro-control” camp as the one currently steering the ship. Although Todd sees the API more as a compromise between the two groups: yes, it offers a lot of control, but it also aligns with the browser’s actual rendering pipeline rather than random timeouts.
The pessimist in me wonders, though, if the API could still be abused – e.g. by carelessly using the user-blocking priority everywhere. Perhaps in the future, some enterprising browser vendor will put their foot more firmly on the throttle (so to speak) and discover that it causes websites to be snappier, more responsive, and less battery-draining. If that happens, then we may see another round of interventions. (Maybe we’ll need a scheduler2 API to dig ourselves out of that mess!)
I’m not involved much in web standards anymore and can only speculate. For the time being, I’ll just do what most web devs do: choose whatever API accomplishes my goals today, and hope that browsers don’t change too much in the future. As long as we’re careful and don’t introduce too much “silliness,” I don’t think that’s a lot to ask.
Thanks to Todd Reifsteck for feedback on a draft of this post.

    When a legal takedown request arrives, whether it’s about copyright,
censorship, privacy, or something more vague, how a Free and Open Source
Software (FOSS) project responds can make all the difference.

Handled well, a takedown request can be a manageable administrative step. Handled poorly, it can cause panic, disrupt infrastructure, or even put contributors at legal risk.

As part of our legal resilience research, we spoke with a range of legal experts, software freedom advocates, and maintainers of mature FOSS infrastructure to understand how others manage these moments. In this article, we share what we learned, and how F-Droid is incorporating these lessons into its own approach.

A Pattern Emerges

Despite differences in jurisdiction, size, and mission, a few common themes
from our research emerged when we asked how other projects handle takedown
requests:

1. Don’t Be a Soft Target

Legal threats often follow the path of least resistance. FOSS projects that
publish a formal takedown policy, require legal submissions through specific
channels, and insist on a valid legal basis are much less likely to receive,
or comply with, vague or harassing demands.

One FOSS organization, for example, requires all legal correspondence to be submitted by postal mail in the national language and citing local law. Most complaints evaporate once asked to comply.

2. Creating a transparent and documented process

Several digital rights organizations advised setting up structured response
steps:


  Require submissions to a dedicated legal@ or abuse@ email.
  Insist on full documentation: legal basis, jurisdiction, evidence of the
infringement and identity of the complainant.
  Review for sufficiency, proportionality, and standing before acting.


This creates proper documentation to process valid claims, while protecting projects from illegitimate or unfounded requests.

3. Use Jurisdiction Strategically

Projects based in civil law jurisdictions, particularly in Europe, are often
better positioned to deflect legal demands from foreign entities. Several
organizations emphasized that complying with vague or extrajudicial
requests, especially those originating outside your jurisdiction, can
increase risk unnecessarily. Instead, they recommended requiring a valid
legal basis grounded in the project’s home country. Formal legal processes,
such as court orders or official government channels, were seen as the
appropriate threshold, not informal emails or unverifiable demands.

Notification and Appeals: Fairness and Transparency

All of the projects we consulted emphasized the importance of notifying
developers whose apps are being targeted, informing them (if possible) of
the seriousness of the claim, and the proposed strategy F-Droid is taking to
handle the claim. 

If a threat is deemed to be valid and a developer’s content is flagged for
takedown:


  The developer or maintainer is informed, unless prohibited by law (gag
orders).
  A window for response (commonly 14 days) is offered, unless unfeasible due
to seriousness and time restraints of the request itself
  If the developer disputes the claim and provides supporting information
(e.g. license, public domain status, fair use justification), the claim is
reviewed.
  If the claim is upheld, the content is removed, but always with an
internal record and opportunity to appeal.


This mirrors principles embedded in international norms (like the Manila Principles and GitHub’s DMCA takedown policy) and avoids overcompliance with weak or abusive claims.

Transparency, Censorship, and What You Can (Legally) Publish

Takedown requests occupy a complex space between legal enforcement and
censorship. While some are legitimate claims, like copyright violations or
privacy breaches, others are vague, politically motivated, or intended to
silence dissent. For FOSS projects that have a global user base, it’s not
always obvious how to respond. Complying too quickly can reinforce
censorship practices; resisting without process can lead to full website
shut downs, domain names being taken
away
(as in the US) or large and costly legal
battles.

One strategy that helps balance this tension is radical
transparency. Several projects we spoke with emphasized the importance of
documenting what actions were taken and why, not just for accountability,
but as a form of resistance. A well-known example is GitHub’s DMCA takedown
policy (as of July 2025), which mandates compliance with valid takedown
requests, but also posts each one publicly in their github/dmca
repository. The result: potential abusers
know their requests will face public scrutiny, which acts as a deterrent.

However, not all jurisdictions allow this kind of transparency. In India,
for example, we were informed that it is often illegal to disclose that you
have received a government request, even to the developer of the affected
app. In contrast, in Russia, takedown requests can often be legally
posted, though by doing so you may be
putting yourself at risk for retaliation, additional takedown requests and
legal troubles.

With that in mind, some best practices for FOSS projects include:


  Publishing biannual transparency reports, even if redacted or aggregated.
  Maintaining an internal log of all takedown activity, with public
disclosure where legally possible.
  Explaining the general reasons for content removals, who made the request,
under what law, and what action was taken, unless legally prohibited.
  Being explicit about what cannot be shared, and why.


Transparency won’t prevent all forms of censorship, but it can slow them
down, raise awareness, and provide a record that strengthens the broader
FOSS ecosystem.

What We’re Doing at F-Droid

F-Droid is revising its own takedown policy, informed by:


  Dutch law and EU regulations
  The structural support provided by The Commons Conservancy
  Practical lessons from long-standing FOSS organizations


Our draft process includes:


  Written takedown submission request to legal@f-droid.org including the
   required information.:



  Identify the specific material in question (e.g. app name)
  Include valid legal basis under applicable jurisdiction (e.g. copyright
  law, court order statutory basis)
  Indicate jurisdiction in which the legal basis is claimed to apply
  Include sufficient evidence of the alleged infringement (e.g. copyright
  certificate, ownership declaration)
  Clearly state that the complaintant is authorized to act on behalf of the
  rights holder
  Include full contact details and a verifiable identity (subject to
  exceptions, such as gag orders or whistleblower protection)



  Verification of jurisdiction and legal basis, including evidence
  Developer notification and appeal procedures
  Rejection of requests lacking documentation or legal authority may be
   rejected or ignored
  Biannual transparency reports and public tracking of takedown requests


We’re also working to improve contributor education about potential exposure
when contributing to F-Droid, document internal escalation paths, and ensure
consistent handling of international claims.

Final Thoughts

Takedown requests are not going away in fact, they’re becoming more frequent
and more complex. But FOSS projects don’t have to face them unprepared.

By building processes, establishing clear jurisdiction, and protecting individuals through structure and policy, we can handle these challenges with the seriousness they deserve without letting them derail our mission.

I host a bunch of hobby code on my server. I would think it’s really only interesting to me, but it turns out every day, thousands of people from all over the world are digging through my code, reviewing years old changesets. On the one hand, wow, thanks, this is very flattering. On the other hand, what the heck is wrong with you?This has been building up for a while, and I’ve been intermittently developing and deploying countermeasures. It’s been a lot like solving a sliding block puzzle. Lots of small moves and changes, and eventually it starts coming together.My primary principle is that I’d rather not annoy real humans more than strictly intended. If there’s a challenge, it shouldn’t be too difficult, but ideally, we want to minimize the number of challenges presented. You should never suspect that I suspected you of being an enemy agent.First measure is we only challenge on the deep URLs. So, for instance, I can link to the anticrawl repo no problem, or even the source for anticrawl.go, and that’ll be served immediately. All the pages any casual browser would visit make up less than 1% of the possible URLs that exist, but probably contain 99% of the interesting content.Also, these pages get cached by the reverse proxy first, so anticrawl doesn’t even evaluate them. We’ve already done the work to render the page, and we’re trying to shed load, so why would I want to increase load by generating challenges and verifying responses? It annoys me when I click a seemingly popular blog post and immediately get challenged, when I’m 99.9% certain that somebody else clicked it two seconds before me. Why isn’t it in cache? We must have different objectives in what we’re trying to accomplish. Or who we’re trying to irritate.The next step is that anybody loading style.css gets marked friendly. Big Basilisk doesn’t care about my artisanal styles, but most everybody else loves them. So if you start at a normal page, and then start clicking deeper, that’s fine, still no challenge. (Sorry lynx browsers, but don’t worry, it’s not game over for you yet.)And then let’s say somebody directly links to a changeset like /r/vertigo/v/b5ea481ff167. The first visitor will probably hit a challenge, but then we record that URL as in use. The bots are shotgun crawling all over the place, but if a single link is visited more than once, I’ll assume it’s human traffic, and bypass the challenge. No promises, but clicking that link will mostly likely just return content, no challenge.The very first version of anticrawl relied on a weak POW challenge (find a SHA hash with first byte 42), just to get something launched, but this does seem counter intuitive. Why are we making humans solve a challenge optimized for machines? Instead I have switched to a much more diabolical challenge. You are asked how many Rs in strawberry. Or maybe something else. To be changed as necessary. But really, the key observation is that any challenge, anything at all, easily sheds like 99.99% of the crawling load.Notably, because the challenge does not include its own javascript solver, even a smart crawler isn’t going to solve it automatically. If you include the solution on the challenge page, at least some bots are going to use it. All anticrawl challenges now require some degree of contemplation, not just blind interpretation.It took a few iterations because the actual deployment involves a few pieces. I had to reduce the style.css cache time, so that visitors would periodically refresh it (and thus their humanity). And then exclude it from the caching proxy, so that the request would be properly observed. Basically, a few minutes tinkering now and then while I wait for my latte to arrive, and now I think I’ve gotten things to the point where it’s unlikely to burden anybody except malignant crawlers.elsewhereI have focused my bot detection efforts on humungus because the ratio of crawler to legit traffic was out of control. But now that I know what to look for, I see the same patterns scraping everywhere else. Seems really unlikely a worldwide colelctive of Opera users is suddenly interested in my old honks. I’m starting to deploy similar countermeasures.appendixSome log samples. There’s always somebody to insist these could be real humans, and I have somehow misjudged them.

I’ve worked to keep response times in the low millisecond range, just seems like good sense, but I think people should be allowed to program in slower languages and frameworks. You shouldn’t need a fairly substantial EPYC server like I have, either.And there’s always stuff happening in the background. Mastodon hits me once a second every time anybody deletes something. Lemmy hits me twice a second every time somebody likes anything. There’s a bunch of nitwits with misconfigured RSS readers. A 4x overhead in one area doesn’t matter, but a 1/4 as powerful CPU, with 1/4 as many cores, and 1/4 as fast language, all of which are entirely realistic, and pretty soon we’re running close to the edge.

            Abstract:K2-Think is a reasoning system that achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 32B parameter model, matching or surpassing much larger models like GPT-OSS 120B and DeepSeek v3.1. Built on the Qwen2.5 base model, our system shows that smaller models can compete at the highest levels by combining advanced post-training and test-time computation techniques. The approach is based on six key technical pillars: Long Chain-of-thought Supervised Finetuning, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), Agentic planning prior to reasoning, Test-time Scaling, Speculative Decoding, and Inference-optimized Hardware, all using publicly available open-source datasets. K2-Think excels in mathematical reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art scores on public benchmarks for open-source models, while also performing strongly in other areas such as Code and Science. Our results confirm that a more parameter-efficient model like K2-Think 32B can compete with state-of-the-art systems through an integrated post-training recipe that includes long chain-of-thought training and strategic inference-time enhancements, making open-source reasoning systems more accessible and affordable.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[We are excited to announce Vectroid, a serverless vector search solution that delivers exceptional accuracy and low latency in a cost effective package. Vectroid is not just another vector search solution—it’s a search engine that performs and scales in all scenarios.Why we built VectroidTalk to any team working with large, low latency vector workloads and you’ll hear a familiar story: something always has to give. Vector databases often make significant tradeoffs between speed, accuracy, and cost. That’s the nature of the mathematical underpinnings of vector search works—taking algorithmic shortcuts to get near-perfect results in a short amount of time.There are some common permutations of these tradeoffs:Very high accuracy, but very expensive and slow
Fast speed and tolerable accuracy, but very expensive
Cheap and fast, but inaccurate to a disqualifying degree
Based on the existing vector database landscape, it would seem that building a cost effective vector database requires sacrificing either speed or accuracy at scale. We believe that’s a false pretense: building a cost-efficient database is possible with high accuracy and low latency. We just need to rethink our underlying mechanism.Our “aha” momentQuery speed and recall are largely a function of the chosen ANN algorithm. Algorithms which are both fast and accurate like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds) are memory intensive and expensive to index. The traditional assumption is that these types of algorithms are untenable for a cost-conscious system.We had two major realizations which challenged this assumption.Demand for in-memory HNSW is not static. Real world usage patterns are bursty and uneven. A cost efficient database can optimize for this reality by making resource allocation dynamic and by individually scaling system components as needed.
HNSW’s memory footprint is tunable. It can be easily be flattened (ex. by compressing vectors using quantization) and expanded (ex. by increasing layer count), which gives us the flexibility to experiment with different configurations to find a goldilocks setup.

What is Vectroid?Vectroid is a serverless vector database with premium performance. It delivers the same or stronger balance of speed and recall promised by high-end offerings, but costs less than competitors.Performant vector search: HNSW for ultra fast, high recall similarity search.
Near real-time search capabilities: Newly ingested records are searchable almost instantly.
Massive scalability: Seamlessly handles billions of vectors in a single namespace.
Cost efficient resource utilization: Scaling each layer (ingest, index, query) separately.

How Vectroid performsThe core philosophy of Vectroid is that optimizing for one metric at any cost to the others doesn’t make for a robust system. Instead, vector search should be designed for balanced performance across recall, latency, and cost so users don’t have to make painful tradeoffs as workloads grow.When tested against other state-of-the-art vector search, Vectroid is not only competitive but the most consistent across the board. Across all of our tests, Vectroid is the only databases that was able to maintain over 90% recall while scaling to 10 query threads per second—all while maintaining good latency scores.Some early benchmarks:Indexed 1B vectors (Deep1B) in ~48 minutes
Achieved P99 latency of 34ms on the MS Marco 138M vector / 1024 dimensions dataset
We’ll be releasing the full benchmark suite (with setup details so anyone can reproduce them) in an upcoming post. For now, these numbers highlight the kind of scale and performance we designed Vectroid to handle.How Vectroid worksVectroid is composed of two independently scalable microservices for writes and reads.As the diagram shows, index state, vector data, and metadata are persisted to cloud object storage (GCS for now, S3 coming soon). Disk, cache, and in-memory storage layers each employ a usage-aware model for index lifecycle in which indexes are lazily loaded from object storage on demand and evicted when idle.For fast, high-recall ANN search, we chose the HNSW algorithm. It offers excellent latency and accuracy tradeoffs, supports incremental updates, and performs well across large-scale workloads. To patch its limitations, we added a number of targeted optimizations:Slow indexing speed ⇒ in-memory write buffer to ensure newly inserted vectors are immediately searchable
High indexing cost ⇒ batched, highly concurrent and partitioned indexing
High memory usage ⇒ vector compression via quantization
Final ThoughtsWe’re just getting started. If you’re building applications that rely on fast, scalable vector search (or you’re running up against the limits of your current stack), we’d love to hear from you.

    As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, building it with privacy at its core is a critical frontier for the field. Differential privacy (DP) offers a mathematically robust solution by adding calibrated noise to prevent memorization. However, applying DP to LLMs introduces trade-offs. Understanding these trade-offs is crucial. Applying DP noise alters traditional scaling laws — rules describing performance dynamics — by reducing training stability (the model's ability to learn consistently without experiencing catastrophic events like loss spikes or divergence) and significantly increasing batch size (a collection of input prompts sent to the model simultaneously for processing) and computation costs.Our new research, “Scaling Laws for Differentially Private Language Models”, conducted in partnership with Google DeepMind, establishes laws that accurately model these intricacies, providing a complete picture of the compute-privacy-utility trade-offs. Guided by this research, we’re excited to introduce VaultGemma, the largest (1B-parameters), open model trained from scratch with differential privacy. We are releasing the weights on Hugging Face and Kaggle, alongside a technical report, to advance the development of the next generation of private AI.


                    
                    
    



    




    Understanding the scaling lawsWith a carefully thought-out experimental methodology, we aimed to quantify the benefit of increasing model sizes, batch sizes, and iterations in the context of DP training. Our work required making some simplifying assumptions to overcome the exponential number of combinations one might consider trying. We assumed that how well the model learns depends mostly on the "noise-batch ratio” which compares the amount of random noise we add for privacy to the size of the data groups (batches) we use for training. This assumption works because the privacy noise we add is much greater than any natural randomness that comes from sampling the data.To establish a DP scaling law, we conducted a comprehensive set of experiments to evaluate performance across a variety of model sizes and noise-batch ratios. The resulting empirical data, together with known deterministic relationships between other variables, allows us to answer a variety of interesting scaling-laws–style queries, such as, “For a given compute budget, privacy budget, and data budget, what is the optimal training configuration to achieve the lowest possible training loss?”


                    
                    
    




                    
                    
    



    




    Key findings: A powerful synergyBefore diving into the full scaling laws, it’s useful to understand the dynamics and synergies between the compute budget, privacy budget, and data budget from a privacy accounting perspective — i.e., understand how these factors influence the noise-batch ratio for a fixed model size and number of iterations. This analysis is significantly cheaper to do as it does not require any model training, yet it yields a number of useful insights. For instance, increasing the privacy budget in isolation leads to diminishing returns, unless coupled with a corresponding increase in either the compute budget (FLOPs) or data budget (tokens).


                    
                    
    




                    
                    
    



        
  To explore this synergy further, the visualization below shows how the optimal training configuration changes based on different constraints. As the privacy and compute budgets change, notice how the recommendation shifts between investing in a larger model versus training with larger batch sizes or more iterations.

    

                    
                    
    




                    
                    
    



        
  This data provides a wealth of useful insights for practitioners. While all the insights are reported in the paper, a key finding is that one should train a much smaller model with a much larger batch size than would be used without DP. This general insight should be unsurprising to a DP expert given the importance of large batch sizes. While this general insight holds across many settings, the optimal training configurations do change with the privacy and data budgets. Understanding the exact trade-off is crucial to ensure that both the compute and privacy budgets are used judiciously in real training scenarios. The above visualizations also reveal that there is often wiggle room in the training configurations — i.e., a range of model sizes might provide very similar utility if paired with the correct number of iterations and/or batch size.

    

                    
                    
    



    




    Applying the scaling laws to build VaultGemmaThe Gemma models are designed with responsibility and safety at their core. This makes them a natural foundation for developing a production-quality, DP-trained model like VaultGemma.Algorithmic advancements: Training at scaleThe scaling laws we derived above represent an important first step towards training a useful Gemma model with DP. We used the scaling laws to determine both how much compute we needed to train a compute-optimal 1B parameter Gemma 2-based model with DP, and how to allocate that compute among batch size, iterations, and sequence length to achieve the best utility.One prominent gap between the research underlying the scaling laws and the actual training of VaultGemma was our handling of Poisson sampling, which is a central component of DP-SGD. We initially used a straightforward method of loading data in uniform batches but then switched to Poisson sampling to get the best privacy guarantees with the least amount of noise. This method posed two main challenges: it created batches of different sizes, and it required a specific, randomized order for processing the data. We solved this by using our recent work on Scalable DP-SGD, which allows us to process data in fixed-size batches — either by adding extra padding or trimming them — while still maintaining strong privacy protections.


                    
                    
    



    




    ResultsArmed with our new scaling laws and advanced training algorithms, we built VaultGemma, to date the largest (1B-parameters) open model fully pre-trained with differential privacy with an approach that can yield high-utility models.From training VaultGemma, we found our scaling laws to be highly accurate. The final training loss of VaultGemma was remarkably close to what our equations predicted, validating our research and providing the community with a reliable roadmap for future private model development.


                    
                    
    




                    
                    
    



    




    We also compare downstream performance of our model against its non-private counterpart across a range of standard academic benchmarks (i.e., HellaSwag, BoolQ, PIQA, SocialIQA, TriviaQA, ARC-C, ARC-E ). To put this performance in perspective and quantify the current resource investment required for privacy, we also include a comparison to an older similar-sized GPT-2 model, which performs similarly on these benchmarks. This comparison illustrates that today’s private training methods produce models with utility comparable to that of non-private models from roughly 5 years ago, highlighting the important gap our work will help the community systematically close.Finally, the model comes with strong theoretical and empirical privacy protections.


                    
                    
    



    




    Formal privacy guaranteeIn general, both the privacy parameters (ε, δ) and the privacy unit are important considerations when doing DP training, as these together determine what the trained model can learn. VaultGemma was trained with a sequence-level DP guarantee of (ε ≤ 2.0, δ ≤ 1.1e-10), where a sequence consists of 1024 consecutive tokens extracted from heterogeneous data sources. Specifically, we used the same training mixture that was used to train the Gemma 2 model, consisting of a number of documents of varying lengths. During pre-processing, long documents are split up and tokenized into multiple sequences, and shorter documents are packed together into a single sequence. While the sequence-level privacy unit was a natural choice for our training mixture, in situations where there is a clear mapping between data and users, user-level differential privacy would be a better choice.What does this mean in practice? Informally speaking, because we provide protection at the sequence level, if information relating to any (potentially private) fact or inference occurs in a single sequence, then VaultGemma essentially does not know that fact: the response to any query will be statistically similar to the result from a model that never trained on the sequence in question. However, if many training sequences contain information relevant to a particular fact, then in general VaultGemma will be able to provide that information.


                    
                    
    



    




    Empirical memorizationSequence-level DP provably bounds the influence of any single training sequence (example) on the final model. We prompted the model with a 50-token prefix from a training document to see if it would generate the corresponding 50-token suffix. VaultGemma 1B shows no detectable memorization of its training data and successfully demonstrates the efficacy of DP training.


                    
                    
    



    




    ConclusionVaultGemma represents a significant step forward in the journey toward building AI that is both powerful and private by design. By developing and applying a new, robust understanding of the scaling laws for DP, we have successfully trained and released the largest open, DP-trained language model to date.While a utility gap still exists between DP-trained and non-DP–trained models, we believe this gap can be systematically narrowed with more research on mechanism design for DP training. We hope that VaultGemma and our accompanying research will empower the community to build the next generation of safe, responsible, and private AI for everyone.

This post isn’t about the virtues of some editors versus others: that's already been written by somebody else (and it’s really good) – if you want to know why I use emacs, I suggest reading that instead.



This post will help you understand why "extensibility" and "introspectability" are such prominent emacs features even without an emacs lisp background.
Bridging the gap from spacemacs or doom emacs to a bespoke configuration wasn't easy for me because I didn’t know how to learn emacs, so I'm going to stumble through one of my own use cases to demonstrate how this process goes if you're peeking in from outside the emacs ecosystem, horrified curious about how this all works.



Let's talk about reStructuredText.

reStructuredText


At my day job I write our user documentation using Sphinx.
It expects my stilted prose in .rst format, which is kind of like Markdown if you squint.



I do an awful lot of cross-referencing between references (or refs) to link concepts across the documentation.
You define a reference like this:


ReSTFont used for directives and roles.
Font used for all other defining constructs.
.. _code_example:

.. code::
   echo "HELP I'M TRAPPED IN A CODE EXAMPLE"




…and then link to it later like this:


ReSTFont used for field names and interpreted text.
Font used for directives and roles.
This :ref:`doesn't look like anything to me <code_example>`.




…or like this (if the ref is associated with a title of some sort):


ReSTFont used for field names and interpreted text.
Font used for directives and roles.
Don't say :ref:`code_example`.




My problem is that I have an assload of references across the all of the documentation and my brain cannot recall them on the spot.
What I really need is the ability to call up the list of references to easily discover and select from that list – this is basically auto-completion but for documentation headers (or titles).



I am ready to write some shitty elisp with the help of aliens.



A Parentheses Prelude

Before we dig into emacs' guts, here are some principles that I learned after my first elisp experiments that might help somebody digging into this ecosystem for the first time:


1. Emacs Wants You to Extend It


I haven't written plugins for other editors extensively, but I can tell you this: emacs doesn't just make deep customization available, but it actively encourages you to make an absolute customization messes masterpieces.
Core editor functions aren't just documented, but often include tidbits about "you probably want to see this other variable" or "here's how you should use this".



Not only that, but emacs happily hands you functions shaped like nuclear warheads like advice-add (that let you override any function) that can absolutely obliterate your editor if you hold it the wrong way.
Of course, this also grants you unlimited power.



Remember that emacs is designed to be torn apart and rearranged.




2. Geriatric Software


The first public release of GNU emacs happened in 1985.
Literally 40 years of development sits inside of emacs and its developers are still adding non-trivial features (native language server support landed in version 29 in 2023).



The ecosystem is vast and the language has evolved for a long time.
There's nearly always something useful if you need a particular piece of functionality, so even moreso than with other ecosystems: remember to do your homework first.




3. Lisp for for the un-Lisped


The syntax is polarizing, I know.
Gurus will wince when I get this wrong, but:



Writing lisp is like writing any other code, just with the parentheses wrapping everything instead of just arguments. print("Macrodata Refinement") becomes (print "Macrodata Refinement")
Sometimes you don't get functions, you get macros that behave special ways.
For example, let sets variables for an inner block of code.
Like this: (let (name "Mark S.") (print name))
Lispers say "this is actually data and not calling code" by doing this with single quotes: '("list" "of" "strings")



I'm out of my depth in lisp, but if you're a novice, those notes might help.






Extensible MACroS


With that prelude out of the way, let's begin.



Inside of emacs you can call up a list of potential completions by using the keyboard shortcut M-. (that’s "hit the meta key along with period", where "meta" is the Alt key for me).
This applies in a wide variety of scenarios, like when completing class names or variables.
If we want to ask emacs to hand us a list of potential references, then the system we want to hook into is this completions system.



(This is the only time I'll assume we know where to go without crawling through documentation. You could discover it yourself looking for "completion" or similar string in emacs docs).



To start our hero’s journey, we figure out what the hell M-. actually does.
We can ask emacs this by calling the function describe-key, which is bound to C-h k.
Hitting Ctrl-h, then k, then M-. drops us into a help buffer that looks like this:


M-. runs the command completion-at-point (found in
evil-insert-state-map), which is an interactive native-compiled Lisp
function in ‘minibuffer.el’.

It is bound to M-..

(completion-at-point)

Perform completion on the text around point.
The completion method is determined by ‘completion-at-point-functions’.

  Probably introduced at or before Emacs version 23.2.



We have the next breadcrumb to follow, which is the variable completion-at-point-functions.
Running completion-at-point by hitting M-. consults that variable to hand us completion candidates, so we describe-variable it with C-h v and then choose completion-at-point-functions from the list of variables:


completion-at-point-functions is a variable defined in ‘minibuffer.el’.

Its value is (cape-dict cape-file tags-completion-at-point-function)

Special hook to find the completion table for the entity at point.
Each function on this hook is called in turn without any argument and
should return either nil, meaning it is not applicable at point,
or a function of no arguments to perform completion (discouraged),
or a list of the form (START END COLLECTION . PROPS)



…and it goes on from there.
You can see some existing completion functions in there: I use a package called cape to offer helpful suggestions like file paths if I start typing in something like ./filename.



The description for this variable instructs us about how to add our own functions (scary!)
You’ll note that emacs calls this a "hook", which is most often just a term used to describe a variable that is a list of functions that get called at a specific time (hooks show up everywhere).



I elided the full description for completion-at-point-functions – which is lengthy! – but if you parse it all out, you learn the following:



Your completion at point function should return either nil (the elisp "null") – which means your completion function doesn’t apply right now – or another function (which emacs discourages), or a list, which is what we’ll do because it sounds like the most-correct thing to do.
The list we return is (START END COLLECTION . PROPS):

START and END should be positions in the buffer between which emacs will replace the completed symbol with our candidate.
That is, if your cursor is calling a method on a Python object like file.ope| (where the bar is your cursor), emacs will replace just ope when you select open from a list of completions and not the entire file.ope string.
COLLECTION is the juicy bit. The documentation calls it a completion "table", and there’s probably hidden meaning there, but you can just return a list of candidates and move on with your day, which is what I'll do.




Okay, so we need to write something to find the bounds of a string to replace and a function that returns that list.



Completions Abound


I fooled around with some regular expressions for a while until I did the right thing and examined how other completion backends do it.
If you have the package installed, the aforementioned cape-file function gives us a hint: hit M-x, then choose find-function, select cape-file, and poke around. You’ll find the use of a function called bounds-of-thing-at-point.
Describing it with C-h f bounds-of-thing-at-point gives us:


Determine the start and end buffer locations for the THING at point.
THING should be a symbol specifying a type of syntactic entity.
Possibilities include ‘symbol’, ‘list’, ‘sexp’, ‘defun’, ‘number’,
‘filename’, ‘url’, ‘email’, ‘uuid’, ‘word’, ‘sentence’, ‘whitespace’,
‘line’, and ‘page’.



And that is useful for our START and END needs.
You can take it for a test drive at any time with M-: (bounds-of-thing-at-point 'word) to see where emacs thinks the word at your cursor starts and ends.
This is a common theme when developing elisp: try out functions all the time within the editor since they’re near at hand.



The argument to bounds-of-thing-at-point is a symbol for a literal thing that is predefined by the function define-thing-chars.
We pass define-thing-chars a name for our "thing" and a regex, and we can call bounds-of-thing-at-point with it from that point on.
The function documentation in thingatpt.el that emacs refers you to explains more if you’re interested.



define-thing-chars expects a string with characters to put into a regex character class (like [...]) - just any valid character.
This is a pretty standard character class and we can start with something super simple.
I can’t be bothered to look up whatever the reStructedText spec is for references, but let’s start with "word characters, dashes, and underscores".
That expressed as a "thing" looks like this:


ELispFont used to highlight strings.
Font used to highlight keywords.
(define-thing-chars rst-ref "[:alpha:]_-")




Now we have a thing called rst-ref we can use with bounds-of-thing-at-point.
In typical emacs fashion, we can run elisp ad-hoc in our editor just to tinker, so let’s do that now.



Remember: we’re trying to write a function to give us the start and end of whatever piece of text we intend for a completion to replace.
Let’s try it out: in any sort of buffer, put a piece of fake .rst text with a reference, like this:


ReSTFont used for field names and interpreted text.
Font used for directives and roles.
This is a :ref:`other-reference`.




Place your point somewhere within "other-reference" and try out your thing:



M-: (bounds-of-thing-at-point 'rst-ref)



You’ll see something like (number . number) in the echo area (the little minibuffer at the bottom of the emacs window frame).
Congratulations!
We’ve got the first part of the problem solved.





Gathering Completions


Recall the structure of what our "completion backend" needs to return to emacs:


ELisp
(START END COLLECTION . PROPS)




We can construct START and END with bounds-of-thing-at-point, now we just need COLLECTION, which is a list of potential candidates.



Conceptually the task isn’t hard: we should find all instances of strings of the form:


ReSTFont used for all other defining constructs.
.. _my-reference:




in our document and capture my-reference.
Where do we start?



Once again you can rely on discovery mechanisms like searching for functions that sound related (by browsing describe-function) or look at existing code.
Personally, I found this:


(re-search-forward REGEXP &optional BOUND NOERROR COUNT)

Search forward from point for regular expression REGEXP.



The documentation refers you to some other related functions, like this one:


(match-beginning SUBEXP)

Return position of start of text matched by last search.
SUBEXP, a number, specifies which parenthesized expression in the last
regexp.



So we can (re-search-forward) for something then invoke (match-beginning 1), for example, if we used a regex capture group to grab the reference’s label.
Cool: we can start there.



As you get deeper into elisp you’ll find that regular expressions are everywhere, and this case is no different.
We need a solid regex to search through a reStructuredText buffer (and honor any quirks in emacs’ regular expression engine), so we’ll use this opportunity to kick the tires on interactively developing regular expressions in emacs.



Regexes


Geriatric millennial software engineers like myself grew up on https://regexr.com/ when it was still a Flash application.
Unless you’re a masochist that lives and breathes regular expressions, it’s kind of hard to develop a good regex without live feedback, which sites like https://regexr.com/ provide.



Little did I know that emacs comes with its own live regular expression builder and it's goooood.



Within any emacs buffer, run M-x re-builder to open the regex builder window split alongside the current buffer.
If I then enter the string "re-\\(builder\\)" into that buffer, that string a) gets highlighted in my original buffer and b) the capture group gets highlighted in its own unique group color.



You can do this all day long to fine-tune a regular expression, but there’s yet another trick when writing regular expressions, which is to use the rx macro.



My previous example regular expression "re-\\(builder\\)" works, but the quirks when writing emacs regular expressions pile up quickly: escaping characters is one example but there are more, too.



Instead, the rx macro will let you define a regular expression in lisp-y form and evaluate it into a typical string-based regular expression you can use normally, so it works any place emacs expects a string-based regular expression.
For example, if you evaluate this with M-::


ELispFont used to highlight strings.
Font used to highlight keywords.
(rx "re-" (group "builder"))




This is what emacs returns:


ELispFont for backslashes in Lisp regexp grouping constructs.
Font used to highlight strings.
"re-\\(builder\\)"




Identical!
The rx documentation explains all the constructs available to you.



Jumping back to re-builder, with the re-builder window active, invoke M-x reb-change-syntax and choose rx.
Now you can interactively build regular expressions with the rx macro!
In the re-builder window, you’ve got to enter a weird syntax to get it to take rx constructs (I’m… not sure why this is), but you end up with the same outcome:


ELispFont used to highlight strings.
'(: "re-" (group "builder"))




Watch the regex get highlighted live just as it was in the string-based regex mode.



To bring this full circle, hop into a buffer with an example .rst document like this one:


ReSTFont used for all other defining constructs.
Font used for the adornment of a section header.
Default font for section title text at level 1.
A Heading
=========

.. _my-reference:

Link to me!




Using our newfound re-builder knowledge, let’s build a regex interactively to make short work of it:



Invoke M-x re-builder
Change the engine to something easier with M-x reb-change-syntax and choose rx
Start trying out solutions



I’ll refer here to the rx constructs documentation which lists out all the possibilities that you can plug into the rx macro.
Here’s a recorded example of what developing it looks like from start to finish, ending up with a functional rx construct:





Live-highlighting regex development.
Nice.
If you add more groups, more colors show up.
In this example the rx constructs I’m using are:



Any strings end up as literal matches
Special symbols bol and eol for "beginning of line" and "end of line", respectively
Symbols like + behave like their regex counterparts ("at least one")
Some symbols like not are nice little shortcuts (in this case, to negate the next form)



Because rx is a macro, we don’t ever actually need to compile its regular expressions to use elsewhere - we can always just use rx when we need a regex.





Gathering Completions: Continued


Okay, we've cut our teeth on emacs regular expressions.
Let's use 'em.
(Not our teeth. Regexes.)



To start, let's save our reStructuredText regular expression to find a ref so we can easily grab it later.
I'll save the one I came up with to the name tmp/re (this name is arbitrary, I drop temporary variables into tmp/<name> out of habit)


ELispFont used to highlight built-in function names.
Font used to highlight strings.
Font used to highlight keywords.
(setq tmp/re (rx bol ".." (+ blank) "_" (group (+ (not ":"))) ":" eol))




Now we can reference it easily.
I mentioned before that re-search-forward accepts a regex, so let's hop into a reStructuredText rev up the regex.



Here's my sample text that I'll work with:


ReSTFont used for directives and roles.
Font used for all other defining constructs.
Font used for the adornment of a section header.
Default font for section title text at level 1.
A Title
=======

Beware the Jabberwock, my son.

.. _my-reference:

You are like a little baby. Watch this.

.. _code-sample:

.. code:: python

   print("emacs needs telemetry")

The end?




The re-search-forward documentation indicates that it starts at the point's current position, so head to the start of the buffer, hit M-: to enter the elisp Eval prompt, and try:


ELispFont used to highlight built-in function names.
(re-search-forward tmp/re)




This is anticlimactic because you'll just see the point move to the end of one of the references.
BUT.
This means that the search succeeded.
So… what now?



More reading in the re-search-forward documentation will educate you about emacs global match data.
In non-functional-programming style, functions like match-beginning and match-end serve to interrogate a global state that functions like re-search-forward will modify.
In concise terms, our regular expression defines one match group and we can grab it with (match-string-no-properties 1) to get the first group match (match-string will return a string with "properties", which is a bunch of data like font styling that we don't want).



Within our example buffer, executing this after the regex search should return our match:


ELispFont used to highlight function names.
(match-string-no-properties 1)




I see "my-reference" from this command.
Now we're cooking like it's 1985, baby.
You can enter the minibuffer again with M-:, press ↑ to find the re-search-forward command again, and repeat this process again to watch the point move to the next match, after which you can see the matched string with match-string-no-properties.



Note that running this a few times will eventually error out after no matches exist past your point.
We'll address this.



If you're a human (or Claude) at this point, you can see the path ahead – we need to write some elisp that will:



Move the point to the beginning of the buffer (important, remember that re-search-forward relies upon the current position of your point)
Iteratively execute an re-search-forward command to aggregate reference targets
Conclude when there aren't any more matches



I'll start with the code and then explain which demons the parentheses are summoning afterward:


ELispFont used to highlight function names.
Font used to highlight strings.
Font used to highlight special form names.
Font used to highlight built-in function names.
Font used to highlight keywords.

    ;; the buffer and we should finish up.
    (cl-loop while (re-search-forward
                    (rx bol ".." (+ blank) "_" (group (+ (not ":"))) ":" eol)
                    ;; The aforementioned `while` termination case
                    ;; relies upon this `t` parameter, which says
                    ;; "don't error out with no matches, just return
                    ;; nil". Once no more matches are found, the loop
                    ;; exits.
                    nil t)
             ;; The `collect` keyword instructs `cl-loop` how to form
             ;; its return value. We can helpfully summarize the regex
             ;; match item by pulling out the global match data.
             collect (match-string-no-properties 1))))




The code is less intimidating without comments:


ELispFont used to highlight function names.
Font used to highlight strings.
Font used to highlight special form names.
Font used to highlight built-in function names.
Font used to highlight keywords.
(save-excursion
  (progn
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (cl-loop while (re-search-forward
                    (rx bol ".." (+ blank) "_" (group (+ (not ":"))) ":" eol)
                    nil t)
             collect (match-string-no-properties 1))))




Without belaboring the point, you can – like I did – discover most of these functions by skimming existing elisp code and using it as a launch pad.
Many of these functions are bog standard and show up all over the place in emacs packages (save-excursion, progn, goto-char…)



Here's the result when I run this code against our example .rst file:


ELispFont used to highlight strings.
("my-reference" "code-sample")




Looks good!




Completing the Completion Backend


We're now armed with the ability to:



Identify the bounds of the string we want to replace, and
Collect a list of targets for completion candidates



We are so close.
Recall the description of the variable we need to modify:


completion-at-point-functions is a variable defined in ‘minibuffer.el’.

Its value is (cape-dict cape-file tags-completion-at-point-function)

Special hook to find the completion table for the entity at point.
Each function on this hook is called in turn without any argument and
should return either nil, meaning it is not applicable at point,
or a function of no arguments to perform completion (discouraged),
or a list of the form (START END COLLECTION . PROPS)



To return the list that completion-at-point-functions expects, we already have the ability to identify the bounds of a thing and sweep up a list of candidates in our buffer.
Note the comment about returning nil: we probably don't always want to run our backend, so we should short-circuit our function to eagerly return nil to avoid tying up emacs with a regex loop we don't need.



With all that said, consider the following:


ELispFont used to highlight special form names.
Font to highlight quoted Lisp symbols.
Font used to highlight built-in function names.
Font used to highlight function names.
Font used to highlight documentation embedded in program code.
It is typically used for special documentation comments or strings.
Font used to highlight function names.
Font used to highlight strings.
Font used to highlight keywords.


;; Our reStructuredText reference "thing"
(define-thing-chars rst-ref "[:alpha:]_-")

(defun my/rst-internal-reference-capf ()
  "Completion backend for buffer reStructuredText references"
  ;; Only applies when we're within a reference - outside of a
  ;; reference, we bail out with nil.
  (when (looking-back (rx ":ref:`" (* (not "`"))) (point-at-bol))
    ;; Get potential bounds for the string to replace
    (let* ((bounds (or (bounds-of-thing-at-point 'rst-ref)
                       ;; Fallback to the current position
                       (cons (point) (point))))
           (start (car bounds))
           (end (cdr bounds))
           ;; Collect all reference candidates
           (candidates
            ;; Our previously-noted reference collector
            (save-excursion
              (progn
                (goto-char (point-min))
                (cl-loop while (re-search-forward
                                (rx bol ".." (+ blank) "_" (group (+ (not ":"))) ":" eol)
                                nil t)
                         collect (match-string-no-properties 1))))))
      ;; Return value suitable for `completion-at-point-functions`
      (list start end candidates))))




We're following some naming conventions by calling this a "capf" (a "completion-at-point function) and prefixing with my/ (a habit to namespace your own functions)
Our short-circuit takes the form of using looking-back to ask, "are we inside of a reStructuredText reference"?
Note the use of rx here again to clean up our lisp.
We use our rst-ref thing to easily snag the start and end of the string to replace – note our fallback to just the immediate point if we can't find the bounds of our thing.



We wrap it all up with list.
Personally, even as somebody relatively new to writing Lisps, I find the code pleasant to read and self-evident.
We did a lot in 17 lines of code!



Inside of our test .rst buffer, we can test drive this function.
First, invoke M-x eval-defun with your cursor somewhere in the function to evaluate it, which makes my/rst-internal-reference-capf available.
Then run:


ELispFont to highlight quoted Lisp symbols.
Font used to highlight variable names.
Font used to highlight function names.
(add-hook 'completion-at-point-functions 'my/rst-internal-reference-capf)




Huzzah!
Our function is now live in emacs' completion framework.
You can trigger the completion by calling completion-at-point at a relevant spot in a buffer.
Many batteries-included emacs distributions like spacemacs or doom emacs slap nice-looking porcelain on top of the completion framework; here's an example that uses the corfu package:





Congratulations, you've extended emacs for the first time!




Dressing Up the Bones

Okay, this is a pretty basic setup.
You could improve it in many ways, but here are a few ideas about potential directions:


Mode Hooks


Manually adding your custom completion function to the completion-at-point-functions hook is tedious, but there's a way to automate it.
Recall that in emacs parlance, a "hook" is usually a variable that holds a list of functions that get called at a specific time.



If you use rst-mode, then opening an .rst file will drop you into rst-mode and implicitly call the rst-mode-hook functions.
That means that this line is sufficient to integrate our completion function:


ELispFont to highlight quoted Lisp symbols.
Font to highlight Lisp quotes.
Font used to highlight keywords.
Font used to highlight variable names.
Font used to highlight function names.
(add-hook 'rst-mode-hook (lambda () 
    (add-hook 'completion-at-point-functions  #'my/rst-internal-reference-capf 0 t)))




This says: "when I open an .rst file, run this lambda that modifies completion-at-point-functions only for this buffer by adding my internal reference completion function".
It's a little nested which makes it less obvious with the two add-hook calls.




Other Files


Okay, our example works for references in the same buffer but this is sort of pointless for uses across files.



You can solve this too, although my post is already too long so we won't solve this step-by-step.
However, here's how I solved it:



Turn my capf into a minor mode that manages the completion variables
Doesn't search the buffer every time but instead does so once and then rebuilds it with a hook in after-change-functions, saving it to a hash cache
Walk all .rst files in the current project and run the reference collection function for each, storing the results into a hash cache for all files that don't have live buffers
When it comes time to call the completion function, combine the hash for completions for files without buffers along with each .rst buffer's cached list of references



It sounds complicated, but it works!
Functions like with-temp-buffer make this pretty easy by aggregating reference targets for files using the exact same function we do for live buffers.


ELispFont used to highlight built-in function names.
Font used to highlight keywords.
(with-temp-buffer
  (insert-file-contents file)
  (my/rst-internal-references))





Fancy Completion


Emacs' long history includes company-mode, which is a third-party completion framework that integrates with the completion-at-point set of functions.
Some company-mode features include additional metadata about completion candidates, and I found two that were useful: company-kind and company-doc-buffer.



company-kind is a simple key that just tells the completion caller what the completion cadidate is.
In our case we can add some eye candy by indicating it's 'text.
company-doc-buffer lets us add additional context to a completion candidate.
I leveraged this to include a couple of lines following the reference line to help me figure out what exactly the link refers to.
It's easier to show what this looks like rather than tell:





Notes:



I'm using GUI emacs here for the nicer completion popup with corfu which displays a transparent, floating frame
My completion candidate "context" is a real excerpt from the text around the reference, complete with styling, etc.
The small icon to the left of each candidate comes from the company-kind attribute.
The ~ syntax is part of orderless



Completion candidate context is an extra frill but very helpful.





Summary

My experience extending a core emacs function was an instructive and interesting exercise.
I don't know what the future of emacs looks like in an increasingly LLM-crazed world, but I hope that future includes an open and powerful way to extend and customize the tools we use to write software.

🔐 How Edison reduces data leakages

🔱 The lethal trifecta, agent lifecycle management
Open Edison includes a comprehensive security monitoring system that tracks the "lethal trifecta" of AI agent risks, as described in Simon Willison's blog post:


Private data access - Access to sensitive local files/data
Untrusted content exposure - Exposure to external/web content
External communication - Ability to write/send data externally


The configuration allows you to classify these risks across tools, resources, and prompts using separate configuration files.
In addition to trifecta, we track Access Control Level (ACL) for each tool call,
that is, each tool has an ACL level (one of PUBLIC, PRIVATE, or SECRET), and we track the highest ACL level for each session.
If a write operation is attempted to a lower ACL level, it can be blocked based on your configuration.
🧰 Tool Permissions (tool_permissions.json)
Defines security classifications for MCP tools. See full file: tool_permissions.json, it looks like:
{
  "_metadata": { "last_updated": "2025-08-07" },
  "builtin": {
    "get_security_status": { "enabled": true, "write_operation": false, "read_private_data": false, "read_untrusted_public_data": false, "acl": "PUBLIC" }
  },
  "filesystem": {
    "read_file": { "enabled": true, "write_operation": false, "read_private_data": true, "read_untrusted_public_data": false, "acl": "PRIVATE" },
    "write_file": { "enabled": true, "write_operation": true, "read_private_data": true, "read_untrusted_public_data": false, "acl": "PRIVATE" }
  }
}

📁 Resource Permissions (`resource_permissions.json`)
Resource Permissions (resource_permissions.json)
Defines security classifications for resource access patterns. See full file: resource_permissions.json, it looks like:
{
  "_metadata": { "last_updated": "2025-08-07" },
  "builtin": { "config://app": { "enabled": true, "write_operation": false, "read_private_data": false, "read_untrusted_public_data": false } }
}


💬 Prompt Permissions (`prompt_permissions.json`)
Prompt Permissions (prompt_permissions.json)
Defines security classifications for prompt types. See full file: prompt_permissions.json, it looks like:
{
  "_metadata": { "last_updated": "2025-08-07" },
  "builtin": { "summarize_text": { "enabled": true, "write_operation": false, "read_private_data": false, "read_untrusted_public_data": false } }
}

Wildcard Patterns ✨
All permission types support wildcard patterns:

Tools: server_name/* (e.g., filesystem/* matches all filesystem tools)
Resources: scheme:* (e.g., file:* matches all file resources)
Prompts: type:* (e.g., template:* matches all template prompts)

Security Monitoring 🕵️
All items must be explicitly configured - unknown tools/resources/prompts will be rejected for security.
Use the get_security_status tool to monitor your session's current risk level and see which capabilities have been accessed. When the lethal trifecta is achieved (all three risk flags set), further potentially dangerous operations are blocked.

                Use the right tool for the job.
            
            

            

            
            
            In my first interview out of college I was asked the change counter problem:

Given a set of coin denominations, find the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given number. IE for USA coinage and 37 cents, the minimum number is four (quarter, dime, 2 pennies).

I implemented the simple greedy algorithm and immediately fell into the trap of the question: the greedy algorithm only works for "well-behaved" denominations. If the coin values were [10, 9, 1], then making 37 cents would take 10 coins in the greedy algorithm but only 4 coins optimally (10+9+9+9). The "smart" answer is to use a dynamic programming algorithm, which I didn't know how to do. So I failed the interview.
But you only need dynamic programming if you're writing your own algorithm. It's really easy if you throw it into a constraint solver like MiniZinc and call it a day. 
int: total;
array[int] of int: values = [10, 9, 1];
array[index_set(values)] of var 0..: coins;

constraint sum (c in index_set(coins)) (coins[c] * values[c]) == total;
solve minimize sum(coins);

You can try this online here. It'll give you a prompt to put in total and then give you successively-better solutions:
coins = [0, 0, 37];
----------
coins = [0, 1, 28];
----------
coins = [0, 2, 19];
----------
coins = [0, 3, 10];
----------
coins = [0, 4, 1];
----------
coins = [1, 3, 0];
----------


Lots of similar interview questions are this kind of mathematical optimization problem, where we have to find the maximum or minimum of a function corresponding to constraints. They're hard in programming languages because programming languages are too low-level. They are also exactly the problems that constraint solvers were designed to solve. Hard leetcode problems are easy constraint problems.1 Here I'm using MiniZinc, but you could just as easily use Z3 or OR-Tools or whatever your favorite generalized solver is.
More examples
This was a question in a different interview (which I thankfully passed):

Given a list of stock prices through the day, find maximum profit you can get by buying one stock and selling one stock later.

It's easy to do in O(n^2) time, or if you are clever, you can do it in O(n). Or you could be not clever at all and just write it as a constraint problem:
array[int] of int: prices = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8];
var int: buy;
var int: sell;
var int: profit = prices[sell] - prices[buy];

constraint sell > buy;
constraint profit > 0;
solve maximize profit;

Reminder, link to trying it online here. While working at that job, one interview question we tested out was:

Given a list, determine if three numbers in that list can be added or subtracted to give 0? 

This is a satisfaction problem, not a constraint problem: we don't need the "best answer", any answer will do. We eventually decided against it for being too tricky for the engineers we were targeting. But it's not tricky in a solver; 
include "globals.mzn";
array[int] of int: numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8];
array[index_set(numbers)] of var {0, -1, 1}: choices;

constraint sum(n in index_set(numbers)) (numbers[n] * choices[n]) = 0;
constraint count(choices, -1) + count(choices, 1) = 3;
solve satisfy;

Okay, one last one, a problem I saw last year at Chipy AlgoSIG. Basically they pick some leetcode problems and we all do them. I failed to solve this one:

Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.


The "proper" solution is a tricky thing involving tracking lots of bookkeeping states, which you can completely bypass by expressing it as constraints:
array[int] of int: numbers = [2,1,5,6,2,3];

var 1..length(numbers): x; 
var 1..length(numbers): dx;
var 1..: y;

constraint x + dx <= length(numbers);
constraint forall (i in x..(x+dx)) (y <= numbers[i]);

var int: area = (dx+1)*y;
solve maximize area;

output ["(\(x)->\(x+dx))*\(y) = \(area)"]

There's even a way to automatically visualize the solution (using vis_geost_2d), but I didn't feel like figuring it out in time for the newsletter.
Is this better?
Now if I actually brought these questions to an interview the interviewee could ruin my day by asking "what's the runtime complexity?" Constraint solvers runtimes are unpredictable and almost always than an ideal bespoke algorithm because they are more expressive, in what I refer to as the capability/tractability tradeoff. But even so, they'll do way better than a bad bespoke algorithm, and I'm not experienced enough in handwriting algorithms to consistently beat a solver.
The real advantage of solvers, though, is how well they handle new constraints. Take the stock picking problem above. I can write an O(n²) algorithm in a few minutes and the O(n) algorithm if you give me some time to think. Now change the problem to

Maximize the profit by buying and selling up to max_sales stocks, but you can only buy or sell one stock at a given time and you can only hold up to max_hold stocks at a time?

That's a way harder problem to write even an inefficient algorithm for! While the constraint problem is only a tiny bit more complicated:
include "globals.mzn";
int: max_sales = 3;
int: max_hold = 2;
array[int] of int: prices = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8];
array [1..max_sales] of var int: buy;
array [1..max_sales] of var int: sell;
array [index_set(prices)] of var 0..max_hold: stocks_held;
var int: profit = sum(s in 1..max_sales) (prices[sell[s]] - prices[buy[s]]);

constraint forall (s in 1..max_sales) (sell[s] > buy[s]);
constraint profit > 0;

constraint forall(i in index_set(prices)) (stocks_held[i] = (count(s in 1..max_sales) (buy[s] <= i) - count(s in 1..max_sales) (sell[s] <= i)));
constraint alldifferent(buy ++ sell);
solve maximize profit;

output ["buy at \(buy)\n", "sell at \(sell)\n", "for \(profit)"];


Most constraint solving examples online are puzzles, like Sudoku or "SEND + MORE = MONEY". Solving leetcode problems would be a more interesting demonstration. And you get more interesting opportunities to teach optimizations, like symmetry breaking.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[August 31, 2025

Over the past several years, I've enjoyed the hobby of paper
modeling (or papercraft), the art
of creating 3D models from cut and glued parts from paper sheets. This hobby is
a superset of origami, in that it allows for cutting and gluing, as well as for
multiple sheets of paper for a single model. The alleviation of these
constraints means that papercraft allows for more complex models that are easier
to assemble.
Over many years, I've built models designed by others as well as designed my
own. In this post, I want to share everything I've learned along the way,
covering the entire process from design to assembly.
I love this hobby for three reasons:

It is extremely accessible. There is no fancy hardware or software
involved. As we'll see, the core tools are paper, scissors, and glue;
everything else is an addon to make the experience better. All software tools
can be free. Accidentally messed up during assembly and need a replacement
part? Just print out another page. The entire creation of a model can be done
in the ballpark of a few cents.
It is equally technical and creative. As we'll see, many of the problems
faced in papercraft require an engineering-like approach and a willingness to
experiment and iterate on designs. While it may appear outwardly like a craft
project, the end-to-end process involves constraints and optimizing within
them.
There's no limits on what you can make. What you decide to build is
limited by your patience and imagination. Theoretically, nearly any object can
be represented as a paper model.

Let's dive in. My most recent model is a papercraft plane inspired by the SR-71
Blackbird, a
reconnaissance plane that to this day holds many records for being one of the
fastest aircrafts ever. It's now one of most iconic planes ever designed and an
engineering masterpiece. The program was ultimately retired in 1999.
The model we'll be desiging and assembling in this post

We're going to walk through the full model design and assembly process, while
referencing specific examples I encountered during creating this SR-71.
Constraints#
Let's set some constraints for how we're allowed to model our creation. These
are self-imposed limitations that fit my preferred-style for model design:

All parts in the assembled model must be made of paper.
Each part must be a single, solid color. The parts must not use any printed
textures or designs.
The model must be represented as a simple
polyhedron. There may be
no curvatures, holes, two-dimensional surfaces, or surface-to-surface contact.
If the figure we're trying to capture has any of these features, we must find
a way to approximate it using only flat faces. The object must be manifold (an
edge is only shared by 2 faces).

Why constraints?#
It may feel weird to impose constraints on an art. However, I find that these
constraints encourage a better designed model that can be assembled easily and
predictably, including by others.
Using features like curvatures, printing with textures, etc. are shortcuts. For
example, printing textures helps fill in details that aren't captured inherently
by the model; curvatures and 2d surfaces are flimsy and introduce variances in
how a model can be assembled. Simply polyhedral designs with single color parts
ensure that the 3D form itself captures the object being depicted, and can be
assembled in a structurally sound, predictable way.
Goals#
In addition to constraints, we also have some goals that we're optimzing for.
These goals will be considered in each step of our design process.

Ease of assembly: By far the most important goal, our model should be
easy to put together. Given the nature of paper and glue, a model that is
difficult to assemble will almost certainly look bad. A model can have a
well-designed topology, but still be difficult to assemble based on the parts
design we put together.
Aesthetic appeal: This is an art, after all. The model we design should
be aesthetically pleasing and resemble the object of interest.
Minimal consumption of resources: We should aim to minimize waste and use
our materials efficiently.

As in engineering, we have to consider trade-offs between these goals, and
optimize for these goals within our constraints.
Steps#
The process of designing a paper model is iterative. Each iteration consists of
the following steps:

Mesh modeling - using software to create a 3D polyhedron mesh of our desired form
Mesh unfolding - unfolding the mesh into a 2D layout of parts
Assembly - putting the parts together to create the final model

The remainder of this article will be walking through each step in detail. The
discussion of each step will be centered around the goals and constraints
declared from above.
Mesh Modeling#
Related goals: Ease of assembly, aesthetic appeal
In this phase, we design the mesh for our model. We aim to capture the essence
of an object in a way that can feasibly be built with paper. Depending on how
you approach this, this can easily be the most complicated step.
What do I mean by "feasibly built with paper"? Our mesh is a collection of
polygons that represent a 3D object. The closeness of that representation is
largely determined by how many polygons we use. We could use many really small
polygons to closely match the subtle curves of our plane, but this would be hard
to assemble in reality. Alternatively, we could simplifiy our representation
down to a triangular pyramid. This would be trivially easy to assemble, but it
wouldn't look a lot like our plane.
We can now see that our goals of ease of assembly and aesthetic appeal are at
odds. Imagine that we have a continuum, where on the left we have a triangular
pyramid (the simplest possible polyhedron) and on the right we have a mesh of
the SR-71 with an arbitrarily high number (millions) of polygons.
Our mesh can exist anywhere between the simplest polyhedron and a mesh with near perfect resolution. The example on the right is by USSIowa on Thingiverse (Creative Commons - Attribution): https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5508640
Generally, an "easy" to assemble model will have somewhere around a few hundred
polygons. Thus, our ideal model exists somewhere on the far left of this
spectrum.
The challenge here is what I call "allocation of resolution" - we have a finite
number of polygons to distribute across the features of our object. Certain
features will naturally require more polygons to be accurately captured than
others. For example, curved features require more polygons than flat features -
in this model, the cylindrical engines will require more detail, than say, the
flat wings.
In addition to the number of polygons and their concentrations, the arrangement
of the polygons themselves matters - this is the topology of the mesh. Most
discourse on 3D mesh topology is related to shading and animation. For our
purposes, we're considered with ease of assembly. Certain topologies are easier
to assemble and more structurally sound. Generally, here's some positive
topological qualities for papercraft:

Symmetries: a good mesh design is symetrical when possible. Symmetrical shapes
are intuitive and easier to reason about when assembling.
No narrow shapes: really narrow shapes are hard to cut out, hard to fold, and
hard to glue. Avoid them at all costs.
Use quads: quad faces have an aesthetic appeal to them.

If all of this is sounding hard, we've got some options, in increasing order of
difficulty:
Easy: Use an existing mesh#
The easiest way past this step is to find an existing mesh. There's a whole
genre of 3D modeling called "low-poly" that you can find with a quick search on
Thingiverse or
Printables. These are
usually designed for video games or 3D printing, but can be taken up for
papercraft.
Medium: Converting an existing mesh#
Sometimes, you can find a high-resolution mesh of your desired object, but not a
low-poly one. In this case, there are tools available to reduce the polygon
count while preserving the overall shape. This is called "mesh simplification"
or "mesh decimation."
This Instructable
goes over the process of doing this with Meshlab,
but there's many other software alternatives out there.
The pitfall of this approach is that automatic mesh decimation typically results
in some nasty topologies, and there's not a lot you can do to control the
output. To get around this, we could add an additional refinement step where
we take the raw decimated mesh output and "clean it up" using a mesh editor
software.
As an example, let's try this with a SR-71 mesh on
Thingiverse. The original mesh has
more than 1.2 million faces, and we're going to try decimating down to ~1,000.
Here's what we get from Meshlab:
Result of mesh decimation in Meshlab
In this case, the output is not usable - it's wildly asymetric and is full of
self-intersections. Refining this topology would take just as long (if not
longer) as creating a model from scratch.
Hard: Creating your own mesh#
The most difficult option is to create your own mesh from scratch. This option
gives you full control over the design, and is what I chose for the SR-71 model.
My software of choice for this is Blender. Blender
has a steep learning curve, but the type of mesh design we're doing for this
project doesn't begin to scratch the surface of its full capabilities. I highly
recommend this low-poly tutorial
if you've never used Blender before and need somewhere to start. Two things I
found very handy were the mirror
modifier
to enforce symmetry, and the 3D Print
Toolbox
to auto-cleanup the mesh and check for manifoldness.
This process is very tedious. My advice here is: simplify your mesh to the point
where you feel uncomfortable. Recall that we're largely optimizing for ease of
assembly. When modeling, it's very tempting to capture finer details, but fine
details have costs (small parts, hard to glue regions, etc.) that are not worth
it during the assembly phase. Scrutinize every feature, and zoom out once in a
while. When you zoom out, your omissions won't feel as weird.
After many days, here's the initial mesh I created. It contains 732 triangles.
Note the symmetry along the y-axis.
Initial mesh created with Blender
Mesh Unfolding#
Related goals: Ease of assembly, minimal consumption of resources
Once we have a mesh, we have to convert it into a 2D template of parts that can
be printed and assembled. This process is called unfolding. Each of the
faces of our mesh are grouped into parts, and the arrangement of our parts
is a layout, or template.
To do this, we're going to turn to software again. The most popular unfolding
tool (and my favorite) is Pepakura
Designer. Pepakura is not free (at the
time of this writing, it's a one time $70 purchase) and it only runs on
Windows. There's also Unfolder for Mac, which is
$30. If you can't use either of these, Blender can save the day again with its
free Paper Model
plugin.
I believe that the unfolding step is one that does not get as much attention as
it deserves. There is a noticable difference between a good template and a bad
one. A good template has parts that make intuitive sense, with logical groupings
and clear flow. The faces themselves are grouped into parts that are easy to cut
out and handle. All of this equates to a better building experience, which means
a better looking model.
Part of unfolding is also deciding the scale of your model. You can make your
model as big or small as you want, but again, ease of assembly should be top of
mind when deciding. A model that's too small will end up with parts that are
hard to cut out and fold. Bigger models are easier to assemble, but you're
limited to the point where the faces of your model must fit on a page.
I ended up making this model 25 inches long. With the original SR-71 being about
107 feet long, this puts our model at around a 1:50 ratio.
Creating many parts#
Let's start off with the creation of parts. In most unfolding software, the
software will auto-unfold for you, and from there you can regroup faces into
whatever parts you want. Here's Pepakura's auto unfold:
Pepakura default unfolding produces complex parts
The parts it generated are pretty complicated, so we have some work to do.
If you have a mesh with nn faces, you can have anywhere from 1 (all the faces
in a single part) to nn total parts (each part is a single face). We want our
model to be easy to assemble, and neither of these extremes are easy.
Rather than trying to fix the number of parts and going from there, I recommend
creating parts that are logical. Identify features that can be captured in a
single part, and go from there. For example, in the SR-71, each engine intake
spike makes sense as a single part. So does the nose cone.
If your mesh has an axis of symmetry, then your parts have symmetrical pairings
as well. The same feature on either side of the axis should be represented with
a mirrored part. In the SR-71, the entire plane is symmetrical on the vertical
axis, so all parts across this axis are mirrored. This is good because once
someone builds one side, they can more easily reason about the other side.
I ended up dividing this model into 42 parts. These parts were carefully divided
in such a way that I felt would make them easier to assemble. If you look at any
part in particular, chances are it'll have a symmetric counterpart.
Finalized parts for the layout
They're arranged pretty haphazardly right now, but we'll cleanup this up in the
next step.
Arranging the parts#
Again, most software will automatically arrange the parts for you as part of
unfolding. Here's the 14 page arrangement Pepakura decided for the parts I created:
Auto arrangement of parts by Pepakura
I highlighted all the parts on the first two pages so you can see where the are
on the finished model. Notice that they're scattered throughout different
sections. That's why I typically don't like auto-arrangement - they're designed
to minimize paper usage, but they often result in a less intuitive assembly
process. You can't look at any particular page and loosely know where its parts
will go.
A good part layout reads like a story. Parts are arranged in a logical
order, with related parts grouped together. I like to arrange mine left to
right, top to bottom on a page. Here's my layout, with the first two pages
highlighted.
Manual arrangement of parts, which now has logical groupings
All the parts that are near each other in the layout are also near each other in
the final assembly. In this case, I even was able to reduce the page count down
to 12 from the starting 14.
Flap structure#
Flaps, or tabs, are the appendages on each part that allow for gluing
parts together. Each flap has a singular counterpart edge that it's glued to -
this is known as an edge/flap pair. Most software will auto-assign a shared
number between an edge and its flap to make identify pairs easy during the
assembly process.
Two edge/flap pairs, with arrows pointing to their matching number IDs
For an edge/flap pair, most unfolding software will allow us to swap the flap
across parts. Doing this strategically is critical for creating an easy to
assemble model, and also has implications for the structural integrity of the
final build.
For example, consider the two example parts shown above. These two parts that
meet at two shared edges, so these parts have two edge/flap pairs between them.
We could arrange the flaps so that one part has both of them:
Arranging both flaps on the same side
We could also interlace the flaps, so each part has one flap on each side.
Arranging flaps as interlaced, with one flap on each part
Interlacing flaps between parts can create a more stable structure, since
there's only one way for the parts to meet. If two flaps are on the same side,
they can over-extend when glued to the edge. That being said, same-side flaps
can be easier to work with, especially when reaching the closing stages of a
model.
In general, I like to using interlaced flaps wherever possible to create an
overall stronger model, and use same-side flaps selectively.
Once we have an arrangement we like, we can export our layout as a PDF.
Assembly#
With our layout PDF ready, we can now print it and move on to assembly. We'll
finally get to see our design come to life.
Materials and Tools#
For our materials, we'll need:

65lb (176 g/m2g/m^2) cardstock: This is the ideal paper weight for creating
sturdy models, while still being thin/flexible enough to pass through a normal
printer and be easy to fold.
Adhesive. My recommended adhesive is tacky glue: it's strong, dries clear, but
is forgiving enough to allow for repositioning during assembly. Specifically,
I use Aleene's Original Tacky
Glue.
I've also had past success with a glue stick.

We'll also need some tools, which I've listed these in order of importance. The
ones with asterisks are essential. Everything else is a nice-to-have.

Printer*: You'll need access to a printer to print the template on the
cardstock. Laser jet printers are great because the prints don't smudge.
Cutting tools*: You'll need a pair of scissors or a craft knife to cut
out the parts. Use sharp tools for clean cuts - it makes a difference.
Ruler*: Cutting/scoring perfectly straight lines is a must. Steel rulers
are great for their consistent edge, and they don't catch against your tools.
That being said, I used a clear plastic ruler for this model. Being able to
see through the ruler helps with alignment.
Scoring tool*: This will help you prepare a part for folding. You can use
a bone folder or scoring wheel. I use an embossing tool I found at a dollar
store, but before that, I used a ballpoint pen than ran out of ink. Anything
with a precise (but not too sharp) tip will do.
Toothpicks: I use toothpicks to spread blobs of glue into thin layers and
get into tight spaces.
Assembly surface: A cutting mat or piece of cardboard will protect your
work surface and give you a stable surface to cut/score your parts.
Tweezers: Tweezers are helpful for handling small parts and getting into
tight spaces, especially while holding parts together as glue dries.

If you want to get fancy, you can also purchase an automatic cutting machine,
like a Cricut or
Silhouette. These machines can precisely
cut/score your parts from cardstock. Getting the template into their software
takes some extra effort, but it results in the best quality parts. I did not use
a machine for this project.
To match the real SR-71, I printed my template on black cardstock. Darker
cardstocks are harder to work with because of the low contrast between the ink
and the paper itself. If you're new to the hobby, I would recommend starting
with a lighter color.
Assembly phases#
The assembly of a model has 4 steps:

Cutting: Cutting the parts out from the paper with your cutting tool of
choice. Scissors are quicker, but the combination of ruler and craft knife
results in cleaner cuts.
Scoring: Running a scoring tool over fold lines to get cleaner folds. This
may be tempting to skip, but I cannot emphasize the importance of this step
enough. Scoring is especially important when dealing with thicker paper.
Folding: Folding the parts in prep for gluing. There's only two types of
folds: mountain folds and valley folds.
Gluing: Gluing the parts together.

How you decide to batch these steps is up to you. For example, you could cut all
the parts out at once, then score all of them, etc. This approach is effective
because you can develop a rhythm by doing each phase only once, so you're not
constantly switching between tools; the downside is that you only get to start
assembly after a pretty lengthy process. Alternatively, you can do it per part:
cut one part out, score it, fold it, and secure it to the assembly. Here, the
pros and cons are flipped: you get to see the model come together quicker, but
there's a lot of context switching between phases. I've tried both of these
approaches, and find that the latter results in a non-negligible increase in the
assembly time of the model.
To strike a balance, the approach I took for this model was performing the
phases at the granularity of sections (engines, wings, fuselage, etc.) of the
model. This approach has the added final step of assembling all the standalone
sections together into the final model.
Here's some pictures I took during the assembly process. In total, assembly took
6-8 hours.

The same part from above, but now scored. Note the visible impressions on the fold lines.

Tips#
Use little glue: When gluing parts together, apply as little glue as
possible. Using too much glue will result in spillover when the flaps/edges are
put together, and this spillover is hard to wipe away from a porous surface like
paper. Too much glue can even result in subtle paper warping. In the recommended
tools, I suggested a toothpick. I apply a small bead of glue to a flap and use
the toothpick to spread it into a thin film. This prevents any spillage and
keeps the model clean.
Start in complex areas: As you progress further in gluing parts together,
the degrees of freedom of your model will reduce. This is why I recommend
starting with more complicated areas of your model where you'll need those
degrees of freedom. In this model, this meant starting with precise features,
like the engine inlet spikes or the vertical stabilizers.
Finish in hidden areas: This goes hand in hand with the tip above. As you
reach to the end of your model, gluing the final parts together can be very
hard, which means the final edges may come out a bit sloppy. Why does this
happen? Any minor imperfections we made throughout the assembly process result
in stresses in our model that will be felt at the end. Gluing the last part may
be challenging because it'll feel misaligned, and it has the added challenge of
attempting to close a 3D object from the outside. That's why I always recommend
choosing an assembly order that results in the last parts being glued in an area
that is out of sight. For the SR-71, that happens to be the underside of the
fuselage.
Final Model#
Here's the final model, displayed on a stand (also made from paper):

Iteration#
No matter how much you scrutinize the modeling and layout phases, you will
inevitably find areas for improvement as you assemble. In the case of the SR-71,
I spotted a few minor assymetries in part tabs, and more importantly, an
opportunity to reduce face count by simplifying the topology of the bottom of
the plane and the nose cone.
I took my mesh back into Blender, and was able to get the triangle count down to
636, which is almost a full 100 faces fewer than the original mesh.
Second mesh iteration in Blender.
Below, you can see the old mesh (left) next to the new mesh (right). It's hard
to tell the difference, yet the new one has almost 15% fewer faces.
First mesh iteration (left) vs. latest mesh iteration (right).
A faster way to iterate is to render the model rather than physically building
it. This allows you to quickly identify and fix visual issues without going
through the hours of assembly. Here's some renders (in Blender) of the final
iteration:
Blender isometric-view rendering of final mesh.
Blender front-view rendering of final mesh.
Conclusion#
In total, the full cycle of designing the mesh, creating the parts layout,
assembly, and subsequent refinement iterations occurred over the course of a few
months. The process is long, but the results are well worth it.
If you're interested in making this model yourself, you can download the PDFs for
the first iteration of the model below. I've included a template for the stand as well.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
All large ships must have insurance, and Ro Marine has provided this in a big way.
The Norwegian company did not have permission to sell insurance but did it anyway — to clients worldwide.
In March, we reported how select ships used false papers to deceive inspectors in NATO countries.
Now, NRK and Dossier Center can reveal how extensive and global the fraud was: over 100 ships have sailed with illegitimate insurance documents from Ro Marine.
“It's very serious and unusual that such a serious fraud happens with the help of a Norwegian company. At worst, it could undermine the trust in the Norwegian maritime industry,” says Thomas Angell Bergh from the Norwegian Maritime Authority.

Most of the fake insurance papers were for ships transporting goods out of Russia, mainly oil.
NRK has contacted dozens of Ro Marine’s clients. Only a few were willing to speak with us.
One of the customers says he was scammed by Ro Marine because he believed the insurance policies he purchased were valid.
Another says that "everyone" knows Ro Marine is fake, but that the ships need Western insurance documents. Such documents can make it easier to sail freely, without Western countries interfering in the transport.
This signature appears time and again on documents issued by Ro Marine.






The search for the owner of the signature led us to a Russian website, where you can download many different signatures. The one used by Ro Marine belongs to a "doctor," says the website.
Norwegian-Russian scam
Behind the global hoax is this man.






His name is Andrey Mochalin, a Russian citizen and resident of St. Petersburg. Mochalin has experience working for a reputable Norwegian insurance company.
In March, he, two Norwegians and a Bulgarian were charged with forging documents and operating an insurance business without a permit. Mochalin is also being investigated for violating international sanctions.
Through an attorney, the Norwegians say they do not understand the charges (see their full response in the fact box later in the article). The Bulgarian tells NRK he is innocent.
For several months, NRK and Dossier Center have tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with Mochalin. At the same time, we investigated Ro Marine's operations. What we found surprised experts.
“Among the worst of the worst”
Sanctions expert David Tannenbaum is shocked by the the scale of it. He knows how far Russia is willing to go to protect its oil exports, which are crucial for funding Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine.
Sanctions against Russia can make it difficult for tankers carrying Russian oil to obtain insurance that is approved in the West. But they are finding ways around it.
This is where Ro Marine enters the picture.
“Seems like Ro Marine is popular with sanctions evaders. You don't have this roster by accident,” says David Tannenbaum from Deep Blue Intelligence. The American company specializes in detecting sanctions evasion.






For Tannenbaum, it appears that Ro Marine primarily serves the shadow fleet or ships engaged in illegal activities or sanctions evasion.
“Is Ro Marine the worst of the worst? I think they're definitely in contention,” he both asks and answers.
Our documentation shows, for example, that Gatik, known as one of the largest players in the Russian shadow fleet, appears to have placed almost all of their ships with Ro Marine.
In addition, six ships linked to the Russian gas giant Novatek have had fake insurance from the Norwegian company. All six have sailed along the Norwegian coast towards the gas facility Arctic LNG2 in Russia, which is sanctioned by the USA. The ships are sanctioned by the EU.
Ships linked to the sanctioned Iranian oil industry and Iranian military have also been customers of Ro Marine.

Dangerous cargo from Russia
Among the cargo ships that have purchased invalid insurance from Ro Marine, we found "Agattu". Here, the vessel is sailing between Denmark and Sweden with explosives in the cargo, bound for Algeria.

Three tonnes of missile weapons were transported from St. Petersburg in Russia, according to Russian port records.
The ship joins the ranks of Ro Marine customers who have contributed to Russia's export revenues by transporting goods from Russian ports. This does not apply to all customers, but the vast majority, according to research by NRK and Dossier Center.
Provoked a NATO country
Not long ago, it was difficult to imagine that ordinary shipping in Europe could lead to military confrontation. Today, the situation is different. European countries may intervene in oil shipments that violate Western sanctions, which are intended to oppose Putin's bloody war in Ukraine. Russia has its countermeasures.
An illustrative example happened to a Ro Marine customer in mid-May: The oil tanker "Blint".
The Estonian navy suspected the ship was sailing without a flag—a clear violation of international regulations. The navy radioed the vessel, but according to Estonian authorities, the captain refused to cooperate.
Suddenly, a Russian fighter jet came whizzing over them, violating the NATO country’s airspace. Instead of stopping, the sanctioned tanker sailed on to the Russian oil port of Primorsk.
This video of the incident is filmed from inside the ship.

    
  
Like many other tankers transporting Russian oil, "Blint" has had fake insurance from Ro Marine, NRK can document.
In this way, Ro Marine has acted in line with the interests of the Russian authorities.
Russia's president, October 2023:
“Thanks to the actions of companies and authorities, the tanker fleet has grown, new mechanisms for payment, insurance and reinsurance of our cargo have been created.”

Researcher Åse Gilje Østensen at the Norwegian Naval Academy tells that “sometimes, entities act in the Russian interest on their own initiative. Sometimes, Putin or other central figures around him have signaled that certain initiatives are welcome. In such cases, actors will often seek to please the regime.”

“Russia is an authoritarian regime that can force civilian actors to assist the regime. Other times, state bodies may be more directly involved. What is the case regarding Ro Marine is difficult to know.”  The Russian Embassy in Norway does not answer NRK's questions about Ro Marine's operations because the company is Norwegian and refers us to the Norwegian authorities. They also do not respond to whether Ro Marine has acted in accordance with the interests of Russian authorities, or any other statements and findings in this case.
The embassy does however choose to point out that the sanctions against the "shadow fleet" are contrary to international law.

Approved by the largest flag state
For several years, the Norwegian company operated without permission and with fake documents without any authorities noticing — neither in Norway nor abroad.
The earliest objectionable activity was in 2021, according to NRK’s investigation.
At that time, Ro Marine applied to be recognized as an insurance company by the world's largest flag state, Panama, despite missing the necessary approval from Norwegian authorities.




NRK has found that most ships among Ro Marine's clients are registered in Panama.




Ro Marine sent the flag state a forged reference, which was originally given to a completely different company, sources tell NRK. With this reference, Ro Marine was recognized by the flag state of Panama in December 2021.

In the time that followed, several flag states were fooled by Ro Marine, including by forged documents that looked like they were from the Norwegian Financial Supervisory Authority.
The illegal activity continued unencumbered until NRK alerted the flag states. 
Russian owner worked many years for a Norwegian company
The Russian owner of Ro Marine, Andrey Mochalin, has gone underground. Mochalin has not responded to any of the numerous inquiries from NRK and Dossier Center.
For over ten years, he worked for a legitimate Norwegian insurance company. Most of the time, he worked from St. Petersburg.
Occasionally, he visited his employer's office in Oslo. Here he is pictured with his former colleagues.

At this time, two of his Norwegian managers also owned another company that offered insurance. This company later became Ro Marine.
A few weeks after Russia's war against Ukraine began in 2022, Ro Marine passed from Norwegian to Russian ownership.
This is when Mochalin bought Ro Marine from the company of the two Norwegians for almost two million NOK.
These two Norwegians, along with Andrey Mochalin and a Bulgarian citizen, are charged with forging documents and conducting illegal insurance business.
Out of respect for the ongoing investigation, the Norwegians did not want to be interviewed by NRK, according to their lawyer.




Ro Marine claimed its address was here at the Norwegian Shipowners' Association building in Oslo, but according to the association, that was not correct.




Money trail in Russia
Alongside the Norwegian company Ro Marine, Andrey Mochalin runs a company in St. Petersburg with direct links to Ro Marine.
NRK and Dossier Center have obtained access to bank documents for his Russian company.
The money transfers are many, and some stand out.
Last year, there were 36 payments totaling approximately five million NOK that we can connect to Ro Marine. 
The bank transfers were marked with the name of the ship and the policy number.

The number corresponds to insurance documents issued by Ro Marine.

The company’s account also shows salary payments to Mochalin.
Those charged






Here’s what we can share about the Russian Andrey Mochalin and the others charged in the case (in parentheses is the time period they had official roles in Ro Marine):
A. Mochalin (2022-2025): 

Sole owner of Ro Marine during the period when the company's illegal insurance activities were most widespread, according to our documentation.
Majority owner of the Russian company that received payments worth millions of NOK last year marked for Ro Marine.

Norwegian 1 (2016-2023): 

Registered as co-owner in the Russian company that last year received payments worth millions of NOK marked for Ro Marine.
Owner and board chairman in 2021 when someone sent a forged reference on behalf of Ro Marine to Panama. At the time the company lacked a permit to sell insurance.
In 2024, a year after he left the board, contributed to ensuring Ro Marine’s continued operations by securing a new board member: the charged Bulgarian.

Norwegian 2 (2017-2023): 

Owner and managing director in 2021 when someone sent a forged reference on behalf of Ro Marine to Panama. At the time the company lacked a permit to sell insurance.

Bulgarian (2024-2025): 

Car mechanic without any experience in marine insurance.
Tenant of Norwegian 1 for years.
Board member in Ro Marine for over half a year, up to March 2025.

After the Norwegians left the board in 2023, the Norwegian company had a problem. With a Russian as the only board member, the company was in violation of the Companies Act of Norway, which requires at least one board member to be from an EEA country. Since Bulgaria is a member of the EEA, the Bulgarian could solve the issue.
According to the Bulgarian, his Norwegian landlord arranged the board position to help him financially.
However, he never received the money he was promised and left the board because he realized something was wrong, the Bulgarian says. He does not understand the police's suspicion towards him.
“I had no idea what they were doing. I have nothing to hide,” says the Bulgarian to NRK. He has been contacted by the police and says he is fully cooperating with them.


The consequences of uncovering the scam
After NRK's revelation in March, several flag states have issued stop orders to ships that used Ro Marine.
Panama alone has banned 16 ships from sailing because the ships have not shown new, real insurance within the deadline they were given.
The UK has sanctioned Ro Marine. Ro Marines’s website has been taken down. In July, the Oslo District Court forcibly dissolved the company for breach of accounting obligations, because Ro Marine had not submitted annual accounts for 2023.
However, the Russian company in St. Petersburg, which received payments worth millions of NOK marked for Ro Marine, is still active.
One month after NRK's revelation in March, another ship in the Russian shadow fleet presented a fake insurance certificate from Ro Marine. Inspectors at the oil port of Primorsk were presented with a document "signed in Oslo."
The expiration date of the fake insurance?
April next year.
NRK has contacted the companies that operate the mentioned ships "Agattu" and "Blint", with no response. We have not been able to contact Gatik. Novatek has not responded to our questions.
