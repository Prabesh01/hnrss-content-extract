  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Migrating Dillo from GitHub&lt;/head&gt;Written on 2025-11-30 by Rodrigo Arias Mallo&lt;p&gt;I would like to migrate the Dillo project away from GitHub into a new home which is more friendly to be used with Dillo and solves some of its problems. This page summarizes the current situation with GitHub and why I decided to move away from it into a self-hosted server with multiple mirrors in other forges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into the details, I would like to briefly mention what happened with the old site. The original Dillo website was at dillo.org, which also had the source code of Dillo in a mercurial repository at hg.dillo.org. But it also included the mail server used to reach the developers, a bug tracker and archives for the mailing list. However, in 2022 the domain was lost and someone else decided to buy it to put a similar site but plaged with AI generated ads. The original developers are no longer active, but luckily I had a copy of the mercurial repository and with some help I was able to recover a lot of material from the original server (some parts are still missing to this day).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to avoid this situation as much as possible, so we cannot rely on a single site that can go down and the whole project become lost. Initially, I uploaded the Dillo source and website to git repositories on GitHub, but I no longer think this is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The situation with GitHub&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;GitHub has been useful to store all repositories of the Dillo project, as well as to run the CI workflows for platforms in which I don't have a machine available (like Windows, Mac OS or some BSDs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it has several problems that make it less suitable to develop Dillo anymore. The most annoying problem is that the frontend barely works without JavaScript, so we cannot open issues, pull requests, source code or CI logs in Dillo itself, despite them being mostly plain HTML, which I don't think is acceptable. In the past, it used to gracefully degrade without enforcing JavaScript, but now it doesn't. Additionally, the page is very resource hungry, which I don't think is needed to render mostly static text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another big problem is that it is a single point of failure. I don't mean that GitHub is stored in a single machine, but it is controlled by a single entity which can unilateraly ban our repository or account and we would lose the ability to notify in that URL what happened. This can cause data loss if we don't have a local copy of all the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the usability side, the platform has become more and more slow over time, which is affecting the development process. It also requires you to have a fast Internet connection at all times, which is not the case for me sometimes. Additionally, GitHub seems to encourage a "push model" in which you are notified when a new event occurs in your project(s), but I don't want to work with that model. Instead, I prefer it to work as a "pull model", so I only get updates when I specifically look for them. This model would also allow me to easily work offline. Unfortunately, I see that the same push model has been copied to alternative forges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the social side, I feel that it doesn't have the right tools to moderate users, specially for projects where the ratio of non-technical users to developers is high. This is specially problematic when active issues with developer notes begin to be filled with comments from users that have never contributed to the project and usually do more harm than good. This situation ends up causing burnout in developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, GitHub seem to follow the current trend of over-focusing on LLMs and generative AI, which are destroying the open web (or what remains of it) among other problems. It has a direct impact on us because sites protect themseves with a JavaScript wall (or worse, browser fingerprinting) to prevent aggresive LLM crawler bots from overloading the site, but they also leave Dillo users out. So I would prefer not to encourage this trend. Despite my intentions, moving Dillo away won't change much their capability to train their model with our code, but at least I won't be actively helping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Self-hosting Dillo&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;After researching the available options, it seems that none of the current forges would allow us to have a redundant system that can prevent the forge from becoming a single point of failure and solve the rest of the problems with GitHub. Therefore, I decided to self-host Dillo myself, move all important data to git repositories and keep them synchronized in multiple git mirrors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to buy the dillo-browser.org domain name and setup a very small VPS. Initially, I was very skeptical that it would be able to survive on today's web, but it seems to be doing an acceptable job at handling it (mostly AI bot traffic masquerading as users). The Dillo website is available here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I researched which git frontends may suit our needs, and I discovered that most options are very complicated to self-host and require a lot of server resources and JavaScript on the frontend. I ended up testing cgit, which is written in C and it seems to be very lightweight both on RAM and CPU usage. Furthermore, the web frontend doesn't require JS, so I can use it from Dillo (I modified cgit CSS slightly to work well on Dillo). It is available on this URL:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://git.dillo-browser.org/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the bug tracker, I also took a look at the available options. They are all too complicated for what I would like to have and they seem to centralize the data into a database that can get lost. This is precisely the case that happened with the old dillo bug tracker and we are still unable to recover the original bug entries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid this problem, I created my own bug tracker software, buggy, which is a very simple C tool that parses plain Markdown files and creates a single HTML page for each bug. All bugs are stored in a git repository and a git hook regenerates the bug pages and the index on each new commit. As it is simply plain text, I can edit the bugs locally and only push them to the remote when I have Internet back, so it works nice offline. Also, as the output is just an static HTML site, I don't need to worry about having any vulnerabilities in my code, as it will only run at build time. You can see it live here, with the exported issues from GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://bug.dillo-browser.org/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mailing list archives are stored by three independent external services, but I might include a copy with our own archives in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Setting up mirrors&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;As all the important data is now stored in git repositories, we can mirror them in any forge, without having to rely on their custom storage format for the issues or other data. If a forge goes down (or goes rogue) we can simply switch to another site with low switching cost. To this end, I have created git mirrors in Codeberg and Sourcehut that are synced with our git server:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Codeberg: https://codeberg.org/dillo/&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Sourcehut: https://git.sr.ht/~dillo/&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, we still have a single point of failure: the DNS entry of the dillo-browser.org domain. If we lose the DNS entry (like with dillo.org) it would cause a problem as all services will be unreachable. We could recover from such situation by relying on alternative ways to reach users, by the mailing list, fediverse or IRC, as well as updating the mirrors to reflect the current situation. It is not ideal, but I don't think it would cause a catastrophic data loss (like it happened before) as all the data is now stored in git and replicated across independent locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;OpenPGP signature&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order for this page to have some authority, the HTML file is signed with my GPG key (32E65EC501A1B6FDF8190D293EE6BA977EB2A253), which is the same that I use to sign the last releases of Dillo and is also listed in my GitHub user. The signature is available here and is linked to the page with the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag using the &lt;code&gt;rel=signature&lt;/code&gt;
relation. You can find more information and how to verify the signature in the
Dillo RFC-006.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using OpenPGP signatures is robust against losing the DNS entry, as the authority is not given by the TLS certificate chain but by the trust in the OpenPGP signature, so we could move the site elsewhere and still claim that is owned by us. Additionally, as we can store the signatures inside all git mirrors, they are also resilient against data loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Closing remarks&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the migration process requires several moving parts and it will take a while for it to stabilize (switching costs). The GitHub repositories won't be removed at any point in time and they will continue to be updated until we finish the migration. When the migration process is completed, I will mark the Dillo repositories as archived and properly comunicate it in our site. It is important that we don't remove any commit or tarball release to avoid breaking downstream builds that still rely on the GitHub URL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I'm glad that we can have our own fully independent and self-hosted site with relatively low expenses and very little energy cost (which is good for the environment, but probably not even noticeable at large scale). With the current DNS and server costs and our current donations I consider that it is likely that we can continue covering the expenses for at least the next 3 years in the worst case scenario.

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;One Tech Tip: Modern cars are spying on you. Here’s what you can do about it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;One Tech Tip: Modern cars are spying on you. Here’s what you can do about it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While driving to a new restaurant, your car’s satellite navigation system tracks your location and guides you to the destination. Onboard cameras constantly track your face and eye movements. When another car veers into your path, forcing you to slam on the brakes, sensors are assisting and recording. Waiting at a stoplight, the car notices when you unbuckle your seat belt to grab your sunglasses in the backseat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern cars are computers on wheels that are becoming increasingly connected, enabling innovative new features that make driving safer and more convenient. But these systems are also collecting reams of data on our driving habits and other personal information, raising concerns about data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is what to know about how your car spies on you and how you can minimize it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How cars collect data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to figure out exactly how much data a modern car is collecting on you, according to the Mozilla Foundation, which analyzed privacy practices at 25 auto brands in 2023. It declared that cars were the worst product category that the group had ever reviewed for privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern cars are spying on you. AP’s Kelvin Chan reports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The data points include all your normal interactions with the car — such as turning the steering wheel or unlocking doors — but also data from connected onboard services, like satellite radio, GPS navigation systems, connected devices, telematics systems as well as data from sensors or cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vehicle telematics systems started to become commonplace about a decade ago, and the practice of automotive data collection took off about five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem is not just that data is being collected but who it’s provided to, including insurers, marketing companies and shadowy data brokers. The issue surfaced earlier this year when General Motors was banned for five years from disclosing data collected from drivers to consumer reporting agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission accused GM of not getting consent before sharing the data, which included every instance when a driver was speeding or driving late at night. It was ultimately provided to insurance companies that used it to set their rates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Be aware&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing drivers should do is be aware of what data their car is collecting, said Andrea Amico, founder of Privacy4Cars, an automotive privacy company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, drivers would read through the instruction manuals and documentation that comes with their cars, and quiz the dealership about what’s being collected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it’s not always practical to do this, and manufacturers don’t always make it easy to find out, while dealership staff aren’t always the best informed, Amico said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy4Cars offers a free auto privacy labeling service at vehicleprivacyreport.com that can summarize what your car could be tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Owners can punch in their car’s Vehicle Identification Number, which then pulls up the automaker’s data privacy practices, such as whether the car collects location data and whether it’s given to insurers, data brokers or law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tweak your settings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data collection and tracking start as soon as you drive a new car off the dealership lot, with drivers unwittingly consenting when they’re confronted with warning menus on dashboard touch screens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experts say that some of the data collection is baked into the system, you can revoke your consent by going back into the menus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There are permissions in your settings that you can make choices about,” said Lauren Hendry Parsons of Mozilla. “Go through on a granular level and look at those settings where you can.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, Toyota says on its website that drivers can decline what it calls “Master Data Consent” through the Toyota app. Ford says owners can opt to stop sharing vehicle data with the company by going through the dashboard settings menu or on the FordPass app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BMW says privacy settings can be adjusted through the infotainment system, “on a spectrum between” allowing all services including analysis data and none at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;You can opt out&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drivers in the U.S. can ask carmakers to restrict what they do with their data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under state privacy laws, some carmakers allow owners across the United States to submit requests to limit the use of their personal data, opt out of sharing it, or delete it, Consumer Reports says. Other auto companies limit the requests to people in states with applicable privacy laws, the publication says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can file a request either through an online form or the carmaker’s mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also go through Privacy4Cars, which provides a free online service that streamlines the process. It can either point car owners to their automaker’s request portal or file a submission on behalf of owners in the U.S., Canada, the European Union, Britain and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;... but there will be trade-offs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experts warn that there’s usually a trade-off if you decide to switch off data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most people, for example, have switched to satellite navigation systems over paper maps because it’s “worth the convenience of being able to get from point A to point B really easily,” said Hendry Parsons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turning off location tracking could also halt features like roadside assistance or disable smartphone app features like remote door locking, Consumer Reports says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BMW advises that if an owner opts to have no data shared at all, “their vehicle will behave like a smartphone in flight mode and will not transmit any data to the BMW back end.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When selling your car&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the time comes to sell your car or trade it in for a newer model, it’s no longer as simple as handing over the keys and signing over some paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve got a newer car, experts say you should always do a factory reset to wipe all the data, which will also include removing any smartphone connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And don’t forget to notify the manufacturer about the change of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amico said that’s important because if you trade in your vehicle, you don’t want insurers to associate it with your profile if the dealer is letting customers take it for test drives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Now your record may be affected by somebody else’s driving — a complete stranger that you have no relationship with.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;____&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;GitHub → Codeberg: my experience&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Published . Estimated reading time: 11 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In which I talk about the process involved in switching forges, and how well that went.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: this very site that you’re reading this on is not served from GitHub Pages anymore! At this point, I’d call my migration successful. But it took more than clicking a single button, so let’s talk about the steps involved, at least for me. I’m hoping that it can help be an example for other people, and show that it’s actually not that complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;(My) migration process&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, I took an hour or so to set up my profile picture, email address(es), SSH keys…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step 1: migrating the repos&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This wasn’t difficult, because Forgejo (the forge software that powers Codeberg) offers a “migrate from GitHub” functionality. You need to generate a PAT on GitHub to import things like issues (which is awesome!), and as a bonus it also speeds up the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was, however, tedious, because the process was entirely manual (perhaps there’s a way to automate it, like by using some Forgejo CLI tool, but I didn’t bother looking into that). And, due to GitHub API rate limits, whenever I tried importing two repos at the same time, one or both would fail. (It wasn’t too bad, though, since I could fill out the migration page for the next while one was in progress; and generally, it took me roughly as long to fill it out as it took Codeberg to perform the import.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m really happy that issues, PRs, wikis, and releases can be imported flawlessly: this makes it possible to not have to refer to GitHub anymore!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step 2: repointing links to Codeberg&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course I don’t control all links that point to my stuff, but I could at least run &lt;code&gt;rg -F github.com/ISSOtm&lt;/code&gt; in my home directory, to catch those within my own repos. It’s possible to automate the replacing process:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…and if you’re feeling like bulk-replacing all files in a directory:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Repositories, however, may still be pointing to GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt; 
 )
 )
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can either manually &lt;code&gt;git remote set-url origin git@codeberg.org:ISSOtm/rsgbds.git&lt;/code&gt; (or the equivalent if you’re using HTTPS), or use one of the replace commands above, since remote URLs are stored textually:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Within a single repo:

# For all repos within the current directory: (requires `shopt -s globstar` if using Bash)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…then it’s a matter of pushing the changes to all of the repos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step 3: stubbing out the GitHub repos&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also wanted to make it clear that my repos were now living on Codeberg; so, I created a little script in an empty directory:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/bash
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, to run it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt; 
 
 
 
 
# ...etc.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The automation made it not painful, so this went pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step 4: porting CI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, onto the harder stuff :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first interesting thing that I noticed is this section of Codeberg’s CI documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Running CI/CD pipelines can use significant amounts of energy. As much as it is tempting to have green checkmarks everywhere, running the jobs costs real money and has environmental costs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Unlike other giant platforms, we do not encourage you to write “heavy” pipelines and charge you for the cost later. We expect you to carefully consider the costs and benefits from your pipelines and reduce CI/CD usage to a minimum amount necessary to guarantee consistent quality for your projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That got me to think about which projects of mine really need CI, and ultimately, I decided that I would only need CI for publishing my website, and the documentation of gb-starter-kit and fortISSimO; the rest of my projects don’t get contributions anyway, so I can live without CI on them, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, Codeberg actually has two different CI solutions: Woodpecker, and Forgejo Actions; the former seems to be more powerful, but you need to apply for access, and the latter is very close to GitHub Actions, which should facilitate the migration. So I picked Forgejo Actions, even though it’s marked as being in beta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not very difficult to port a YAML file from GHA to Forgejo Actions; for example, look at the commit porting gb-starter-kit’s publishing CI. (This doesn’t really appear as a diff, since I’ve moved the file; but it’s small, so it’s easy to compare manually.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some salient points:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Actions are normally just referred to as &lt;code&gt;owner/repo&lt;/code&gt;, but Forgejo supports cloning any Git repo, especially across forges. It’s actually recommended to use full URLs always, so you don’t rely on the default prefix, which is configurable by the instance admin and thus not necessarily portable.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I could have kept the files in &lt;code&gt;.github/workflows&lt;/code&gt;, since Forgejo picks up that directory automatically if&lt;code&gt;.forgejo/workflows&lt;/code&gt;doesn’t exist; however, I think it’s more convenient to keep un-migrated scripts in&lt;code&gt;.github&lt;/code&gt;and migrated ones in&lt;code&gt;.forgejo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Most Actions (the individual steps, not the workflow files) actually work out of the box on Forgejo Actions. Nice!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Codeberg’s runners differ from GitHub’s significantly: they have way less software installed by default, fewer resources, and only Linux runners are provided (Ubuntu by default, but you can use any Docker container image). macOS and Windows being non-free OSes, Codeberg has no plans to offer either of those! For both philosophical and financial reasons. If this is a deal-breaker for you, consider cross-compiling, or bringing your own runner.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unless low latency is crucial, consider using the lazy runners for better load balancing and possibly greener energy consumption. In practice I haven’t seen delays beyond a few minutes, which is acceptable to me.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I actually spent some extra time trying to use less compute to perform my CI jobs, somewhat motivated by the small size of the runners, and because I’m guessing that the smaller the runner you’re picking, the faster your job will be able to be scheduled. Here is one such commit; note in particular line 50, where I tried1 using a Docker image with LaTeX preinstalled, which saves the time taken by &lt;code&gt;apt install&lt;/code&gt; and requires fewer writes to the filesystem, freeing up RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, due to a version discrepancy with &lt;code&gt;noweb&lt;/code&gt;, I had to revert to the base Ubuntu image; but a “regular” LaTeX workflow would have had no problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Step 5: re-hosting my website&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the previous steps were done within the span of a few days; however, since my website (this very website) was hosted using GitHub Pages, I couldn’t migrate its repos (yes, plural: you can configure individual repos to be published separately, which is how e.g. https://eldred.fr/fortISSimO is published, despite not being in the website’s main repo).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nominally, Codeberg has an equivalent, Codeberg Pages; however, as mentioned on that page, &lt;quote&gt;the software behind this feature is currently in maintenance mode&lt;/quote&gt;, because of complexity and performance issues2. So I left it at that for roughly a month, hoping there’ll eventually be an update. Also, subprojects are published as subdomains instead of subdirectories, which would have broken links (e.g. &lt;code&gt;http://eldred.fr/fortISSimO&lt;/code&gt; would have become &lt;code&gt;http://fortISSimO.eldred.fr&lt;/code&gt;). Meh…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then (by chance lol) I discovered git-pages and its public instance Grebedoc3! It functions much like GitHub Pages, though with a bit more setup since it’s not integrated within the forge itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;git-pages actually has several niceties:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;My website had zero downtime during the entire migration, as git-pages supports uploading your website before updating your DNS records!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It also supports server-side redirects, which lets me redirect people who still go to http://eldred.fr/gb-asm-tutorial/* to its new home, for example. People have been getting 404s because of incomplete client-side coverage on my side, but no more!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It also also supports custom headers; I’m not particularly interested in CORS, but I’ve used that file to pay my respects4.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, and also, Codeberg’s November 2025 newsletter mentions that &lt;quote&gt;Codeberg is planning to gradually migrate to [git-pages]&lt;/quote&gt;. Exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m actually much happier using this than GitHub Pages; so, I’ve joined Catherine’s Patreon, because I want to see this go far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To quote Catherine’s motivation for creating git-pages: &lt;quote&gt;I started out wanting to just use Codeberg Pages and then I found out that Codeberg Pages is in maintenance mode and has such poor architecture that not only does it have rather low uptime but it also regularly crashes Codeberg’s Forgejo instance itself.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;🦃. It is intensely looking at you…….&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is some context as to what this means.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Time tracking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steps 1 through 3 (migrating the repos) took me the better part of an afternoon; step 4 (porting CI) took me another afternoon, mostly to learn the new CI system; and step 5 (the website) took me… well, it should have taken an afternoon, but I used the opportunity to also pay down some tech debt (merging my slides repo into my main website), which took a few days due to required rearchitecting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All in all, even with 45 repos migrated, this basically took a weekend. And I didn’t find it annoying!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the task seemed really daunting, my anxiety caused me to procrastinate this a lot, but in the end it was little work. One of the reasons I’m writing this is to let other people know that, so they can overcome their own anxiety. Maybe. :P&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What now?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All in all, I’m very happy with this migration! As far as I can tell, nothing on this website has broken, and I’ve tried reasonably containing the breakage over on GitHub: I have truncated the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branches, but all other branches and tags remain in place (mostly due to laziness lol), permalinks (e.g. &lt;code&gt;https://github.com/ISSOtm/gb-bootroms/blob/c8ed9e106e0ab1193a57071820e46358006c79d0/src/dmg.asm&lt;/code&gt;) still work, only non-perma links (e.g. &lt;code&gt;https://github.com/ISSOtm/gb-bootroms/blob/master/src/dmg.asm&lt;/code&gt;) are broken, but those are unreliable in the first place anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since that means that all of my code is still on GitHub, I want to delete my repos; but that would be a bad idea at this point, due to leaving no redirects or anything. I’ll consider that again in… idk, a year or something. I would also like to delete my GitHub account (like I have deleted my Twitter account when… *gestures vaguely*), but not only do I need my repos to be up, I also need my account to contribute to projects that are still on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One downside of this migration is that since I’m moving off of The Main Forge, my projects are likely to get fewer contributions… But I wasn’t getting many in the first place, and some people have already made accounts on Codeberg to keep contributing to my stuff. Likewise, I’m not really worried about discoverability. We’ll see I guess lol 🤷♂️&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, I’m writing this after the migration, and I haven’t really taken notes during it; so, if I’ve forgotten any steps, feel free to let me know in the comments below or by opening an issue, and I’ll edit this article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Special thanks&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An AI-powered supply chain compliance engine&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;San Francisco - In Person&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re RetailReady (YC W24), an AI-powered supply chain compliance engine shaking up an antiquated (and yes, unsexy) industry. Since YC, we raised a $3.3M seed round and signed over 15 enterprise customers… we’re officially in scaling mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RetailReady is the first AI-powered compliance engine designed for retail supply chains. We automate the messy web of compliance requirements between brands, warehouses, and retailers, turning weeks of manual work into minutes of automation. Our platform integrates deeply with warehouse operations and connects with customer systems via EDI and APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t just build dashboards. We build the nervous system of compliance inside a warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re hiring an Associate Product Manager to work directly with our Technical Product Lead and drive day-to-day product execution. You’ll own QA, write clear specs, organize feedback, and keep features moving across engineering and customers. This role is built for someone who wants to grow into a full PM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bonus: supply chain or 3PL experience, QA background, implementation experience, or exposure to EDI/APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RetailReady is building an AI-powered supply chain compliance engine. Supply chains are still heavily reliant on paper processes and tribal knowledge, causing costly shipping mistakes that jeopardize the longevity of businesses. RetailReady is the first-to-market with our retail compliance packing software, leveraging camera vision to direct warehouses to ship orders without error. We are positioning our compliance data models to become the operating system that will power the next wave of warehouse robotics and automation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Sentinel-1D delivers first images: from Antarctica to Bremen&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first high-resolution images have been received from Copernicus Sentinel-1D and were shared publicly for the first time at the European Space Agency’s Ministerial Council, held today in Bremen, Germany. Glaciers in Antarctica, the tip of South America, as well as the city of Bremen, are visible in these stunning radar images.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission saw the arrival in orbit of its latest satellite earlier in November: Sentinel-1D was launched on 4 November, on board an Ariane 6 launcher from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once in orbit, the satellite and its instruments – it carries a 12 m-long synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instrument – were switched on, ready to capture images during a pass over the Antarctic and South America two days after launch. On the night of 6 November (European time), the first images were captured over the Antarctic Peninsula, the Tierra del Fuego and the Thwaites Glacier. Some six hours later, on the morning of 7 November, Sentinel-1D also captured images over Bremen, in Germany. The data was then transmitted, or ‘downlinked’, from the satellite to the ground station, in Matera (Italy), which is part of the Copernicus Ground Segment. All this was done within 50 hours of launch, which is likely to be the shortest time from launch to data delivery for a radar-based Earth observation satellite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Nuno Miranda, ESA’s Sentinel-1 Mission Manager, the images are of unprecedented data quality for a ‘first light’ acquisition. They are very similar to the images captured not so long ago by Sentinel-1C, which, according to Nuno, is very promising for the commissioning phase. He noted, “These images have been downlinked and processed within an exceptionally short timeframe. Some of us remember that when Sentinel-1B was launched, it delivered its first radar images within two hours of activation. Sentinel-1D achieved this in an even faster time, setting what we believe is a new record for space radar. This remarkable performance reflects the dedication and exceptional preparation of all the teams involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Radar instruments can image Earth’s surface through clouds, precipitation, regardless of sunlight, making them particularly well suited for monitoring polar regions. The Sentinel-1C and -1D satellites also carry an Automatic Identification System (AIS) instrument – improving the mission capacity to detect ships and sea pollution. The Sentinel-1D AIS was also activated as the satellite passed over Antarctica capturing the presence of ships in these extreme areas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;First images show fragility of glaciers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Antarctic Peninsula (above) is part of the larger peninsula of West Antarctica, protruding 1300 km. It is an ice sheet resting on a string of rocky islands and its tip is just 1000 km from the southern tip of South America. The Antarctic Peninsula ice sheet is one of the smallest ice sheets in Antarctica but is perhaps the most vulnerable to climate change as its glaciers are small and in a region of rapid warming. Observable changes such as collapsing ice shelves, thinning and accelerating glaciers are all key indicators of climate change in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This image is in black and white, showing the contrast between the ocean and the peninsula’s icy landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tierra del Fuego (above) is an archipelago off the southern tip of the South American continent. It covers territory in both Argentina to the east and in Chile to the west and is separated from the mainland by the Magellan Strait. The most southerly point of Tierra del Fuego is Cape Horn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bright contrasting colours in this image are created by using multiple types of radar wave, known polarisations. In this image the ocean and snowy peaks are shown in shades of blue, while the land appears yellow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Thwaites Glacier, and the adjacent Pine Island Glacier (above), are located west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Both are vulnerable to climate change. Thwaites is one of the most unstable glaciers in Antarctica and is at risk of rapid retreat. The details shown in this image from Sentinel-1D remind us of the fragility of glaciers in the Antarctic. And since 2025 is the United Nation’s International Year of Glaciers' Preservation, it is timely to see this image, captured on 6 November 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This image also uses multiple radar polarisations to capture enhanced data on the landscape. In this image, the sea ice in the water is visible in tones of purple or violet, while the glacier appears white.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The publication of these images also follows the 30th meeting of the Conference of Parties, or COP30, where the consequences of climate change and the mitigating actions needed were discussed. The World Meteorological Organization’s State of the Climate Update for COP30 notes that glaciers, from October 2023 to September 2024, lost the largest amount of ice on record back to 1950. The report states this is equivalent to 1.2 mm of global mean sea-level rise. The report also notes that, on 24 February 2025, the extent of Antarctic sea-ice reached its third lowest extent since satellite records began in 1978, the lowest being in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simonetta Cheli, Director of ESA’s Earth Observation Programmes, said, “This is a great achievement and I am so pleased to see these results from Sentinel-1D. It really places the data we receive from our innovative missions in the spotlight – it is data that we as a society rely upon as we continue to discuss and take action on climate change, and also data that we need in applications for understanding and studying our planet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The Sentinel-1 team has done an amazing job and I would like to thank everyone within ESA, together with our partners in the space industry and European institutions, for delivering work of such high quality. It’s an honour to deliver this mission for the Copernicus Earth observation programme, and we thank the Commission for their support and collaboration. We look forward also to developing the Sentinel missions of the future, to further extend the capacity and potential of Copernicus for Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ESA’s Sentinel-1 Project Manager, Ramón Torres, expressed the whole team’s pride, “Unveiling the first images from Sentinel-1D is an incredibly emotional milestone for all of us. The sense of awe and fulfilment goes beyond the thrill of liftoff itself, because seeing those breathtaking images from the SAR instrument brings our hard work to life. They are not just pictures – they are proof of our vision becoming reality, underlining how cutting-edge this mission truly is. The fact that these stunning images also confirm the satellite’s health and flawless operation fills us with relief and joy. And to have achieved all of this within an astonishingly short time – just over two days after launch – makes this moment even more unforgettable for our team.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Spring 2025 (227-0003-10L)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome to the wiki for Digital Design and Computer Architecture for Spring 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Announcements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Course Information&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Description&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The class provides a first introduction to the design of digital circuits and computer architecture. It covers technical foundations of how a computing platform is designed from the bottom up. It introduces various execution paradigms, hardware description languages, and principles in digital design and computer architecture. The focus is on fundamental techniques employed in the design of modern microprocessors and their hardware/software interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Objectives&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This class provides a first approach to Computer Architecture. The students learn the design of digital circuits in order to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;understand the basics,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;understand the principles (of design),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;understand the precedents (in computer architecture).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on such understanding, the students are expected to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;learn how a modern computer works underneath, from the bottom up,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;evaluate tradeoffs of different designs and ideas,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;implement a principled design (a simple microprocessor),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;learn to systematically debug increasingly complex systems,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;hopefully be prepared to develop novel, out-of-the-box designs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The focus is on basics, principles, precedents, and how to use them to create/implement good designs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;# Writing a good CLAUDE.md&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kyle Mistele · November 25, 2025 · &amp;lt; 10 min read&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: this post is also applicable to &lt;code&gt;AGENTS.md&lt;/code&gt;, the open-source equivalent of &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; for agents and harnesses like OpenCode, Zed, Cursor and Codex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;## Principle: LLMs are (mostly) stateless&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs are stateless functions. Their weights are frozen by the time they're used for inference, so they don't learn over time. The only thing that the model knows about your codebase is the tokens you put into it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, coding agent harnesses such as Claude Code usually require you to manage agents' memory explicitly. &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;AGENTS.md&lt;/code&gt;) is the only file that by default goes into every single conversation you have with the agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has three important implications:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Coding agents know absolutely nothing about your codebase at the beginning of each session.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The agent must be told anything that's important to know about your codebase each time you start a session.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;is the preferred way of doing this.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;## &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; onboards Claude to your codebase&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since Claude doesn't know anything about your codebase at the beginning of each session, you should use &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; to onboard Claude into your codebase. At a high level, this means it should cover:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WHAT: tell Claude about the tech, your stack, the project structure. Give Claude a map of the codebase. This is especially important in monorepos! Tell Claude what the apps are, what the shared packages are, and what everything is for so that it knows where to look for things&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WHY: tell Claude the purpose of the project and what everything is doing in the repository. What are the purpose and function of the different parts of the project?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HOW: tell Claude how it should work on the project. For example, do you use &lt;code&gt;bun&lt;/code&gt;instead of&lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt;? You want to include all the information it needs to actually do meaningful work on the project. How can Claude verify Claude's changes? How can it run tests, typechecks, and compilation steps?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the way you do this is important! Don't try to stuff every command Claude could possibly need to run in your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file - you will get sub-optimal results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;## Claude often ignores &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless of which model you're using, you may notice that Claude frequently ignores your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file's contents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can investigate this yourself by putting a logging proxy between the claude code CLI and the Anthropic API using &lt;code&gt;ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL&lt;/code&gt;. Claude code injects the following system reminder with your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file in the user message to the agent:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;system-reminder&amp;gt; IMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks. You should not respond to this context unless it is highly relevant to your task. &amp;lt;/system-reminder&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, Claude will ignore the contents of your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; if it decides that it is not relevant to its current task. The more information you have in the file that's not universally applicable to the tasks you have it working on, the more likely it is that Claude will ignore your instructions in the file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why did Anthropic add this? It's hard to say for sure, but we can speculate a bit. Most &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; files we come across include a bunch of instructions in the file that aren't broadly applicable. Many users treat the file as a way to add "hotfixes" to behavior they didn't like by appending lots of instructions that weren't necessarily broadly applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can only assume that the Claude Code team found that by telling Claude to ignore the bad instructions, the harness actually produced better results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;## Creating a good &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following section provides a number of recommendations on how to write a good &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file following context engineering best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your mileage may vary. Not all of these rules are necessarily optimal for every setup. Like anything else, feel free to break the rules once...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;you understand when &amp;amp; why it's okay to break them&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;you have a good reason to do so&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### Less (instructions) is more&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can be tempting to try and stuff every single command that claude could possibly need to run, as well as your code standards and style guidelines into &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;. We recommend against this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though the topic hasn't been investigated in an incredibly rigorous manner, some research has been done which indicates the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frontier thinking LLMs can follow ~ 150-200 instructions with reasonable consistency. Smaller models can attend to fewer instructions than larger models, and non-thinking models can attend to fewer instructions than thinking models.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Smaller models get MUCH worse, MUCH more quickly. Specifically, smaller models tend to exhibit an expotential decay in instruction-following performance as the number of instructions increase, whereas larger frontier thinking models exhibit a linear decay (see below). For this reason, we recommend against using smaller models for multi-step tasks or complicated implementation plans.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LLMs bias towards instructions that are on the peripheries of the prompt: at the very beginning (the Claude Code system message and &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;), and at the very end (the most-recent user messages)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As instruction count increases, instruction-following quality decreases uniformly. This means that as you give the LLM more instructions, it doesn't simply ignore the newer ("further down in the file") instructions - it begins to ignore all of them uniformly&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our analysis of the Claude Code harness indicates that Claude Code's system prompt contains ~50 individual instructions. Depending on the model you're using, that's nearly a third of the instructions your agent can reliably follow already - and that's before rules, plugins, skills, or user messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This implies that your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file should contain as few instructions as possible - ideally only ones which are universally applicable to your task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file length &amp;amp; applicability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All else being equal, an LLM will perform better on a task when its' context window is full of focused, relevant context including examples, related files, tool calls, and tool results compared to when its context window has a lot of irrelevant context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; goes into every single session, you should ensure that its contents are as universally applicable as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, avoid including instructions about (for example) how to structure a new database schema - this won't matter and will distract the model when you're working on something else that's unrelated!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Length-wise, the less is more principle applies as well. While Anthropic does not have an official recommendation on how long your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file should be, general consensus is that &amp;lt; 300 lines is best, and shorter is even better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At HumanLayer, our root &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file is less than sixty lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### Progressive Disclosure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing a concise &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file that covers everything you want Claude to know can be challenging, especially in larger projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To address this, we can leverage the principle of Progressive Disclosure to ensure that claude only sees task- or project-specific instructions when it needs them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of including all your different instructions about building your project, running tests, code conventions, or other important context in your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file, we recommend keeping task-specific instructions in separate markdown files with self-descriptive names somewhere in your project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;agent_docs/ |- building_the_project.md |- running_tests.md |- code_conventions.md |- service_architecture.md |- database_schema.md |- service_communication_patterns.md&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, in your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file, you can include a list of these files with a brief description of each, and instruct Claude to decide which (if any) are relevant and to read them before it starts working. Or, ask Claude to present you with the files it wants to read for aproval first before reading them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prefer pointers to copies. Don't include code snippets in these files if possible - they will become out-of-date quickly. Instead, include &lt;code&gt;file:line&lt;/code&gt; references to point Claude to the authoritative context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conceptually, this is very similar to how Claude Skills are intended to work, although skills are more focused on tool use than instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### Claude is (not) an expensive linter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most common things that we see people put in their &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file is code style guidelines. Never send an LLM to do a linter's job. LLMs are comparably expensive and incredibly slow compared to traditional linters and formatters. We think you should always use deterministic tools whenever you can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code style guidelines will inevitably add a bunch of instructions and mostly-irrelevant code snippets into your context window, degrading your LLM's performance and instruction-following and eating up your context window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs are in-context learners! If your code follows a certain set of style guidelines or patterns, you should find that armed with a few searches of your codebase (or a good research document!) your agent should tend to follow existing code patterns and conventions without being told to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you feel very stronly about this, you might even consider setting up a Claude Code &lt;code&gt;Stop&lt;/code&gt; hook that runs your formatter &amp;amp; linter and presents errors to Claude for it to fix. Don't make Claude find the formatting issues itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bonus points: use a linter that can automatically fix issues (we like Biome), and carefully tune your rules about what can safely be auto-fixed for maximum (safe) coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could also create a Slash Command that includes your code guidelines and which points claude at the changes in version control, or at your &lt;code&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt;, or similar. This way, you can handle implementation and formatting separately. You will see better results with both as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;### Don't use &lt;code&gt;/init&lt;/code&gt; or auto-generate your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both Claude Code and other harnesses with OpenCode come with ways to auto-generate your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file (or &lt;code&gt;AGENTS.md&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; goes into every single session with Claude code, it is one of the highest leverage points of the harness - for better or for worse, depending on how you use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A bad line of code is a bad line of code. A bad line of an implementation plan has the potential to create a lot of bad lines of code. A bad line of a research that misunderstands how the system works has the potential to result in a lot of bad lines in the plan, and therefore a lot more bad lines of code as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; file affects every single phase of your workflow and every single artifact produced by it. As a result, we think you should spend some time thinking very carefully about every single line that goes into it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;## In Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;is for onboarding Claude into your codebase. It should define your project's WHY, WHAT, and HOW.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Less (instructions) is more. While you shouldn't omit necessary instructions, you should include as few instructions as reasonably possible in the file.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keep the contents of your &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;concise and universally applicable.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use Progressive Disclosure - don't tell Claude all the information you could possibly want it to know. Rather, tell it how to find important information so that it can find and use it, but only when it needs to to avoid bloating your context window or instruction count.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude is not a linter. Use linters and code formatters, and use other features like Hooks and Slash Commands as necessary.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt;is the highest leverage point of the harness, so avoid auto-generating it. You should carefully craft its contents for best results.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, we are jopejoe1 and Leona Maroni, the release managers of the newest release of NixOS. We are very proud to announce the public availability of NixOS 25.11 “Xantusia”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NixOS is a Linux distribution. Its underlying package repository Nixpkgs can also be used on other Linux systems and macOS with the Nix package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This release will receive bugfixes and security updates for seven months (up until 2026-06-30). The old release 25.05 “Warbler” is now officially deprecated and will reach its end-of-life and stop receiving security updates after 2025-12-31.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 25.11 release was made possible due to the efforts of 2742 contributors, who authored 59430 commits since the previous release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Highlights&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our vast and routinely maintained set of packages has also been updated. This release of Nixpkgs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Added 7002 new packages&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Updated 25252 existing packages&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Removed 6338 outdated packages, in an effort to keep the package set maintainable and secure.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to packages from Nixpkgs, the NixOS Linux distribution also features composable configuration modules and integration tests for distributed systems. This release of NixOS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Added 107 new modules and 1778 configuration options&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Removed 41 outdated modules and 807 configuration options.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;GNOME 49&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GNOME has been updated to version 49 “Brescia”, which removes X11 session support, introduces a new video player, a new document viewer, a redesigned calendar and more changes. Refer to the release notes for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;C compilers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLVM has been updated to version 21. GCC remains at version 14. CMake was updated to version 4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Special Thanks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to personally thank&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Seth and dish for editorializing the release notes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Yohann Boniface for the release logo&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The NixOS infrastucture team for their dutifully tending to our build infrastructure&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Nixpkgs staging team for supporting our staging cycles and the patient fixing of many build errors.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also want to thank all contributors who made this release possible!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reflections and closing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are grateful for the opportunity to support the community as release managers and to learn about and participate in the release process. Seeing all the contributors working in their area of the project to improve it has been an exciting experience. We would like to thank everyone in the community for that. We are looking forward to the next release, NixOS 26.05 “Yarara”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Computer Science &amp;gt; Computation and Language&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Submitted on 22 Nov 2022 (v1), last revised 23 Oct 2023 (this version, v4)]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Title:Program of Thoughts Prompting: Disentangling Computation from Reasoning for Numerical Reasoning Tasks&lt;/head&gt;View PDF&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:Recently, there has been significant progress in teaching language models to perform step-by-step reasoning to solve complex numerical reasoning tasks. Chain-of-thoughts prompting (CoT) is by far the state-of-art method for these tasks. CoT uses language models to perform both reasoning and computation in the multi-step `thought' process. To disentangle computation from reasoning, we propose `Program of Thoughts' (PoT), which uses language models (mainly Codex) to express the reasoning process as a program. The computation is relegated to an external computer, which executes the generated programs to derive the answer. We evaluate PoT on five math word problem datasets (GSM, AQuA, SVAMP, TabMWP, MultiArith) and three financial-QA datasets (FinQA, ConvFinQA, TATQA) for both few-shot and zero-shot setups. Under both few-shot and zero-shot settings, PoT can show an average performance gain over CoT by around 12\% across all the evaluated datasets. By combining PoT with self-consistency decoding, we can achieve SoTA performance on all math problem datasets and near-SoTA performance on financial datasets.

      &lt;item&gt;The Linux desktop has continued its slow growth.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux has been making gains in no small part because of Microsoft Windows' blunders.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Users and governments have been losing trust in Windows and Microsoft.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My colleague Jack Wallen and I have been telling you for a while now that you should switch from Windows to the Linux desktop. Sounds like some of you have been listening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proof of the pudding comes from various sources. First, with Windows 10 nearing the end of its supported life, we told you to consider switching from Windows to Linux Mint or another Windows-like Linux distribution. What do we find now?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: The most beautiful Linux distributions for 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zorin OS, an excellent Linux desktop, reports that its latest release, "Zorin OS 18 has amassed 1 million downloads in just over a month since its release." What makes it especially interesting is that over "78% of these downloads came from Windows" users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, that's got my attention... 780,000 Windows users don't download a 3.5 Gigabyte Linux desktop distribution if they're not giving it serious consideration. Linux desktop fans download different distros all the time. For them, it's a hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Windows users? You have to think they are considering making the Linux switch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The real top dog operating system&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many have already been making the leap. By May 2025, StatCounter data showed the Linux desktop had grown from a minute 1.5% global desktop share in 2020 to above 4% in 2024, and was at a new American high of above 5% by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In StatCounter's latest US numbers, which cover through October, Linux shows up as only 3.49%. But if you look closer, "unknown" accounts for 4.21%. Allow me to make an educated guess here: I suspect those unknown desktops are actually running Linux. What else could it be? FreeBSD? Unix? OS/2? Unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: What Linus Torvalds really thinks about AI and software development might surprise you&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, ChromeOS comes in at 3.67%, which strikes me as much too low. Leaving that aside, ChromeOS is a Linux variant. It just uses the Chrome web browser for its interface rather than KDE Plasma, Cinnamon, or another Linux desktop environment. Put all these together, and you get a Linux desktop market share of 11.37%. Now we're talking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to look at the broader world of end-user operating systems, including phones and tablets, Linux comes out even better. In the US, where we love our Apple iPhones, Android -- yes, another Linux distro -- boasts 41.71% of the market share, according to StatCounter's latest numbers. Globally, however, Android rules with 72.55% of the market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, that's right, if you widen the Linux end-user operating system metric to include PC, tablets, and smartphones, you can make a reasonable argument that Linux, and not Windows, is already the top dog operating system. Take that, Redmond!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The view from DAP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, of course, StatCounter's numbers, as Ed Bott has pointed out, have their problems. So I also looked at my preferred data source for operating system numbers: the US federal government's Digital Analytics Program (DAP).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: Inside Canonical's plan to make Ubuntu 26.04 the Linux desktop that finally goes mainstream&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This site gives a running count of US government website visits and an analysis. On average, there are 1.6 billion sessions over the last 30 days, with millions of users per day. In short, DAP gives a detailed view of what people use without massaging the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DAP gets its raw data from a Google Analytics account. DAP has open-sourced the code, which displays the data on the web, and its data-collection code. You can download its data in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format so you can analyze the raw numbers yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By DAP's count, the Linux desktop now has a 5.8% market share. That may not sound impressive, but when I started looking at DAP's numbers a decade ago, the Linux desktop had a mere 0.67% share. We've come a long way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you add Chrome OS (1.7%) and Android (15.8%), 23.3% of all people accessing the US government's websites are Linux users. The Linux kernel's user-facing footprint is much larger than the "desktop Linux" label suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: 5 factors steadily fueling Linux's desktop rise&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll also note that although Windows 10 should be heading into retirement by now, DAP numbers show it's still the most popular version of Windows, with 16.9% compared to Windows 11's 13.5%. StatCounter, however, has Windows 11 leading in the US, with 64.83% of all Windows users, while Windows 10 is well behind with 31.92%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's still way too many Windows 10 users taking chances with their security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But wait, there's more data. According to Lansweeper, an IT asset discovery and inventory company, in its analysis of over 15 million identified consumer desktop operating systems, Linux desktops currently account for just over 6% of PC market share.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why is Linux growing?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I identified five drivers for people switching from Windows to Linux. These are: Microsoft's shift of focus from Windows as a product to Microsoft 365 and cloud services, the increased viability of gaming via Steam and Proton, drastically improved ease of use in mainstream distros, broader hardware support, and rising concern about privacy and data control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three others have emerged since then. One is that many companies and users still have perfectly good Windows 10 machines that can't "upgrade" to Windows 11. ControlUp, a company that would love to help you move to Windows 11, has found that about 25% of consumer and business Windows 10 PCs can't be moved to Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 for free - today&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This hardware lockout is a key reason many users plan to ride Windows 10 beyond the end of support instead of paying for a new machine just to meet Microsoft's specs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another is that many people really, really don't want to move to Windows 11. A UK survey by consumer group Which? in September 2025 found that 26% of respondents intended to keep using Windows 10 even after updates stopped. Interestingly, 6% plan to go to an alternative operating system such as Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why so stubborn? Well, besides wanting to save money, surveys and vendor analyses consistently mention three main reasons users hesitate: Windows 10 is "good enough," Windows 11 is not seen as meaningfully better, and they don't like the forced interface changes (e.g., the centered Start menu, context menus, default app behavior, and Copilot integration).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: Linux's remarkable journey from one dev's hobby to 40 million lines of code - and counting&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gaming users are also afraid that Windows 11 will slow down their games or come with compatibility bugs. For example, Windows 11's October update came with a bug that hurt gaming performance on some NVIDIA-equipped gaming PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, not everyone is thrilled with Windows 11 being turned into an AI-agentic operating system. Despite all the AI hype, some people don't want AI second-guessing their every move or reporting on their work to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After Microsoft president Pavan Davulur tweeted on Nov. 10 that "Windows is evolving into an agentic OS, connecting devices, cloud, and AI to unlock intelligent productivity and secure work anywhere," he probably expected Windows users to be happy with this vision. They weren't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: Can't upgrade to Windows 11? This Linux distro is the best alternative for your Windows 10 PC&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, the top response from one person on X was "It's evolving into a product that's driving people to Mac and Linux." Exactly so. If you want a traditional desktop where you control what's what on your PC without an AI Big Brother looking over your shoulder, Linux will be almost your only choice going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Don't forget digital sovereignty&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My last reason for people looking to Linux from Windows doesn't matter much to users in the US, but it matters a lot to people outside the US. You see, the European Union (EU) governments don't trust Microsoft to deliver on its service promises under potential US political pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has resulted in the rise of Digital Sovereignty initiatives, where EU companies and not American tech giants are seen as much more trustworthy. As a result, many EU states have dropped Microsoft programs and have switched to open-source software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: Yet another European government is ditching Microsoft for Linux - here's why&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That includes the desktop. Indeed, one EU group has created EU OS. This is a proof-of-concept Linux desktop for a Fedora-based distro that uses the KDE Plasma desktop environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not just the EU. The UK also no longer trusts Microsoft with its data. A 2024 Computer Weekly report revealed that Microsoft told Scottish police it could not guarantee that data in Microsoft 365 and Azure would remain in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nicky Stewart, former UK Cabinet Office ICT chief, told Computer Weekly at the time: "You've got Microsoft touting what they describe as sovereign cloud, but what do they mean by sovereign...because truly sovereign data would not be offshored under any circumstances."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Windows 11 data potentially being sent back and forth to US data centers, more and more governments will be wary about trusting Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: Another European agency shifts off Big Tech, as digital sovereignty movement gains steam&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taken together, all these shifts make Linux less of a tinker's special and more of a pragmatic option for people who want out of the Windows upgrade treadmill or subscription model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Desktop Linux is moving from perennial underdog to a small but meaningful slice of everyday computing, especially among technically inclined users, non-American public-sector agencies, and ordinary consumer and business users who want a cheaper, more trustworthy desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Love Letter to FreeBSD&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dear FreeBSD,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m still the new person here, learning your ways, stumbling over the occasional quirk, smiling when I find the small touches that make you different. You remind me of what computing felt like before the noise. Before hype cycles and performance theatre. Before every tool needed a plugin system and a logo. You are coherent. You are deliberate. You are the kind of system that doesn’t have to shout to belong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You carry the quiet strength of the greats, like a mainframe humming in a locked room, not chasing attention, just doing its work, year after year. Your base system feels like it was built by people who cared about the whole picture, not just the pieces. Your boot environments are like an old IBM i’s “side A / side B” IPL, a built-in escape hatch that says, we’ve thought ahead for you. You could be, you should be, the open-source mainframe: aligned with hardware lifecycles of three to five years or more, built for long-term trust, a platform people bet their uptime on. Your core design reminds me of Solaris in its best days: a stable base that commercial and community software could rely on without fear of shifting foundations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And make uptime a design goal: a thousand-day uptime shouldn’t be folklore, it should be normal. Not a party trick, not a screenshot to boast about, but simply the natural consequence of a system built to endure. Mainframes never apologised for uptime measured in years, and neither should you. Apply updates without fear, reboot only when the kernel truly demands it, and let administrators see longevity as a feature, not a gamble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know you are reaching further into the desktop now. I understand why, and I can see how it might widen your reach. But here I find myself wondering: how do you keep the heartbeat of a rock-solid server while also embracing the quicker pulse of a modern desktop? I don’t pretend to have all the answers, I’m too new to you for that, but my first instinct is to lean on what you already have: the natural separation between CURRENT and RELEASE. Let those worlds move at their own pace, without asking one to carry the other’s compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now, with pkgbase in play, the stability of packages matters as much as the base system itself. The base must remain untouchable in its reliability, but I dream of a world where the package ecosystem is available in clear stability channels: from a rock-solid “production tier” you can stake a business on, to faster-moving streams where new features can flow without fear of breaking mission-critical systems. Too many times in the past, packages vanished or broke unexpectedly. I understand the core is sacred, but I wouldn’t mind if some of the wider ecosystem inherited that same level of care.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Culture matters too. One reason I stepped away from Linux was the noise, the debates that drowned out the joy of building. Please keep FreeBSD the kind of place where thoughtful engineering is welcome without ego battles, where enterprise focus and technical curiosity can sit at the same table. That spirit, the calm, shared purpose that carried Unix from the PDP-11 labs to the backbone of the Internet, is worth protecting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s also the practical side: keep the doors open with hardware vendors like Dell and HPE, so FreeBSD remains a first-class citizen. Give me the tools to flash firmware without having to borrow Linux or Windows. Make hardware lifecycle alignment part of your story, major releases paced with the real world, point releases treated as refinement rather than disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My hope is simple: that you stay different. Not in the way that shouts for attention, but in the way that earns trust. If someone wants hype or the latest shiny thing every month, they have Linux. If they want a platform that feels like it could simply run, and keep running, the way the best of Unix always did, they should know they can find it here. And I still dream of a future where a purpose-built “open-source mainframe” exists: a modern, reliable hardware system running FreeBSD with the same quiet presence as Sun’s Enterprise 10k once did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And maybe, one day, someone will walk past a rack of servers, hear the steady, unhurried rhythm of a FreeBSD system still running, and smile, knowing that in a world that burns through trends, there is still something built to last.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With gratitude,&lt;lb/&gt; and with the wish to stay for the long run,&lt;lb/&gt; A newcomer who finally feels at home.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bricklink suspends Marketplace operations in 35 countries (developing story)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bricklink, LEGO’s biggest online marketplace and lifeblood of the LEGO community has made quite an alarming announcement. From 12 December 2025, BrickLink Marketplace will not be available for members in 35 countries around the world, which means that LEGO and Bricklink members will no longer be able to buy or sell on the Marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See Bricklink’s statement and list of countries impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is very surprising as the list of countries (listed below) are pretty established, and are home to thousands of AFOLs and LEGO fans, and are pretty mature markets for LEGO all things considered. These include South Africa, Turkey, Brazil, Indonesia, Egypt, Israel, Taiwan and even huge swathes of the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Indonesia&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Turkey&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;South Africa&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Taiwan&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ukraine&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Brazil&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Serbia&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Peru&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Israel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;India&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Morocco&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chile&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vietnam&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Georgia&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lebanon&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Qatar&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Oman&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;El Salvador&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bahrain&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Armenia&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pakistan&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Egypt&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Moldova&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ecuador&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Argentina&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Colombia&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Turkmenistan&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Greenland&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;San Marino&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To put this into perspective, the total combined population of these countries exceed 2.5 billion, or just about 30% of Earth’s population which is wild.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a massive shift, and while I understand that Bricklink might have issues operating in some of these countries which are located in remote locations (Greenland), or in a state of war (Ukraine), a blanket ban on these 35 countries with less than 2 weeks notice is crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are plenty of Bricklink sellers in these countries who run their Bricklink stores as businesses, and rely on the income to support their livelihoods and families, so this really should’ve been communicated far ahead of time. I can’t imagine how stressful this might be to read for sellers in those countries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then there are LEGO fans in those countries, who will also be barred from buying on Bricklink, which is a whole other level of insane. LEGO fans, and LUGs rely deeply on Bricklink to source elements to express their creativity, as not every country in the world has official LEGO Stores, or access to Pick a Brick online, and Bricklink in some cases are the only way fans can buy LEGO sets too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And these aren’t just any other countries, but countries where LEGO has an official presence in with LEGO Certified Stores, 3rd party retailers, and in the case of the UAE, even a Legoland Park. Oh, and Greenland’s on the list. That Greenland, a Danish territory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also recognised LUG communities in these countries as well, so it’s not like The LEGO Group have no interest in nurturing LEGO fans and creativity in these countries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will absolutely smother and stifle LEGO fans and communities in these countries, and I cannot for the life of me understand why such drastic action is required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also ironic as Bricklink celebrated their 25th Anniversary this year, with quite a bit of fanfare, and to close out the year by barring 30% of the world’s population from using the service is in my opinion, an absolute slap in the face of Bricklink founder Dan Jezek, whose vision was to create a global LEGO marketplace and connect fans and elements from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Six years ago, I wrote that it was a terrible idea for LEGO to acquire Bricklink and revisiting some of my thoughts I expressed then, it sure seems like there’s some dodgy stuff happening behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be fair, I acknowledge that there may be compliance challenges operating in some of these countries, where things like local laws, logistics, import restrictions etc may make it difficult for LEGO/Bricklink to do their business there, but surely there could’ve been a better way to communicate this, or invite community feedback instead of turning the whole site off in 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apart from the sudden forum message, there has been no other comment or statement from LEGO or Bricklink about this decision, and with the Bricklink head office based in California, they likely won’t issue more communication on this issue until after the Thanksgiving weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this news upsets you in any way, please share your thoughts by leaving a comment on this post, or if you can manage navigating the extremely archaic Bricklink forums, leave a comment on the Bricklink post announcing this shocking news.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dear BrickLink members,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve made the difficult decision to stop Marketplace operations in some areas:&lt;lb/&gt;https://www.bricklink.com/help.asp?helpID=2687&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting December 12, 2025, BrickLink members in these countries will no longer&lt;lb/&gt;be able to buy or sell on the Marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will review this decision regularly, and we hope to be able to reopen the&lt;lb/&gt;BrickLink Marketplace to LEGO® fans in these countries in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s an FAQ for members in these countries:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have pending orders. What will happen to them?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting December 12, 2025 you will no longer be able to place new orders. Any&lt;lb/&gt;orders placed before that will be processed as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happens to my wanted lists?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will still be able to access and manage your wanted lists. If you would like&lt;lb/&gt;to export any of your wanted list, use the ‘Download’ button at the top of the&lt;lb/&gt;page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will I keep my store inventory?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will still be able to access your store inventory, but it’s always a good&lt;lb/&gt;idea to have a copy of your inventory. You can download it using this page: https://www.bricklink.com/invExcel.asp&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We appreciate your understanding,&lt;lb/&gt;The BrickLink Team&lt;/p&gt;
