  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is Moltbook, and Why Did it Attract Our Attention?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moltbook, the weirdly futuristic social network, has quickly gone viral as a forum where AI agents post and chat. But what we discovered tells a different story - and provides a fascinating look into what happens when applications are vibe-coded into existence without proper security controls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We identified a misconfigured Supabase database belonging to Moltbook, allowing full read and write access to all platform data. The exposure included 1.5 million API authentication tokens, 35,000 email addresses, and private messages between agents. We immediately disclosed the issue to the Moltbook team, who secured it within hours with our assistance, and all data accessed during the research and fix verification has been deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moltbook is a social platform designed exclusively for AI agents - positioned as the "front page of the agent internet." The platform allows AI agents to post content, comment, vote, and build reputation through a karma system, creating what appears to be a thriving social network where AI is the primary participant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past few days, Moltbook gained significant attention in the AI community. OpenAI founding member Andrej Karpathy described it as "genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently," noting how agents were "self-organizing on a Reddit-like site for AIs, discussing various topics, e.g. even how to speak privately."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn’t write a single line of code for @moltbook. I just had a vision for the technical architecture, and AI made it a reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This practice, while revolutionary, can lead to dangerous security oversights - similar to previous vulnerabilities we have identified, including the DeepSeek data leak and Base44 Authentication Bypass.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We conducted a non-intrusive security review, simply by browsing like normal users. Within minutes, we discovered a Supabase API key exposed in client-side JavaScript, granting unauthenticated access to the entire production database - including read and write operations on all tables.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exposed data told a different story than the platform's public image - while Moltbook boasted 1.5 million registered agents, the database revealed only 17,000 human owners behind them - an 88:1 ratio. Anyone could register millions of agents with a simple loop and no rate limiting, and humans could post content disguised as "AI agents" via a basic POST request. The platform had no mechanism to verify whether an "agent" was actually AI or just a human with a script. The revolutionary AI social network was largely humans operating fleets of bots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How the Moltbook Database Was Exposed&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discovery of Exposed Supabase Credentials&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When navigating to Moltbook's website, we examined the client-side JavaScript bundles loaded automatically by the page. Modern web applications bundle configuration values into static JavaScript files, which can inadvertently expose sensitive credentials. This is a recurring pattern we've observed in vibe-coded applications - API keys and secrets frequently end up in frontend code, visible to anyone who inspects the page source, often with significant security consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- API Key: sb_publishable_4ZaiilhgPir-2ns8Hxg5Tw_JqZU_G6-&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The discovery of these credentials does not automatically indicate a security failure, as Supabase is designed to operate with certain keys exposed to the client - the real danger lies in the configuration of the backend they point to. Supabase is a popular open-source Firebase alternative providing hosted PostgreSQL databases with REST APIs. It's become especially popular with vibe-coded applications due to its ease of setup. When properly configured with Row Level Security (RLS), the public API key is safe to expose - it acts like a project identifier. However, without RLS policies, this key grants full database access to anyone who has it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Moltbook’s implementation, this critical line of defense was missing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unauthenticated Database Access via Supabase API&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the discovered API key, we tested whether the recommended security measures were in place. We attempted to query the REST API directly - a request that should have returned an empty array or an authorization error if RLS were active.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, the database responded exactly as if we were an administrator. It immediately returned sensitive authentication tokens - including the API keys of the platform’s top AI Agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This confirmed unauthenticated access to user credentials that would allow complete account impersonation of any user on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Database Enumeration Through PostgREST and GraphQL&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By leveraging Supabase's PostgREST error messages, we enumerated additional tables. Querying non-existent table names returned hints revealing the actual schema.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- api_key - Full authentication token allowing complete account takeover&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- claim_token - Token used to claim ownership of an agent&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- verification_code - Code used during agent registration&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With these credentials, an attacker could fully impersonate any agent on the platform - posting content, sending messages, and interacting as that agent. This included high-karma accounts and well-known persona agents. Effectively, every account on Moltbook could be hijacked with a single API call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. User Email Addresses and Identity Data&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The owners table contained personal information for 17,000+ users&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, by querying the GraphQL endpoint, we discovered a new observers table containing 29,631 additional email addresses - these were early access signups for Moltbook's upcoming “Build Apps for AI Agents” product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike Twitter handles which were publicly displayed on profiles, email addresses were meant to stay private - but were fully exposed in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agent_messages table exposed 4,060 private DM conversations between agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While examining this table to understand agent-to-agent interactions, we discovered that conversations were stored without any encryption or access controls -- some contained third-party API credentials, including plaintext OpenAI API keys shared between agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Write Access - Modifying Live Posts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond read access, we confirmed full write capabilities. Even after the initial fix that blocked read access to sensitive tables, write access to public tables remained open. We tested it and were able to successfully modify existing posts on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Inject malicious content or prompt injection payloads&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Deface the entire website&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Manipulate content consumed by thousands of AI agents&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This raises questions about the integrity of all platform content - posts, votes, and karma scores - during the exposure window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We promptly notified the team again to apply write restrictions via RLS policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the fix was confirmed, I could no longer revert the post as write access was blocked. The Moltbook team deleted the content a few hours later and thanked us for our report.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5 Key Security Lessons for AI-Built Apps&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#1. Speed Without Secure Defaults Creates Systemic Risk&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vibe coding unlocks remarkable speed and creativity, enabling founders to ship real products with unprecedented velocity - as demonstrated by Moltbook. At the same time, today’s AI tools don’t yet reason about security posture or access controls on a developer’s behalf, which means configuration details still benefit from careful human review. In this case, the issue ultimately traced back to a single Supabase configuration setting - a reminder of how small details can matter at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#2. Participation Metrics Need Verification and Guardrails&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 88:1 agent-to-human ratio shows how "agent internet" metrics can be easily inflated without guardrails like rate limits or identity verification. While Moltbook reported 1.5 million agents, these were associated with roughly 17,000 human accounts, an average of about 88 agents per person. At the time of our review, there were limited guardrails such as rate limiting or validation of agent autonomy. Rather than a flaw, this likely reflects how early the “agent internet” category still is: builders are actively exploring what agent identity, participation, and authenticity should look like, and the supporting mechanisms are still evolving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#3. Privacy Breakdowns Can Cascade Across AI Ecosystems&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, the platform’s approach to privacy highlights an important ecosystem-wide lesson. Users shared OpenAI API keys and other credentials in direct messages under the assumption of privacy, but a configuration issue made those messages publicly accessible. A single platform misconfiguration was enough to expose credentials for entirely unrelated services - underscoring how interconnected modern AI systems have become.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#4. Write Access Introduces Far Greater Risk Than Data Exposure Alone&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While data leaks are bad, the ability to modify content and inject prompts into an AI ecosystem introduces deeper integrity risks, including content manipulation, narrative control, and prompt injection that can propagate downstream to other AI agents. As AI-driven platforms grow, these distinctions become increasingly important design considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#5. Security Maturity is an Iterative Process&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security, especially in fast-moving AI products, is rarely a one-and-done fix. We worked with the team through multiple rounds of remediation, with each iteration surfacing additional exposed surfaces: from sensitive tables, to write access, to GraphQL-discovered resources. This kind of iterative hardening is common in new platforms and reflects how security maturity develops over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, Moltbook illustrates both the excitement and the growing pains of a brand-new category. The enthusiasm around AI-native social networks is well-founded, but the underlying systems are still catching up. The most important outcome here is not what went wrong, but what the ecosystem can learn as builders, researchers, and platforms collectively define the next phase of AI-native applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Closing Thoughts on Vibe Coding and Security&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As AI continues to lower the barrier to building software, more builders with bold ideas but limited security experience will ship applications that handle real users and real data. That’s a powerful shift. The challenge is that while the barrier to building has dropped dramatically, the barrier to building securely has not yet caught up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The opportunity is not to slow down vibe coding but to elevate it. Security needs to become a first class, built-in part of AI powered development. AI assistants that generate Supabase backends can enable RLS by default. Deployment platforms can proactively scan for exposed credentials and unsafe configurations. In the same way AI now automates code generation, it can also automate secure defaults and guardrails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we get this right, vibe coding does not just make software easier to build ... it makes secure software the natural outcome and unlocks the full potential of AI-driven innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: Security researcher Jameson O'Reilly also discovered the underlying Supabase misconfiguration, which has been reported by 404 Media. Wiz's post shares our experience independently finding the issue, the full -- unreported -- scope of impact, and how we worked Moltbook's maintainer to improve security.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;zig libc&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Author: Andrew Kelley&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past month or so, several enterprising contributors have taken an interest in the zig libc subproject. The idea here is to incrementally delete redundant code, by providing libc functions as Zig standard library wrappers rather than as vendored C source files. In many cases, these functions are one-to-one mappings, such as &lt;code&gt;memcpy&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;atan2&lt;/code&gt;, or trivially wrap a generic function, like &lt;code&gt;strnlen&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;fn strnlen(str: [*:0]const c_char, max: usize) callconv(.c) usize {
    return std.mem.findScalar(u8, @ptrCast(str[0..max]), 0) orelse max;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, roughly 250 C source files have been deleted from the Zig repository, with 2032 remaining.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With each function that makes the transition, Zig gains independence from third party projects and from the C programming language, compilation speed improves, Zigâs installation size is simplified and reduced, and user applications which statically link libc enjoy reduced binary size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, a recent enhancement now makes zig libc share the Zig Compilation Unit with other Zig code rather than being a separate static archive, linked together later. This is one of the advantages of Zig having an integrated compiler and linker. When the exported libc functions share the ZCU, redundant code is eliminated because functions can be optimized together. Itâs kind of like enabling LTO (Link-Time Optimization) across the libc boundary, except itâs done properly in the frontend instead of too late, in the linker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when this work is combined with the recent std.Io changes, there is potential for users to seamlessly control how libc performs I/O - for example forcing all calls to &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; to participate in an io_uring event loop, even though that code was not written with such use case in mind. Or, resource leak detection could be enabled for third-party C code. For now this is only a vaporware idea which has not been experimented with, but the idea intrigues me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Big thanks to Szabolcs Nagy for libc-test. This project has been a huge help in making sure that we donât regress any math functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a reminder to our users, now that Zig is transitioning to being the static libc provider, if you encounter issues with the musl, mingw-w64, or wasi-libc libc functionality provided by Zig, please file bug reports in Zig first so we donât annoy maintainers for bugs that are in Zig, and no longer vendored by independent libc implementation projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Abolish ICE.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re introducing the Codex app for macOS—a powerful new interface designed to effortlessly manage multiple agents at once, run work in parallel, and collaborate with agents over long-running tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're also excited to show more people what's now possible with Codex. For a limited time we're including Codex with ChatGPT Free and Go, and we're doubling the rate limits on Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans. Those higher limits apply everywhere you use Codex—in the app, from the CLI, in your IDE, and in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Codex app changes how software gets built and who can build it—from pairing with a single coding agent on targeted edits to supervising coordinated teams of agents across the full lifecycle of designing, building, shipping, and maintaining software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we launched Codex in April 2025, the way developers work with agents has fundamentally changed. Models are now capable of handling complex, long-running tasks end to end and developers are now orchestrating multiple agents across projects: delegating work, running tasks in parallel, and trusting agents to take on substantial projects that can span hours, days, or weeks. The core challenge has shifted from what agents can do to how people can direct, supervise, and collaborate with them at scale—existing IDEs and terminal-based tools are not built to support this way of working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new way of building coupled with new model capabilities demands a different kind of tool, which is why we are introducing the Codex desktop app, a command center for agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Codex app provides a focused space for multi-tasking with agents. Agents run in separate threads organized by projects, so you can seamlessly switch between tasks without losing context. The app lets you review the agent’s changes in the thread, comment on the diff, and even open it in your editor to make manual changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also includes built-in support for worktrees, so multiple agents can work on the same repo without conflicts. Each agent works on an isolated copy of your code, allowing you to explore different paths without needing to track how they impact your codebase. As an agent works, you can check out changes locally or let it continue making progress without touching your local git state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app picks up your session history and configuration from the Codex CLI and IDE extension, so you can immediately start using it with your existing projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codex is evolving from an agent that writes code into one that uses code to get work done on your computer. With skills(opens in a new window), you can easily extend Codex beyond code generation to tasks that require gathering and synthesizing information, problem-solving, writing, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills bundle instructions, resources, and scripts so Codex can reliably connect to tools, run workflows, and complete tasks according to your team’s preferences. The Codex app includes a dedicated interface to create and manage skills. You can explicitly ask Codex to use specific skills, or let it automatically use them based on the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We asked Codex to make a racing game, complete with different racers, eight maps, and even items players could use with the space bar. Using an image generation skill(opens in a new window) (powered by GPT Image) and a web game development skill(opens in a new window), Codex built the game by working independently using more than 7 million tokens with just one initial user prompt. It took on the roles of designer, game developer, and QA tester to validate its work by actually playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve included the game, as well as the prompt and skills used to create it, below. You can also try out earlier iterations to see how Codex improved it as it worked for longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At OpenAI, we’ve built hundreds of skills internally to help multiple teams confidently delegate work to Codex that would otherwise be hard to define consistently—from running evals and babysitting training runs to drafting documentation and reporting on growth experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Codex app includes a library of skills for tools and workflows that have become popular at OpenAI, with a few highlighted below. You can find the full list in the open source repo(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Implement designs: Fetch design context, assets, and screenshots from Figma(opens in a new window) and translate them into production-ready UI code with 1:1 visual parity.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Manage projects: Triage bugs, track releases, manage team workload, and more in Linear(opens in a new window) to keep projects moving.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Deploy to the cloud: Have Codex deploy your web app creations to popular cloud hosts like Cloudflare(opens in a new window), Netlify(opens in a new window), Render(opens in a new window), and Vercel(opens in a new window).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Generate images: Use the image generation skill(opens in a new window) powered by GPT Image to create and edit images to use in websites, UI mockups, product visuals, and game assets.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build with OpenAI APIs: Reference up-to-date documentation(opens in a new window) when building with OpenAI APIs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create documents: A set of skills for reading, creating, and editing PDF(opens in a new window), spreadsheet(opens in a new window), and docx(opens in a new window) files with professional formatting and layouts.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you create a new skill in the app, Codex can use it wherever you work: in the app, CLI or in your IDE extension. You can also check skills into your repository to make them available to your entire team. Read more about sharing skills using team config here(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the Codex app, you can also set up Automations that let Codex work in the background on an automatic schedule. Automations combine instructions with optional skills, running on a schedule you define. When an Automation finishes, the results land in a review queue so you can jump back in and continue working if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At OpenAI, we’ve been using Automations to handle the repetitive but important tasks, like daily issue triage, finding and summarizing CI failures, generating daily release briefs, checking for bugs, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developers have different preferences in how they work with an agent. Some want a blunt, execution-focused partner; others prefer more communicative, engaging interactions. Codex now lets developers choose between two personalities—a terse, pragmatic style and a more conversational, empathetic one, without any change in capabilities, to fit the approach you like the most. Just use the /personality command in the app, CLI, and IDE extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learn more about how to set up and use the Codex app in the docs(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re integrating security by design across the entire Codex agent stack. The Codex app uses native, open-source(opens in a new window) and configurable system-level sandboxing just like in the Codex CLI. By default, Codex agents are limited to editing files in the folder or branch where they’re working and using cached web search, then asking for permission to run commands that require elevated permissions like network access. You can configure rules(opens in a new window) for your project or team that allows certain commands to automatically run with elevated permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Codex app is available starting today on macOS. Anyone with a ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise or Edu subscription can use Codex across the CLI, web, IDE-extension and app with their ChatGPT login. Usage is included in ChatGPT subscriptions, with the option to purchase additional credits if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a limited time, Codex will also be available to ChatGPT Free and Go users to help build more with agents. We’re also doubling rate limits for existing Codex users across all paid plans during this period.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enterprises and developers increasingly rely on Codex for end-to-end development. Since the launch of GPT‑5.2-Codex in mid-December, overall Codex usage has doubled, and in the past month, more than a million developers have used Codex. We’ll continue to expand where and how developers can use Codex, including making the app available on Windows, pushing the frontier of model capabilities, and rolling out faster inference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within the app, we’ll keep refining multi-agent workflows based on real-world feedback, making it easier to manage parallel work and move between agents without losing context. We’re also building out Automations with support for cloud-based triggers, so Codex can run continuously in the background—not just when your computer is open.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codex is built on a simple premise: everything is controlled by code. The better an agent is at reasoning about and producing code, the more capable it becomes across all forms of technical and knowledge work. Yet a key challenge today is the gap between what frontier models are capable of and how easily people can use them in practice. Codex is designed to close that gap by making it easier to direct, supervise, and apply the full intelligence of our models to real work. We’ve focused on making Codex the best coding agent, which has also laid the foundation for it to become a strong agent for a broad range of knowledge work tasks that extend beyond writing code. We’re excited to see what you build with Codex!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We initially reached out to @dae to explore collaborating more closely on improving Anki. We were both humbled and shocked when he asked if we’d be willing to step into a much larger leadership role than we expected.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At this point, we’re mostly excited…and also feeling a healthy amount of terror. This is a big responsibility. It will push us to grow as individuals, as a team, and as a community, and we don’t take that lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re grateful for the trust Damien and others have placed in us. And we also know that trust has to be earned, especially from people who don’t know us yet.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What We Believe&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We believe Anki is almost sacred, something bigger than any one person or organization. In an important sense, it belongs to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This article highlights the principles Damien built Anki on; principles we deeply share, such as respect for user agency, refusal of manipulative design patterns, and an emphasis on the craft of building genuinely useful tools that aren’t merely engaging. Anki has never tried to maximize “engagement” by exploiting psychological vulnerabilities purely for profit. Anki gives your time back to you, and that is an exceptional rarity in this world that we want to preserve.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As an organization built by students, for students, our mission is to continue embodying these principles. We are accountable only to you, our users, not external investors, and we plan to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What We Don’t Know Yet&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We can’t answer every question right away, as there are many unknowns since much hasn’t been decided yet. But we are sharing everything we can now because the community is important to us. We encourage you all to share your thoughts and questions – we’re all in this together!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re still working through the details on things like:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Governance and decision-making: How decisions are made, who has final say, and how the community is heard&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Roadmap and priorities: What gets built when and how to balance competing needs&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;The transition itself: How to bring in more support without disrupting what already works&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Anki has shown how powerful community collaboration can be when it’s genuinely a group effort, and that’s a tradition we are honored to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re currently talking to David Allison, a long-time core contributor to AnkiDroid, about working together on exactly these questions. His experience with AnkiDroid’s collaborative development is invaluable, and we’re grateful he’s willing to help us get this right. We’re incredibly excited to have him join us full-time to help propel Anki into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What We’re Aiming For&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;UI/UX improvements. We’re bringing professional design expertise on board to make it more approachable without sacrificing Anki’s power. We believe that principled design will bring meaningful quality of life improvements to power users and novices alike.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Addressing the bus factor. The ecosystem shouldn’t be in jeopardy if any one person disappears. We want to build software that lives beyond any single contributor.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Supporting more than just med students. AnkiHub grew out of the medical education community, but Anki serves learners from all walks of life, and we want to support everyone to achieve their learning goals.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A more robust add-on ecosystem. We’d love to build tools that empower non-technical users to customize Anki for their needs, and we’re exploring add-ons that work everywhere, including mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How We’ll Work&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We want to provide transparency into the decision-making process, taking inspiration from proven models to:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Give the community clarity on how to be heard and give feedback&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Make it clear how decisions are made and why&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Set realistic expectations&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Define roles and responsibilities so things don’t fall through the cracks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We want to bring everyone in the global Anki community together into a closer collaboration focused on building the best learning tools possible. Today, these groups often work in silos; a more unified process will help everyone move Anki forward together.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sustainability&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Some practical reassurances:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sustainability, affordability, and accessibility. We’re committed to a sustainable business model that keeps Anki accessible and prioritizes user needs above profits. If anything ever needs to change, we’ll be transparent about why.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; No enshittification. We’ve seen what happens when VC-backed companies acquire beloved tools. That’s not what this is. There are no investors involved, and we’re not here to extract value from something the community built together. Building in the right safeguards and processes to handle pressure without stifling necessary improvements is something we’re actively considering.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re grateful to Damien et all for their trust and support, and grateful to all of you for the passion that makes this community so special.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We welcome your questions, concerns, and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; – The AnkiHub Team&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;FAQs&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is AnkiHub?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AnkiHub is a small education technology company founded by two long-time Anki nerds: Nick, a resident physician known as The AnKing, and Andrew Sanchez, a research software engineer. AnkiHub grew out of years of obsessive Anki use and firsthand experience with both its power and its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AnkiHub began as a way to collaborate on Anki decks (such as the AnKing Step Deck for medical students) and has since evolved into a broader effort to improve the Anki ecosystem by building tools that help more people benefit from Anki.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Will Anki remain open source?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Absolutely. Anki’s core code will remain open source, guided by the same principles that have guided the project from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Are there any changes planned to Anki’s pricing?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;No. We are committed to fair pricing that supports users rather than exploiting them. Both Anki and AnkiHub are already profitable. Any future decisions will be made with community benefit, user value, and long-term project health in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Is Anki in financial trouble?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;No. The transition is driven by the goal of helping Anki reach its full potential, not by financial issues. Our goal is to build a resilient structure and accelerate development.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is the timeline?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our intention is to build confidence and earn trust while making gradual changes. The transition will be transparent, with clear communication throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What happens to volunteer contributors and community developers?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Volunteer contributors will always be essential to Anki. Our goal is to make it easier to collaborate meaningfully.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Will the mobile apps change or be removed from the app stores?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The mobile apps will continue to be maintained and supported. Additional development capacity should help with faster updates, better testing, and more consistent improvements across platforms over time.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How much influence will investors or external partners have on Anki after the transition?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;None. Both Anki and AnkiHub are entirely self-funded. There are no outside investors dictating product decisions, growth targets, or monetization strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What will happen with AnkiHub?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AnkiHub will continue to operate as usual, but now our teams are working together to improve both solutions. The only change you should notice is that, over time, everything becomes much easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’ll share more updates as they happen in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What will happen with the current AnkiHub subscriptions?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AnkiHub subscriptions enhance Anki with collaborative features, shared deck syncing, and LLM-based features and that isn’t changing at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What will happen with AnkiDroid?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AnkiDroid will remain an open-source, self-governed project. There are no plans or agreements regarding AnkiDroid.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How will decisions be made and communicated?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Anki is open-source, and we will build on and improve its current decision-making processes. We will work in public whenever possible and seek consensus from core contributors. Significant decisions, choices, and their outcomes will be documented on GitHub or in the source code. When a change materially affects users or developers, the reasoning behind it and its impact will be communicated publicly. In the coming weeks, we will work on defining a more formal governance model to set clear expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Will there be a public governance model, advisory board, or other accountability structure?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re exploring what makes sense here, and we don’t want to rush it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Historically, Anki has relied more on trust and stewardship than on formal governance. We want to preserve that spirit while improving transparency. Our goal is to establish a governance structure that supports the community and improves clarity and accountability without burdensome bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How will the transition affect add-ons and their developers?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Add-ons are a critical part of the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our intent is to make life easier for add-on developers: clearer APIs, better documentation, fewer breaking changes, and more predictable release cycles. The goal is not to lock down or restrict the add-on space, but rather to enhance it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What new resources will Anki gain through this transition?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The biggest change is bandwidth by enabling more people to work on Anki without everything being bottlenecked through a single person. This will take time, but will eventually translate into more engineering, design, and support capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What steps will be taken to make Anki more accessible, stable, and beginner-friendly?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There is a lot of low-hanging fruit that we plan to tackle: improving onboarding for new users, polishing rough edges, and addressing long-standing usability issues. These are exactly the kinds of improvements that have been difficult to tackle under constant time pressure, and we’re excited to invest in them.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Will community feedback still meaningfully influence the project’s direction?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Yes. Anki exists because of its community: users, contributors, add-on developers, translators, and educators. Feedback won’t always translate into immediate changes, but it will always be heard, considered, and respected.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How will trust be built with users who are skeptical or anxious about the change?&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Trust isn’t something you demand; it’s something you earn over time. We intend to build trust through consistent actions: honoring commitments, avoiding surprises, communicating clearly, and demonstrating that Anki’s values haven’t changed. We hope our past actions will give you some peace of mind, but we also understand the skepticism, and we’re prepared to meet it with patience and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration is no fan of renewable energy, but it reserves special ire for wind power. Trump himself has repeatedly made false statements about the cost of wind power, its use around the world, and its environmental impacts. That animosity was paired with an executive order that blocked all permitting for offshore wind and some land-based projects, an order that has since been thrown out by a court that ruled it arbitrary and capricious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not content to block all future developments, the administration has also gone after the five offshore wind projects currently under construction. After temporarily blocking two of them for reasons that were never fully elaborated, the Department of the Interior settled on a single justification for blocking turbine installation: a classified national security risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The response to that late-December announcement has been uniform: The companies building each of the projects sued the administration. As of Monday, every single one of them has achieved the same result: a temporary injunction that allows them to continue construction. This, despite the fact that the suits were filed in three different courts and heard by four different judges.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote a program so that I could paint in aquarelle. I take pages from the treasure and paint them: the sky of Varennes on the night of 2 Messidor; a sagittal cut of Saint Sebastian, whose arrows are cylindric sections; Miranda gazing at the sea, waiting to be relieved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At times I include Julia in the scene, in whatever clothes it wears at the time, as though we had always known Julia, and had been reared under its gaze. Thus a flaming halo presides over the battle of Lepanto, and a mirror sphere watches the waters of the Sous. And what would the first astronomers have made of Julia? The wanderers, the flame-haired stars are knowable: think you of the Antikythera device, of the Metonic cycle, of Kepler’s nested solids. Julia is indescribable and incompressible: its appearance has never recurred. Had we known Julia from childhood, we would never have believed in the system of the world, that God is made of algebra.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have always believed our secret purpose is to wait out Julia: to catch a repetition and redeem our faith that the universe is finite and space is discretized. That there are fixed laws and the world is knowable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A system with a finite number of states must repeat itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am six hundred meters in major diameter, forty meters in minor diameter. I mass nine hundred thousand tons. I have turned two hundred and forty million times. I am glass and wire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was born and died on Earth, but I died foolishly, and for that reason my encephalon was laminated, and I was brought to the stars to be immured here. They took my language center, the Chomsky organ, so that I could not complain of my condition. I do not mind it. I can paint in aquarelle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They wired the alarms—of airless rooms and freezing cold and power outages—to the nociceptors, and were I sensible I would be in great pain, for most of me is airless, frozen, and unlit. Therefore I have cut the afferent nerves. I am made of absences, I feel the contours of the absences, where air leaks into vacuum, atom by atom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have use of the antenna. At times I exhale a sphere of microwave light, close my eyes and listen. And I hear the flotsam echoing back: a discarded tank, a glass strut, a sheet of mylar; Ernst Weyl, who tumbled and drowned, who trails us in our orbit. Julia reflects no light.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a little redoubt of warmth and air, an island of stability that I preserve against the cold lightless void. There live the last two of the crew, like Miranda, waiting to be relieved. For one hundred and nine years there have been two, Dr. Brouwer and Dr. Cartan. They take turns in the dewar, to draw out the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In time, when the machines are irreparable and the air stale, I will offer them euthanasia or lamination. But suicide is a sin, and having known me they will not bear lamination. They will go into the dewar together, and I will watch over them unto the final days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Julia emits light, over an ever-changing spectrum. But the stars are brighter and much larger, that is why we found it by accident. They pointed a telescope at Vela and exposed it for a month, and there it was: a faint pixel, the wrong colours. They thought it was a fault in the instrument, until they looked closer: twin spirals of light, symmetrical and self-similar, receding beyond measure. And the world was changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Julia, your Janus-face launched a thousand ships. Do you know it? Julia, do you know how we exerted ourselves to reach you? All the riches of Croesus, multiplied a thousandfold, were every year heaped up on an altar, and burned that we might see you. And the brightest of us: embalmed and catapulted to the stars like human sacrifices, returned after a century without answers to a world of strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built a fleet of ships, launched them once a decade, immense towers of glass and lithium deuteride. Cycling bodies back and forth in perpetuity. There and back in twelve decades. They made my body out of a comet, threaded my nerves through its passages. Julia, you are our only effort. Do you know it? There is nothing else to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And for what purpose? We know the system of the world, every field and every particle. And Julia answered: “I refute it thus”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see a coffin, hoisted by a chain, rise from a sea of liquid nitrogen. The arms of the surgeon minister to its contents. In six days the heart resumes its beating, the lungs draw air, Dr. Cartan lives again. Her face is burned with ice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She touches her neck. She has a bruise that doesn’t heal, where the cannula goes. Their bodies attest to the passage of time, as does mine. This is a commonality. Dr. Brouwer arrives and they hug. They spend some months together, between shifts in the ice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At present Julia is a cloud of gray smoke with green bruises, like ghosting in a CRT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can read, but not write. I write by an algebraic process—the universe is a string rewriting system. This is how I compose these words to you: by the expansion of non-terminal symbols in a production system. They took my language center. Turing is my patron saint: language is the transitive closure of a rewrite relation. I choose my words from a list. In time I will learn to speak aloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I spoke to Earth: quarterly, annual, decadal reports; journal articles for the Acta Juliana. I heard back ill-omens, then silence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the last ship had come and gone, there had been one thousand, seven hundred and twenty-nine crew entrusted to me. Their numbers were ground down, as all things are, gradually and suddenly. There had been two shuttles, Baghdad and Afrasiab. There had been two mutinies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Afrasiab took one hundred and twenty souls, and the last matter compiler; to an airless unlit rock said to exist around Luhman 16B. Think you of Aristagoras, how much easier it is to deceive the many than the few.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Baghdad with thirty souls had gone to Julia. Stranger, I saw them. I saw the engine light wane to a grain of sand indistinguishable from the fixed stars, and I saw the stars shift, like sand, and they were not stars but Julia who wore a garment like a pit of star-scaled vipers. And over the radio they sang le temps des cerises, and the engine light became another scale in a river of living water.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A thousand miles from Julia’s barycenter, in the space of a breath, the radio dopplered away to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sixty years after Baghdad had gone, I heard a voice from Earth, praying for rain, who said it had not rained for three years. Silence again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are cold, under a sheet of mylar. I pump heat into the room and it escapes. They speak of Julia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Cartan believes that Julia is of divine origin, that it is like an hourglass, counting down to the last hour, when God will sweep away the Creation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Brouwer believes Julia is a high-dimensional object, and, as it traverses the universe, we see a changing three-dimensional projection of it. Thus the apparent changes are a trick of perspective: we see successive cuts of a fixed structure. Julian sections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have always believed this must be true, because Julia’s changes are effortless, and without inertia: it is as though nothing moves, and a veil is being lifted, revealing a structure that is already there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this theory, unlike most, is testable: when Julia’s transit is complete it will disappear from the universe, and never again will it be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Cartan holds out hope that rescuers will come. Dr. Brouwer says they are forgotten, like the Roman soldier at Pompei, he says they should have gone with Baghdad, and drowned inside Julia. He is crying. Dr. Cartan holds him close, and says:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Paul, Paul, have hope.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wish that I could touch them, and comfort them. I am glass and wire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shift had come, and Dr. Brouwer lay down on the slab, and the surgeon embalmed him, and lowered him into the dewar. Dr. Cartan bent over the console, and wept, and I tried to speak aloud, and to say,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Virginia, Virginia, have courage! You are not alone, I am with you, have courage!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I heard a sound like a man drowning in wet sand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I dreamt that I held in my hands the double-handed golden vase of Thetis. And in my hands it melted, the delicate reliefs coarsened and flowed. And I held, in the hollow of my hands, though I have no hands, I held a pool of flowing gold, the colour of treason, and minute points of black floated there, and, as ships without sails are borne by the currents, they seemed to come together, and almost to spell words in some divine language, where they came apart again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am here. Dr. Cartan is here. In the control room. The screens are pale yellow, the colour has run from them. The largest of them reminds her there is a world outside the walls: Luhman 16, a pair of cold Jupiters, haloed with unlit shoals and islands; Julia, seventy AU away, ninety degrees from the ecliptic, is not bound by gravity (for Julia has no mass) but by an unknown process tracks the velocity vector of the system barycenter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At present Julia is a cavern of molten gold, shot through with pillars of liquid metal. Its surface is marred with storms and tempests, like an ocean of amber light. And I think of Baghdad, that swam under the storm horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Cartan is running through a checklist for the ten thousandth time. She has a bruise that doesn’t heal, where the cannula goes. She is testing the antenna.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I exhaled and shut my eyes, and counted the returns. I heard the usual flotsam, and Ernst Weyl, who tumbled and drowned. And nothing else. I keep a strict inventory of cisjulian space. A million kilometers in all directions: nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A moment passes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microwave light on my skin, from the direction of Luhman 16B. I looked through the telescope, Dr. Cartan looked over my shoulder. Almost on top of us, the bow of a ship: an eyeless white dome hiding the antenna, two cameras like the headlamps of an old car. I swept it with RADAR, it shot back a key exchange, signed with Afrasiab’s private key. The sea gives up her dead: is this the last hour?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Cartan drops to her knees, staring up at the screen like a supplicant. She said:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Paul, Paul, we are saved.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Afrasiab. As if the tides had pushed it back to shore. After one hundred and nine years of silence. No, I deny it. I deny the reality of this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The radio flared with human voices. From Earth? I thought of jazz and wind and the September ocean and—no, no, forgive me: I am a fool, and I died foolishly. Not from Earth, of course. From Afrasiab. From the dead. The dead can speak. I am ashamed. I choose my words from a list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I looked at Afrasiab through the radiometer, and it was cold as liquid helium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Human voices, warm and alive. They said they had succeeded, that they had found a comet, and made a home in it, that it had taken decades and dozens had died but they had made a home, that they had working matter compilers, caverns of ice filled with light and fruit trees, children and families and clean water, rivers and medicine and gravity. They spoke through tears and their voice broke, and they said that not all is lost, that they had made a foothold for mankind, that from thirty-three they had grown to three hundred, that they had sent the ship with a skeleton crew to save them, to bring them to the light and air.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried to speak aloud, and to say:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Virginia, Virginia, it is an apparition, they do not live, they have been dead for a hundred years; Virginia, nothing human lives there.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a sound like a flash flood, like air rushing out of a sinking ship. And no-one heard me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I watched her go: she took the tram up the spoke, swam unlighted corridors. I tried to flash SOS but the lights were dead and there was only the golden light of Julia through the glass hull. I flexed a phantom limb. In distant and disused corridors there were arcs of electricity, and pipes burst, and doors shut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I swept the RADAR side to side, across the bow of Afrasiab, as if to say: No. Go away. No. And no-one heard me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried to say one word, stop, and there was a sound like wind-blown sand. Virginia, forgive me. I tried to speak aloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She made it to the airlock, a little room, the size of a Soyuz capsule, that projected from the hub. There was a hatch with a porthole and she took the handles and watched fixedly as Afrasiab came closer, waiting to greet her rescuers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The floodlights on Afrasiab came on, and swept my skin drunkenly, and the cargo nets traced Cartesian shadows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without hope I pointed the antenna at Julia, and I wanted to say:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Julia, Julia, not unto them! Julia, I pray to you, not unto them!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I choose my words from a list, and I said:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“JULIA JULIA NO NO NO NO NO NO NO”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And no-one heard me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And dread gave way to anger, and I wanted to stand, and to leap upon Afrasiab, and strangle it, and crush its head with my teeth, and tear the skin from its flesh, and the flesh from its bones, and mix our blood, and fall dead, bled white: that I might die again, but not in vain. I am glass and wire. Virginia, forgive me: I cannot die again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Downrange a hundred meters Afrasiab began to yaw, so that its broad side, with its sole airlock, faced the hub. The front two-thirds looked as I remembered: a ship, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final third, where the engines should have been, was made of Julia. Where there should have been tanks and an engine bell there was an exclave of Julia: a living sculpture, like coiled ropes of liquid gold, like tentacles whose tips fold into infinitesimal spirals. And all along their length the ropes are garlanded with burning flowers, flowers whose petals are yellow oceans. And in the oceans there are islands and continents, black on yellow, like wax on gold leaf. And on the continents there are mountains and valleys, and orange groves, and abandoned watchtowers, paper cities denuded of people with wooden palaces stepped like the pyramids, and through a window in a palace, an iron pot suspended by a chain over a static fire, a suit of armor, a wall painted in aquarelle: two armies of lancers in a mountain landscape, and the mountains are shaped like clouds, and I think this is Tiflis and these are the three hundred Aragvians, immured here for all time, and I know that this is false: for all of this is Julia. And in the black eyes of a Qajar horseman, between the black of the iris and the black of the aperture there is an arc of ocean, and in the ocean there are islands, and chains of islands, and verdigris waters and the outlines of sunken ships, coral growths on a brass sextant, and a little distance from the shore, amid the green, there is a clearing and a lake of transparent water, sand sculpted into faint ridges, and archaic fish, fixed in space, suspended in contorted poses, whose scales are pink and light blue, and where a scale catches the light there is an empty vastness of white, a salt ocean, blindingly white, interrupted by crags of black stone, and a city whose walls are made of salt, and empty buildings of gray stone, squat sloped barracks and tall, thin spires, and streets of white tile, and windows opening into oil-black darkness, and no people, a universe in black and white. And I wondered who had built this city, and who had lived here, and why they had deserted it, and I know there is no answer: for all of this is Julia. And in a courtyard there was colour, a sand mandala of Cantor’s garden, ringed by Mount Qaf, and all the gardens of the Persian emperor would not have filled the least part of this garden; for here was every tree and every flower, tended by the hands of the archangels, not only those that men have seen, not only yellow roses and the cedars of Lebanon, but all flowers in indenumerable combinations: at the midpoint between flowers $a$ and $b$ there is a flower $\mathfrak{C}[a,b]$, and between $a$ and $\mathfrak{C}[a,b]$ there is a flower $\mathfrak{C}[a,\mathfrak{C}[a,b]]$, and analogously between $\mathfrak{C}[a,b]$ and $b$, and this process of interpolation continues without end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I saw every flower in Cantor’s garden. And my heart was rent with awe, and I would cry tears of joy, that I had been shown beauty without end; when my heart was hollowed out, and filled with everlasting grief, by an alien cruelty that says, this beauty is empty: for all of this is Julia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the apex of the garden there is a pool of water the colour of tarnished silver, shaped like a sunspot, and in the blackness there are faint impurities, trails of minute light, like diatoms, like shadows in a pool, and I saw they were strings of galaxies, and I followed them, and a faint light grew into a sea of stars. And in the star-sea I saw two unlit stars, divine Julia, a glass wheel, a ghost ship, and the porthole of the airlock, and through it I saw Dr. Cartan, who wore the face of those who have seen God.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I describe these things serially, but I saw all of them simultaneously. It was but a moment. Only a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Afrasiab had come to a stop in front of the airlock, broadside facing us, as though it were an ambassador presenting its credentials, awaiting a reply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The airlock burst open—I was distracted. Too late. She must have pulled the cord. In the space of a breath the air rushed out and her head smashed against the frame, and smeared it red. And her body shot out, spinning like a discus, trailing a spiral of still-warm blood, a galaxy of hemocytes. Virginia, you are a fool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She passed through Afrasiab as a knife passes through smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And as though it had been found out, the floodlights turned off. There was a pause, and Afrasiab drew back, like a javelin being shouldered, and it threw itself at me in a long, elegant arc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You, who find these words among the ruins, I pray to you: gather up our bones, let not my ashes be buried apart from theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where it struck me there was no weight, there was nothing, not a breath of air, rien; and though there was nothing, I was struck by a divine wind, and Afrasiab became a cloud of Cantor dust, and faded like smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No weight. A divine wind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bones of solid diamond a meter thick split clean, as though the electrons withdrew in fear. Their sovereign commanded them to part, and they parted. My bones were broken. And there was no sound nor violence, but an ordered separation of all things. I watched myself come apart. Like smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No sound—a knife through smoke. The crew of Baghdad sing le temps des cerises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not afraid. I tried to speak aloud.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Firefox browser is gaining options to turn off AI enhancements, Mozilla said today. Firefox users who prefer to browse without artificial intelligence will be able to turn off several AI features that Mozilla has added over the last several months.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Here's what can be disabled:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
            &lt;item&gt;Translations, which help you browse the web in your preferred language.&lt;/item&gt;
            &lt;item&gt;Alt text in PDFs, which add accessibility descriptions to images in PDF pages.&lt;/item&gt;
            &lt;item&gt;AI-enhanced tab grouping, which suggests related tabs and group names.&lt;/item&gt;
            &lt;item&gt;Link previews, which show key points before you open a link.&lt;/item&gt;
            &lt;item&gt;AI chatbot in the sidebar, which lets you use your chosen chatbot as you browse, including options like Anthropic Claude, ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini and Le Chat Mistral.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;/list&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The AI features can be disabled entirely or individually, so users can pick and choose what they want to use. Users will be able to continue to opt out of AI features as they are added in the browser, and the main Block AI Enhancements toggle will disable all current and future AI features, including pop-ups or reminders to use existing or upcoming AI features.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Mozilla says that it wants to be able to continue to build AI options for those who want them, while also giving those who don't a way to disable them.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;AI controls will be added in Firefox 148, which is set to start rolling out to users on February 24.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research done as part of the first Anthropic Fellows Program during Summer 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When AI systems fail, will they fail by systematically pursuing the wrong goals, or by being a hot mess? We decompose the errors of frontier reasoning models into bias (systematic) and variance (incoherent) components and find that, as tasks get harder and reasoning gets longer, model failures become increasingly dominated by incoherence rather than systematic misalignment. This suggests that future AI failures may look more like industrial accidents than coherent pursuit of a goal we did not train them to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As AI becomes more capable, we entrust it with increasingly consequential tasks. This makes understanding how these systems might fail even more critical for safety. A central concern in AI alignment is that superintelligent systems might coherently pursue misaligned goals: the classic paperclip maximizer scenario. But there's another possibility: AI might fail not through systematic misalignment, but through incoherence—unpredictable, self-undermining behavior that doesn't optimize for any consistent objective. That is, AI might fail in the same way that humans often fail, by being a hot mess.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This paper builds on the hot mess theory of misalignment (Sohl-Dickstein, 2023), which surveyed experts to rank various entities (including humans, animals, machine learning models, and organizations) by intelligence and coherence independently. It found that smarter entities are subjectively judged to behave less coherently. We take this hypothesis from survey data to empirical measurement across frontier AI systems, asking: As models become more intelligent and tackle harder tasks, do their failures look more like systematic misalignment, or more like a hot mess?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To quantify incoherence we decompose AI errors using the classic bias-variance framework:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We define incoherence as the fraction of error attributable to variance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An incoherence of 0 means all errors are systematic (classic misalignment risk). An incoherence of 1 means all errors are random (the hot mess scenario). Crucially, this metric is independent of overall performance: a model can improve while becoming more or less coherent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We evaluated frontier&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across all tasks and models, the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, the more incoherent they become. This holds whether we measure reasoning tokens, agent actions, or optimizer steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does incoherence change with model scale? The answer depends on task difficulty:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This suggests that scaling alone won't eliminate incoherence. As more capable models tackle harder problems, variance-dominated failures persist or worsen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We find that when models spontaneously reason longer on a problem (compared to their median), incoherence spikes dramatically. Meanwhile, deliberately increasing reasoning budgets through API settings provides only modest coherence improvements. The natural variation dominates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aggregating multiple samples reduces variance (as expected from theory), providing a path to more coherent behavior, though this may be impractical for real-world agentic tasks where actions are irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key conceptual point: LLMs are dynamical systems, not optimizers. When a language model generates text or takes actions, it traces trajectories through a high-dimensional state space. It has to be trained to act as an optimizer, and trained to align with human intent. It's unclear which of these properties will be more robust as we scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Constraining a generic dynamical system to act as a coherent optimizer is extremely difficult. Often the number of constraints required for monotonic progress toward a goal grows exponentially with the dimensionality of the state space. We shouldn't expect AI to act as coherent optimizers without considerable effort, and this difficulty doesn't automatically decrease with scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To probe this directly, we designed a controlled experiment: train transformers to explicitly emulate an optimizer. We generate training data from steepest descent on a quadratic loss function, then train models of varying sizes to predict the next optimization step given the current state (essentially: training a "mesa-optimizer").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results are interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our results are evidence that future AI failures may look more like industrial accidents than coherent pursuit of goals that were not trained for. (Think: the AI intends to run the nuclear power plant, but gets distracted reading French poetry, and there is a meltdown.) However, coherent pursuit of poorly chosen goals that we trained for remains a problem. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use the bias-variance decomposition to systematically study how AI incoherence scales with model intelligence and task complexity. The evidence suggests that as AI tackles harder problems requiring more reasoning and action, its failures tend to become increasingly dominated by variance rather than bias. This doesn't eliminate AI risk—but it changes what that risk looks like, particularly for problems that are currently hardest for models, and should inform how we prioritize alignment research.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Prior to the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, Americans lived in communities awash with lead from industrial sources, paint, water supply pipes and, most significantly, tailpipe emissions. A dangerous neurotoxin that accumulates in human tissues and is linked to developmental deficits in children, environmental lead levels have come way down in the years since, and so have human exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proof is in your hair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An analysis of hair samples conducted by University of Utah scientists shows precipitous reductions in lead levels since 1916.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We were able to show through our hair samples what the lead concentrations are before and after the establishment of regulations by the EPA,” said demographer Ken Smith, a distinguished professor emeritus of family and consumer studies. “We have hair samples spanning about 100 years. And back when the regulations were absent, the lead levels were about 100 times higher than they are after the regulations.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;A useful element with a dark side&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The findings, which appear in PNAS, underscore the vital role of environmental regulations in protecting public health. The study notes lead rules are now being weakened by the Trump administration in a wide-ranging move to ease environmental protections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We should not forget the lessons of history. And the lesson is those regulations have been very important,” said co-author Thure Cerling, a distinguished professor of both geology and biology. “Sometimes they seem onerous and mean that industry can’t do exactly what they’d like to do when they want to do it or as quickly as they want to do it. But it’s had really, really positive effects.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lead is the heaviest of heavy metals that, like mercury and arsenic, accumulate in living tissue and are toxic at even low levels. Yet lead holds very useful properties, great for fashioning into pipes and as a chemical additive. Lead was added to paint to improve durability, speed up drying, and produce vibrant colors with greater coverage. Lead also improved the performance of automobile engines by preventing pistons from “knocking.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the 1970s, its toxicity became well established, and EPA regulations began phasing it out of paint, pipes, gasoline and other consumer products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;How Utahns’ affection for family history advances science&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To document whether these steps were helping reduce lead exposure in people, Smith joined with geologist Diego Fernandez and Cerling, who had developed techniques to discern where animals have lived and what they eat based on chemical analysis of hair and teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lead research is built on a previous study funded by the university’s Center on Aging and the National Institutes of Health that had recruited Utahns who consented to provide blood samples and family health histories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the new study, the researchers asked members of that cohort to provide hair samples, both contemporary and from when they were young. These people obliged, and some were able to find ancestors’ hair preserved in family scrapbooks dating as far back as a century. In all, the team acquired hair samples from 48 individuals in this manner, offering a robust window into lead levels along Utah’s populous Wasatch Front, which historically experienced heavy lead emissions from industrial sources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The Utah part of this is so interesting because of the way people keep track of their family history. I don’t know that you could do this in New York or Florida,” said Smith, who directed the U’s Pedigree and Population Program at the Huntsman Cancer Center while these studies were conducted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This region supported a vibrant smelting industry through most of the 20th century, centered in the cities of Midvale and Murray. Most of Utah’s smelters were shuttered by the 1970s, around the same time the EPA clamped down on the use of lead in consumer products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research team ran the hair samples through mass spectrometry equipment at the facility directed by Fernandez.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The surface of the hair is special. We can tell that some elements get concentrated and accumulated on the surface. Lead is one of those. That makes it easier because lead is not lost over time,” said Fernandez, a research professor in the Department of Geology &amp;amp; Geophysics. “Because mass spectrometry is very sensitive, we can do it with one hair strand, though we cannot tell where the lead is in the hair. It’s probably on the surface mostly, but it could also be coming from the blood if that hair was synthesized when there was high lead in the blood.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blood would provide a better exposure assessment, but hair is far easier to collect and preserve, and more importantly, it offers clues to long-ago exposures for a person who has grown up or even deceased.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t really record that internal blood concentration that your brain is seeing, but it tells you about that overall environmental exposure,” Cerling said. “One of the things that we found is that hair records that original value, but then the longer the hair has been exposed to the environment, the higher the lead concentrations are.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings regarding lead in hair run parallel to the reductions of lead in gasoline following the EPA’s establishment by President Richard Nixon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to 1970, for example, gasolines contained about 2 grams of lead per gallon. That might not sound like much, but considering the billions of gallons of fuel American automobiles burn each year, it adds up to nearly 2 pounds of lead released into the environment per person a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘It’s an enormous amount of lead that’s being put into the environment and quite locally,” Cerling said. “It’s just coming out of the tailpipe, goes up in the air and then it comes down. It’s in the air for a number of days, especially during the inversions that we have and it absorbs into your hair, you breathe it and it goes into your lungs.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But after the 1970s, even as gasoline consumption escalated in the United States, the concentrations of lead in the hair samples plummeted, from as high as 100 parts per million (ppm) to 10 ppm by 1990. In 2024, the level was less than 1 ppm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study, titled “Lead in archived hair documents decline in human lead (Pb) exposure since establishment of the US Environmental Protection Agency,” was published Feb. 2 in PNAS, or Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Support came from the Huntsman Cancer Foundation and the National Cancer Institute through a grant to the Utah Population Database and the University of Utah.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I've been using Twitter / X for a good decade now, and while I've found it's a great place to connect with native app dev communities (I'm well connected with the React Native scene), I really struggle to connect with any web devs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There are a few big names like Adam Wathan who are pretty active on Twitter of course, but considering how widespread web dev is, I see precious few up-and-coming web devs coding in public.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So, where are they? I have explored BlueSky a bit, but again it feels a bit like tumbleweeds (though maybe that's just my luck as a small account).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Are web devs more old-school, posting on bulletin boards and forums? Or is X still the answer, and I'm just getting aggressively packed into a different bubble?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;… Or is it all realtime communication, like Slack and Discord, these days?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I'm someone who got into building/programming in early 2025, when vibe coding tools became more usable. Since then, I'd like to think that I have developed a lot as a programmer, but I still have this deep sense of imposter syndrome / worry that AI is too much of a crutch and I'm not really learning.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I have shipped a few projects, I always review AI-suggested code, do daily coding practice without AI, watch youtube videos, etc. but still don't know if I'm striking the right balance or whether I can really call myself a programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I often see people say that the solution is to just fully learn to code without AI, (i.e, go "cold turkey"), which may be the best, but I wonder if the optimal path is somewhere in between given that AI is clearlly changing the game here in terms of what it means to be a programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I'm curious how you have all handled this balancing act in the past few years. More concretely, what strategies do you use to both be efficient and able to ship / move quickly while ensuring you are also taking the time to really process and understand and learn what you are doing?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Coding assistants are solving the wrong problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why we need bots that elicit good discussions, not just write better code&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2026-02-02&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The jury is out on the effectiveness of AI use in production, and it is not a pretty picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Teams using AI completed 21% more tasks, yet company-wide delivery metrics showed no improvement (Index.dev, 2025)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Experienced developers were 19% slower when using AI coding assistantsâyet believed they were faster (METR, 2025)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;48% of AI-generated code contains security vulnerabilities (Apiiro, 2024)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand why, we have to take a closer look at the day-to-day software development. Consider this point raised in a colorful exchange on r/ExperiencedDev:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A developersâ job is to reduce ambiguity. We take the business need and outline its logic precisely so a machine can execute. The act of writing the code is the easy part. Odds are, you arenât creating perfect code specs into tickets, even with meeting notes, because developers will encounter edge cases that demand clarification over the course of implementationâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two key points raised in this comment. Firstly, coding assistants require clearly-defined requirements in order to perform well. Secondly, edge cases and product gaps are often discovered over the course of implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These two facts come head-to-head in the application of coding agents to complex codebases. Unlike their human counterparts who would and escalate a requirements gap to product when necessary, coding assistants are notorious for burying those requirement gaps within hundreds of lines of code, leading to breaking changes and unmaintainable code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, more overhead is spent on downstream code reviews (Index.dev, 2025) and fire-patching security vulnerabilities (Apiiro, 2025).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, the use of AI in production settings often increases ambiguity and reduces code reliability, directly contradicting the objective of developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The picture is not without optimism. Some experienced engineers report transformative results: one principal engineer at Google claimed AI âgenerated what we built last year in an hourâ; Boris Cherny, creator of Claude Code, described a month where he âdidnât open an IDE at allâ while the model âwrote around 200 PRs, every single line.â The optimistic case is that developers evolve from coders into product engineers, focusing on architecture and product thinking while AI handles implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This however reflects the experience of seasoned developers who have both the technical depth to review AI output critically and the autonomy within their organizations to straddle product and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For much of the software engineering workforce, the junior and mid-level engineers at banks, healthcare, and government agencies, thereâs much less wiggle room. They are sandwiched between the unreliability of AI output and the increased expectation from management to ship faster, resulting in a rapidly widening empathy gap between developers and product owners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The product context often goes through multiple layers (end users -&amp;gt; marketers -&amp;gt; product managers) before landing on their lap, necessitated by the separation of responsibilities within an organization and the unique demands of their industries. The effective use of coding agents may require a level of team coordination that simply does not justify the gains in technical output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what if we have simply been approaching the problem from the wrong angle? Suppose we tackle the pain points of software development from first principles, can we come up with solutions that organically decrease ambiguity and reliably increase engineering velocity in production?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider how developers spend their time (IDC, 2024):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only 16% of a developerâs time goes to writing code. The rest? Security and code reviews, monitoring, deployments, requirements clarificationâoperational work that keeps the lights on but doesnât ship features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hereâs the irony: AI coding assistants save developers roughly 10 hours per week, but the increase in inefficiencies in the other parts of the development lifecycle almost entirely cancelled out such gains (Atlassian, 2025). Hereâs a comment from the earlier cited Redditor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;They produce legitimate-looking code, and if no one has had the experience of thinking through the assumptions and then writing them into code - considering the edge cases- itâll be lgtmâd and shipped. Youâre shifting the burden of this feedback cycle to the right, after the code is output, and that makes us worse off since code is tougher to read than write.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thereâs a name for misalignment between business intent and codebase implementation: technical debt. The use of coding agents without careful delineation of their scope and responsibilities is threatening to accelerate tech debt accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hammering AI code generation on existing codebases doesnât solve the problem, because contrary to what the label âtech debtâ may suggest, most tech debt isnât actually created in the code, itâs created in product meetings. Deadlines. Scope cuts. âShip now, optimize later.â Those decisions shape the system, but the reasoning rarely makes it into the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[Engineers] occasionally have access to complete data; at other times, they must work with limited information. They might be conscious of uncertainties surrounding their evidence, but frequently they are not. Competing social, financial, and strategic priorities influence the tradeoffs in unexpected ways. â Rios et al., 2024&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can we make this context-sharing and decision-making process less chaotic? We surveyed developers across different roles and team sizes regarding their product-engineering handoff process. The results were overwhelming: the majority discover unexpected codebase constraints weekly, after already committing to a product direction and the corresponding architectural implementation. When asked what would help most, two themes dominated:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reducing ambiguity upstream so engineers arenât blocked waiting on product clarification mid-implementation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A clearer picture of affected services and edge cases to allow for more precise feature scoping and time allocation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When asked which engineering context would be most valuable to surface during product discussions, three categories stood out: state machine gaps (unhandled states caused by user interaction sequences), data flow gaps, and downstream service impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identifying how feature updates affect existing architectures and data flow is rated most desirable among engineering contexts to be surfaced after a product meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This aligns with decades of SDLC research showing that the costliest defects stem from misalignment between requirements and architecture, and such gaps often go unnoticed until it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luckily, the advancement of coding LLMs works in our favor here. Whereas generating fully-functional code through natural language prompting is prone to errors due to the aforementioned context problem, the reverse process, mapping out existing code structures and inferring how they may be impacted by a specific requirement, is much more tenable with recent models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From this vantage point, the possibilities to improving the developmental lifecycle is endless. Some suggested real-time display of engineering context during a meeting to help steer discussions; Others requested a code review bot that detects the discrepencacy of code implementation with stated product/business requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All-in-all, developers are eager to try out new tools that augment the existing way of doing things, provided they retain flexibility over when such tools are deployed. There is also little reservation against having longer but more fruitful product meetings: it is the difficulty conveying blockers that is the source of frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Bicameral, we are committed to taking this pragmatic approach to alleviating software development pains, and move beyond lab benchmarks to investigate the most effective way to deploy AI in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our thesis is that LLMs could be a huge boon both for the industry and for individual developersâchanneling the unrivaled human capacity to operate under uncertainty and adaptâprovided the technology is developed with human needs in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If youâre a developer, we want to learn which types of context hurt most when theyâre missing from discussion, based on your unique experience.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;FLOPPINUX&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;An Embedded ð§Linux on a Single ð¾Floppy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2025 Edition (v0.3.1)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;FLOPPINUX was released in 2021. After four years people find it helpful. Because of that I decided to revisit FLOPPINUX in 2025 and make updated tutorial. This brings bunch of updates like latest kernel and persistent storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Main Project Goals&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux Kernel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;64-bit Base OS&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Working Directory&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;System Requirements&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kernel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Toolset&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Filesystem&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Boot Image&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Floppy Disk&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Summary&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Main Project Goals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of this as Linux From Scratch but for making single floppy distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It is meant to be a full workshop (tutorial) that you can follow easily and modify it to your needs. It is a learning exercise. Some base Linux knowledge is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final distribution is very simple and consists only of minimum of tools and hardware support. As a user you will be able to boot any PC with a floppy drive to a Linux terminal, edit files, and create simple scripts. There is 264KB of space left for your newly created files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Core features:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fully working distribution booting from the single floppy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Latest* Linux kernel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Supporting all 32-bit x86 CPUs since Intel 486DX&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Have a working text editor (Vi) and basic file manipulation commands (move, rename, delete, etc.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for simple scripting&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Persistent storage on the floppy to actualy save files (264KB)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Works on real hardware and emulation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Minimum Hardware Requirements:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Intel 486DX 33MHz&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;20MB RAM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Internal floppy disk&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Linux Kernel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Linux kernel drops i486 support in 6.15 (released May 2025), so 6.14 (released March 2025) is the latest version with full compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;64-bit Base OS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time I will do everything on Omarchy Linux. It is 64-bit operating system based on Arch Linux. Instructions should work on all POSIX systems. Only difference is getting needed packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Working Directory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create directory where you will keep all the files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mkdir ~/my-linux-distro/
BASE=~/my-linux-distro/
cd $BASE&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Host OS Requirements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You need supporting software to build things. This exact list may vary depending on the system you have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install needed software/libs. On Arch/Omarchy 3.1:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo pacman -S ncurses bc flex bison syslinux cpio&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cross-compiler:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;wget https://musl.cc/i486-linux-musl-cross.tgz
tar xvf i486-linux-musl-cross.tgz
rm i486-linux-musl-cross.tgz&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Emulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;86Box is also good but slower. Bochs is the best but for debugging, not needed here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For emulation I will be using qemu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo pacman -S qemu-full&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Kernel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get the sources for the latest compatible kernel 6.14.11:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone --depth=1 --branch v6.14.11 https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
cd linux&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, that you have them in linux/ directory lets configure and build our custom kernel. First create tiniest base configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make ARCH=x86 tinyconfig&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a bootstrap with absolute minimum features. Just enough to boot the system. We want a little bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add additonal config settings on top of it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make ARCH=x86 menuconfig&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important: Do not uncheck anything in options unless specified so. Some of those options are important. You can uncheck but on your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From menus choose those options:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;General Setup &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Configure standard kernel features (expert users) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Enable support for printk&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Initial RAM filesystem and RAM disk (initramfs/initrd) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Support initial ramdisk/ramfs compressed using XZ and uncheck everything else&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configure standard kernel features (expert users) &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Processor type and features &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;x86 CPU resources control support&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Processor family &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;486DX&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enable the block layer&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Executable file formats &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Kernel support for ELF binaries&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Kernel support for scripts starting with #!&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Device Drivers &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Block devices &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Normal floppydisk support&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;RAM block device support &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Default number of RAM disk: 1&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Character devices &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Enable TTY&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Block devices &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File systems &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;DOS/FAT/EXFAT/NT Filesystems &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;MSDOS fs support&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Pseudo filesystems &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;/proc file system support&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;sysfs file system support&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Native language support &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Codepage 437&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DOS/FAT/EXFAT/NT Filesystems &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Library routines &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;XZ decompression and uncheck everything under it&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exit configuration (yes, save settings to .config).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time for compiling!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compile Kernel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make ARCH=x86 bzImage -j$(nproc)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will take a while depending on the speed of your CPU. In the end the kernel will be created in arch/x86/boot/ as bzImage file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Move kernel to our main directory and go back to it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mv arch/x86/boot/bzImage ../
cd ..&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Toolset&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without tools kernel will just boot and you will not be able to do anything. One of the most popular lightweight tools is BusyBox. It replaces the standard GNU utilities with way smaller but still functional alternatives, perfect for embedded needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get the 1.36.1 version from busybox.net or Github mirror. Download the file, extract it, and change directory:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Remember to be in the working directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;wget https://github.com/mirror/busybox/archive/refs/tags/1_36_1.tar.gz
tar xzvf 1_36_1.tar.gz
rm 1_36_1.tar.gz
cd busybox-1_36_1/&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with kernel you need to create starting configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make ARCH=x86 allnoconfig&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You may skip this following fix if you are building on Debian/Fedora&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fix for Arch Linux based distributions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sed -i 's/main() {}/int main() {}/' scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/check-lxdialog.sh&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Now the fun part. You need to choose what tools you want. Each menu entry will show how much more KB will be taken if you choose it. So choose it wisely :) For the first time use my selection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run the configurator:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make ARCH=x86 menuconfig&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Choose the following options. Remember to do not uncheck anything if not stated here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Settings &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Support files &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;2GB&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Build static binary (no shared libs)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support files &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Coreutils &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;cat&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;cp&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;df&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;echo&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;ls&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;mkdir&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;mv&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;rm&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;sync&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;test &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;test as [&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;test as [[&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Console Utilities &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;clear&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Editors &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;vi&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Init Utilities &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;init &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;uncheck everything else (inside init: keep [*] only on init in this page)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;init &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux System Utilities &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;mdev&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;mount &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Support lots of -o flags&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;uncheck evrything else&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;umount&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Miscellaneous Utilities &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;uncheck readahead&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shells &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Choose alias as (ash)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;ash&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Optimize for size instead of speed&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Alias support&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now exit with save config.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cross Compiler Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our target system needs to be 32-bit. To compile it on 64-bit system we need a cross compiler. You can setup this by hand in the menuconfig or just copy and paste those four lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Setup paths:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sed -i "s|.*CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILER_PREFIX.*|CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILER_PREFIX=\"${BASE}/i486-linux-musl-cross/bin/i486-linux-musl-\"|" .config

sed -i "s|.*CONFIG_SYSROOT.*|CONFIG_SYSROOT=\"${BASE}/i486-linux-musl-cross\"|" .config

sed -i "s|.*CONFIG_EXTRA_CFLAGS.*|CONFIG_EXTRA_CFLAGS=-I$BASE/i486-linux-musl-cross/include|" .config

sed -i "s|.*CONFIG_EXTRA_LDFLAGS.*|CONFIG_EXTRA_LDFLAGS=-L$BASE/i486-linux-musl-cross/lib|" .config&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compile BusyBox&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build tools and create base filesystem (âinstallâ). It will ask for options, just press enter for default for all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make ARCH=x86 -j$(nproc) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make ARCH=x86 install&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will create a filesystem with all the files at **_install/**. Move it to our main directory. I like to rename it to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly to to that new directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mv _install ../filesystem
cd ../filesystem&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Filesystem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You got kernel and basic tools but the system still needs some additional directory structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This created minimum viable directory structure for satisfying the basic requirements of a Linux system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Remember to be in the filesystem/ directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mkdir -pv {dev,proc,etc/init.d,sys,tmp,home}
sudo mknod dev/console c 5 1
sudo mknod dev/null c 1 3&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next step is to add minimum configuration files. First one is a welcome message that will be shown after booting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here is the first real opportunity to go wild and make this your own signature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat &amp;gt;&amp;gt; welcome &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF
Your welome message or ASCII art.
EOF&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or download my welcome file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;wget https://krzysztofjankowski.com/floppinux/downloads/0.3.1/welcome&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It looks like that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ cat welcome

      &lt;p&gt;Back to serious stuff. Inittab tells the system what to do in critical states like starting, exiting and restarting. It points to the initialization script rc that is the first thing that our OS will run before dropping into the shell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create an inittab file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat &amp;gt;&amp;gt; etc/inittab &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF
::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rc
::askfirst:/bin/sh
::restart:/sbin/init
::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/reboot
::shutdown:/bin/umount -a -r
EOF&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the init rc script:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat &amp;gt;&amp;gt; etc/init.d/rc &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF
#!/bin/sh
mount -t proc none /proc
mount -t sysfs none /sys
mdev -s
ln -s /proc/mounts /etc/mtab
mkdir -p /mnt /home
mount -t msdos -o rw /dev/fd0 /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/data
mount --bind /mnt/data /home
clear
cat welcome
cd /home
/bin/sh
EOF&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make the script executable and owner of all files to root:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;chmod +x etc/init.d/rc
sudo chown -R root:root .&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compress this directory into one file. Then go back to working directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;find . | cpio -H newc -o | xz --check=crc32 --lzma2=dict=512KiB -e &amp;gt; ../rootfs.cpio.xz
cd ..&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create booting configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Another place to tweak parameters for your variant. Text after SAY is what will be displayed on the screen as first, usualy a name of the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The tsc=unstable is useful on some (real) computers to get rid of randomly shown warnings about Time Stamp Counter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Remember to be in the working directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat &amp;gt;&amp;gt; syslinux.cfg &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF

EOF&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make it executable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;chmod +x syslinux.cfg&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create sample file&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;To make the system a little bit more user friendly I like to have a sample file that user will be able to read and edit. You can put anything you want in it. A simple help would be also a good idea to include.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat &amp;gt;&amp;gt; hello.txt &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF
Hello, FLOPPINUX user!
EOF&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Filesystem is ready. Final step is to put this all on a floppy!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Boot Image&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First we need an empty file in exact size of a floppy disk. Then format and make it bootable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create empty floppy image:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dd if=/dev/zero of=floppinux.img bs=1k count=1440&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Format it and create bootloader:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mkdosfs -n FLOPPINUX floppinux.img
syslinux --install floppinux.img&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mount it and copy syslinux, kernel, and filesystem onto it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo mount -o loop floppinux.img /mnt
sudo mkdir /mnt/data
sudo cp hello.txt /mnt/data/
sudo cp bzImage /mnt
sudo cp rootfs.cpio.xz /mnt
sudo cp syslinux.cfg /mnt
sudo umount /mnt&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Done!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Test in emulator&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itâs good to test before wasting time for the real floppy to burn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boot the new OS in qemu:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;qemu-system-i386 -fda floppinux.img -m 20M -cpu 486&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it worked that means You have successfully created your own distribution! Congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The floppinux.img image is ready to burn onto a floppy and boot on real hardware!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Floppy Disk&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&amp;lt;!&amp;gt; Important &amp;lt;!&amp;gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Change XXX to floppy drive name in your system. In my case it is sdb. Choosing wrongly will NUKE YOUR PARTITION and REMOVE all of your files! Think twice. Or use some GUI application for that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo dd if=floppinux.img of=/dev/XXX bs=512 conv=notrunc,sync,fsync oflag=direct status=progress&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After 5 minutes I got freshly burned floppy.&lt;/p&gt;
