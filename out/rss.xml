  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the number of passenger vehicles rising across Europe, cities are grappling with air pollution, traffic accidents, and the loss of public space. In Spain, the city of Pontevedra has managed to overcome these challenges, surpassing national air quality standards and creating safer streets. The key, according to the Galician municipality’s mayor, is an urban model that prioritises residents over cars – without imposing an outright ban on private vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a bright summer evening in Pontevedra, a Galician city in the northwest of Spain. The air is filled with a contralto accompanying a live jazz show in a corner of the big town square. A few metres away, four teenagers play soccer with an orange ball that two younger children try to touch in vain. A family takes a selfie while, seated on a nearby bench, four elderly women are engaged in a lively conversation. The intervals between one jazz piece and another are filled with the chirping of birds that are attracted to the greenery around the fountain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the images of Pontevedra from the 1990s, with lines of cars stretching as far as the eye could see, it would be very difficult to predict a future like this. But since family doctor Miguel Anxo Fernández Lores was elected mayor in 1999, the Galician city has been implementing policies that go well beyond regulating vehicles in its streets. The goal, according to the 71-year-old mayor, is to recover public space for the people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“When we reclaim public space and guarantee universal accessibility, then people have autonomy,” the mayor says. A politician of the Galician Nationalist Bloc party (Bloque Nacionalista Galego, BNG), Lores is now serving his seventh mandate and is willing to run for an eighth in 2027. Galicia is mainly and historically ruled by the right-wing Popular Party, and is the birthplace of several of its national leaders, which makes the local leftist and nationalist BNG’s long rule in Pontevedra an exception in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When we reclaim public space and guarantee universal accessibility, then people have autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In December 2022, the Spanish government approved a royal decree requiring all municipalities with more than 50,000 inhabitants to have a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) in operation. To improve air quality for citizens and reduce carbon emissions, the decree recommends measures such as restricting access for more polluting vehicles based on their environmental label and introducing traffic-restricted areas where entry charges apply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spain adopted this measure to comply with the legally binding requirements of the Paris Agreement – the international treaty on climate change – more than six years after it entered into force in November 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, since Pontevedra was already fully complying with the air quality parameters laid out in the national Law 7/2021 on Climate Change, the city council decided to take a much more ambitious step: declaring the entire urban area (about 490 hectares) as a “reduced traffic zone”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a sunny, fresh noon at the end of June in his city-centre office, Lores recalls what Pontevedra looked like when he first took up his duties: “It was literally a cars’ warehouse and people, especially those with disabilities and the elderly, couldn’t go out on the streets, because everything was occupied by vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While he speaks, the mayor mentions the 19th-century Catalan engineer Ildefons Cerdà i Sunyer, best known for the urban reform of Barcelona’s central Eixample neighbourhood, with its distinctive grid layout and symmetrical structure. Just like Cerdà, he views public space as an extension of the home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cars: a continental problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than 75 per cent of the EU population lives in urban areas, and this figure is expected to rise to approximately 83 per cent by 2050. With air pollution widely recognised as the most pressing health risk in Europe, curbing road transport emissions – responsible for 37 per cent of nitrogen oxide pollution – is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The European Union has launched a number of initiatives to encourage cities to become cleaner and healthier. One of the most notable is the Green City Accord, which invites towns with a population of 20,000 inhabitants or more to commit to improvements in areas such as air and water quality, noise reduction, biodiversity conservation, and advancing towards a circular economy. The initiative also calls on cities to connect with a wider European network to facilitate knowledge sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another initiative is the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities EU Mission, which is supporting 100 cities in the EU and 12 in countries associated with the Horizon Europe programme. The goal of the mission is to develop a pilot project to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. The solutions and models tested in these cities could then serve as an example, helping all European cities to follow suit by 2050, the year by which the EU has committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also informal initiatives such as the Ciudades que caminan (“Walking Cities”) network in Spain, which is a non-profit open to city councils and other public administrations committed to walkability. The network provides participant cities with training and a forum for the exchange of information and experiences. It includes an online school of public space, and is responsible for managing and promoting Entornos escolares (“school environments”), Spain’s most important website dedicated to promoting child autonomy and urban mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, in spite of both top-down and bottom-up initiatives, the number of cars in our continent is growing: in 2024, the number of vehicles in the European Union exceeded 259 million, an increase of 5.9 per cent as compared to 2019. The country with the highest motorisation rate – that is, the number of cars per 1,000 inhabitants – is Italy (701), followed by Luxembourg (670) and Finland (666 cars). With a rate of 544 (although this is based on provisional data), Spain is below the EU average of 576.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Defying the norm&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in Pontevedra, the number of cars has consistently diminished in recent years. The city has also introduced regulations both restricting the purposes for which cars may circulate and adjusting the times when they are permitted to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When asked to name one of the best examples of what his administration has achieved in terms of prioritising pedestrians over vehicles, the mayor does not hesitate to mention the transformation of one of the main squares in Pontevedra. Next to the remains of the 14th-century Gothic convent of Santo Domingo lies the wide Praza de España, regarded as the city’s “kilometre zero” – the starting point of its main natural and historical routes. Nowadays, the site serves as a lively hub where on any summer day walkers, drawn by the frequent cultural events hosted in the city, meet with pilgrims of the St. James’ Way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lores points out that at the end of the 1990s, about 26,000 cars passed by this square every day. Remarkably, many of these vehicles were simply trying to reach destinations out of town, such as the beaches of Sanxenxo – a touristic municipality some 30 kilometres away, as well as the mayor’s birthplace – and to do so they passed through Praza de España. But today, transit traffic and circling for parking are not allowed anywhere in the city, and according to Lores, only 800 cars reach the square on a daily basis. As he explains, the decision to prohibit passing traffic and divert it to beltways has led to a 40-per cent reduction in the city’s overall traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only “necessary traffic” is allowed in Pontevedra: vehicles used for emergency and public safety, public services (including garbage and water trucks, etc.), transportation of people with reduced mobility, and accessing private garages are permitted 24/7. However, loading and unloading for commercial supplies, home delivery, transporting bulky objects, and house moving and related activities, are permitted only during certain hours. Free parking spaces are scattered all over the city so that people can temporarily stop while carrying out any of these activities. In case of violations, police have the option to issue fines of up to several hundred euros.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There is no place in town that can’t be reached by car, but only by those who need to, not those who feel like it,” Lores explains. And with his characteristic tone, direct yet polite, he adds: “The fact that you park your private car in a public space is crazy: if you don’t have room for your freezer, do you put it on the sidewalk?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the order of priorities, all cars, including electric ones, come last in Pontevedra: “The entire pyramid of preferences was changed: pedestrians come first, then bicycles, scooters, public transportation, and only lastly private transportation.” Inspired by Jane Jacobs’ 1961 book The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Lores has placed maintaining a “compact city” at the heart of his administration’s policies on urban expansion: concentrating most activities in the city centre, discouraging large department stores on the outskirts, encouraging mixed-use neighbourhoods instead of single-purpose zones (such as a separate ‘city of justice’), like Barcelona’s law courts complex and improving public transport. The aim is not only to reduce unnecessary car travel, but also to bring life to neighbourhoods and strengthen social cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The entire pyramid of preferences was changed: pedestrians come first, then bicycles, scooters, public transportation, and only lastly private transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wandering through the downtown area on any working day, it is surprising to see the large number and diversity of shops, especially for a provincial city. Local boutiques, jewellers, florists, and bookstores all thrive side by side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to the Galician municipality, some other European cities are also taking steps towards more sustainability. Freiburg, for instance, is well known for its sustainable policies, including its regulation of car traffic. In the vibrant university city in southwest Germany, the urban planning process involves local people, bikes account for about 30 per cent of all journeys, and one district – Vauban – is almost entirely car-free. Moreover, in 2019, Oslo became the first European capital to completely ban cars in its central areas. The city has expanded the public transportation network and eliminated hundreds of parking spaces, replacing them with benches, green spaces, and bike paths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Pontevedra, pedestrians clearly take precedence in the centre – and in roughly a third of the city overall. There, the roads and the sidewalks are indistinguishable. For those who see it for the first time, it is startling to witness people walking in the middle of the street, apparently unconcerned, while cars slowly wait behind them until they spontaneously move and let them pass. No one honks; no traffic light is there to tell people when they can or can’t move. And no parking is allowed in the whole area between 6 PM and 8 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the rest of the city, streets are single-track roads with wide sidewalks. Cars can stop during working hours for a limited time (15 minutes for services and 30 for loading and unloading), and parking is allowed between 9 PM and 9 AM. Traffic lights can only be found on the two-lane avenues on the city’s external ring, where pedestrian overpasses and roundabouts remind vehicles to slow down. Only ten minutes away from the city centre, an open-air parking area offers an alternative to the roughly 4,500 private underground parking spaces available in the city. In total, Pontevedra has more than ten free municipal parking sites and approximately 3,500 free parking spaces, all located within a walking distance of 10-15 minutes maximum from the centre. This is especially useful for people who don’t live in the city but have to commute from surrounding areas for work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Safer, healthier, and more accessible&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2010, Pontevedra was the first Spanish city to enact a speed limit of 30 km/h on all roads in its urban territory. At present, the limit is 10 km/h in the downtown area, “but only if there is no one around”, explains Daniel Macenlle, an ex-local policeman and the current director general for protection of citizens at the city council. “If there are people, then it goes down to six.” In the rest of the centre, the maximum speed is 20 kilometres per hour, while in other neighbourhoods, vehicles can go as fast as 30.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is that there have been no fatal accidents on municipal roads for a decade. Today, according to municipality data, 73 per cent of children walk to school (including 44 per cent who go accompanied, and 29 who take the journey on their own). A 2012 study conducted in Denmark, involving 20,000 children and part of a bigger project on the links between concentration, diet, and exercise, found that those who walk or bike to school have higher concentration levels than their peers up to four hours later. &lt;lb/&gt;In Pontevedra, as in other Spanish cities like Barcelona, “school routes” have been implemented for years. These spaces with specific signposts are located around schools to offer students the option of walking to and from school, alone or in groups. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the benefits extend to all residents: overall, the number of people who choose to walk or bike in the Galician municipality has risen from 66 per cent in 2011 to 90 per cent in 2021. Moreover, today about 70 per cent of all trips take place on foot or by bicycle. The city council also estimates that, since the end of the 1990s, CO2 emissions have been reduced by approximately 67 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to know not only the distance by foot, but also the number of steps and the calories burnt to reach a location, people in Pontevedra can try to use Metrominuto.1 The synoptic map includes information about the city’s historic sites, news (e.g. on recent international studies on mobility), and service information (like national subsidies for electric cars).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though it may be assumed that geo-referenced camera checks, fines and towing in place are extensively used to ensure road rules are respected in Pontevedra, most people interviewed said that the system works simply because people find that it is convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is also true for businesses: “A city that is kind to you invites you to explore it and enjoy it. And when you walk around, you also consume,” says Andrés Martínez, 48 and owner of an optical shop in calle de la Oliva, one of the city’s more commercial streets. Andrés lives in the same building where the shop is located and parks his private car in its communal parking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A city that is kind to you invites you to explore it and enjoy it. And when you walk around, you also consume.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another resident is 57-year-old Santi Cachadas, who has been selling fish at the municipal market for 30 years. He points out a different benefit of the city’s model: “People who come to buy pick up and leave, and that means an empty space where a new client can park, and so on, which leads to more movement.” Santi lives about three kilometres away from where he works, and every morning he leaves his car in a free parking lot, built by the Lérez river, and walks for 500 metres to reach his market stall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, it must be noted that two out of five business owners interviewed for this story, one managing a newsstand and one running an eco-products shop, say that their clients often complain about the fact that they cannot find parking spots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When asked why he thinks Pontevedra’s policies have succeeded, the mayor points to several factors: clear communication and education about the city’s goals, networking “with the most proactive and dynamic people in town”, carrying out participatory processes, and the decision not to ban cars outright. And he adds: “We carried out many projects to expand sidewalks and pedestrian spaces; as soon as the project was completed, the space was automatically occupied by activities. We also allowed cars that needed it to enter, and people who had doubts were relieved.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Replicating Pontevedra’s success&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the years, the northwestern Spanish municipality has received numerous awards for its good practices, including the UN-Habitat’s 2014 Dubai International Best Practices Award for Sustainable Development for its city model centred on people, and the 2020 European Commission’s EU Urban Road Safety Award for “impressively achieving zero road deaths between 2011 and 2018”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When invited to answer whether he thinks Pontevedra’s success is exportable, Lores quickly replies that each city has to find its own model and strategy, and that every external example needs to be translated. And when asked if there is at least some lesson he believes could serve as an inspiration for other cities, and if so, for what type of city, without hesitation he states: “Changing the paradigm by moving away from a town imagined for the cars back to one for the people”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I learn about cryptographic vulnerabilities all the time, and they generally fill me with some combination of jealousy (“oh, why didn’t I think of that”) or else they impress me with the brilliance of their inventors. But there’s also another class of vulnerabilities: these are the ones that can’t possibly exist in important production software, because there’s no way anyone could still do that in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today I want to talk about one of those ridiculous ones, something Microsoft calls “low tech, high-impact”. This vulnerability isn’t particularly new; in fact the worst part about it is that it’s had a name for over a decade, and it’s existed for longer than that. I’ll bet most Windows people already know this stuff, but I only happened to learn about it today, after seeing a letter from Senator Wyden to Microsoft, describing how this vulnerability was used in the May 2024 ransomware attack on the Ascension Health hospital system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vulnerability is called Kerberoasting, and TL;DR it relies on the fact that Microsoft’s Active Directory is very, very old. And also: RC4. If you don’t already know where I’m going with this, please read on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple of updates: The folks on HN pointed out that I was using some incorrect terms in here (sorry!) and added some good notes, so I’m updating below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What’s Kerberos, and what’s Active Directory?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s Active Directory (AD) is a many-tentacled octopus that controls access to almost every network that runs Windows machines. The system uses centralized authentication servers to determine who gets access to which network resources. If an employee’s computer needs to access some network Service (a file server, say), an Active Directory server authenticates the user and helps them get securely connected to the Service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that AD is also the main barrier ensuring that attackers can’t extend their reach deeper into a corporate network. If an attacker somehow gets a toehold inside an enterprise (for example, because an employee clicks on a malicious Bing link), they should absolutely not be able to move laterally and take over critical network services. That’s because any such access would require the employee’s machine to have access to specialized accounts (called “Service accounts”) with privileges to fully control those machines. A well-managed network obviously won’t allow this. This means that AD is the “guardian” that stands between most companies and total disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Active Directory is a monster dragged from the depths of time. It uses the Kerberos protocol, which was first introduced in early 1989. A lot of things have happened since 1989! In fairness to Microsoft, Active Directory itself didn’t actually debut until about 1999; but (in less fairness), large portions of its legacy cryptography from that time period appear to still be supported in AD. This is very bad, because the cryptography is exceptionally terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me get specific.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you want to obtain access to some network resource (a “Service” in AD parlance), you first contact an AD server (called a KDC) to obtain a “ticket” that you can send to the Service to authenticate. This ticket is encrypted using a long-term Service “password” established at the KDC and the Service itself, and it’s handed to the user making the call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, ideally, this Service password is not really a password at all: it’s actually a randomly-generated cryptographic key. Microsoft even has systems in place to generate and rotate these keys regularly. This means the encrypted ticket will be completely inscrutable to the user who receives it, even if they’re malicious. But occasionally network administrators will make mistakes, and one (apparently) somewhat common mistake is to set up a Service that’s connected to an ordinary user account, complete with a human-generated password.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since human passwords probably are not cryptographically strong, the tickets encrypted using them are extremely vulnerable to cracking. This is very bad, since any random user — including our hypothetical laptop malware hacker — can now obtain a copy of such a ticket, and attempt to crack the Service’s password offline by trying many candidate passwords using a dictionary attack. The result of this is that the user learns an account password that lets them completely control that essential Service. And the result of that (with a few extra steps) is often ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Isn’t that cute?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;That doesn’t actually seem very cute?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s not. It’s actually a terrible design that should have been done away with decades ago. We should not build systems where any random attacker who compromises a single employee laptop can ask for a message encrypted under a critical password! This basically invites offline cracking attacks, which do not need even to be executed on the compromised laptop — they can be exported out of the network to another location and performed using GPUs and other hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a few things that can stop this attack in practice. As we noted above, if the account has a long enough (random!) password, then cracking it should be virtually impossible. Microsoft could prevent users from configuring services with weak human-generated passwords, but apparently they don’t — at least because this is something that’s happened many times (including at Ascension Health.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let’s say you did not use a strong cryptographic key as your Service’s password. Where are you?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your best hope in this case is that the encrypted tickets are extremely challenging for an attacker to crack. That’s because at this point, the only thing preventing the attacker from accessing your Service is computing power. But — and this is a very weak “but” — computing power can still be a deterrent! In the “standard” authentication mode, tickets are encrypted with AES, using a key derived using 4,096 iterations of PBKDF2 hashing, based on the Service password and a per-account salt (Update: which is not truly random salt, it’s a combination of domain and principal name.) The salt means an attacker cannot easily pre-compute a dictionary of hashed passwords, and while the PBKDF2 (plus AES) isn’t an amazing defense, it puts some limits on the number of password guesses that can be attempted in a given unit of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This page by Chick3nman gives some excellent password cracking statistics computed using an RTX 5090. It implies that a hacker can try 6.8 million candidate passwords every second, using AES-128 and PBKDF2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;So that’s not great. But also not terrible, right?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t the end of the story. In fact it’s self-evident that this is not the end of the story, because Active Directory was invented in 1999, which means at some point we’ll have to deal with RC4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing. Anytime you see cryptography born in the 1990s and yet using AES, you cannot be dealing with the original. What you’re looking at is the modernized, “upgraded” version of the original. The original probably used an abacus and witchcraft, or (failing that) at least some combination of unsalted hash functions and RC4. And here’s the worst part: it turns out that in Active Directory, when a user does not configure a Service account to use a more recent mode, then Kerberos will indeed fall back to RC4, combined with unsalted NT hashes (basically, one iteration of MD4.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main implication of using RC4 (and NT hashing) is that tickets encrypted this way become hilariously, absurdly fast to crack. According to our friend Chick3nman, the same RTX 5090 can attempt 4.18 billion (with a “b”) password guesses every second. That’s roughly 1000x faster than the AES variant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an aside, the NT hashes are not salted, which means &lt;del&gt;they’re vulnerable to pre-computation attacks that involve rainbow tables.&lt;/del&gt; I had been meaning to write about rainbow tables recently on this blog, but had convinced myself that they mostly don’t matter, given that these ancient unsalted hash functions are going away. I guess maybe I spoke too soon? Update: see Tom Tervoort’s excellent comment below, which mentions that there is a random 8-byte “confounder” acting as a salt during key derivation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;So what is Microsoft doing about this?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly not enough. These “Kerberoasting” attacks have been around for ages: the technique and name is credited to Tim Medin who presented it in 2014 (and many popular blogs followed up on it) but the vulnerabilities themselves are much older. The fact that there are practical ransomware attacks using these ideas in 2024 indicates that (1) system administrators aren’t hardening things enough, but more importantly, (2) Microsoft is still not turning off the unsafe options that make these attacks possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To give some sense of where we are, in October 2024, Microsoft published a blog post on how to avoid Kerberos-based attacks (NB: I cannot say Kerberoasting again and take myself seriously).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The recommendations are all kind of dismal. They recommend that administrators should use proper automated key assignment, and if they can’t do that, then to try to pick “really good long passwords”, and if they can’t do that, to pretty please shut off RC4. But Microsoft doesn’t seem to do anything proactive, like absolutely banning obsolete legacy stuff, or being completely obnoxious and forcing admins to upgrade their weird and bad legacy configurations. Instead this all seems much more like a reluctant and half-baked bit of vulnerability management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m sure there are some reasons why this is, but I refuse to believe they’re good reasons, and Microsoft should probably try a lot harder to make sure these obsolete services go away. It isn’t 1999 anymore, and it isn’t even 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don’t believe me on these points, go ask Ascension Health.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey HN, we're David and Amanda from Recall.ai (&lt;/p&gt;https://www.recall.ai&lt;p&gt;). Today we’re launching our Desktop Recording SDK, a way to get meeting data without a bot in the meeting: &lt;/p&gt;https://www.recall.ai/product/desktop-recording-sdk&lt;p&gt;. It’s our biggest release in quite a while so we thought we’d finally do our Launch HN :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a demo that shows it producing a transcript from a meeting, followed by examples in code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4croAGGiKTA . API docs are at https://docs.recall.ai/.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in W20, our first product was an API that lets you send a bot participant into a meeting. This gives developers access to audio/video streams and other data in the meeting. Today, this API powers most of the meeting recording products on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, meeting recording through a desktop form factor instead of a bot has become popular. Many products like Notion and ChatGPT have added desktop recording functionality, and LLMs have made it easier to work with unstructured transcripts. But it’s actually hard to reliably record meetings at scale with a desktop app, and most developers who want to add recording functionality don’t want to build all this infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing a basic recording with just the microphone and system audio is fairly straightforward since you can just use the system APIs. But it gets a lot harder when you want to capture speaker names, produce a video recording, get real-time data, or run this in production at large scale:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Capturing speaker names involves using accessibility APIs to screen-scrape the video conference window to monitor who is speaking at what time. When video conferencing platforms change their UI, we must ship a change immediately, so this keeps working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Producing a video recording that is clean, and doesn’t capture the video conferencing platform UI involves detecting the participant tiles, cropping them out, and compositing them together into a clean video recording.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Because the desktop recording code runs on end-user machines, we need to make it as efficient as possible. This means writing highly platform-optimized code, taking advantage of hardware encoders when available, and spending a lot of time doing profiling and performance testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meeting recording has zero margin for failure because if anything breaks, you lose the data forever. Reliability is especially important, which dramatically increases the amount of engineering effort required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Desktop Recording SDK takes care of all this and lets developers build meeting recording features into their desktop apps, so they can record both video conferences and in-person meetings without a bot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We built Recall.ai because we experienced this problem ourselves. At our first startup, we built a tool for product managers that included a meeting recording feature. 70% of our engineering time was taken up by just this feature! We ended up starting Recall.ai to solve this instead. Since then, over 2000 companies use us to power their recording features, e.g. Hubspot for sales call recording, Clickup for their AI note taker. Our users are engineering teams building commercial products for financial services, telehealth, incident management, sales, interviewing, and more. We also power internal tooling for large enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running this sort of infrastructure has led to unexpected technical challenges! For example, we had to debug a 1 in 36 million segfault in our audio encoder (https://www.recall.ai/blog/debugging-a-1-in-36-000-000-segfa...), we encountered a Postgres lock-up that only occurs when you have tens of thousands of concurrent writers (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44490510), and we saved over $1M a year on AWS by optimizing the way we shuffle data around between our processes (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42067275).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can try it here: https://www.recall.ai. It's self-serve with $5 of free credits. Pricing starts at $0.70 for every hour of recording, prorated to the second. We offer volume discounts with scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All data recorded through Recall.ai is the property of our customers, we support 0-day retention, and we don’t train models on customer data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We would love your feedback!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I didn't bring my son to a museum to look at screens&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;If your museum's exhibits could be experienced just as well on an iPad at home, you're doing it wrong.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was a kid in the ’80s, one of my two favorite places on Earth was The Franklin Institute (TFI) in downtown Philadelphia. We lived a couple hours away so a visit was a rare and precious thing. I think I only visited two or three times but it left an indelible impression on me. I remember wandering in amazement through its enormous spaces getting to actually play with amazing and interesting things. I remember sweeping off a table and then filling an overhanging funnel pendulum with sand, setting it going, and watching it create unexpected patterns on the table. I remember running through the gigantic model heart with other kids. I remember the overpowering joy of being in an actual monumental marble temple of curiosity and fascination. So I was filled with anticipation a couple weeks ago when, during a family trip to the East Coast, we managed to squeeze in a visit to TFI with our six-year-old son.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We parked and ran in, paid close to ninety bucks (ouch! but I love you, so take my money), and started off on the top floor with the Wondrous Space exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And were met with screens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Design your own rocket! it said (or something like that). No, I thought, this isn’t designing a rocket, this is playing a lame video game on a touchscreen. Yes, there were space-related artifacts around the walls, and a spacesuit in its own large case, but you couldn’t touch any of this stuff, you couldn’t play with it, you could just look at it for a few seconds, read the placard, say “huh”, and maybe point out some interesting feature to the kiddo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the screens were given pride of place, dead center in the dimly-lit space. And so they beckoned. My wife — a science writer who used to be the only staff writer covering space for New Scientist and before that, worked at NASA — poked at one of these with my son, added too many boosters to their launch vehicle, and were told it failed “for reasons” in a way she found totally unhelpful and pointless. She led our son gently but firmly away to the glorious four-story Foucault pendulum which hangs in a stairwell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some images from the website showing patrons interacting with (or running past) screens so you can see what I’m talking about:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the screens were all over the place. There were on the main floor, in another section of Wondrous Space, and in the Body Odyssey exhibit. They were all over the SportsZone exhibit on the top floor. Many of them are connected to body motion sensors a la Xbox Kinect so you don’t need to touch them, but they’re still just video games, where the action-response feedback loop is provided by software, not the universe itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the wonderful hands-on physical stuff that I loved as a kid? Jammed into out-of-the-way spaces in the Sir Isaac’s Loft and Air Show rooms. These rooms are terrific, and I was delighted to see they were absolutely packed with kids playing with stuff. No screens, just objects and forces — you don’t even need to read anything to enjoy many of the exhibits, such as the one where you sit in one of two chairs hanging from different configurations of block-and-tackle and haul yourself up — and then just let yourself drop, cushioned by a damping piston. Tucked far away in a desolate corner by a hallway we discovered an engaging exhibit where you pluck rods with your finger to generate Lissajous curves from the vibrations. My son was fascinated; he had never seen anything behave like that. And in the Air Show room he liked many of the exhibits, like the one where you (apparently) evacuate a cylinder to see the effect that has on objects moving through it (versus a control). And the “shimmer wall”, where kids generate sound waves using a variety of devices and can then see the sound waves impacting on a reflective and reactive surface was wonderful and really conveys the mechanical nature of sound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But these physical exhibits require maintenance, and I was dismayed to see that several are in bad repair; some of them weren’t even working anymore, some seemed worn out, or didn’t seem well-designed to begin with. For instance, they have the classic “bicycle wheel and rotating stool” gyro effect demonstration, but the wheel was too large a diameter for my son to hold, and the stool seemed to have too much friction to work properly for my wife. There was no one trying to use it before or after us; I’d be curious to see the data on how many visitors attempt it, and how well it usually works for them. And that one should be trivial to design and implement properly: for crying out loud, our local ice cream shop has stools that spin on ball bearings, and I think that would be a big improvement. Every time something didn’t work right I couldn’t help thinking: we paid almost ninety bucks to visit this place. TFI doesn’t seem poor; it seems like its budgetary priorities lie elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And where it looks like the budget has been going are the screen rooms. They occupy the huge central spaces on the main floor of the museum, and I’m sure a lot of time, money, and passion went into these things. But it’s misguided.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe museums exist to present the real thing for the visitor to experience with their own senses. Here’s the sculpture — the actual piece of stone, two thousand years old, Greek sculptor unknown — now go ahead and form your impressions. Come back to it when you’re an old man or woman, it will still be here, and you will see it with different eyes. This is a tiny but, to me, beautiful part of the human condition. And what made the Franklin Institute so amazingly special to me as a kid was that the exhibits sat at the intersection of things that kids want to play with, things that kids are allowed to play with, and things that demonstrate some “hey, that’s cool!” scientific phenomenon. And it was all real.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But a lame video game? I can do that on my goddamn phone. TFI “was one of the first museums in the nation to offer a hands-on approach to learning about the physical world”, but — and I can’t emphasize this enough, it’s my whole reason for writing this — touchscreens are not actually hands-on. Digital representations aren’t tangible, and touchscreen experiences just don’t activate a kid’s brain (including, I’d say, a sense of delight) the same way a genuinely hands-on experience, like pulling hard on a rope to raise your chair, does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t know why museums are doing this; my idle speculation is that they see themselves as competing with screens for attention, so in a kind of experiential race to the bottom, they feel compelled to bring screens into their exhibits (see: Amusing Ourselves to Death). But now more than ever in history, kids need a break from the screens that all too many of them are sadly often plugged into by default, and connection to the real world instead. Now is the time for TFI — and all museums — to take a stand against the tidal wave of digital garbage that is consuming humanity, especially kids, by eliminating all of their touchscreen “exhibits”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be fair, TFI is still pretty damn great if you just ignore all the screens. The Franklin Memorial rotunda (free to visit!) is gorgeous. The hands-on stuff, tucked away and apparently suffering from neglect though it is, should be replicated in every city in the world. But it would be so much better if they removed all the screens and put that budget and real estate toward the real, tangible, interactive science exhibits that were the reason the museum was created in the first place, and what made me love it as a child.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act may have quietly changed the economics of the creator economy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury Department this past week released a list of occupations “that customarily and regularly received tips” and thus will be eligible for the administration’s flagship “no tax on tips” policy, which will let eligible taxpayers deduct their tipped income, within certain limits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And while the list includes the obvious (bartenders, food servers, casino dealers and housekeepers are all there) it also includes some surprising jobs that could alter the economics of the creator economy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Related Stories&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s because the Treasury Department has determined that “digital content creators” are eligible, including podcasters, social media influencers and streamers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comedians, singers, musicians, DJs and magicians are also included, though that is more relevant to the wedding performer crowd than Grammy-winners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The change could cause digital creators to rethink how they seek income. Platforms like TikTok, YouTube, Twitch and Snapchat all offer a variety of ways for creators to generate income, be it a share of advertising revenue or creator funding programs, or options to launch subscription tiers for their channels or profiles. But they also give creators the option to turn on tips or gifts. If revenue from user tips or gifts is eligible, while recurring subscription revenue is not, it could shift how streamers, podcasters or influencers ask their followers to support them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be sure, there are limitations: The tax deduction is capped at $25,000 per year, and it begins to phase out at $150,000 in income for single filers and $300,000 for married joint filers. The act also provides that tips do not qualify for the deduction if they are received “in the course of certain specified trades or businesses — including the fields of health, performing arts, and athletics,” Treasury says, further limiting the deduction opportunity for some in entertainment-adjacent lines of work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But by making influencers, Twitch streamers and podcasters eligible, the administration has nonetheless changed the incentive structure for digital creators, and the ramifications could be felt across the creator economy in the name of tax efficiency (Don’t be surprised if users are asked to like, subscribe, and tip).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Platforms may also develop more ways to more prominently feature tips and gifts, pushing creators to add more opportunities for that income.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the inclusion of digital creators is also a recognition of how the power dynamics have shifted in media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Podcasters and creators, as everyone knows by now, have emerged as a driving force in today’s political climate, and the classification by Treasury could push more people to consider joining the fray or ramping up their content, as long as it is tipped, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Defeating Nondeterminism in LLM Inference&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reproducibility is a bedrock of scientific progress. However, it’s remarkably difficult to get reproducible results out of large language models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, you might observe that asking ChatGPT the same question multiple times provides different results. This by itself is not surprising, since getting a result from a language model involves “sampling”, a process that converts the language model’s output into a probability distribution and probabilistically selects a token.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What might be more surprising is that even when we adjust the temperature down to 0This means that the LLM always chooses the highest probability token, which is called greedy sampling. (thus making the sampling theoretically deterministic), LLM APIs are still not deterministic in practice (see past discussions here, here, or here). Even when running inference on your own hardware with an OSS inference library like vLLM or SGLang, sampling still isn’t deterministic (see here or here).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why aren’t LLM inference engines deterministic? One common hypothesis is that some combination of floating-point non-associativity and concurrent execution leads to nondeterminism based on which concurrent core finishes first. We will call this the “concurrency + floating point” hypothesis for LLM inference nondeterminism. For example, a recent arXiv preprint writes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Floating-point arithmetic in GPUs exhibits non-associativity, meaning $(a + b) + c \neq a + (b + c)$ due to finite precision and rounding errors. This property directly impacts the computation of attention scores and logits in the transformer architecture, where parallel operations across multiple threads can yield different results based on execution order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also find the “concurrency + floating point” hypothesis repeated by others, like here (“There are speed tradeoffs, and in order to make the endpoints fast GPUs are used, which do parallel [nondeterministic] calculations. Any modern GPU neural net calculations will be subject to these."), or here (“Because GPUs are highly parallelized, the ordering of additions or multiplications might be different on each execution, which can cascade into small differences in output.").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this hypothesis is not entirely wrong, it doesn’t reveal the full picture. For example, even on a GPU, running the same matrix multiplication on the same data repeatedly will always provide bitwise equal results. We’re definitely using floating-point numbers. And our GPU definitely has a lot of concurrency. Why don’t we see nondeterminism in this test?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;A = torch.randn(2048, 2048, device='cuda', dtype=torch.bfloat16)
B = torch.randn(2048, 2048, device='cuda', dtype=torch.bfloat16)
ref = torch.mm(A, B)
for _ in range(1000):
    assert (torch.mm(A, B) - ref).abs().max().item() == 0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the true cause of LLM inference nondeterminism, we must look deeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, even defining what it means for LLM inference to be deterministic is difficult. Perhaps confusingly, the following statements are all simultaneously true:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Some kernels on GPUs are nondeterministic.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;However, all the kernels used in a language model’s forward pass are deterministic.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Moreover, the forward pass of an LLM inference server (like vLLM) can also be claimed to be deterministic.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Nevertheless, from the perspective of anybody using the inference server, the results are nondeterministic.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this post, we will explain why the “concurrency + floating point” hypothesis misses the mark, unmask the true culprit behind LLM inference nondeterminism, and explain how to defeat nondeterminism and obtain truly reproducible results in LLM inference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The original sin: floating-point non-associativity&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before talking about nondeterminism, it’s useful to explain why there are numerical differences at all. After all, we typically think of machine learning models as mathematical functions following structural rules such as commutativity or associativity. Shouldn’t there be a “mathematically correct” result that our machine learning libraries should provide us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The culprit is floating-point non-associativity. That is, with floating-point numbers:&lt;/p&gt;$$ (a + b) + c \neq a + (b + c) $$&lt;code&gt;(0.1 + 1e20) - 1e20
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 0
0.1 + (1e20 - 1e20)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 0.1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, breaking associativity is what makes floating-point numbers useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Floating-point numbers are useful because they allow for a “dynamic” level of precision. For the purposes of explanation, we will use base 10 (instead of binary), where floating-point numbers are in the format $\text{mantissa} * 10^\text{exponent}$. We will also use 3 digits for the mantissa and 1 digit for the exponent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, for the value 3450, we can represent it exactly as $3.45 * 10^3$. We can also represent much smaller values like 0.486 as $4.86 * 10^{-1}$. In this way, floating point allows us to represent both very small as well as very large values. In the sciences, we might say that floating point allows us to maintain a constant number of “significant figures”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you add together two floating-point numbers with the same exponent, it looks similar to integer addition. For example, 123 ($1.23 * 10^2$) + 456 ($4.56 * 10^2$) results in 579 ($5.79 * 10^2$).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what happens when we add two floating-point numbers with different exponents, such as 1230 and 23.4? In this case, the exact result is 1253.4. However, we can only maintain 3 digits of precision at a time. Floating-point addition will thus drop the last 2 digits and obtain the value $1.25 * 10^3$ (or 1250).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, however, we’ve destroyed information. Note that this can happen every time we add two floating-point numbers with different “scales” (i.e. different exponents). And adding together floating-point numbers with different exponents happens all of the time. In fact, if we could guarantee that we never needed different exponents, we could just use integers!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, every time we add together floating-point numbers in a different order, we can get a completely different result. To take an extreme example, there are 102 possible different results for summing this array depending on the order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;import random

vals = [1e-10, 1e-5, 1e-2, 1]
vals = vals + [-v for v in vals]

results = []
random.seed(42)
for _ in range(10000):
    random.shuffle(vals)
    results.append(sum(vals))

results = sorted(set(results))
print(f"There are {len(results)} unique results: {results}")

# Output:
# There are 102 unique results: [-8.326672684688674e-17, -7.45931094670027e-17, ..., 8.326672684688674e-17]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this is the underlying cause for non-identical outputs, it does not directly answer where the nondeterminism comes from. It doesn’t help us understand why floating-point values get added in different orders, when that happens, nor how it can be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answers lie in how kernels are implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why don’t kernels always add numbers in the same order?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, one common explanation for why kernels add numbers in different orders is the “concurrency + floating point” hypothesis. The hypothesis states that if the order in which concurrent threads finish is nondeterministic and the accumulation order depends on the order in which concurrent threads finish (such as with an atomic add), our accumulation order will be nondeterministic as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confusingly, although this can lead to nondeterministic kernels, concurrency (and atomic adds) end up being completely uninvolved in LLM inference nondeterminism! To explain what the real culprit is, let’s first understand why modern GPU kernels rarely need atomic adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When are atomic adds needed?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically a GPU launches a program concurrently across many “cores” (i.e. SMs). As the cores have no inherent synchronization among them, this poses a challenge if the cores need to communicate among each other. For example, if all cores must accumulate to the same element, you can use an “atomic add” (sometimes known as a “fetch-and-add”). The atomic add is “nondeterministic” — the order in which the results accumulate is purely dependent on which core finishes first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concretely, imagine that you are reducing a 100-element vector with 100 cores (e.g. &lt;code&gt;torch.sum()&lt;/code&gt;). Although you can load all 100 elements in parallel, we must eventually reduce down to a single element. One way to accomplish this is with some kind of “atomic add” primitive, where the hardware guarantees that all additions will be processed but does not guarantee the order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is usually what folks mean by “nondeterminism” — you execute the same kernel twice with exactly the same inputs and you get a different result out. This is known as run-to-run nondeterminism, where you run the same python script twice with the exact same dependencies but get a different result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although concurrent atomic adds do make a kernel nondeterministic, atomic adds are not necessary for the vast majority of kernels. In fact, in the typical forward pass of an LLM, there is usually not a single atomic add present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be surprising, given that parallelizing a reduction can benefit from atomic adds. There are two main reasons why atomic adds do not end up being needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;There is often sufficient parallelism along the “batch” dimension that we don’t need to parallelize along the reduction dimension. For example, let’s say that instead of reducing a single 100-dim vector we were reducing 500 vectors in parallel. In this case, we can reduce an entire vector in each core and allow every core to operate on a different vector.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Over time, most neural network libraries have adopted a variety of strategies for achieving determinism without sacrificing performance. For example, we can perform a “split” (or tree) reduction, where we split the 100-element reduction into five 20-element reductions (thus achieving five-way parallelism). Then, to combine the remaining five elements, we can either perform a separate “clean-up” reduction (which isn’t parallelized, but operates over few enough elements to be cheap) or utilize a semaphore (which ensures that each concurrent thread-block will accumulate in a deterministic order).The semaphore strategy can be found described here.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to these two factors, avoiding atomics adds is a negligible performance penalty for the vast majority of neural network operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still a couple of common operations that have significant performance penalties for avoiding atomics. For example, &lt;code&gt;scatter_add&lt;/code&gt; in PyTorch (&lt;code&gt;a[b] += c&lt;/code&gt;). The only one commonly used in LLMs, however, is FlashAttention backward.Fun fact: did you know that the widely used Triton implementations of FlashAttention backward actually differ algorithmically from Tri Dao’s FlashAttention-2 paper? The standard Triton implementation does additional recomputation in the backward pass, avoiding atomics but costing 40% more FLOPs!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the forward pass of an LLM involves no operations that require atomic adds. Thus, the forward pass in an LLM is in fact “run-to-run deterministic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia writes that “a deterministic algorithm is an algorithm that, given a particular input, will always produce the same output.” And in this case, given the exact same inputs (i.e. the exact requests the inference server is processing), the forward pass always produces the exact same outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the forward pass itself being “deterministic” is not sufficient to ensure that a system that includes it is deterministic. For example, what if our request’s output depended on the parallel user requests (e.g. batch-norm)? Since each individual request has no way of knowing what the parallel requests will be, from their perspective our overall LLM inference is also nondeterministic!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, our request’s output does depend on the parallel user requests. Not because we’re somehow leaking information across batches — instead, it’s because our forward pass lacks “batch invariance”, causing our request’s output to depend on the batch size of our forward pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Batch invariance and “determinism”&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explain batch invariance, let’s simplify the system and look solely at matmuls. You can assume that all matmul implementations are “run-to-run deterministic."This is not totally true, but most common matmul implementations do have this property. However, they are not “batch-invariant.” In other words, when the batch size changes, each element in the batch can get different results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly unusual property from a mathematical perspective. Matrix multiplication should be “independent” along every element in the batch — neither the other elements in the batch nor how large the batch is should affect the computation results of a specific element in the batch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as we can observe empirically, this isn’t true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;import torch
torch.set_default_device('cuda') 

B = 2048
D = 4096
a = torch.linspace(-1000, 1000, B*D).reshape(B, D)
b = torch.linspace(-1000, 1000, D*D).reshape(D, D)
# Doing a matrix vector multiplication by taking
# the first element of the batch
out1 = torch.mm(a[:1], b)
# Doing a matrix matrix multiplication and then taking
# the first element of the batch
out2 = torch.mm(a, b)[:1]
print((out1 - out2).abs().max()) # tensor(1669.2500, device='cuda:0')
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that this is “run-to-run deterministic.” If you run the script multiple times, it will deterministically return the same result.It is not “hardware/software version invariant” — your GPU/PyTorch version may return a different value, but it should deterministically return the same value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when a non-batch-invariant kernel is used as part of a larger inference system, the system can become nondeterministic. When you make a query to an inference endpoint, the amount of load the server is under is effectively “nondeterministic” from the user’s perspective. The load determines the batch size that the kernels are run under, and thus changes the eventual result of each individual request!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you compose some property under which the kernel is not invariant (i.e. batch-size) with nondeterminism of that property (i.e. the load the server is under), you get a nondeterministic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the primary reason nearly all LLM inference endpoints are nondeterministic is that the load (and thus batch-size) nondeterministically varies! This nondeterminism is not unique to GPUs — LLM inference endpoints served from CPUs or TPUs will also have this source of nondeterminism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if we’d like to avoid nondeterminism in our inference servers, we must achieve batch invariance in our kernels. In order to understand how that can be achieved, let’s first take a look at why kernels don’t have batch invariance in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How do we make kernels batch-invariant?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to make a transformer implementation batch-invariant, we must make every kernel batch-invariant. Luckily, we can assume that every pointwise operation is batch-invariant.Although this is true for all kernels in say, PyTorch, it’s not inherently true. For example, there are some kernel implementations on CPU that will use vectorized intrinsics on some parts of the array and non-vectorized intrinsics on other parts, and these intrinsics don’t necessarily always have bitwise identical numerics. Thus, we only need to worry about the 3 operations that involve reductions — RMSNorm, matrix multiplication, and attention.Reductions related to parallelism are out of the scope of this discussion, but the same principles apply. One factoid that may be useful is that NVLink-Sharp in-switch reductions are deterministic on Blackwell as well as Hopper with CUDA 12.8+. As is the case with many things, this information can be found on NCCL’s github issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conveniently, these are also ordered in ascending levels of difficulty. Each one requires some additional considerations to achieve batch invariance with reasonable performance. Let’s talk about RMSNorm first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Batch-invariant RMSNorm&lt;/head&gt;RMSNorm can be implemented as:&lt;code&gt;# x: [batch_size, hidden_dim]
# weight: [hidden_dim]
def rms_norm(x, weight):
    return x * torch.rsqrt(torch.mean(x ** 2, dim=-1, keepdim=True)) * weight
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The requirement for batch invariance is that the reduction order for each element must be fixed regardless of the batch-size of the kernel. Note that this doesn’t mean we must always use the same reduction strategy. For example, if we change the number of elements we’re reducing over, we can still be batch-invariant even if our reduction strategy changes.The Quack blog post has some nice examples showing the hierarchy of various reduction strategies you can do (e.g. thread reduction, warp reduction, block reduction, cluster reduction).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, we only break batch invariance when our batch-size affects the reduction strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the standard parallelism strategy for RMSNorm. Generally, parallel algorithms benefit from minimizing communication across cores. For the purpose of this discussion you can assume that when we refer to “cores” we mean SMs. More specifically, the property here that’s important is that the # of threadblocks our kernel launches is greater than the # of SMs. So, one strategy we can start with is to assign each batch element to one core, as seen in the above figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing our batch size doesn’t affect our reduction strategy; if a batch size of 200 provides sufficient parallelism to our kernel then a batch size of 2000 will definitely provide sufficient parallelism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, decreasing the batch size can pose challenges. Because we assign each batch element to one core, decreasing our batch size will eventually lead to having more cores than batch elements, leaving some cores idle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon encountering this situation, a good kernel engineer would reach for one of the solutions mentioned in the prior section (atomic adds or split reductions), maintaining good parallelism and thus, good performance. Unfortunately, this changes the reduction strategy, preventing this kernel from being batch-invariant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easiest solution is to simply ignore these cases altogether. This is not completely unreasonable — a small batch size means that the kernel is likely to execute quickly anyways, and so a slowdown may not be catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we were compelled to optimize this use case, one approach would be to consistently use a reduction strategy that has enough parallelism even for very small batch sizes. Such a reduction strategy would lead to an excess amount of parallelism for larger batch sizes but would allow us to achieve decent (but not peak) performance across the entire range of sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Batch-invariant matrix multiplication&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its core, you can view matrix multiplication as simply a pointwise operation followed by a reduction. Then, if we parallelize our matrix multiplication by chunking the output into tiles, we have an analogous “data-parallel” kernel strategy that keeps each reduction within one core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also similar to RMSNorm, it is possible for our “batch” dimensions (M and N) to become too small, forcing us to split along the reduction dimension (K). Despite having two “batch” dimensions, matmuls also require us to have much more “work” per core in order to leverage tensorcores effectively. For example, if you have a [1024, K] x [K, 1024] matmul and a standard 2D tile size of [128, 128], a data-parallel strategy would only be able to split this matmul into 64 cores, insufficient to saturate the GPU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Splitting along the reduction dimension in a matmul is known as a Split-K Matmul. And just like RMSNorm, using this strategy breaks batch invariance. Another interesting parallelism strategy for matmuls is stream-k. Stream-k is interesting because it has even less invariance than typical matmuls. As discussed, most matmul libraries are not batch-invariant, but they’re at least what you could call batch-position-invariant (i.e. changing the position of the element within the batch does not affect numerics). However, stream-k is not batch-position-invariant either! Its core insight is that you can get cleaner load-balancing by splitting along k in different ways for different output tiles, but taking advantage of this makes our kernel not batch-position-invariant either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s an additional complexity with matmuls — tensor core instructions. Whereas with reductions we could simply operate on one row at a time, efficient matrix multiplication kernels must operate on an entire “tile” at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each tensor-core instruction (like say, &lt;code&gt;wgmma.mma_async.sync.aligned.m64n128k16&lt;/code&gt;) may have a different reduction order internally. One reason to use a different tensor-core instruction might be that the batch size is very small. For example, if we use a tensor-core PTX instruction that operates on a tile of length 256 but the batch size is only 32, we’re wasting almost all of that compute! At a batch-size of 1, the fastest kernels usually don’t use tensor cores at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the easiest way to ensure batch invariance for matmuls is to compile one kernel configuration and use that for all shapes. Although we will lose some performance, this isn’t typically disastrous in LLM inference. In particular, split-k is most needed when both M and N are small, and luckily in our case, N (i.e. the model dim) is usually pretty large!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Batch-invariant attention&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;After obtaining batch invariance for matmuls, attention introduces two additional wrinkles — fittingly, because it contains two matmuls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;As opposed to only reducing over the feature dimension like both RMSNorm and matmuls, we now reduce over the feature dimension and sequence dimension.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Due to the above, attention must deal with a variety of inference optimizations that affect how sequences get processed (chunked prefill, prefix caching, etc.).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, to achieve determinism in LLM inference our numerics must be invariant to both how many requests are processed at once and how each request gets sliced up in the inference engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s first walk through the standard parallelism strategy for attention, first introduced in FlashAttention2. Similar to RMSNorm and Matmul, the default strategy is a “data-parallel” strategy. Since we reduce along the key/value tensors, a data-parallel strategy can only parallelize along the query tensor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, depending on the inference engine’s choices, it’s possible that a sequence might get processed in several parts (such as in chunked prefill) or perhaps all at once (if the prefill isn’t split up). In order to achieve “batch invariance”, it’s necessary that the reduction order for a given token does not depend on how many other tokens from its sequence are being simultaneously processed. If you reduce over the K/V values in the KV cache separately from the K/V values in the current tokens being processed (like in vLLM’s Triton attention kernel), this can’t be achieved. For example, when processing the 1000th query token in a sequence, the reduction order must be identical regardless of whether 0 tokens are in the KV cache (prefill) or 999 tokens are in the KV cache (decoding).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To resolve this, we can just update the KV cache and page table before the attention kernel itself, ensuring that our keys and values are always consistently laid out regardless of how many tokens are being processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this additional detail (as well as all the things mentioned in the previous section, like consistent tile sizes), we are able to achieve a batch-invariant attention implementation!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is a significant problem here. Unlike with matrix multiplication, the attention shapes we see in LLM inference often do require a split-reduction kernel, often known as Split-KV or FlashDecoding. This is because if we don’t parallelize along the reduction, we can only parallelize along the batch dimension, head dimension, and “query length” dimension. In the decode stage of attention, query length is very small, and so unless we have a very large batch size we are often unable to saturate the GPU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it’s not as easy to ignore this case as it was for RMSNorm and Matmuls. For example, if you have a very long KV cache, the attention kernel may take a very long time despite only processing one request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the split-reduction strategies commonly used for attention also pose challenges for batch invariance. For example, FlashInfer’s “balanced scheduling algorithm” chooses the largest split-size that can still saturate all the GPU’s cores, thus making the reduction strategy not “batch-invariant”. However, unlike with RMSNorm/Matmuls, it’s not sufficient to choose a fixed number of splits regardless of the batch size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, to achieve batch invariance, we must adopt a “fixed split-size” strategy. In other words, instead of fixing the # of splits, we fix the size of each split and then end up with a varying number of splits. In this manner, we can guarantee that regardless of how many tokens we’re processing, we always perform the identical reduction order. This requires some internal FlexAttention changes that are not included in our code release. We will upstream them in the near future!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Implementation&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We provide a demonstration of deterministic inference on top of vLLM by leveraging its FlexAttention backend as well as torch.Library. Through torch.Library, we’re able to substitute out most of the relevant PyTorch operators in an unintrusive way. You can find the library of “batch-invariant” kernels at thinking-machines-lab/batch-invariant-ops, as well as the vLLM example of running in “deterministic” mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Experiments&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How nondeterministic are completions?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;code&gt;Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507&lt;/code&gt; and sample 1000 completions at temperature 0 with the prompt “Tell me about Richard Feynman” (non-thinking mode), generating 1000 tokens each. Surprisingly, we generate 80 unique completions, with the most common of these occuring 78 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at where the completions differ, we see that the completions are actually identical for the first 102 tokens! The first instance of diverging completions occurs at the 103rd token. All completions generate the sequence “Feynman was born on May 11, 1918, in” However, 992 of the completions go on to generate “Queens, New York” whereas 8 of the completions generate “New York City”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, when we enable our batch-invariant kernels, all of our 1000 completions are identical. This is what we would mathematically expect from our sampler, but we aren’t able to achieve deterministic results without our batch-invariant kernels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Performance&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have not put a significant effort into optimizing the performance of the batch-invariant kernels here. However, let’s run some experiments to verify that our performance remains usable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will set up an API server with one GPU running Qwen-3-8B, and request 1000 sequences with an output length of between 90 and 110.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Configuration&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Time (seconds)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;vLLM default&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;26&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Unoptimized Deterministic vLLM&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;55&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;+ Improved Attention Kernel&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;42&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the slowdown comes from the fact that the FlexAttention integration in vLLM has not been heavily optimized yet. Nevertheless, we see that performance is not disastrous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;True on-policy RL&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;As researchers have noted, the different numerics between training and inference implicitly turns our on-policy RL into off-policy RL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it is impossible to get bitwise identical results between training and inference if we can’t even get bitwise identical results from two identical inference requests. Then, deterministic inference enables us to also modify our training stack to obtain bitwise identical results between sampling and training, thus resulting in true on-policy RL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We run experiments in a RLVR setup on Bigmath with the RL policy initialized from the Qwen 2.5-VL instruct 8B with a max rollout length of 4096.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we train without off-policy correction (i.e. importance weighting), our reward collapses partway through training, whereas adding an off-policy correction term allows training to proceed smoothly. But, if we achieve bitwise identical results between our sampler and trainer, we are fully on policy (i.e. 0 KL divergence) and can also train smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can also plot the KL-divergence in logprobs between our sampler and trainer, where all 3 runs have notably different behavior. When running with importance weighting, it stays around 0.001 with occasional spikes. However, running without importance weighting eventually leads to a spike in KL-divergence around the same time that reward crashes. And, of course, when running “True On-Policy RL”, our KL-divergence stays flat at 0, indicating that there is no divergence between the training policy and sampling policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern software systems contain many layers of abstractions. In machine learning, when we run into nondeterminism and subtle numerical differences it can often be tempting to paper over them. After all, our systems are already “probabilistic”, so what’s wrong with a little more nondeterminism? What’s wrong with bumping up the atol/rtol on the failing unit test? The difference in logprobs between the trainer and the sampler probably isn’t a real bug, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We reject this defeatism. With a little bit of work, we can understand the root causes of our nondeterminism and even solve them! We hope that this blog post provides the community with a solid understanding of how to resolve nondeterminism in our inference systems and inspires others to obtain a full understanding of their systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Citation&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please cite this work as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;He, Horace and Thinking Machines Lab, "Defeating Nondeterminism in LLM Inference",

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dotter is a dotfile manager and templater.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dotfiles are configuration files that usually live in the home directory and start with a dot. Often times, it is desirable to have a backup of all the configurations on your system, which is why a lot of users have their dotfiles saved in a git repository, then symlinking them to their target locations using &lt;code&gt;ln -s&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, there are several issues with that barebones approach:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hard to keep track of what comes from where once you have more than a handful of dotfiles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tedious to setup on a new machine - you need to manually create every single link&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No real way to handle differences between machines - say you want the battery meter on your bar to not appear on your desktop machine&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dotter aims to solve all those problems by providing a flexible configuration and automatic templating or symlinking to the target locations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dotter is available on homebrew using &lt;code&gt;brew install dotter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following AUR packages are available:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dotter-rs-bin for a precompiled version of the latest release&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dotter-rs for the latest release's source that is built on your machine&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dotter-rs-git for the latest commit on master that is built on your machine&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of those are maintained by orhun - huge thanks to him!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dotter is available on Scoop. Run &lt;code&gt;scoop install dotter&lt;/code&gt; to install the latest release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download the binary for your platform from the latest release and then put it in your &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt; or in your dotfile repository (then you'd run it with &lt;code&gt;./dotter&lt;/code&gt;).
Alternatively, Dotter is on crates.io, so if you have Rustup installed, run &lt;code&gt;cargo install dotter&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out the wiki for more information. Among other things, it explains how to setup and configure Dotter, as well as giving insight on how the templating and deployment works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that you've configured all the global and local file sections, you can simply run &lt;code&gt;dotter&lt;/code&gt; from within your repository.&lt;lb/&gt; All the files will be deployed to their target locations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;code&gt;dotter -h&lt;/code&gt; for the command-line flags that Dotter supports:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At Akademy 2025, the KDE Project released an alpha version of KDE Linux, a distribution built by the project to "&lt;quote&gt;include the best implementation of everything KDE has to offer, using the most advanced technologies&lt;/quote&gt;". It is aimed at providing an operating system suitable for home use, business use, OEM installations, and more "&lt;quote&gt;eventually&lt;/quote&gt;". For now there are many rough edges and missing features that users should be aware of before taking the plunge; but it is an interesting look at the kind of complete Linux system that KDE developers would like to see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Development and goals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KDE contributor Nate Graham wrote an announcement blog post on September 6 to accompany the release of KDE Linux. Harald Sitter had introduced the project as "Project Banana" during a talk (video, slides) at Akademy in 2024, and has been leading its development along with major contributions from Hadi Chokr, Lasath Fernando, Justin Zobel, Graham, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KDE Linux is an immutable distribution that uses Arch Linux packages as its base, but Graham notes that it is "&lt;quote&gt;definitely not an 'Arch-based distro!'&lt;/quote&gt;" Pacman is not included, and Arch is used only for the base operating system. Everything else, he said, is either compiled from source using KDE Builder or installed using Flatpak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some may wonder why another Linux distribution is needed; Graham said that he has expressed that sentiment himself in the past regarding other distributions, but he thinks that KDE Linux is justified:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;KDE is a huge producer of software. It's awkward for us to not have our own method of distributing it. Yes, KDE produces source code that others distribute, but we self-distribute our apps on app stores like Flathub and the Snap and Microsoft stores, so I think it's a natural thing for us to have our own platform for doing that distribution too, and that's an operating system. I think all the major producers of free software desktop environments should have their own OS, and many already do: Linux Mint and ElementaryOS spring to mind, and GNOME is working on one too.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Besides, this matter was settled 10 years ago with the creation of KDE neon, our first bite at the "in-house OS" apple. The sky did not fall; everything was beautiful and nothing hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of neon, Graham points out that it is "&lt;quote&gt;being held together by a heroic volunteer&lt;/quote&gt;" (singular) and that no decision has been made as of yet about its future. Neon has "&lt;quote&gt;served admirably for a decade&lt;/quote&gt;", he said, but it "&lt;quote&gt;has somewhat reached its limit in terms of what we can do with it&lt;/quote&gt;" because of its Ubuntu base. According to the wiki page, neon's Ubuntu LTS base is built on old technology and requires "&lt;quote&gt;a lot of packaging busywork&lt;/quote&gt;". It also becomes less stable as time goes on, "&lt;quote&gt;because it needs to be tinkered with to get Plasma to build on it, breaking the LTS promise&lt;/quote&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Architecture and plans&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KDE Linux, on the other hand, is designed to be a greenfield project that allows KDE to make use of newer technologies and more modern approaches to a Linux distribution unhampered by the needs of a general-purpose distribution. If KDE Linux's technology choices are not appealing, Graham says, "&lt;quote&gt;feel free to ignore KDE Linux and continue using the operating system of your choice. There are plenty of them!&lt;/quote&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KDE Linux is Wayland-only; there is no X.org session and no plan to add one. Users with some of the older NVIDIA cards will need to manually configure the system to work properly with KDE Linux. The distribution also only supports UEFI systems, and there are no plans to add support for BIOS-only systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The root filesystem (/) is a read/write Btrfs volume, while /usr is a read-only Enhanced Read-Only File System (EROFS) volume backed by a single file. The system is updated atomically by swapping out the EROFS volume; currently KDE Linux caches up to five of the files to allow users to roll back to previous versions if the most recent updates are broken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The files have names like kde-linux_202509082242.erofs and are stored in /system. The most recent releases are about 4.8GB in size. The project uses systemd-sysupdate under the hood, which does not have support for delta updates yet. Users should expect to set aside at least 30GB just to cache the EROFS files for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike Fedora's image-based Atomic Desktops, KDE Linux does not supply a way for users to add packages to the base system. So, for example, users have no way to add packages with additional kernel modules. Users can add applications packaged as Flatpaks using KDE's Discover graphical software manager; the Snap format is also supported, but it is not integrated with Discover—the snap command-line utility can be used to do install Snaps for now. KDE Linux also includes Distrobox, which allows users to set up a container with the distribution of their choice and install software in the container that is integrated with the system. LWN touched on Distrobox in our coverage of the Bluefin image-based operating system in December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it looks like users are not set up correctly for Podman, which Distrobox needs, on KDE Linux; trying to set up a new container gives a "potentially insufficient UIDs or GIDs available in user namespace" error when trying to test Distrobox on the latest KDE Linux build. This comment in the Podman repository on GitHub set me on the right path to fix the problem. This kind of bug is to be expected in an alpha release; no doubt it will be ironed out in the coming weeks or months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;System updates are also performed using Discover: when a new system image is available, it will show up in the Updates tab and can be installed from there. (Or using "sudo updatectl update" from the command line, for those who prefer doing it that way.) Likewise, installed Flatpaks with updates will show up in the Updates tab. For now, at least, users will have to manually manage any applications installed in a Distrobox container.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default software selection is a good start for a desktop distribution; it includes the Gwenview image viewer, Okular document viewer, Haruna media player, Kate text editor, and Konsole for terminal emulation. Firefox is the only prominent non-KDE application included with the default install. The base system currently includes GNU Bash 5.3.3, curl 8.15, Linux 6.16.5, GCC 15.2.1, Perl 5.42, Python 3.13.7, Vim 9.1, and wget 1.25. It does not include some utilities users might want or expect, such as GNU Screen, Emacs, tmux, pip, or alternate shells like Fish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KDE Linux's base packages are not meant to be user-customizable, but it should be possible to create custom images using systemd's mkosi tool, which is what is used by the project itself. The mkosi.conf.d directory in the KDE Linux repository contains the various configuration files for managing the packages included in the system image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Development and what's next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The plan, longer term, is to have three editions of KDE Linux: the testing edition, which is what is available now, an enthusiast edition, and a stable edition. The testing edition is meant for developers and quality assurance folks; it is to be built daily from Git and to be similar in quality to KDE neon's unstable release. The enthusiast edition will include beta or released software, depending on the status of a given application at the time; this edition is aimed at "&lt;quote&gt;KDE enthusiasts, power users, and influencers&lt;/quote&gt;". The stable edition, as the name suggests, will include only released software that meets quality metrics (which are not yet defined), indicating it's ready for users not in the other categories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;KDE Linux can be installed on bare metal or in a virtual machine using virt-manager. Support for UEFI Secure Boot is currently missing. Since KDE Linux uses a lot of space for cached images, users should provision more disk space for a virtual machine than they might ordinarily; I allocated 50GB, but probably should have gone with 75GB or more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those wishing to follow along with KDE Linux development can check out the milestone trackers for the enthusiast and stable editions. All of the milestones have been reached for the testing edition. There are quite a few items to complete before KDE Linux reaches beta status; for example, the project is currently using packages from the Arch User Repository (AUR) but the plan is to move away from using AUR soon. The project also needs to move production to official KDE infrastructure rather than depending on Sitter's personal systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the moment, the project does not have a security announcement mailing list or other notification mechanism; those using KDE Linux for more than testing should keep an eye on Arch's security tracker and KDE security advisories. Since KDE Linux is an immutable derivative of Arch Linux, with no way to immediately pull updated Arch packages, users should remember that they will be at a disadvantage when there are security vulnerabilities in the base operating system. Any security update would need to be created by Arch Linux, pushed out as an Arch package, and then incorporated into a build for KDE Linux. Conservatively, that will add at least a day for any security updates to reach KDE Linux users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the downsides of having no package manager is that there is no easy way to take stock of what is installed on the system. Normally, one might do an inventory of software using a package manager's query tools; a quick "rpm -qa" shows all of the system software on my desktop's Fedora 42 install. There is no such mechanism for KDE Linux, and it's not clear that there are any plans for that type of feature long term. To be suitable for some of the target audiences, KDE Linux will need (for example) ways to manage the base operating system and easily query what is installed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project's governance is described as a "&lt;quote&gt;'Council of elders' model with major contributors being the elders&lt;/quote&gt;". Sitter has final decision-making authority in cases of disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously the team working on KDE Linux wants the project to succeed, but it has put some thought into what will happen if the distribution is put out to pasture at some point. There is an end-of-life contingency plan to "&lt;quote&gt;push a final update shipping an OS image that transforms the system into a completely different distro&lt;/quote&gt;". The successor distribution has not been chosen yet; it would be picked based on the KDE Linux team's relationship with the other distribution and its ability to take on all of the new users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part of the rationale for KDE Linux is to satisfy an impulse that is common to many open-source developers: the desire to ship software directly to users without an intermediary tampering with it. The process of creating and refining KDE Linux will satisfy that for KDE developers, but it may also serve another purpose: to demonstrate just how difficult it is to create and maintain a desktop distribution for widespread use. Whether KDE Linux succeeds as a standalone distribution or not, it may be a useful exercise to illustrate why projects like Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, Ubuntu, and others make choices that ultimately frustrate application developers.&lt;/p&gt;

I've used all of the components of this thing at one time or another but I would not use them like this as a whole. I remember when KDE (around 1998) compiled and ran on my Slackware effort. Time has moved on. This beast starts off with Arch - fine choice of rolling distro. No pacman ... hmm we are off piste now ... OK. It has an unusual partitioning scheme involving Butter Fuss and something-else-fs (EROFS). Arch is not normally deployed on that sort of combo but it probably has been done because Archers are pretty &lt;head&gt;Hmmm&lt;/head&gt;&lt;del&gt;weird&lt;/del&gt; adventurous. Then it gets cute and immutable and all that stuff. I hope it works out but I don't think that what I might charitably call a Window Manager flogger, should be fiddling with the rest of the OS. Stick with what you do well and leave the OS floggers to do their thing. A demo OS build is obviously a great way to advertise your wares. For starters this distro will never be a corporate thing which is sad. I can get Kubuntu (int al) through all audits - ISO 9000, 27000, UK - Cyber Essentials and Essentials+. *sigh* &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel’s IPUs, or Infrastructure Processing Units, evolved as network adapters developed increasingly sophisticated offload capabilities. IPUs take things a step further, aiming to take on a wide variety of infrastructure services in a cloud environment in addition to traditional software defined networking functions. Infrastructure services are run by the cloud operator and orchestrate tasks like provisioning VMs or collecting metrics. They won’t stress a modern server CPU, but every CPU core set aside for those tasks is one that can’t be rented out to customers. Offloading infrastructure workloads also provides an extra layer of isolation between a cloud provider’s code and customer workloads. If a cloud provider rents out bare metal servers, running infrastructure services within the server may not even be an option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel’s incoming “Mount Morgan” IPU packs a variety of highly configurable accelerators alongside general purpose CPU cores, and aims to capture as many infrastructure tasks as possible. It shares those characteristics with its predecessor, “Mount Evans”. Flexibility is the name of the game with these IPUs, which can appear as a particularly capable network card to up to four host servers, or run standalone to act as a small server. Compared to Mount Evans, Mount Morgan packs more general purpose compute power, improved accelerators, and more off-chip bandwidth to support the whole package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Compute Complex&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel includes a set of Arm cores in their IPU, because CPUs are the ultimate word in programmability. They run Linux and let the IPU handle a wide range of infrastructure services, and ensure the IPU stays relevant as infrastructure requirements change. Mount Morgan’s compute complex gets an upgrade to 24 Arm Neoverse N2 cores, up from 16 Neoverse N1 cores in Mount Evans. Intel didn’t disclose the exact core configuration, but Mount Evans set its Neoverse N1 cores up with 512 KB L2 caches and ran them at 2.5 GHz. It’s not the fastest Neoverse N1 configuration around, but it’s still nothing to sneeze at. Mount Morgan of course takes things further. Neoverse N1 is a 5-wide out-of-order core with a 160 entry ROB, ample execution resources, and a very capable branch predictor. Each core is already a substantial upgrade over Neoverse N1. 24 Neoverse N2 cores would be enough to handle some production server workloads, let alone a collection of infrastructure services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mount Morgan gets a memory subsystem upgrade to quad channel LPDDR5-6400 to feed the more powerful compute complex. Mount Evans had a triple channel LPDDR4X-4267 setup, connected to 48 GB of onboard memory capacity. If Intel keeps the same memory capacity per channel, Mount Morgan would have 64 GB of onboard memory. Assuming Intel’s presentation refers to 16-bit LPDDR4/5(X) channels, Mount Morgan would have 51.2 GB/s of DRAM bandwidth compared to 25.6 GB/s in Mount Evans. Those figures would be doubled if Intel refers to 32-bit data buses to LPDDR chips, rather than channels. A 32 MB System Level Cache helps reduce pressure on the memory controllers. Intel didn’t increase the cache’s capacity compared to the last generation, so 32 MB likely strikes a good balance between hitrate and die area requirements. The System Level Cache is truly system level, meaning it services the IPU’s various hardware acceleration blocks in addition to the CPU cores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Lookaside Crypto and Compression Engine (LCE) sits within the compute complex, and shares lineage with Intel’s Quickassist (QAT) accelerator line. Intel says the LCE features a number of upgrades over QAT targeted towards IPU use cases. But perhaps the most notable upgrade is getting asymmetric crypto support, which was conspicuously missing from Mount Evans’s LCE block. Asymmetric cryptography algorithms like RSA and ECDHE are used in TLS handshakes, and aren’t accelerated by special instructions on many server CPUs. Therefore, asymmetric crypto can consume significant CPU power when a server handles many connections per second. It was a compelling use case for QAT, and it’s great to see Mount Morgan get that as well. The LCE block also supports symmetric crypto and compression algorithms, capabilities inherited from QAT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A programmable DMA engine in the LCE lets cloud providers move data as part of hardware accelerated workflows. Intel gives an example workflow for accessing remote storage, where the LCE helps move, compress, and encrypt data. Other accelerator blocks located in the IPU’s network subsystem help complete the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Network Subsystem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Networking bandwidth and offloads are a core function of the IPU, and its importance can’t be understated. Cloud servers need high network and storage bandwidth. The two are often two sides of the same coin, because cloud providers might use separate storage servers accessed over datacenter networking. Mount Morgan has 400 Gbps of Ethernet throughput, double Mount Evans’s 200 Gbps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;True to its smart NIC lineage, Mount Morgan uses a large number of inline accelerators to handle cloud networking tasks. A programmable P4-based packet processing pipeline, called the FXP, sits at the heart of the network subsystem. P4 is a packet processing language that lets developers express how they want packets handled. Hardware blocks within the FXP pipeline closely match P4 demands. A parser decodes packet headers and translates the packet into a representation understood by downstream stages. Downstream stages can check for exact or wildcard matches. Longest prefix matches can be carried out in hardware too, which is useful for routing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FXP can handle a packet every cycle, and can be configured to perform multiple passes per packet. Intel gives an example where one pass processes outer packet layers to perform decapsulation and checks against access control lists. A second pass can look at the inner packet, and carry out connection tracking or implement firewall rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An inline crypto block sits within the network subsystem as well. Unlike the LCE in the compute complex, this crypto block is dedicated to packet processing and focuses on symmetric cryptography. It includes its own packet parsers, letting it terminate IPSec and PSP connections and carry out IPSec/PSP functions like anti-replay window protection, sequence number generation, and error checking in hardware. IPSec is used for VPN connections, which are vital for letting customers connect to cloud services. PSP is Google’s protocol for encrypting data transfers internal to Google’s cloud. Compared to Mount Evans, the crypto block’s throughput has been doubled to support 400 Gbps, and supports 64 million flows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloud providers have to handle customer network traffic while ensuring fairness. Customers only pay for a provisioned amount of network bandwidth. Furthermore, customer traffic can’t be allowed to monopolize the network and cause problems with infrastructure services. The IPU has a traffic shaper block, letting it carry out quality of service measures completely in hardware. One mode uses a mutli-level hierarchical scheduler to arbitrate between packets based on source port, destination port, and traffic class. Another “timing wheel” mode does per-flow packet pacing, which can be controlled by classification rules set up at the FXP. Intel says the timing wheel mode gives a pacing resolution of 512 nanoseconds per slot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RDMA traffic accounts for a significant portion of datacenter traffic. For example, Azure says RDMA accounts for 70% of intra-cloud network traffic, and is used for disk IO. Mount Morgan has a RDMA transport option to provide hardware offload for that traffic. It can support two million queue pairs across multiple hosts, and can expose 1K virtual functions per host. The latter should let a cloud provider directly expose RDMA acceleration capabilities to VMs. To ensure reliable transport, the RDMA transport engine supports the Falcon and Swift transport protocols. Both protocols offer improvements over TCP, and Intel implements congestion control for those protocols completely in hardware. To reduce latency, the RDMA block can bypass the packet processing pipeline and handle RDMA connections on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the accelerator blocks above are clients of the system level cache. Some hardware acceleration use cases, like connection tracking with millions of flows, can have significant memory footprints. The system level cache should let the IPU keep frequently accessed portions of accelerator memory structures on-chip, reducing DRAM bandwidth needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Host Fabric and PCIe Switch&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mount Morgan’s PCIe capabilities have grown far beyond what a normal network card may offer. It has 32 PCIe Gen 5 lanes, providing more IO bandwidth than some recent desktop CPUs. It’s also a huge upgrade over the 16 PCIe Gen 4 lanes in Mount Evans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, a network card sits downstream of a host, and thus appears as a device attached to a server. The host fabric and PCIe subsystem is flexible to let the IPU wear many hats. It can appear as a downstream device to up to four server hosts, each of which sees the IPU as a separate, independent device. Mount Evans supported this “multi-host” mode as well, but Mount Morgan’s higher PCIe bandwidth is necessary to utilize its 400 Gigabit networking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mount Morgan can run in a “headless” mode, where it acts as a standalone server and a lightweight alternative to dedicating a traditional server to infrastructure tasks. In this mode, Mount Morgan’s 32 PCIe lanes can let it connect to many SSDs and other devices. The IPU’s accelerators as well as the PCIe lanes appear downstream of the IPU’s CPU cores, which act as a host CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A “converged” mode can use some PCIe lanes to connect to upstream server hosts, while other lanes connect to downstream devices. In this mode, the IPU shows up as a PCIe switch to connected hosts, with downstream devices visible behind it. A server could connect to SSDs and GPUs through the IPU. The IPU’s CPU cores can sit on top of the PCIe switch and access downstream devices, or can be exposed as a downstream device behind the PCIe switch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The IPU’s multiple modes are a showcase of IO flexibility. It’s a bit like how AMD uses the same die as an IO die within the CPU and a part of the motherboard chipset on AM4 platforms. The IO die’s PCIe lanes can connect to downstream devices when it’s serving within the CPU, or be split between an upstream host and downstream devices when used in the chipset. Intel is also no stranger to PCIe configurability. Their early QAT PCIe cards reused their Lewisburg chipset, exposing it as a downstream device with three QAT devices appearing behind a PCIe switch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Final Words&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloud computing plays a huge role in the tech world today. It originally started with commodity hardware, with similar server configurations to what customers might deploy in on-premise environments. But as cloud computing expanded, cloud providers started to see use cases for cloud-specific hardware accelerators. Examples include "Nitro" cards in Amazon Web Services, or smart NICs with FPGAs in Microsoft Azure. Intel has no doubt seen this trend, and IPUs are the company's answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mount Morgan tries to service all kinds of cloud acceleration needs by packing an incredible number of highly configurable accelerators, in recognition of cloud providers’ diverse and changing needs. Hardware acceleration always runs the danger of becoming obsolete as protocols change. Intel tries to avoid this by having very generalized accelerators, like the FXP, as well as packing in CPU cores that can run just about anything under the sun. The latter feels like overkill for infrastructure tasks, and could let the IPU remain relevant even if some acceleration capabilities become obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a higher level, IPUs like Mount Morgan show that Intel still has ambitions to stretch beyond its core CPU market. Developing Mount Morgan must have been a complex endeavor. It’s a showcase of Intel’s engineering capability even when their CPU side goes through a bit of a rough spot. It’ll be interesting to see whether Intel’s IPUs can gain ground in the cloud market, especially with providers that have already developed in-house hardware offload capabilities tailored to their requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Doomscrolling: The Game&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can a game work where all you do is scroll?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re all familiar with doomscrolling, spending too much time scrolling endless feeds of content that make you feel bad about everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But sometimes when I hear the word “doomscrolling” it makes me think of two other things: the classic video game Doom and, well, scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That got me wondering if I could make a Doom-inspired game in a web browser where the only thing you do to play is scroll. No moving your character laterally, no jumping. Just scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I made it. And it’s fun! Here’s a small clip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s what the game looks like. But here’s what playing it feels like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can go play it right now on desktop or mobile. The rest of this newsletter is the non-technical story of how I made the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The first time was a failure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As readers know, I’m not a coder, but I enjoy how vibe coding lets me turn an idea into something real. So naturally, I turned to vibe coding for this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was around nine months ago. I tried and tried, but none of the LLMs were able to help me go from idea to a playable game at all. Like, not even close. GPT-4 absolutely refused to understand that scrolling down a page means that the background should move up the page. I ended up with something kinda pathetic that didn’t even resemble a game. So I gave up, figuring this was either beyond an LLM’s skills, beyond my skills, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then GPT-5 came out a few weeks ago, and I tried again to see how much better it might be at coding. In just two hours I had a very good prototype. I even made a little title screen for my prototype so it felt more like a real game:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I described the game design to ChatGPT very broadly at first. I said it should work kinda like Galaga turned upside-down. But I explained that unlike Galaga, the player moves forward and backward rather than side to side, and that the monster’s position should remain relative to the floor. That and a few more details got me surprisingly far as a first step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For prototyping purposes, I asked ChatGPT to just come up with five different monsters, each one with a two-frame animation, like Space Invaders aliens. They were little more than basic shapes, and I figured at some point I’d replace them with actual pre-rendered monster sprites. But this worked for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I went on vacation. I spent an hour or two each morning over coffee working on this game until the kids woke up, gradually adding and refining features one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Improving the game&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I focused on making the game more fun to play, with incentives to keep moving but also things to stop you from racing through it too fast. I added things like weapon upgrades for every 100 monsters you kill, a wall of fire that chases you if you stay in one place too long, and obstacles to slow you down, like brick walls and spider webs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some other little quality-of-life features I came up with include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Five different background textures so you can have a different visual experience each time you play.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Health potions. The first one appears when you’re down to three health points. After that, they are more rare and may require weapon upgrades to reach.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A visual marker when you pass your record distance&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A pause screen with some stats&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Making it really Doomscrolling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was pretty happy with the game and ready to share it. But then at the last minute I got another nagging idea in the back of my mind: What if it was somehow more like actual doomscrolling?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be easy to get an RSS Feed of headlines from a news site. Could I make them appear in the game as you scroll, in a way that felt integrated with the game?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First I tried having headlines just appear on the floor as you play, but it felt very tacked-on. So I came up with some lore for the game that helped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I decided that the game takes place in the future, in a lair that was sealed up today, whatever day you happen to be playing the game. And the civilization that sealed up the cave left behind plaques featuring today’s headlines for some unexplained reason. So as you play, you encounter these plaques that each has a bit of news from when the cave was sealed up. Today’s actual news.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The plaques have no effect on the game, except to the extent that they tempt you to read them and get distracted from the gameplay. But they’re just decorative elements. Feel free to ignore them. If you can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The headlines all come from the New York Times front page RSS feed. So in a sense, this game is actually an extremely complex single-feed RSS reader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Working with AI is still a pain. This was my solution.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever tried to work with AI, you’ve likely run into a roadblock where you’re describing something over and over and it’s simply not getting it. “No, don’t do it that way, for the umpteenth time, do it this way.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still planned on making the monsters as pre-rendered sprites, but the background textures, plaques, and decorative items like torches could still be rendered in-game if I could just get GPT-5 to understand what I want them to look like. An LLM isn’t really good at making artwork like this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I simplified things. I had the AI set up simple “labs,” standalone test pages where we could work on different designs, using the style from the game. For example, here’s one “lab” I made for testing how some in-world elements would look on different backgrounds:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything above is rendered on the fly. One big advantage of that approach is that I could randomize some visual elements in the game. For example, look at the spider webs above. They all follow the same rules but they’re all slightly different. The game’s background textures are also slightly different each time you play.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, I set about making pre-rendered monsters. But wow, small-scale pixel art is hard. I went through a lot of versions of different monsters. Eventually, I had a few I felt were good enough. The game looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It had its own charm, but in the end, I didn’t love it. Somehow, my pre-rendered monsters made the game feel worse. Maybe it’s because I just am not a good pixel artist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I decided to see what I could do with ChatGPT in a “lab” like I did for other in-game items, but focused on monster designs. After a lot of experimentation, I settled on the simple monsters that ended up in the game:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I assume doing all this computationally is more processor-intensive than using pre-rendered monsters, but it’s very smooth for me on both desktop and phone, so it must not be too intensive. I guess I’ll hear from people if it’s choppy on their device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes I still needed a little more control over how something looked. So in those cases I had ChatGPT build labs with sliders that I could adjust to decide how I want things to appear, instead of getting frustrated with the chatbot. This way I could quickly settle on a look and feel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here for example is the lab page for the plaques. I wanted them to look integrated into the game world, so I described the parameters I wanted to play with for the text styling and plaque itself. We put a “copy settings” button that I could use to report back to the LLM once I liked it, so I could say “Okay, let’s go with these settings in the game.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve made this lab page live for you to play with if you’re curious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ship it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are still features and adjustments I’d like to add, but I’m not on vacation anymore, so think I just need to stop here. I may still tweak it, but for now I’m calling version 1.0 ready to ship. It has successfully scratched my itch to see if I could make a fun scrolling-only game, which was really all I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should play equally well on mobile and desktop. The only difference is that with a taller device you can see more of the world at a time, which makes it a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, and you can save it to your home screen so it acts like a standalone app rather than a browser game. That’s how I play.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that’s it for another newsletter!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s where I remind you that you can support my endeavors by becoming a paid member, or making a one-time donation. Every little bit matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if not, that’s okay, too. But maybe you can share the newsletter? Moving from Beehiiv to Ghost resulted in a subscriber hit, which I anticipated because the same thing happened when I first left Substack. It took a while to begin growing again after the first move, and you can help me get back to positive growth by spreading the word now that I’ve landed at Ghost. It would mean the world to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until next time, thanks as always for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Beginning BD: Where Did the Smurfs Get Their Hats?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That white floppy hat on top of every Smurf’s head.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is it? Where did it come from?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do Smurfs have bald spots?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve got a history lesson coming up here, folks. Sit back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, first, let’s answer a side question:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s Under a Smurf’s Hat?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s only one true source for information on this question, and that’s Peyo’s comics. Accept no substitutes. Yes, there are probably moments in various movies and cartoons where a Smurf can been seen without their hat on. That’s not Peyo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Peyo showed us one example of a Smurf without a hat. Go to the classic story, “The Purple Smurf.” At one point, Papa Smurf’s lab blows up, along with his hat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Papa Smurf is bald. This doesn’t necessarily mean that Brainy Smurf isn’t sporting a pompadour under his hat or that Hefty Smurf doesn’t have a buzz cut, but…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know Smurfs are capable of having hair. Smurfette has luxurious blonde locks, but she’s also not really a natural born Smurf. Technically, she’s a concoction of Gargamel’s. But let’s give his spell-making the benefit of the doubt. Maybe Smurfs can have hair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mean, where do Smurfs come from? What’s the genetics at work that would determine–&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;–wait, no, I’m not going down that rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Papa Smurf is definitely bald. I bet you already assumed that, though. Let’s move on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where Do Smurfs Get Such Wonderful Hats?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s called a Phrygian cap, which is about as much fun to type as Vercingetorix, who is an amazing story for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The headgear is over 2000 years old. Here’s proof:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Handsome fella, isn’t he? But check out that hat! He’s totally a Smurf, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His name is Attis, and this sculpture comes from somewhere in the 100s AD, though Attis lived even further back, in the 4th century BC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that time period, you know who else worse a Smurfs hat? King Midas. Yes the guy with the thing for gold. (Croesus is also involved in this story, but let’s not get completely off topic.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phrygis, in case your curious, is the name of an ancient group of people who lived in the Balkans region of eastern Europe — Greece, Turkey, Romania, etc. Their language and culture went extinct by the 5th century AD. Near the end, the Romans thought of them as being lazy and dull.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those Phrygian caps do kind of resemble a dunce cap, don’t they? It’s completely unrelated, though. That’s a dead end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Liberty and Freedom&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hat is often associated with liberty and freedom. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was adopted during the French Revolution (at the end of the 18th century AD) as “the red cap of liberty” by the revolutionaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see one such cap on the French personification of “Liberté”. Here she is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looks just like Papa Smurf’s hat. And while Peyo was Belgian, he was working with French publishers, so drawing inspiration from a French symbol isn’t too crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing that Peyo maybe didn’t realize and the French revolutionaries definitely didn’t realize, though, is that it’s the wrong hat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Right Hat&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the pileus hat. It’s a brimless hat, often made of felt or maybe wool. It started in Ancient Greece as a sailor’s hat, and eventually found its way to Ancient Rome, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Rome, a freed slave had his head shaved. Then, they would wear a pileus, in part to keep their head warm. The hat was a sign of the slave’s freedom/liberty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Somewhere along the line in the French Revolution, they adopted the freed slaves’ head gear as their own symbol of freedom, but picked the wrong one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They didn’t have Google Images back then, so don’t be too hard on them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m sure Peyo picked that hat because it looked good on the Smurfs, helped further set them apart from all the other characters, and would someday make for an awesome free giveaway at Angouleme.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Side By Side&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wikipedia has an image of the Phrygian and Pileus next to each other on the bottom shelf here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the bottom shelf, the Smurfs’ Phrygian cap on the left is next to the pileus in the center there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, there were metal versions of both that were used as head gear during war times. Imagine an army of Smurfs coming over the hill to attack!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Glad You Asked?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To sum it all up: Some Greeks had a hat that the Romans borrowed and that their slaves used to represent their freedom. 2000 years later, some French revolutionaries confused that hat for a different one from the Phrygis folks and made it their own sign of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;150 years after that, Peyo created the Smurfs and gave them that hat, but in white.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here endeth the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45206311</guid></item><item><title>Court rejects Verizon claim that selling location data without consent is legal</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/09/court-rejects-verizon-claim-that-selling-location-data-without-consent-is-legal/</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="fb2479b85417625e"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Verizon lost an attempt to overturn a $46.9 million fine for selling customer location data without its users' consent. The US Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit rejected Verizon's challenge in a ruling issued today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Federal Communications Commission fined the three major carriers last year for violations revealed in 2018. The companies sued the FCC in three different courts, with varying results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T beat the FCC in the reliably conservative US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, while T-Mobile lost in the District of Columbia Circuit. Although FCC Chairman Brendan Carr voted against the fine last year, when the commission had a Democratic majority, his FCC urged the courts to uphold the Biden-era decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A ruling against the FCC could gut the agency's ability to issue financial penalties. The different rulings from different circuits raise the odds of the cases being taken up by the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today's 2nd Circuit ruling against Verizon was issued unanimously by a panel of three judges, and it comes to the same legal conclusions as the DC Circuit did in the T-Mobile case. The court did not accept the carrier's argument that the fine violated its Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial, and that the location data wasn't protected under the law used by the FCC to issue the penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We disagree [with Verizon]," the 2nd Circuit ruling said. "The customer data at issue plainly qualifies as customer proprietary network information, triggering the Communication Act's privacy protections. And the forfeiture order both soundly imposed liability and remained within the strictures of the penalty cap. Nothing about the Commission's proceedings, moreover, transgressed the Seventh Amendment's jury trial guarantee. Indeed, Verizon had, and chose to forgo, the opportunity for a jury trial in federal court. Thus, we DENY Verizon's petition."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Verizon claimed law doesn’t cover device location data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until 2019, Verizon "ran a 'location-based services' program that sold access to certain kinds of wireless customer location data," the ruling said. "As part of that program, Verizon contracted with 'location information aggregators,' which collected customer data and resold it to third-party location-based services providers. Verizon had arrangements with two aggregators, LocationSmart and Zumigo, which in turn contracted with 63 third-party entities."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Korean government has decided to begin discussions with the US government on measures to improve the visa system for Koreans in the US and to prevent the recurrence of workplace immigration raids after the arrest and detention of Korean citizens at a battery plant in Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calls for systemic improvements have emerged within political circles and beyond, alongside demands for an official apology from US President Donald Trump and the US government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We conveyed the public’s outrage over this incident to the US verbatim,” Kim Yong-beom, the policy chief for the presidential office, said at a Korea Broadcasting Journalists Club forum held on Tuesday at the Korea Broadcaster Center in Seoul&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kim said that officials expressed “serious concern and regret in the strongest diplomatic terms,” while the minister of trade, industry and energy issued a protest that “went beyond diplomatic language.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Addressing concerns about the slow pace of improvements to the US visa system for Koreans, Kim explained, “The Korean government and businesses alike have been aggressively pushing for an E-4 visa [a visa quota for skilled Korean workers] for over a decade. But due to anti-immigration sentiment, the number of lawmakers proposing this measure has decreased, compared to 10 years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We must turn this crisis into an opportunity to fix the system,” Kim emphasized. “South Korea is the US’ top investor as a nation. The US seeks more investments from us, but we cannot proceed if these issues aren’t resolved.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;President Lee Jae Myung also expressed disappointment over the US authorities’ actions during his opening remarks at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, citing the need to maintain “mutual trust and the spirit of alliance.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I hope that no unfair infringements on the activities of our people and businesses will ever happen again,” he said, emphasizing that such activities “contribute to the shared development of both Korea and the United States.” The president also urged for “active negotiation efforts based on mutual trust and the spirit of alliance to achieve tangible results.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kim Young-bae, a Democratic Party lawmaker and vice chairperson of the National Assembly’s Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee, suggested that the recent fiasco may have a silver lining.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Until now, the US was not in the position of requesting investment from us. But now, we hold the power as investors, and the US must respond to our demands,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It is now time for the US Congress and government to change their attitude. Our demands for legislation that guarantees quotas for Korean professionals, such as the Partner with Korea Act, are legitimate,” he stressed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Four lawmakers from the progressive minor Jinbo Party, including floor leader Yoon Jong-oh, visited the US Embassy in Seoul’s Jongno District on Tuesday afternoon. They met with Joseph Yun, the US chargé d’affaires in Korea, and delivered a letter demanding an official apology from the US government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the letter, they stated, “Treating Korean workers as felons, shackling them in chains and detaining them, is a clear violation of human rights and an insult to the entire Korean people.”&lt;/p&gt;
