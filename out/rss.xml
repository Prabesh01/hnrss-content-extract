  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stargaze: SpaceX’s Space Situational Awareness System&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SpaceX has developed a novel Space Situational Awareness (SSA) system, called Stargaze, that significantly enhances the safety and sustainability of satellite operations in low Earth orbit (LEO), and its screening data will be made available to the broader satellite operator community free of charge in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Practices—such as leaving rocket bodies in LEO, operators maneuvering their satellites without sharing trajectory predictions or coordinating with other active satellites, and countries conducting anti-satellite tests—have heightened the risk of collision, necessitating improvements in space-traffic coordination. Conventional methods typically observe objects only a limited number of times per day, causing large uncertainties in orbital predictions, further compounded by volatile space weather.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stargaze delivers a several-order-of-magnitude increase in detection capability compared to conventional ground-based systems. Stargaze uses data collected from nearly 30,000 star trackers, each of which makes continuous observations of nearby objects, resulting in approximately 30 million transits detected daily across the fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system autonomously detects observations of orbiting objects and are then aggregated to generate accurate orbit estimates and predictions of position and velocity for all detected objects in near real-time. These predictions integrate into a space-traffic management platform that identifies potential close approaches between objects in space and generates Conjunction Data Messages (CDMs). To fully realize the utility of such frequent observations, SpaceX developed this system to provide conjunction screening results within minutes, compared to the current industry standard of several hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To maximize safety for all satellites in space, SpaceX will be making Stargaze conjunction data available to all operators, free of charge, via its space-traffic management platform. This platform has been in a “closed beta” with over a dozen participating satellite operators, allowing low-latency ephemeris sharing and conjunction screening. Starting this spring, operators that submit ephemeris (trajectory predictions) to the platform will also receive CDMs against Stargaze data, in addition to ephemeris from other participating operators. This ensures that operators have low-latency access to the best available data for conjunction assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stargaze already has a proven track record in its utility for space safety. In late 2025, a Starlink satellite encountered a conjunction with a third-party satellite that was performing maneuvers, but whose operator was not sharing ephemeris. Until five hours before the conjunction, the close approach was anticipated to be ~9,000 meters—considered a safe miss-distance with zero probability of collision. With just five hours to go, the third-party satellite performed a maneuver which changed its trajectory and collapsed the anticipated miss distance to just ~60 meters. Stargaze quickly detected this maneuver and published an updated trajectory to the screening platform, generating new CDMs which were immediately distributed to relevant satellites. Ultimately, the Starlink satellite was able to react within an hour of the maneuver being detected, planning an avoidance maneuver to reduce collision risk back down to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With so little time to react, this would not have been possible by relying on legacy radar systems or high-latency conjunction screening processes. If observations of the third-party satellite were less frequent, conjunction screening took longer, or the reaction required human approval, such an event might not have been successfully mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Stargaze embodies a major improvement to the ability of any operator to fly safely, it is imperative for operators to frequently share ephemeris of their own fleets. This is particularly true for operators with maneuvering vehicles. While Stargaze can detect maneuvers more quickly than any other system in use today, the most definitive source of satellite trajectories should be provided by operators themselves, allowing deconfliction and minimizing collision avoidance maneuvers. Starlink ephemeris is updated and shared publicly every hour, and all other operators should do the same. An appropriate analogy is commercial aviation: there are hundreds of thousands of flights of aircraft daily, but they are able to avoid collisions because they broadcast their location and flight plan to other aircraft. Similarly, spacecraft operators should follow this minimal standard of sharing their predicted trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By providing this ephemeris sharing and conjunction screening service free of charge, we hope to motivate operators to take similar steps towards ephemeris sharing and safe flight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two months ago, I hacked together a weekend project. What started as “WhatsApp Relay” now has over 100,000 GitHub stars and drew 2 million visitors in a single week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, I’m excited to announce our new name: OpenClaw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Naming Journey&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve been through some names.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clawd was born in November 2025—a playful pun on “Claude” with a claw. It felt perfect until Anthropic’s legal team politely asked us to reconsider. Fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moltbot came next, chosen in a chaotic 5am Discord brainstorm with the community. Molting represents growth - lobsters shed their shells to become something bigger. It was meaningful, but it never quite rolled off the tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenClaw is where we land. And this time, we did our homework: trademark searches came back clear, domains have been purchased, migration code has been written. The name captures what this project has become:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open: Open source, open to everyone, community-driven&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claw: Our lobster heritage, a nod to where we came from&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What OpenClaw Is&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenClaw is an open agent platform that runs on your machine and works from the chat apps you already use. WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Teams—wherever you are, your AI assistant follows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your assistant. Your machine. Your rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike SaaS assistants where your data lives on someone else’s servers, OpenClaw runs where you choose—laptop, homelab, or VPS. Your infrastructure. Your keys. Your data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s New in This Release&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along with the rebrand, we’re shipping:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;New Channels: Twitch and Google Chat plugins&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Models: Support for KIMI K2.5 &amp;amp; Xiaomi MiMo-V2-Flash&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Web Chat: Send images just like you can in messaging apps&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Security: 34 security-related commits to harden the codebase&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank all security folks for their hard work in helping us harden the project. We’ve released machine-checkable security models this week and are continuing to work on additional security improvements. Remember that prompt injection is still an industry-wide unsolved problem, so it’s important to use strong models and to study our security best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s next? Security remains our top priority. We’re also focused on gateway reliability and adding polish plus support for more models and providers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project has grown far beyond what I could maintain alone. Over the last few days I’ve worked on adding maintainers and we’re slowly setting up processes so we can deal with the insane influx of PRs and Issues. I’m also figuring out how to pay maintainers properly—full-time if possible. If you wanna help, consider contributing or sponsoring the org.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thank You&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To the Claw Crew—every clawtributor who’s shipped code, filed issues, joined our Discord, or just tried the project: thank you. You are what makes OpenClaw special.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lobster has molted into its final form. Welcome to OpenClaw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get started: openclaw.ai&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Join the Claw Crew: Discord&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Star on GitHub: github.com/openclaw/openclaw&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;— Peter&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;P.S. Yes, the mascot is still a lobster. Some things are sacred. 🦞&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46820783</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:14:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How AI assistance impacts the formation of coding skills</title><link>https://www.anthropic.com/research/AI-assistance-coding-skills</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="b720e598aba307c3"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research shows AI helps people do parts of their job faster. In an observational study of Claude.ai data, we found AI can speed up some tasks by 80%. But does this increased productivity come with trade-offs? Other research shows that when people use AI assistance, they become less engaged with their work and reduce the effort they put into doing it—in other words, they offload their thinking to AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s unclear whether this cognitive offloading can prevent people from growing their skills on the job, or—in the case of coding—understanding the systems they’re building. Our latest study, a randomized controlled trial with software developers as participants, investigates this potential downside of using AI at work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This question has broad implications—for how to design AI products that facilitate learning, for how workplaces should approach AI policies, and for broader societal resilience, among others. We focused on coding, a field where AI tools have rapidly become standard. Here, AI creates a potential tension: as coding grows more automated and speeds up work, humans will still need the skills to catch errors, guide output, and ultimately provide oversight for AI deployed in high-stakes environments. Does AI provide a shortcut to both skill development and increased efficiency? Or do productivity increases from AI assistance undermine skill development?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a randomized controlled trial, we examined 1) how quickly software developers picked up a new skill (in this case, a Python library) with and without AI assistance; and 2) whether using AI made them less likely to understand the code they’d just written.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We found that using AI assistance led to a statistically significant decrease in mastery. On a quiz that covered concepts they’d used just a few minutes before, participants in the AI group scored 17% lower than those who coded by hand, or the equivalent of nearly two letter grades. Using AI sped up the task slightly, but this didn’t reach the threshold of statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Importantly, using AI assistance didn’t guarantee a lower score. How someone used AI influenced how much information they retained. The participants who showed stronger mastery used AI assistance not just to produce code but to build comprehension while doing so—whether by asking follow-up questions, requesting explanations, or posing conceptual questions while coding independently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Study design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recruited 52 (mostly junior) software engineers, each of whom had been using Python at least once a week for over a year. We also made sure they were at least somewhat familiar with AI coding assistance, and were unfamiliar with Trio, the Python library on which our tasks were based.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We split the study into three parts: a warm-up; the main task consisting of coding two different features using Trio (which requires understanding concepts related to asynchronous programming, a skill often learned in a professional setting); and a quiz. We told participants that a quiz would follow the task, but encouraged them to work as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We designed the coding task to mimic how someone might learn a new tool through a self-guided tutorial. Each participant was given a problem description, starter code, and a brief explanation of the Trio concepts needed to solve it. We used an online coding platform with an AI assistant in the sidebar which had access to participants’ code and could at any time produce the correct code if asked.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Evaluation design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our evaluation design, we drew on research in computer science education to identify four types of questions commonly used to assess mastery of coding skills:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debugging: The ability to identify and diagnose errors in code. This skill is crucial for detecting when AI-generated code is incorrect and understanding why it fails.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code reading: The ability to read and comprehend what code does. This skill enables humans to understand and verify AI-written code before deployment.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code writing: The ability to write or select the correct approach to writing code. Low-level code writing, like remembering the syntax of functions, will be less important with the further integration of AI coding tools than high-level system design.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Conceptual: The ability to understand the core principles behind tools and libraries. Conceptual understanding is critical for assessing whether AI-generated code uses appropriate software design patterns that adhere to how the library is intended to be used.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our assessment focused most heavily on debugging, code reading, and conceptual problems, as we considered these the most important for providing oversight of what is increasingly likely to be AI-generated code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On average, participants in the AI group finished about two minutes faster, although the difference was not statistically significant. There was, however, a significant difference in test scores: the AI group averaged 50% on the quiz, compared to 67% in the hand-coding group—or the equivalent of nearly two letter grades (Cohen's d=0.738, p=0.01). The largest gap in scores between the two groups was on debugging questions, suggesting that the ability to understand when code is incorrect and why it fails may be a particular area of concern if AI impedes coding development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Qualitative analysis: AI interaction modes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We were particularly interested in understanding how participants went about completing the tasks we designed. In our qualitative analysis, we manually annotated screen recordings to identify how much time participants spent composing queries, what types of questions they asked, the types of errors they made, and how much time they spent actively coding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One surprising result was how much time participants spent interacting with the AI assistant. Several took up to 11 minutes (30% of the total time allotted) composing up to 15 queries. This helped to explain why, on average, participants using AI finished faster although the productivity improvement was not statistically significant. We expect AI would be more likely to significantly increase productivity when used on repetitive or familiar tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, participants in the No AI group encountered more errors. These included errors in syntax and in Trio concepts, the latter of which mapped directly to topics tested on the evaluation. Our hypothesis is that the participants who encountered more Trio errors (namely, the control group) likely improved their debugging skills through resolving these errors independently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We then grouped participants by how they interacted with AI, identifying distinct patterns that led to different outcomes in completion time and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low-scoring interaction patterns: The low-scoring patterns generally involved a heavy reliance on AI, either through code generation or debugging. The average quiz scores in this group were less than 40%. They showed less independent thinking and more cognitive offloading. We further separated them into:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;AI delegation (n=4): Participants in this group wholly relied on AI to write code and complete the task. They completed the task the fastest and encountered few or no errors in the process.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Progressive AI reliance (n=4): Participants in this group started by asking one or two questions but eventually delegated all code writing to the AI assistant. They scored poorly on the quiz largely due to not mastering any of the concepts on the second task.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iterative AI debugging (n=4): Participants in this group relied on AI to debug or verify their code. They asked more questions, but relied on the assistant to solve problems, rather than to clarify their own understanding. They scored poorly as a result, and were also slower at completing the two tasks.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High-scoring interaction patterns: We considered high-scoring quiz patterns to be behaviors where the average quiz score was 65% or higher. Participants in these clusters used AI both for code generation and conceptual queries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Generation-then-comprehension (n=2): Participants in this group first generated code and then manually copied or pasted the code into their work. After their code was generated, they asked the AI assistant follow-up questions to improve understanding. These participants were not particularly fast when using AI, but showed a higher level of understanding on the quiz. Interestingly, this approach looked nearly the same as that of the AI delegation group, except for the fact that they used AI to check their own understanding.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hybrid code-explanation (n=3): Participants in this group composed hybrid queries in which they asked for code generation along with explanations of the generated code. Reading and understanding the explanations they asked for took more time, but helped in their comprehension.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Conceptual inquiry (n=7): Participants in this group only asked conceptual questions and relied on their improved understanding to complete the task. Although this group encountered many errors, they also independently resolved them. On average, this mode was the fastest among high-scoring patterns and second fastest overall, after AI delegation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our qualitative analysis does not draw a causal link between interaction patterns and learning outcomes, but it does point to behaviors associated with different learning outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that incorporating AI aggressively into the workplace, particularly with respect to software engineering, comes with trade-offs. The findings highlight that not all AI-reliance is the same: the way we interact with AI while trying to be efficient affects how much we learn. Given time constraints and organizational pressures, junior developers or other professionals may rely on AI to complete tasks as fast as possible at the cost of skill development—and notably the ability to debug issues when something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though preliminary, these results suggest important considerations as companies transition to a greater ratio of AI-written to human-written code. Productivity benefits may come at the cost of skills necessary to validate AI-written code if junior engineers’ skill development has been stunted by using AI in the first place. Managers should think intentionally about how to deploy AI tools at scale, and consider systems or intentional design choices that ensure engineers continue to learn as they work—and are thus able to exercise meaningful oversight over the systems they build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For novice workers in software engineering or any other industry, our study can be viewed as a small piece of evidence toward the value of intentional skill development with AI tools. Cognitive effort—and even getting painfully stuck—is likely important for fostering mastery. This is also a lesson that applies to how individuals choose to work with AI, and which tools they use. Major LLM services also provide learning modes (e.g., Claude Code Learning and Explanatory mode or ChatGPT Study Mode) designed to foster understanding. Knowing how people learn when using AI can also help guide how we design it; AI assistance should enable humans to work more efficiently and develop new skills at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior studies have found mixed results on whether AI helps or hinders coding productivity. Our own research found that AI can reduce the time it takes to complete some work tasks by 80%—a result that may seem in tension with the findings presented here. But the two studies ask different questions and use different methods: our earlier observational work measured productivity on tasks where participants already had the relevant skills, while this study examines what happens when people are learning something new. It is possible that AI both accelerates productivity on well-developed skills and hinders the acquisition of new ones, though more research is needed to understand this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This study is only a first step towards uncovering how human-AI collaboration affects the experience of workers. Our sample was relatively small, and our assessment measured comprehension shortly after the coding task. Whether immediate quiz performance predicts longer-term skill development is an important question this study does not resolve. There remain many unanswered questions we hope future studies will investigate, for example: the effects of AI on tasks beyond coding, whether this effect dissipates longitudinally as engineers develop greater fluency, and whether AI assistance differs from human assistance while learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, to accommodate skill development in the presence of AI, we need a more expansive view of the impacts of AI on workers. In an AI-augmented workplace, productivity gains matter, but so does the long-term development of the expertise those gains depend on.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet how this assistance affects the development of skills required to effectively supervise AI remains unclear. Novice workers who rely heavily on AI to complete unfamiliar tasks may compromise their own skill acquisition in the process. We conduct randomized experiments to study how developers gained mastery of a new asynchronous programming library with and without the assistance of AI. We find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average. Participants who fully delegated coding tasks showed some productivity improvements, but at the cost of learning the library. We identify six distinct AI interaction patterns, three of which involve cognitive engagement and preserve learning outcomes even when participants receive AI assistance. Our findings suggest that AI-enhanced productivity is not a shortcut to competence and AI assistance should be carefully adopted into workflows to preserve skill formation -- particularly in safety-critical domains.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Submission history&lt;/head&gt;From: Judy Hanwen Shen [view email]&lt;p&gt;[v1] Wed, 28 Jan 2026 04:40:43 UTC (2,680 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current browse context: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cs.CY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GOG is planning a Linux-native GOG Galaxy, calling Linux the 'next major frontier.'&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GOG is hiring a senior engineer to shape Galaxy's architecture for Linux from day one.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Native Galaxy will let Linux users relive classics without the usual headaches.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gaming on Linux used to be in a nasty catch-22. People wouldn't develop games for Linux because gamers didn't use it, and gamers didn't use Linux because people wouldn't develop games for it. However, with the advancement of tech like Proton, we're beginning to see people take Linux seriously as a gaming powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, that doesn't mean that the Linux community won't welcome developers who create Linux-native versions of their games and related apps. So, when the news broke that GOG was hiring a developer to help get its library app over into the world of FOSS, it was good news for everyone who wants to bring the classics over to Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;GOG's new owner details how he plans to take on Steam: publish less chaff&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a world of monopolies, GOG wants a niche.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;GOG calls Linux "a major frontier" as it aims to make Galaxy Linux-native&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It's the next step in GOG's plans to appeal to Linux users&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you've never heard of GOG before, it stands for 'Good Old Games,' and its name gives away what kind of titles it sells. It's not all classic games, though; sometimes the company will publish newer titles with a retro feel to them that feel at home on the platform. Recently, the original co-founder of GOG bought the store back from its previous owner, CD Projekt Red, and declared they would survive under Steam's shadow by vetting games published on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, it seems they're making efforts to bring GOG over to Linux. As spotted by VideoCardz, a recent job advertisement on the GOG website revealed that the company is hiring a senior engineer to help with its optional library app, GOG Galaxy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;GOG GALAXY is our desktop client and ecosystem hub - the place where players manage their libraries, connect with the community, and access features that go far beyond a store. Today, it delivers experience on Windows and macOS, but Linux is the next major frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a Senior Engineer who will help shape GOG GALAXY’s architecture, tooling, and development standards with Linux in mind from day one. At the same time, GOG GALAXY is a long-lived product with a large and complex C++ codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While you don't need GOG Galaxy to play your purchased games, it's still nice to see the company working on making an app that runs on Linux natively. Here's hoping it's the first of many tweaks GOG is making to help Linux users relive the classics without any of the headaches.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tesla’s nascent robotaxi program is off to a rough start. New NHTSA crash data, combined with Tesla’s new disclosure of robotaxi mileage, reveals Tesla’s autonomous vehicles are crashing at a rate much higher tha human drivers, and that’s with a safety monitor in every car.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to NHTSA’s Standing General Order crash reports, Tesla has reported 9 crashes involving its robotaxi fleet in Austin, Texas between July and November 2025:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;November 2025: Right turn collision&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;October 2025: Incident at 18 mph&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;September 2025: Hit an animal at 27 mph&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;September 2025: Collision with cyclist&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;September 2025: Rear collision while backing (6 mph)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;September 2025: Hit a fixed object in parking lot&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;July 2025: Collision with SUV in construction zone&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;July 2025: Hit fixed object, causing minor injury (8 mph)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;July 2025: Right turn collision with SUV&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to a chart in Tesla’s Q4 2025 earnings report showing cumulative robotaxi miles, the fleet has traveled approximately 500,000 miles as of November 2025. That works out to roughly one crash every 55,000 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For comparison, human drivers in the United States average approximately one police-reported crash every 500,000 miles, according to NHTSA data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That means Tesla’s robotaxis are crashing at a rate 9 times higher than the average human driver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, that figure doesn’t include non-police-reported incidents. When adding those, or rather an estimate of those, humans are closer to 200,000 miles between crashes, which is still a lot better than Tesla’s robotaxi in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The safety monitor problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what makes this data particularly damning: every Tesla robotaxi in the reported mileage had a safety monitor in the vehicle who can intervene at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These aren’t fully autonomous vehicles operating without backup. There’s a human sitting in the car whose entire job is to prevent crashes. And yet Tesla’s crash rate is still nearly an order of magnitude worse than regular human drivers operating alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Waymo, by comparison, operates a fully driverless fleet, no safety monitor, no human backup, and reports significantly better safety numbers. Waymo has logged over 25 million autonomous miles and maintains a crash rate well below human averages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The transparency gap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps more troubling than the crash rate is Tesla’s complete lack of transparency about what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every single Tesla crash narrative in the NHTSA database is redacted with the same phrase: “[REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know a Tesla robotaxi hit a cyclist. We don’t know what happened.&lt;lb/&gt;We know one caused a minor injury. We don’t know what happened.&lt;lb/&gt;We know one hit an animal at 27 mph. We don’t know what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Waymo, Zoox, and other AV operators provide full narrative descriptions of every incident. Here’s a typical Waymo report from the same dataset:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“The Waymo AV was traveling northbound on N. 16th Street in the left lane when it slowed to a stop to yield to a pedestrian that had begun crossing the roadway. While the pedestrian continued to cross and the Waymo AV remained stopped, a passenger car approaching from behind made contact with the rear of the stationary Waymo AV.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s accountability. That’s transparency. Tesla provides none of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s clear that Tesla is not responsible for some of these crashes, but the fact that we don’t know is entirely due to Tesla’s own secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A great example is an incident that happened last week in Santa Monica, California, where a Waymo hit a child in a school zone. That sounds awful, doesn’t it? Potentially a company-ending incident, but Waymo released all the details, which confirmed that the child ran into the street while hidden behind an SUV. The Waymo vehicle immediately detected the child and while it didn’t have to time to prevent the impact, it was able to apply the brakes and reduce the speed from 17 mph to under 6 mph before contact was made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, the child was OK. Waymo even claims that its models show that a human driver would have likely reacted more slowly and hit the kid at twice the speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s better to know about these incidents than to keep everything secret to avoid publicizing those you are responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Electrek’s Take&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s good and there’s bad in this. With only a crash in October and one in November, there appears to be improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the overall data is sobering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Top comment by Nx&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is also not captured in the statistics is exactly how many interventions were made by the safety operators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 3X worse than humans number for Tesla Robotaxi is actually incredibly over-optimistic as a projection for operation without safety operators. Because it excludes all the accidents that were prevented by safety operators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A crash every 55,000 miles, with a safety monitor in the car, is not robotaxi-ready. It’s not even close. And the complete lack of transparency about what’s causing these crashes makes it impossible to have confidence that Tesla is learning from them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Waymo operates fully driverless vehicles in multiple cities and publishes detailed information about every incident. Tesla operates supervised vehicles in one geofenced area and redacts everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Tesla wants to be taken seriously as a robotaxi operator, it needs to do two things: dramatically improve its safety record, and start being honest about what’s happening on the roads of Austin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now, it’s failing at both.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;30 January 2026&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code is cheap. Show me the talk.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TLDR; Software development, as it has been done for decades, is over. LLM coding tools have changed it fundamentally for the better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Talk is cheap. Show me the code.” — Linus Torvalds, August 2000&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, made this quip in response to a claim about a complex piece of programming in the Linux kernel, [1] I was an oblivious, gangly, fledgling teenage n00b coder learning by copy-pasting open source Perl and VB snippets over dialup internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The quip has since become an adage in the software world. The gist of it back then was that, it was easy to talk about all the software stuff one would like to do, or could be hypothetically done, but unless one actually put in the effort and proved it, talk wasn’t of much value. Writing and proving good software was a high-effort, high-cost, high-skill endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even when armed with a crystal clear software development plan and the exact know-how to implement it, any sufficiently complex piece of programming is high-effort, tedious, and time consuming to actually write and get to a form where it is functional, reliable, and at least reasonably future-ready. In the process of developing software, any number of unforeseen complexities and gotchas can arise with many unresolvable trade-offs,[2] both technical and external. It is not uncommon for software architectures to change mid-way multiple times. The cost of just trying things out is so exponentially high that the significant majority of ideas are simply never tried out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After all, the real bottleneck is good old physical and biological human constraints—cognitive bandwidth, personal time and resources, and most importantly, the biological cost and constraints of having to sit for indefinite periods, writing code with one’s own hands line by line even if it is all in one’s head, while juggling and context-switching through the mental map of large systems. And if it is more than one individual, a whole host of interpersonal coordination and communication dynamics come into play. It is thus very difficult to prototype and try out not just grand ideas, but even reasonably simple ones. As many of us have done, most ideas are generally appended to a bottomless wishlist where they very likely stay forever. That’s how I have programmed and written software on a regular basis and enjoyed it—from hobby stuff to critical systems that millions of people depend on—for about 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All that has now been thrown out of the window, of course, for better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coming back to Linus, fast-forward 25 years, when he merges a chunk of AI-generated code into his toy project and comments “Is this much better than I could do by hand? Sure is.”, [3] I, no longer the fledgling n00b, but someone with decades of software development scars and calluses (both physical and metaphorical), am able to grasp its implications. Not only that, now with a sizeable amount of first-hand experience with LLM-assisted coding, I am compelled to say, software development, as it has been done for decades, is over. Along with that, many other things are too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I say that with the full awareness that it smacks of Fukuyama’s The End of History, [4] but I will reiterate:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Software development, as it has been done for decades, is over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;I&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was lucky to be in the transitionary Goldilocks era to witness and to partake in the breakneck evolution of the internet and software landscape—dialup to DSL to gigabit; Basic, Visual Basic 4/5/6 and Delphi; rise and fall of cgi-bin; Altavista to Google; XMLHttpRequest kicking off Web 2.0; rise and fall of Flash; death of IE and the rise of Chrome; WAP to Symbian to Android and smartphone apps; the demise of SourceForge and the massive proliferation and success of FOSS (Free and Open-source Software); git and GitHub; rise of SaaS; ExpertsExchange to StackOverflow; the growth of the Linux world; sysadmin to devops to whateverOps; the ominous birthing of Node.js and MongoDB in the same year; microservices; the explosion of VC-funded software “unicorns”; crypto and web3 shams; the rapid darkening of patterns; widespread enshittification and monetisation of privacy, attention, and dignity; and the monumental bloating of software that has since become the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All throughout this, I have been writing, maintaining, and deploying software both as a professional developer and as a FOSS hobbyist dabbling in a gazillion languages, frameworks, tools, and methodologies. From thinking that “indenting code is lame” (cringe) as a teen, from copy-pasting to CVS to svn to git, fighting space vs. tab battles, to maturing to “whatever floats your boat” and still regularly compressing PNGs to shave off a few KBs, I have been a dabbler, dilettante, and an addict, someone who has unconditionally enjoyed writing code and developing software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But now? How I develop software now is not how I have done it all these years, all the right, wrong, good, bad, easy and hard bits combined. With the advent of code-assisting LLMs, it has been completely flipped on its head, and I don’t think there is any going back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, that is some “Tears in rain”-esque [5] monologue right there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barring a bunch of obvious objective 101s, there is no universal measure of what makes a codebase good or great. Styles, idioms, patterns, architectures all vary greatly. Even objectively provable technical choices are subject to trade-offs that defy consensus. For a software developer like me, historically, there have been a few rule-of-thumb indicators for quick evaluation of software. When I evaluate a FOSS project, I look at a bunch of factors, all a mix of objective and subjective, weighted differently under different contexts—the project’s age; is the commit activity overly sparse or frantic; frameworks and dependencies; is code consistently organised and commented without being over-abstracted; is there a community around it; are maintainers responsive; can I actually get it up and running quickly from a clear README; the quality and depth of its documentation …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of these rule-of-thumb signals give a reasonable glimpse of the mental model and the style of working of the maintainers and the likely future trajectory of the project. For example, concise comments, README, and documentation indicate thoughtfulness, extra effort, and empathy for other developers (and self). Mainly because, for mortal developers like me, documentation and tests are a necessity, but unpleasant, boring, and tedious things to write and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, those notions have now been abruptly and violently defenestrated by LLMs. They can now one-shot generate stunning looking documentation pages, dense (ironically, pedantically detailed) READMEs, build great looking user interfaces, neatly organise code with proper idioms, patterns, and comments. One can no longer know whether such a repository was “vibe” coded by a non-technical person who has never written a single line of code, or an experienced developer, who may or may not have used LLM assistance. These no longer indicate the quality of a codebase. On the contrary, the more stunning or perfect looking something is, the more suspicious it is now—was it low-effort, one-shot vibe coded?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the tell-tale, rule-of-thumb measures of code and software quality being outright dead, without a much closer inspection and a bit of expert forensic analysis, it is now difficult to tell the wheat from the “slop”. One is now slowly being compelled to also look much more closely at the provenance of software—the who, why, their track record, and plans of governance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Effort&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historically, it would take a reasonably long period of consistent effort and many iterations of refinement for a good developer to produce 10,000 lines of quality code that not only delivered meaningful results, but was easily readable and maintainable. While the number of lines of code is not a measure of code quality—it is often the inverse—a codebase with good quality 10,000 lines of code indicated significant time, effort, focus, patience, expertise, and often, skills like project management that went into it. Human traits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, LLMs can not only one-shot generate that in seconds, they can handle many technical aspects of the software development workflow, from testing to sysadmin to publishing. Unlike the unpredictable outcomes of frenzied vibe coding, when steered with human expertise, the output can be high quality and highly effective.[6] This has been my personal experience as well. On a regular basis, I have been compressing work that would have taken me weeks and months to mere days and even hours. That too, without vibe coding, an AGENT.md file, or any fancy multi-agent workflows or orchestration. Just an LLM agent CLI at arm’s length.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a developer with a bottomless wishlist of things I wish I could have done or tried out, I have been able to use LLM tools to not just rapidly prototype and validate complex ideas, but actually write good quality production-grade software (my own subjective metric, of course) with better code than I could have written manually—things where I knew exactly what I had to do, but was constrained by physical limits, and also things that were unclear to me and needed novel ideas, approaches, and leaps. All the while, learning and bettering my own understanding of things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The physiological, cognitive, and emotional cost I generally incur to achieve the software outcomes I want or am capable of engineering, has undoubtedly reduced by several orders of magnitude. The time and bandwidth this has freed up, I now spend on engineering, architecting, debating, tinkering, trying to expand my imagination, and writing much more concise and meaningful code that I actually want to write.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember the old adage, “programming is 90% thinking and 10% typing”? It is now, for real.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Slop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given all that, what is the value of code as an artefact, when it can be generated at an industrial scale within seconds by someone who has never written any code? Barring obviously bad LLM-generated code, when code is neatly structured and functional (yes, LLMs can write good code when steered competently), what makes it valuable or not? We wouldn’t want LLM-generated code in systems out there in the real world, but would instead prefer pure unadulterated human code, yes? Well, that would be a wonderful joke.[7] [8] [9] [10] [11]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reality is that the significant majority of the code written by humans globally on a daily basis, is likely borderline junk.[12] Software development is not even a discipline that has reached any objective level of maturity. Medical doctors and civil engineers go through rigorous training to be issued licenses that are contingent on real world ramifications of their work. How about software developers and engineers? The world runs on shoddily engineered, poorly cobbled together, bloated systems with garbage code that humans have written, mostly directed by people in positions of power with perverse incentives who have absolutely no technical know-how or have any grounding in the humanities—the tyranny of non-tech “tech leaders”.[13]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One could, to trigger emotions, argue that AI slop is at least neatly formatted, well documented, and more syntactically consistent than the vast majority of human-written code. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kidding aside, I am no fan of AI slop. Reading those obvious soulless LLM-generated messages and articles on the (dead) internet[14] is a waste of neuronal activation in the amygdala, if there is any activation at all. That so many people across the world LLM-speak and emote in the exact same manner on the internet, is creepy self-Pluribus-ification.[15] Without human creation, perfection and flaws, language, literature, art, music etc. are unenjoyable (to most). Infinite, instantly-generatable stuff without human constraints and limits, is actually very difficult to value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As is code, then? Well, code is a bit different from art, literature, or any form of direct communication and evocation. Code was always a means to an end. Unlike poetry or prose, end users don’t read or care about code. They don’t care what language or framework or the architecture the hundred systems running behind a portal are made of. Code is hidden. They interact with the effect and outcomes of code through various forms of UX. I say that, slightly begrudgingly, as someone who enjoys writing, organising, and even nurturing code. For those who are immersed in it, there is an element of creativity and art in it, and many like me, are borderline curmudgeons on all things software.[16]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ignoring outright bad code, in a world where functional code is so abundant that “good” and “bad” are indistinguishable, ultimately, what makes functional AI code slop or non-slop? I am strongly inclined to think that it is the framework of accountability, and ironically, the element of humanness. That is, all things (code) being equal, the ability to hold someone accountable at least emotionally and morally (and sometimes legally), for an artefact, instills value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When one gets that big pull request (PR) on an open source repository, irrespective of its quality, if it is handwritten by a human, there is an intrinsic value and empathy for the human time and effort that is likely ascribed to it. It is known that there is a physical and cognitive cost that has been paid writing a lot of code before raising a PR. That is what makes that code “expensive” and not cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a PR is obviously LLM-generated, irrespective of how good it is, the first reaction is likely to be “slop!”, because it is no longer possible to instantly ascertain the human effort behind it. On the other hand, the effort required to read and validate it is disproportionately and exponentially high—setting aside people who have also offloaded reading of code to LLMs. It may very well be the best possible functional code, but it is one out of an infinite possible variation that could have been generated with no human cost or effort. Emotionally, it feels wrong and unfair to be burdened by such code dumps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, at that point, our reality has become a version of Borges’ Library of Babel.[17]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FOSS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of libraries, FOSS is perhaps the greatest public commons that humanity has created. The genesis of FOSS and its predecessors, various schemes for sharing code, can be traced to the fundamental premise that software was prohibitively expensive and required immense specialist skills to create. Only a tiny handful of people in the world had the ability to do that, and everyone else was naturally forced to use the creations of the few (proprietary or not). While the global developer ecosystem has exploded since then, the ratio of makers to users has largely remained the same. Largescale FOSS collaboration and community dynamics all stem from that—codebases as valuable shared artefacts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happens in a world where code is cheap and small to medium-sized software libraries and modules can be quickly created by an expert, perfectly customised and attuned to their needs, no matter how niche? Forget expertise, a world where anyone reasonably savvy can vibe code the small things they need for their private use, however they please. I see this happening everywhere. What is happening to StackOverflow[18] is also happening to software, although not as dramatically. This seems to strike at the very heart of the human dynamics, societal conditions, and incentives that drive FOSS collaboration and sharing. Add to that, if one considers the impending Cambrian explosion of FOSS projects manufactured at an unprecedented scale, the high-quality FOSS projects that remain and thrive, expert governance, curation, and trust are likely to become more valuable than the code itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Missing the forest for the trees&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Humans have produced amazing software when there was no syntax highlighting, IDEs, or any kind of tooling. And humans also produce trash despite all the tooling and resources in the world. A good competent developer with good articulation skills and care for quality will use LLMs, or any other tools, in their own ways to produce quality outcomes. An incompetent developer with poor articulation skills or one with a lack of care for quality, will produce bad stuff, LLMs or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, the extreme proponents of manic “agentic” vibe coding,[19] and the outright denouncers of LLMs, are both missing the forest for the trees. That there is a pragmatic middle path, where people who have the experience, expertise, competence, and the ability to articulate can use these tools to get the outcomes they desire with the right sets of trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vibe coding has its place, especially for non-technical people, who, for the first time, can tinker, explore, have fun, and empower themselves with software. I see this happening all around me. However, the fanatical acolytes of vibe coding are missing a very important thing that makes humans take artefacts seriously—finitude. They’re generating a vast Borgesian library where they themselves are likely to be lost in an ocean of slop generated by sycophantic agents. Slop, not because the code is of poor quality, but because anything that can be generated infinitely without effort and has no meaningful provenance, is very hard to value or take seriously. Humans fundamentally do not deal well with an infinite supply of anything, especially choices. Completely unsurprising because we are heavily constrained biological beings that have evolved on a finite planet with finite resources to live out finite lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then, the denouncers, they can’t seem to get past the argument from incredulity.[20] They denounce LLMs because they don’t personally like them for whatever reason, or have been unable to get desirable outcomes, or had the wrong expectations about them, or have simply gotten sick of them. But that is immaterial because there is a sizeable population who are using the exact same tools fruitfully and have the opposite experience. I am one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All that said, the widespread braindead and outright stupid and harmful implementations of these technologies fuelled by hype, frenzy, and greed are an unfortunate reality and a massive cause of concern. The AI-business bubble is perhaps one of the biggest in history. The rise of FOSS AI technologies makes one hopeful. However, to incorrectly conflate bad actors, bad actions, bean-counting, and nonsensical implementations with fundamental, physical capabilities of these technologies—not theoretical, but the regular, proven, and practical—is irrational. It is missing the forest for the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The human cost&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this has been from the perspective of an experienced developer and engineer. For someone who has been weathered and bruised enough, these AI technologies provide extremely effective and powerful assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what about the young folks who are just starting out? If one does not have their fundamentals in place, if one has not developed an innate and nuanced understanding of systems and the process of software development, then these technologies are unreliable, dangerous genies. One asks for code, it gives code. One asks for changes, it gives changes. Soon, one is stuck with a codebase whose workings one doesn’t understand, and one is forced to go back to the genie and depend on it helplessly. And because one is hooked on and dependent on the genie, the natural circumstances that otherwise would allow for foundational and fundamental skills and understanding to develop, never arise, to the point of cognitive decline.[21] What then happens to an entire generation of juniors, who never get an opportunity to become seniors meaningfully?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally, I don’t care about the extreme vibe coders or denouncers or even slop. We are all going to drown in a deluge of slop, from which, many islands of sanity, recovery, and a new order of software will emerge. The real concern is for generations of learners who are being robbed of the opportunity to acquire the expertise to objectively discern what is slop and what is not. Even worse, the possibility that experienced folks who use these tools effectively, will feel disincentivised from mentoring and training junior folks in foundational ways, something that was a natural part of societal evolution. And not just with software development, but the wholesale offloading of agency and decision-making to black boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Talk&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, for a hands-on developer, reading and critically evaluating code have become more important than learning syntax and typing it out line by line. Of course, that is still an important skill, because the ability to read code effectively comes from that in the first place. But, the daily software development workflows have flipped over completely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An experienced developer who can talk well, that is, imagine, articulate, define problem statements, architect and engineer, has a massive advantage over someone who cannot, more disproportionately than ever. Knowledge of specific language, syntax, and frameworks—code—is no longer a bottleneck. The physiological constraints of yore are no longer impediments. The machinery for instantly creating code at scale is now a commodity and available to everyone, just a &lt;code&gt;pip install&lt;/code&gt; equivalent away. It requires no special training, no new language or framework to learn, and has practically no entry barriers—just good old critical thinking and foundational human skills, and competence to run the machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conventional software development methodologies and roles—Waterfall[22] to Agile,[23] developer to tester, senior to junior—have fundamentally changed with traditional boundaries consolidating into unimaginably fast, compressed, blurry, iterative “agentic” loops. The dynamics of people, organisations, and public communities in software development, the very human incentives for sharing and collaboration,[24] [25] [26] are all changing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the first time ever, good talk is exponentially more valuable than good code. The ramifications of this are significant and disruptive. This time, it is different.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cicada is a lightweight scripting language that runs inside of C code. For details, see the website:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;http://heltilda.github.io/cicada&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Installation: From the command prompt go into the Cicada download directory, and type:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; ./configure&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; make&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; make install&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How to use: Include the Cicada header file in your C code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;cicada.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and pass an &lt;code&gt;lcicada&lt;/code&gt; option to the linker:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;gcc -lcicada -o myprogram ...&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simplest way to run Cicada is to call:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;runCicada(NULL, NULL, true);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This story was produced and originally published by Wisconsin Watch, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom. It was made possible by donors like you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How did a $1 billion, 520-acre data center proposed by one of the world’s richest companies go unnoticed in tiny Beaver Dam, Wisconsin?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key reason: In a city that lists “communication matters” atop its core values, officials took steps to keep the project hidden for more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;News with a little more humanity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WPR’s “Wisconsin Today” newsletter keeps you connected to the state you love without feeling overwhelmed. No paywall. No agenda. No corporate filter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now Meta, the trillion-dollar company that owns Facebook and Instagram, is building a complex as big as 12 football fields in a city with a population of 16,000, enough to fill only a fifth of Lambeau Field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s one of seven major data center projects pending in Wisconsin that combined are worth more than $57 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In four of them, including Beaver Dam, local government officials kept the massive projects under wraps through confidential nondisclosure agreements, a Wisconsin Watch investigation has found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secrecy also occurred in the three communities without NDAs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one, the Madison suburb of DeForest, officials worked behind the scenes for months before publicly announcing a proposed $12 billion data center, which residents are fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lack of public disclosure, while relatively common for typical development proposals in the planning stages, raises questions about how much time the public should have to digest projects that dramatically affect the economy, land use, energy, taxes, the environment and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“As soon as community leadership is contemplating, even entertaining it, I think they need to make the public aware,” said retired tech executive Prescott Balch, who is advising residents around Wisconsin where data centers are proposed. “Even if it makes it harder, that’s the right way to do it. And nobody is doing it that way.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blowback from residents who have been kept in the dark has spurred a new legislative proposal that would ban data center NDAs statewide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Beaver Dam did it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wisconsin has some 40 data centers, stretching from Kenosha to Eau Claire. But most are tiny compared with the big seven: three under construction in Beaver Dam, Mount Pleasant and Port Washington; and four proposed in DeForest, Janesville, Kenosha and Menomonie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides storing and processing data, data centers are vital to advancing the use of artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A case study in how projects each worth $1 billion or more are kept quiet is Beaver Dam, the Dodge County burg an hour northeast of Madison, where Meta’s data center is expected to open in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Beaver Dam Area Development Corp., a quasi-government nonprofit that functions as the city’s economic development arm, signed an NDA on Dec. 1, 2023, not with Meta, but with a shell company no one had ever heard of, Balloonist LLC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agreement referred only to a “project,” making no mention of a data center or Meta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NDA was signed “very early, almost in the introductory period of that project,” the development corporation’s leader, Trent Campbell, told Wisconsin Watch. All major development projects have “different levels of confidentiality for different purposes. And this entity believed it to be necessary at the onset of the conversations.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NDA meant that the Beaver Dam Area Development Corp. could not reveal its discussions with Balloonist, or even disclose “the existence of the project.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NDA also put the wheels in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more than a year, the city quietly took official actions to make the data center a reality, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;July 2024: The city council voted 12-0 to approve a predevelopment agreement with another shell company, Degas LLC, that only later was identified with the data center. The agenda and the minutes of the meeting don’t mention a data center.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;November 2024: The city council created a tax incremental finance, or TIF, district for the data center to help fund development. The agenda and the minutes for that meeting do not mention a data center, though the agreement itself does.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not until February 2025 — 14 months after the NDA was signed — did the Beaver Dam Area Development Corp. announce that it and the city were working with a company — then still unidentified — on a “potential data center project.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Campbell noted to Wisconsin Watch that Gov. Tony Evers and other officials had identified the site for a major development as far back as 2019. For months after the NDA was signed, it wasn’t known whether the data center would come to fruition, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I know the opponents currently disagree, but I think the city acted in as transparent a way as they could,” Campbell said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually, a news report in April 2025 identified Meta, which declined comment for this story, as the company likely behind the data center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta confirmed its involvement eight months later, saying on Facebook: “We’re proud to call Beaver Dam home. We are honored to have joined such an incredible community in 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first reply to that post was from a Beaver Dam resident, who wrote: “We would have been honored to have the opportunity to decline this.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Secrecy without an NDA&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NDAs also helped keep the public in the dark about data centers under consideration in the three other cities that used them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Menomonie signed its NDA with Balloonist LLC in February 2024 — more than a year before the city in northwest Wisconsin announced a $1.6 billion data center proposal in July 2025. Two months after the NDA, the city council unanimously helped pave the way for a data center by changing a land use ordinance. The change gave, for the first time, a definition of the ordinance’s reference to “warehousing,” saying warehousing includes data centers. The city’s mayor put the proposed data center on hold in September 2025. In January 2026, the city council adopted a zoning ordinance for data centers that reversed the warehousing definition. “Based upon feedback from the community and elected officials, it is clear that additional discussion should occur regarding the appropriate level of regulation of data centers,” the city’s public works director told the council and the mayor.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Kenosha signed its NDA, with Microsoft, in May 2024, six months before news reports surfaced saying the NDA kept the proposed data center operator’s name confidential. It was later announced that Microsoft had purchased 240 acres in the neighboring town of Paris, which the city annexed in December 2024. No dollar amount for the proposal has been announced.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Janesville announced in July 2025 it was approached by developers about a data center and put out a request for proposal. The city signed its NDA two months later and is now in negotiations with Viridian Acquisitions, a Colorado developer, for an $8 billion data center.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Port Washington in Ozaukee County and Mount Pleasant in Racine County responded to records requests from Wisconsin Watch saying they had not signed NDAs for their data centers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Port Washington, where three people were arrested during a city council meeting on the data center in December, residents are trying to recall Mayor Ted Neitzke, saying he has been secretive about the $15 billion data center from OpenAI, Oracle and Vantage Data Centers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Mount Pleasant, Microsoft this month announced plans to add 15 data centers, worth $13 billion, to the $7 billion complex under construction there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NDAs are described by economic development officials as necessary and criticized by data center opponents as against the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NDAs and other steps to protect confidentiality are crucial at the early stages of a development proposal, said Tricia Braun, executive director of the Wisconsin Data Center Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If I’m a company considering making strategic investments, regardless of industry, I don’t want my competition to know where I’m going, what I’m doing, what pace I’m doing it at,” said Braun, a former executive at the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. “You want to make sure everything is buttoned up and bow tied before that type of information is put into the public realm.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Questions have swirled around transparency even in communities where local government officials did not sign NDAs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That includes DeForest, which lists “communicate clearly” among its core values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DeForest data center, proposed by Virginia-based QTS Data Centers, is controversial, in part, because the village board would have to annex 1,600 acres in the neighboring town of Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At one DeForest Village Board meeting about the project, Village President Jane Cahill Wolfgram said that based on emails she had been receiving from residents, there was “just one thing I think we need to clear up.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“And you can ask any one of these board members. They will tell you, they just learned about this project in the last couple of weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was Nov. 18, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Village Board trustees had been offered one-on-one meetings with the developer some 10 weeks earlier, trustee Jan Steffenhagen-Hahn said in an email to Vienna resident Shawn Haney.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Because of the scale of this project,” that’s when residents should have been notified, said Haney, a leader of a group that opposes the data center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other emails obtained by the group show that DeForest staff were strategizing with QTS representatives and Alliant Energy as early as March 2025 — seven months before announcing the proposal last October.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one email, the village planner discussed with QTS representatives when to seek various village approvals, including annexation, while acknowledging that doing so without disclosing “any details of the project or operations will be difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cahill Wolfgram told Wisconsin Watch she in fact had met with QTS on Oct. 1, three weeks before the public announcement. She expressed frustration that many residents are urging trustees to stop the data center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They’ve been brought in from the very early moments of this discussion and they have continued to be front and center of everything we’ve done,” Cahill Wolfgram said. “As village president, I know of nothing that has been done behind the scenes.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A public hearing on the annexation is scheduled for Feb. 9.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The state Department of Administration, which reviews annexation proposals and issues advisory opinions, concluded the DeForest annexation is not in the public interest because of concerns over how the village would provide water and sewer services for the annexed area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Clean Economy Coalition of Wisconsin has called for state leaders to pause consideration of any data centers until a comprehensive strategy on them is adopted. In part, the coalition said comprehensive planning is needed to avoid more “stranded assets.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wisconsin Watch reported in December that Wisconsin utility ratepayers owe nearly $1 billion for stranded assets — coal power plants that have been or soon will be shut down. A push to provide new energy capacity for data centers poses the risk of creating more stranded assets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Some states targeting NDAs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Jan. 13 announced new standards aimed at being a “good neighbor in the communities where we build, own and operate our data centers.” It mentioned transparency five times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee researchers called Microsoft’s initial Mount Pleasant data center a “microcosm of a larger problem with secrecy and lack of transparency about water and electricity demands” of data centers throughout the country. That, they wrote, “harms the public’s ability to determine whether hosting a data center is in their best interest.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mount Pleasant has wanted a major development where the data center is now under construction because a massive development signed with Foxconn in 2017 largely fell through.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Local government use of NDAs and other methods to keep data center development secret is widespread across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Minnesota, local elected officials were aware of data center proposals for months or even years before disclosing them. In Virginia, 25 out of 31 data center projects had NDAs. In one New Mexico county, county staff negotiated for a $165 billion data center with an NDA that kept elected officials in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several states are targeting NDAs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least three — Florida, Michigan and New Jersey — are considering legislation to prohibit governments from signing data center NDAs. A Georgia bill would prohibit NDAs that hide information about data center electricity or water usage. New York is considering a bill to limit NDAs for economic development proposals generally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, similar legislation is pending in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, state Rep. Clint Moses, R-Menomonie, citing questions about transparency over the Menomonie proposal, introduced a bill to prohibit NDAs for data center proposals in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’ve never seen such overwhelming opposition from all sides of the aisle,” he told Wisconsin Watch, describing constituents’ feelings about data centers and secrecy surrounding them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moses said he understands the need for confidentiality in economic development generally, but that because data centers have such widespread impact, public notice is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The earlier the better,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Braun, the data centers coalition leader, said the public should be notified when a data center proposal is ready to be considered for approvals by elected officials — after municipal staff do due diligence to determine whether things such as zoning, utility capacity, water and sewer would make a proposal potentially viable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Balch, who helped defeat a proposed data center in the Racine County village of Caledonia, where he lives, said the public should be alerted well before local elected officials consider such votes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You have to use your judgment,” he said. “But at some point, you need to realize this is not a normal thing and we need to look out for the residents.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Ode to the AA Battery&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently this post from @Merocle caught my eye:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I'm fixing my iFixit soldering station. I haven't used it for a long time and the battery has gone overdischarge. I hope it will come back to life. Unfortunately, there are no replacements available for sale at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devices with built-in rechargeable batteries have been bugging me a lot lately. It's convenient to have a device you can take with you and use anywhere. And with modern Li-ion cells, battery life is remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for years, I've noticed the same thing happening to many devices as Merocle mentions above:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I purchase the device, charge it to 100%, use it a bit.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Knowing Li-ion cells are better off in the 40-80% range, I store the device with the battery at that charge level.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The next time I go to use the device (a few months later), it won't power on.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I plug the device in to charge, and 1 in 4 times the device won't start charging!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One problem is many devices don't have a proper BMS integrated into the charging circuit, that will cut power before the battery is below a critical threshold. Li-ion cells start to have problems below 3V, and often suffer permanent damage below 2.5V.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devices from even the most stalwart right-to-repair companies suffer from undervoltage issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can sometimes revive 'dead' Li-ion batteries, but I don't recommend it unless you know what you're doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assuming most people don't know what they're doing, when they pull out a piece of gear that won't turn on and has no obvious way of being repaired (especially with odd pouch-cell batteries, much less 18650 cells), these devices will most often end up in the trash. Or if you're lucky, some people will try recycling them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Enter the AA&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because of this trend, if I need portability, I look for devices that use AA and AAA batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each year for the past 14 years, I buy sets of Panasonic eneloop batteries to replace disposable AA batteries as they die. Eneloops have around 2000 mAh of capacity (versus 2100+ mAh for good alkaline batteries1), and run at a nominal 1.2V instead of the 1.5V of alkaline batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But they can be recharged. Over and over. They can be pulled out of a device, with new batteries swapped in quickly. For long term storage, I can pop the batteries out and use them in other devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, across 128 batteries, I have not had a single incident of leakage, fire, etc., and even the cells I reserve for outdoor use (in devices that go from -12Â°F in the winter to 105Â°F+ in the summer) are still holding a charge, over a decade later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only one cell has had to be retired, out of all the eneloops I've purchased.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What prompted me to write this post is the soldering project I worked on during this weekend's snowstorm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Universal Standards&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was putting together this clock at my workbench, and at one point I needed to determine which resistor was 100KÎ© and which was 1MÎ©. I pulled out my Fluke multimeter, inserted two AAA batteries I had sitting on my bench (I keep 8 AA and 8 AAA batteries charged and ready at my workbench, and don't store them in my tools), and measured the resistors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upon doing so, I realized the clamp meter I was using (Fluke 323 True RMS Clamp Meter) only measures between 400-4000Î©, so I switched to my old Craftsman meter that worked a treatâand uses a replaceable 9V battery!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be faster to leave the batteries in my tools, but over 40 years of sacrificing devices to alkaline cell leakage, it's my habit not to. So far I've never had leakage problems with the eneloops, but old habits die hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I put away the meter, I noticed my wife's and old Sony Walkman sitting nearby. Just for fun, I popped in two AA batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My wife had both a WM-EX150 (made in 1995) and a WM-FX281. These are 31 and 25 years old, respectivelyâand outside the rubber belts being shot, the devices both work. The radio works good as new, and it would play cassettes again after a little maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AAs might not last 32 hours, and the Walkman doesn't fit in tight jeans pockets, but they can still be as useful today as they were decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at my stack of old tech, every device uses one of the standard AA, AAA, or C-sized batteries. And thinking of all the new devices I've purchased, the ones that worry me the least (regarding fire safety, and whether they're work the next time I pull them out)... are the ones with easily-replaceable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;No Batteries at All&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I don't need portability, I prefer USB-C powered tools (with no battery). USB-C is ubiquitous enough I always have a plug available with at least 5, 9, or 12V of power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At every workbench and desk, and in my car and backpack, I have either USB battery packs, or wall plugs, that supply any voltage a device would need, and can supply up to 100W (sometimes more) through a small USB-C connector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I truly need portability, I can rubber-band a battery pack to the device I'm using.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not always ideal, and I wouldn't want a smartphone with such a battery pack, but many of my battery-less devices will outlive me, I am sure, with no risk of burning down my house.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Energy Density and Weight&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are cases where the energy density, portability, and weight tradeoffs of traditional battery cells don't work out: laptops, tablets, smartphones, watches, extremely lightweight computer mice...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Considering wireless input devices, though, Apple's 1st gen Magic Trackpad was AA-powered. Apparently Apple considered battery swaps so convenient they didn't even include a USB or Lightning connector2!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can understand when you need a more exotic or thin layout that doesn't lend itself well to cylindrical battery cells. There are laptops that exist with exposed 18650 cells, but they're certainly not for everyone (unless you like portable computing like it's 1999).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I build my own devices, I find myself relying on USB power (if the device lives near a desk or workbench), or integrated AA battery holders (if the device is meant to be portable). Not having to keep a few dozen cheap Li-ion packs sitting in close proximity to my sand bucket is a neat side-benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Project Farm has a great video exploring which AA battery provides the best value / power / longevity. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I still prefer wired connections for my peripherals, though. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Every popular agent framework runs LLM-generated code via &lt;code&gt;subprocess&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;exec()&lt;/code&gt;. That's arbitrary code execution on your host. One prompt injection and you're done.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;subprocess.run(["bash", ...])&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SWE-ReX&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some frameworks offer Docker isolation (OpenHands, AutoGen), but that requires running a Docker daemon and managing container infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;amla-sandbox is a WASM sandbox with capability enforcement. Agents can only call tools you explicitly provide, with constraints you define. Sandboxed virtual filesystem. No network. No shell escape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uv pip install "git+https://github.com/amlalabs/amla-sandbox"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No Docker. No VM. One binary, works everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from amla_sandbox import create_sandbox_tool

sandbox = create_sandbox_tool(tools=[stripe_api, database])

# Agent writes one script instead of 10 tool calls (JavaScript)
result = sandbox.run('''
    const txns = await stripe.listTransactions({customer: "cus_123"});
    const disputed = txns.filter(t =&amp;gt; t.disputed);
    console.log(disputed[0]);
''', language="javascript")

# Or with shell pipelines
result = sandbox.run('''
    tool stripe.listTransactions --customer cus_123 | jq '[.[] | select(.disputed)] | .[0]'
''', language="shell")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tool-calling is expensive. Every MCP call is a round trip through the model:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;LLM → tool → LLM → tool → LLM → tool → ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ten tool calls = ten LLM invocations. Code mode collapses this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;LLM → script that does all 10 things → result
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you can't just eval whatever the model spits out. So people either pay the token tax or run unsafe code. This gives you both: code-mode efficiency with actual isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sandbox runs inside WebAssembly with WASI for a minimal syscall interface. WASM provides memory isolation by design—linear memory is bounds-checked, and there's no way to escape to the host address space. The wasmtime runtime we use is built with defense-in-depth and has been formally verified for memory safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of WASM isolation, every tool call goes through capability validation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from amla_sandbox import Sandbox, MethodCapability, ConstraintSet, Param

sandbox = Sandbox(
    capabilities=[
        MethodCapability(
            method_pattern="stripe/charges/*",
            constraints=ConstraintSet([
                Param("amount") &amp;lt;= 10000,
                Param("currency").is_in(["USD", "EUR"]),
            ]),
            max_calls=100,
        ),
    ],
    tool_handler=my_handler,
)

# This works
sandbox.execute('await stripe.charges.create({amount: 500, currency: "USD"})')

# This fails - amount exceeds capability
sandbox.execute('await stripe.charges.create({amount: 50000, currency: "USD"})')&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design draws from capability-based security as implemented in systems like seL4—access is explicitly granted, not implicitly available. Agents don't get ambient authority just because they're running in your process. This matters because prompt injection is a fundamental unsolved problem; defense in depth through capability restriction limits the blast radius.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from amla_sandbox import create_sandbox_tool

sandbox = create_sandbox_tool()

# JavaScript
sandbox.run("console.log('hello'.toUpperCase())", language="javascript")  # -&amp;gt; "HELLO"

# Shell
sandbox.run("echo 'hello' | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'", language="shell")  # -&amp;gt; "HELLO"

# With tools
def get_weather(city: str) -&amp;gt; dict:
    return {"city": city, "temp": 72}

sandbox = create_sandbox_tool(tools=[get_weather])
sandbox.run("const w = await get_weather({city: 'SF'}); console.log(w);", language="javascript")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sandbox = create_sandbox_tool(
    tools=[transfer_money],
    constraints={
        "transfer_money": {
            "amount": "&amp;lt;=1000",
            "currency": ["USD", "EUR"],
        },
    },
    max_calls={"transfer_money": 10},
)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tools require object syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// WORKS - tools always take an object argument
await get_weather({city: "SF"});
await transfer({to: "alice", amount: 500});

// FAILS - positional arguments don't work
await get_weather("SF");  // Error: argument after ** must be a mapping&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt; for output:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Return value is captured and output
return await get_weather({city: "SF"});  // -&amp;gt; {"city":"SF","temp":72}
return {a: 1, b: 2};  // -&amp;gt; {"a":1,"b":2}
return "hello";  // -&amp;gt; hello (strings not double-quoted)

// console.log also works
console.log(JSON.stringify({a: 1}));  // -&amp;gt; {"a":1}

// No return = no output
const x = 42;  // -&amp;gt; (no output)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VFS is writable only under /workspace and /tmp:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// WORKS - /workspace and /tmp are ReadWrite
await fs.writeFile('/workspace/data.json', '{}');
await fs.mkdir('/tmp/cache');

// FAILS - root is read-only
await fs.mkdir('/mydir');  // EACCES: Permission denied&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For LangGraph integration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from amla_sandbox import create_sandbox_tool

sandbox = create_sandbox_tool(tools=[get_weather, search_db])
agent = create_react_agent(
    ChatAnthropic(model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"),
    [sandbox.as_langchain_tool()]  # LLM writes JS/shell that calls your tools
)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For fine-grained capability control:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from amla_sandbox import SandboxTool, MethodCapability, ConstraintSet, Param

caps = [
    MethodCapability(
        method_pattern="mcp:search_db",
        constraints=ConstraintSet([Param("query").starts_with("SELECT")]),
        max_calls=5,
    )
]

sandbox_tool = SandboxTool.from_functions([search_db], capabilities=caps)
agent = create_react_agent(model, [sandbox_tool.as_langchain_tool()])&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The sandbox yields on tool calls. Host executes them (after capability checks) and resumes. QuickJS runs inside WASM for the JS runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First run compiles the WASM module (~300ms). Cache it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;amla-precompile&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subsequent loads: ~0.5ms.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;stripe/**&lt;/code&gt;— zero or more segments&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you get: Isolation without infrastructure. Capability enforcement. Token efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you don't get: Full Linux environment. Native module support. GPU access. Infinite loop protection (a &lt;code&gt;while(true){}&lt;/code&gt; will hang - the step limit only counts WASM yields, not JS instructions).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you need a real VM with persistent state and arbitrary dependencies, use e2b or Modal. amla-sandbox is for the common case: agents running generated code with controlled tool access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Python code is MIT. The WASM binary is proprietary—you can use it with this package but can't extract or redistribute it separately.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Where I'm at with AI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weâre in new paradigm territory with generative AI. A lot of commentary falls into the skeptic, evangelist, or doomsdayer categories, or are practical but narrow takes. In this article, I’ll discuss my current use of generative AI tools and outline areas that concern me - areas that raise questions about how our industry and others will evolve. I am certain that generative AI is a productivity amplifier, but its economic, environmental, and cultural externalities are not being discussed enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A quick note on terminology: in this article, Iâll use the term “generative AI” to describe the current wave of generative AI systems - large language models like Claude and ChatGPT and similar tools. I want to be clear that Iâm talking about LLMs and not other areas of AI such as autonomous vehicles or medical diagnostic algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;We’re Moving Quickly&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you asked me six months ago what I thought of generative AI, I would have said that weâre seeing a lot of interesting movement, but the jury is out on whether it will be useful in my day to day work. Itâs remarkable how quickly my position has changed - fast forward just a few months and I am using Claude daily at work and at home. I use it for routine coding tasks like generating scaffolding or writing tests, and for ideation on new projects. I treat Claude like another software engineer and give it specific instructions. I spend a lot of time reading code it generates and making corrections before submitting a PR for my coworkers to review. I often have a generative AI tool do a pass on the PR before I ask a human to have a look, which has saved me many iterations. Coworkers of mine have used generative AI tools to build some truly mind blowing things in a short period of time. Iâve become a convert.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coding with generative AI absolutely increases velocity. Absent the concerns I outline in this article, the role of software engineers has changed. I am probably most closely aligned with the view Mark Brooker puts forward - that most software will be built very quickly, and more complicated software should be developed by writing the specification, and then generating the code. We may still need to drop down to a programming language from time to time, but I believe that almost all development will be done with generative AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the surface, my position here shouldnât be surprising or controversial. Iâve long held the belief that our job as software engineers is not to write code, but rather to solve problems. If code is the most efficient way to solve a problem, then great. Generative AI makes code much cheaper to generate. That comes with some huge wins, and some very real concerns that Iâll outline here. My purpose is not to express skepticism, or cast doubt, but rather to shine a light on questions that to my knowledge, are still open.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ironies of Automation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lisanne Bainbridge’s 1983 paper “Ironies of Automation” posits that automation can relegate humans to exception handling tasks (think of this whenever you hear someone say that itâs important to always âhave a human in the loopâ) and that when humans are relegated to such tasks, they become less effective than if they had a more active role.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best example of this that I can think of relates to roadway design and safety. “Stroads” (hybrid throughfares that combine qualities of high traffic streets and roads), for example, are dangerous because they encourage driving at high speeds and reduce the amount of friction encountered on a route. This causes inattentive driving which leads to more crashes and fatalities. Replacing stroads with more obstacles results in fewer crashes. One of the more striking examples is redesign of the La Jolla Boulevard in San Diego, where crashes were reduced by 90% after going from 5 lanes and 70ft pedestrian crossings to 2 lanes and 12-14 foot crossings with islands. Traffic volume stayed the same, and crashes plummeted. This video documents similar phenomenon contrasting urban design in Toronto and cities in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâm certainly not the first to draw similarities between Bainbridgeâs paper and the current use of generative AI tools. Mica R Endsley, former Chief Scientist of the U.S. Air Force published a paper called “Ironies of artificial intelligence” in 2023 which directly builds on Bainbridge in this context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The principle applies beyond roads. In software and operations, we have long accepted that a certain amount of friction is necessary or beneficial. Very few companies would release software without doing some kind of security evaluation, and software teams frequently debate how many gates need to be included to operate safely. Anyone who has found themselves in a vibe coding loop with their role reduced to periodically saying “yes” or ânoâ to a coding tool knows how this principle could easily apply to generative AI and coding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Certain kinds of friction, such as code review, also have secondary benefits â they are a tool for vicarious learning and reducing the bus factor for parts of a system. By reviewing each others code, we are more able to safely modify and operate that code. Just as drivers lose attentiveness on over-automated roads, software teams risk losing deep system understanding if they offload too much judgment to AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Open Source is Behind&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People sometimes compare the current wave of generative AI coding tools with other shifts in how we build software. It is true that in my career, Iâve seen us move further and further away from bare metal thanks to the introduction of new tools. Higher level languages, frameworks, and tools that allow us to develop at a higher level of abstraction, such as virtualization, containers, and orchestrators. These comparisons are fair, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the previous waves were dominated by Open Source technology. Docker, Kubernetes, Linux, Xen, GCC, Ruby, Python, Rails, Numpy, JQuery, React, and countless other technologies have made software engineers more productive. They were also, however, open source and available to anyone with an internet connection. I am deeply concerned that the current wave of generative AI is highly dependent on a small set of vendors (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc). I do not know what implications that will have, but I can say that before the great mainstreaming of open source in the late nineties and early aughts, we were far worse off as an industry â accessibility was a real concern (it was harder for newcomers to the field to get started) and innovation was nowhere near as plentiful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vendor dependency concentrates control over core development infrastructure. That centralization risks slower innovation, higher pricing, and reduced accessibility - the opposite of what open source has historically delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reliance on vendors brings me to my next concern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;We Arenât Paying the Real Cost&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current landscape is a battle between loss-leaders. OpenAI is burning through billions of dollars per year and is expected to hit tens of billions in losses per year soon. Your $20 per month subscription to ChatGPT is nowhere near keeping them afloat. Anthropicâs figures are more moderate, but it is still currently lighting money on fire in order to compete and gain or protect market share.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weâve seen loss-leader strategies before, most notably with Uber, which Iâll return to later. The danger in these strategies is that dependencies are being created while the product is cheap, meaning alternatives â even open source tools, canât compete. This has the potential of creating lock-in where companies integrate these tools into their products, developers become dependent on them in their workflows, and even students learn using them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What will this mean for generative AI? I have no idea - obviously there is a chance that some breakthrough will make LLMs far cheaper to build and operate, or companies will have to start forking out a much higher price to use these tools, which could make our industry even harder to break into for people who canât afford the premium. For now, the question isnât whether this is sustainable - the companies themselves admit it isnât. The question is what happens when the subsidy phase ends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Environmental Impact&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if the markets appetite for losing billions of dollars annually continues, the use of generative AI is not at all free. LLMs require enormous compute. That compute generates heat. Cooling that heat consumes water - massive amounts of it. A recently published study in Nature Sustainability concluded that AI could have a footprint of 731-1,125 million mÂ³ of water and 24-44 Mt CO2-equivalent emissions annually from 2024 to 2030. Thatâs equivalent to 200 - 500 bottles of water per person on Earth annually. A similar study published in Patterns concludes that AI systems could produce the same amount of CO2 as the entire city of New York in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree that generative AI is exciting, but the speed with which a lot of industry leaders went from being apparently concerned with the environment to being happy emitting a NYC worth of CO2 in a year is dizzying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Marketing is Off - Not Really AI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This might be comparatively trivial, but itâs always bothered me how loose we are with the term “AI”. Artificial Intelligence has the humorous distinction of being a field that is named for what it hopes to achieve, not what it actually does. We have not yet created anything that can be called intelligent, instead we have created impressive technology that looks like thinking without being it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Noam Chomsky, Ian Roberts, and Jeffrey Watumull made this point sharply in their New York Times piece “The False Promise of ChatGPT,” characterizing these systems as statistical pattern-matchers rather than thinking machines. They note these tools are useful for tasks like computer programming, but we shouldn’t mistake that utility for understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This framing matters because it affects how we talk about these tools and what we can expect from them. Calling them “AI” rather than “LLMs” or âgenerative systemsâ inflates expectations and enables hype bubbles. Setting realistic expectations helps us figure out where these tools actually fit into our workflows and what their genuine limitations are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond terminology, there’s a more fundamental question about who benefits from this shift.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Whereâs the Wealth?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generative AI will certainly be economically disruptive. Jobs will change and in some cases, certain types of work may be eliminated. Many similar technological shifts have resulted in increased demands for certain kinds of work â meaning that overall, economic opportunity grows, but the disruption is still there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâve heard more optimistic people suggest that generative AI may lead to more leisure time for more people, without negatively impacting them economically. I disagree with this. You donât have to look very far into the history of technological shifts to see that increases in worker productivity at best increase demand for labor, and at worst result in massive disruption - they never result in the same pay for less manual work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because these technologies are vendor specific, I actually predict that generative AI will make a relatively small number of people massively wealthy, and a large number of people moderately wealthier, but I fear that an even larger number of people could be left out in the cold as certain types of work become possible without human labor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a technological shift is centralized to one or two vendors, there is a real possibility of a massive wealth transfer. Uber famously benefited from massive investor subsidies while following a loss-leader strategy. This enabled them to drive out competition, both from established players such as taxis and from future projects such as public transportation that would have belonged to the public. Once competitors were eliminated or reduced in size and Uberâs user base was established, prices were raised and consumers were left with few alternatives. During the subsidy phase of Uberâs growth, passengers paid only 41% of costs, leading to a loss of $20 Billion dollars from 2015-2019. Once the subsidy phase ended, fares increased by 65% and the rate that Uber took from drivers was increased.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The end result was that competitors were eliminated, cities became dependent on ride sharing, and users were locked into higher prices. I fear we could end up in a similar situation with generative AI where productivity is gained through use of generative AI tools, companies become dependent on those tools, prices increase once the land-grab has been established, and workers are left either paying higher premiums for AI tools, or seeing reduced compensation because of the productivity gains seen by using generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where AI Doesnât Belong&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâve focused so far on technical and economic concerns, but thereâs something that troubles me more fundamentally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generative AI is being used for a variety of non-technical tasks such as writing and creating art, including visual art and music. This disturbs me greatly. Art does not have a single purpose, and debating the purpose of art is another subject entirely, but for me, art is a way to communicate a variety of ideas and emotions across time and geography. Experiencing art as a viewer or listener provides a connection with the artist in a very real and human way. Replacing the artist with a computer, in my strong opinion, strips away something essential. Even if the consumer canât tell that the art was created by generative AI, weâve lost something real and unquantifiable in the exchange and I fear for what that means for our culture and civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;So, What Now?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The productivity gains experienced by using generative AI tools are not small, but neither are these concerns. As a professional, I am obligated to use the most effective tools that help me do my job well. I am also obligated to consider the trade-offs between doing something fast and doing something safely. Generative AI applies a thumb on this scale in a very real way, but does not completely eradicate the need for some friction. This will be something that we in the software industry figure out over the next few years. I predict a bit of a roller coaster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a human, I am concerned about my impact on the environment and our collective experiences on this planet. As I’ve mentioned, thereâs no putting the genie back in the bottle, so itâs imperative that we continue to focus research on making LLMs more environmentally sustainable and I implore those subsidizing the unrestrained growth to take a very real look at the economic realities staring at us all. I do not know what the future holds, and I would never venture to guess what impact this will all have on the environment, our collective sense of purpose, and our careers, but it is up to us all to try and make it as positive as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The challenge isnât choosing “AI or not AI” - that ship has sailed. Itâs navigating the shift thoughtfully and considering the trade offs of how and when we use it in our day to day lives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Wallace and Gromit Font&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Categories:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new typeface for Aardman’s iconic duo – meet Buttered Crumpet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was thrilled to be selected to design a custom typeface for Wallace &amp;amp; Gromit – Aardman’s most beloved and recognisable characters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The brief called for a font with a distinct tone of voice that could work seamlessly across film, print and digital, while bringing warmth and continuity to their next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Method&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We began by exploring warm, characterful styles, taking inspiration from Oswald Cooper’s original drawings for Cooper Black. We then took a creative turn, developing a softer, low-contrast design with a distinctly hand-crafted feel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each letterform was carefully shaped to feel expressive yet balanced, with serifs that resemble loaves of bread – a nod to Aardman’s tactile, playful world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Outcomes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The finished typeface – Buttered Crumpet – gives Aardman a timeless, familiar tone of voice with bundles of charm. It includes over 200 characters, covering all Western European languages, and was designed in a single, carefully crafted weight with room for future expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a Bristol-based designer, it was a joy to create a lasting connection with my home city and one of its most renowned creative studios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;I’ve loved rolling out this typeface and we’re starting to see it in action now. There have been lots of compliments.&lt;/quote&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
