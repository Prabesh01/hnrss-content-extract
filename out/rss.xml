  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;HTML-only conditional lazy loading (via preload + media)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The accepted practice is to not add lazy-loading to images above the fold, especially the LCP image, since doing so can delay their loading until the browser has determined they are definitely in the viewport. One problem though is that "above the fold" depends on screen size: an image can be above the fold on desktop and below it on mobile. With native lazy loading and static HTML (e.g., without device detection on the server side or JavaScript), you normally have to pick one behavior and get it wrong for part of your users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there's a small workaround that seems to work. Browsers won't delay the loading of an image if it's already been fetched. You can take advantage of that by conditionally preloading the image using a media query, then marking the image as lazy later. I tested it using the HTTP link header, but may also work fine with a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel="preload"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conceptually:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Link: &amp;lt;/hero.jpg&amp;gt;; rel=preload; as=image; media="(min-width: 1024px)"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img src="/hero.jpg" loading="lazy" /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Effect:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Desktop: preload fires â image loads eagerly (good for LCP)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mobile: preload ignored â image lazy-loads&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm using this in book pages and sidebar images at https://pccd.dites.cat. Example: https://pccd.dites.cat/obra/Conca-Guia_(1996)%3A_Els_primers_reculls_de_proverbis_catalans&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that layout, the cover image is above the fold on desktop but not on smaller devices â so it's eagerly loaded where Lighthouse recommends it, and lazy-loaded where it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Caveats:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Not documented or discussed anywhere (but seems to work fine in major browsers)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Requires preloading, which may not always be practical (or intended)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this gives you HTML-only, viewport-dependent lazy loading.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I dumped Windows 11 for Linux, and you should too&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;CheckMag&lt;/head&gt;With the growing number of users jumping from Windows to Linux, I decided to fully take the plunge and dive deep into the Open Source ocean. A few months and several headaches later, it has proved to be the best computer-related decision I've made in over a decade (and perhaps in my entire life).&lt;p&gt;Sam Medley 👁 Published 🇪🇸 🇵🇹 ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I run Artix, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There. That's out of the way. I recently installed Linux on my main desktop computer and work laptop, overwriting the Windows partition completely. Essentially, I deleted the primary operating system from the two computers I use the most, day in and day out, instead trusting all of my personal and work computing needs to the Open Source community. This has been a growing trend, and I hopped on the bandwagon, but for good reasons. Some of those reasons might pertain to you and convince you to finally make the jump as well. Here's my experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The crash-prone catalyst: Telemetry and unstable software&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are so many articles and YouTube videos lately regaling readers and watchers with the harrowing tales of techies switching from Windows to Linux? Anyone who has read one of those articles or watched one of those videos will know it boils down to two main issues: telemetry and poor software stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that Windows 11 harvests data like a pumpkin farmer in October, and there is no easy way (and sometimes no way at all) to stop it. The operating system itself acts exactly like what was called "spyware" a decade or so ago, pulling every piece of data it can about its current user. This data includes (but is far from limited to) hardware information, specific apps and software used, usage trends, and more. With the advent of AI, Microsoft made headlines with Copilot, an artificial assistant designed to help users by capturing their data with tools like Recall. It turns out that Copilot has largely been a flop and helps Microsoft (and data thieves) more than its users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other main reason folks uninstall Windows is due to the overall poor software experience. Windows 11 has multiple settings modules to handle the same task (such as setting up networking or adding devices), and none of them seem to talk to each other. Additionally, each new update (which will eventually be forced upon you) seems to bring more bugs than fixes. Personally, I encountered 2-3 full system crashes a week when I ran Windows 11, and my hardware is fairly decent: AMD Ryzen 7 6800H, 32 GB of RAM, and a 1 TB PCIe NVMe drive. Still, a few times a week, my computer would freeze for a few seconds, the displays would go dark, and the PC would either restart or hang indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After dealing with these issues and trying to solve them with workarounds, I dual-booted a Linux partition for a few weeks. After a Windows update (that I didn't choose to do) wiped that partition and, consequently, the Linux installation, I decided to go whole-hog: I deleted Windows 11 and used the entire drive for Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Decisions, decisions&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first question often asked of Windows refugees migrating to Linux is, "Why Linux?" It's a good question, and one that needs to be asked before dumping Windows for anything else. Personally, I tried macOS first. The experience was smooth and easy but ultimately felt restrictive (installing from third-party developers, anyone?). Additionally, the only Apple computer I have is a 2014 MacBook Air. As such, the latest version of macOS I could actually run is 11 (Big Sur), which was released in 2020. Overall system operation was quite sluggish on the older hardware, and I knew that time would inevitably take its toll on the software experience — apps would soon be out of date and I wouldn't be able to update them. I also tried the OpenCore Legacy Patcher to push the laptop to macOS 13. While performance improved, key features like iMessage and Continuity Camera were either buggy or flat out refused to work. It felt like my laptop was running in mud with its hands tied behind its back. Plus, I needed something for my desktop. Not wanting to drop a mortgage payment or two on new hardware, I opted for Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux promised me the potential of what I wanted - high hardware compatibility with full software freedom. The operating system can run on pretty much anything, and it grants users a huge amount of control over their system. I tried out a few ditributions, or distros, of Linux. A distro is like a "flavor" of Linux, and each one has unique factors (e.g., app/package management, bundled user interface). With most distros, these differences are largely irrelevant; most distros offer the same main packages as others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried Mint, a popular option for beginners, first. I started this journey with some Linux experience under my belt; I have installed Linux on Chromebooks and old laptops (which I briefly referenced in this article). Mint is considered a "just works" distro since it usually comes packaged with all the drivers and software most users would need. You can get to work within seconds of booting a fresh install without needing to fuss about in text files and the package manager. Mint was a nice experience, but it was a bit too bloated for my tastes (meaning it came with too much software preinstalled). I settled for Mint on my family's home theatre PC due to its stability and wide array of packages, and it hasn't failed us yet. For my own personal use, I wanted something a bit more "techy" and robust in terms of user features and system control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried out a few other distros, including Debian (which I ran on my work laptop and now use on the office PC at the coffee shop I own and manage), Bazzite, Fedora, and Void. These were all fine, save for Void — the XBPS repository of Void Linux was too sparse for what I needed, and driver compatibility was a big issue on my work laptop and home PC. I finally settled on Artix Linux, which is a derivative of Arch Linux. Artix has all the features and control of Arch, including the robust Arch User Repository for plenty of packages and applications. It is also a pretty lightweight distro in that it doesn't come with much out of the box. Artix differs from Arch in that it does not use SystemD as its init system. I won't go down the rabbit hole of init systems here, but suffice it to say that Artix boots lightning quick (less than 10 seconds from a cold power on) and is pretty light on system resources. However, it didn't come "fully assembled."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hurdles and hangups&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;My laptop is a 2014 MacBook Air, which is still a pretty solid machine. Unfortunately, Linux doesn't always play nice with Apple products. The biggest problem I ran into after installing Artix on the Air was the lack of wireless drivers, which meant that WiFi did not work out of the box. The resolution was simple: I needed to download the appropriate WiFi drivers (Broadcom drivers, to be exact) from Artix's main repository. This is a straightforward process handled by a single command in the Terminal, but it requires an internet connection... which my laptop did not have. Ultimately, I connected a USB-to-Ethernet adapter, plugged the laptop directly into my router, and installed the WiFi drivers that way. The whole process took about 10 minutes, but it was annoying nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the record, my desktop (an AMD Ryzen 7 6800H-based system) worked flawlessly out-of-the-box, even with my second monitor's uncommon resolution (1680x1050, vertical orientation). I did run into issues with installing some packages on both machines. Trying to install the KDE desktop environment (essentially a different GUI for the main OS) resulted in strange artifacts that put white text on white backgrounds in the menus, and every resolution I tried failed to correct this bug. After reverting to XFCE4 (the default desktop environment for my Artix install), the WiFi signal indicator in the taskbar disappeared. This led to me having to uninstall a network manager installed by KDE and re-linking the default network manager to the runit services startup folder. If that sentence sounds confusing, the process was much more so. It has been resolved, and I have a WiFi indicator that lets me select wireless networks again, but only after about 45 minutes of reading manuals and forum posts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other issues are inherent to Linux. Not all games on Steam that are deemed Linux compatible actually are. Civilization III Complete is a good example: launching the game results in the map turning completely black. (Running the game through an application called Lutris resolved this issue.) Not all the software I used on Windows is available in Linux, such as Greenshot for screenshots or uMark for watermarking photos in bulk. There are alternatives to these, but they don't have the same features or require me to relearn workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Smartphone paradise&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, smartphone management is heavenly on Artix Linux, but it didn't start that way. Android management is fairly straightforward due to how Android manages USB connections. An Android smartphone tends to be immediately recognized by Linux and act as a USB mass storage device. There's also ADB (Android Debugging Bridge) via the terminal for executing commands to an Android device. However, I use an iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, Apple products and Linux don't always play together very well. This was certainly the case with my iPhone 13 Pro Max and Artix running the XFCE4 desktop environment. My phone would only charge when plugged in but wouldn't show up. I tried installing applications like KDE Connect, which promised to offer most of the same functions available between iPhones and Mac computers. Unfortunately, it was a no-go. But I found a solution in an unlikely place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I tried installing KDE (read above), it left the Dolphin file manager on my device. I started using Dolphin and preferred it to the default file manager for XFCE4 (Thunar). Dolphin held a pleasant surprise: it could detect my iPhone when it was plugged in. This made it a snap to transfer files to and from my phone as the file manager granted full file access to the iPhone. Due to how far Apple's file management has come on iOS, there were specific folders for each of my apps. The overall process is significantly easier than it was on Windows as iTunes is no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Operating system with benefits&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why did I switch to Linux, and why am I writing this article about the experience? In a word: joy. I like using my computers again and find the experience fun. There's always something I can tweak or learn about how it operates. The fact that it runs faster than it did on Windows and is significantly more stable are huge bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are lots of other points to discuss that would make this article more long-winded than it already is, so I will be brief on a few final specifics. Installing games via Steam is as simple as it is on any other OS, though compatibility will be a bit smaller than on Windows. Still, I've been able to play all of my Steam games (with the exception of Civilization III mentioned above) without any hiccups. In some cases, gameplay is a little bit smoother due to the lack of things like anticheat software running in the background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customization is a give and take and will vary based on your chosen desktop environment or window manager. I use XFCE4, which can be customized quite a bit but requires some technical knowledge to beautify. It supports a tool called Conky, which can display system information on your desktop. It is highly customizable but uses a typescript format in a config file to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power management is a bit wonky on Linux. My MacBook Air seems to last as long as it did with macOS (it's an old laptop, so the battery has worn down), but sometimes a rogue process will keep the machine from sleeping when the lid is closed. However, the lighter nature of Artix means the laptop's fan rarely ramps up. This is true of my desktop as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transferring one's system configuration, including desktop and application settings, is as easy as transferring a single folder, so my MacBook can look exactly like my desktop (provided it has the same packages installed) with a simple drag-and-drop. The additional flexibility in choosing my computer's UI is unrivaled: if I don't like something in XFCE, I can either tweak the actual configuration file or just install a new environment (though this comes with risks, as mentioned above).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall system stability has been excellent. My computer hasn't crashed a single time, and I've never run into graphical issues rendering a black screen like I did with Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion: Linux takes time but is worth it&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux is not a "one and done" silver bullet to solve all your computer issues. It is like any other operating system in that it will require users to learn its methods and quirks. Admittedly, it does require a little bit more technical knowledge to dive into the nitty-gritty of the OS and fully unlock its potential, but many distributions (such as Mint) are ready to go out of the box and may never require someone to open a command line. Our main media PC runs Mint and my younger children (aged 4 and 5 as of this writing) are able to navigate it without issue. My older kids are able to load games on it and play with Bluetooth controllers with no issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I like a bit of a challenge, and Linux balances usability with the carrot of a deeper computing experience. Depending on the distribution, I could have been up and running immediately after installation, but I wanted something more. The beauty of Linux is its flexibility; you can use a distribution that is as challenging or straightforward as you like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installing Linux not only saved three machines in my house (my laptop, desktop, and our media PC); it resurrected the joy of using a computer. It has been frustrating at times, but the rush of finally fixing a problem after a bit of work is unlike anything I felt on Windows. When I fix a problem on Windows, it's more of a shrug of the shoulder and relief that I'll no longer feel like I'm being stabbed in the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that's because the issues I ran into on Linux were, for the most part, my fault. On Windows or macOS, most problems I run into are caused by a restriction or bug in the OS. Linux gives me the freedom to break my machine and fix it again, teaching me along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Microsoft's refusal (either from pride or ignorance) to improve (or at least not crapify) Windows 11 despite loud user outrage, switching to Linux is becoming a popular option. It's one you should consider doing, and if you've been thinking about it for any length of time, it's time to dive in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Source(s)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Medley - Notebookcheck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teaser image source: ChatGPT Image 1.5; Anastase Maragos on Unsplash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt; 2025 in retrospect &amp;amp; happy new year 2026! &lt;lb/&gt; Jan 5, 2026 &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happy New Year 2026! Once again, a lot has happened in Gentoo over the past months. New developers, more binary packages, GnuPG alternatives support, Gentoo for WSL, improved Rust bootstrap, better NGINX packaging, â¦ As always here weâre going to revisit all the exciting news from our favourite Linux distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Gentoo in numbers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gentoo currently consists of 31663 ebuilds for 19174 different packages. For amd64 (x86-64), there are 89 GBytes of binary packages available on the mirrors. Gentoo each week builds 154 distinct installation stages for different processor architectures and system configurations, with an overwhelming part of these fully up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The number of commits to the main ::gentoo repository has remained at an overall high level in 2025, with a slight decrease from 123942 to 112927. The number of commits by external contributors was 9396, now across 377 unique external authors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GURU, our user-curated repository with a trusted user model, as entry point for potential developers, has shown a decrease in activity. We have had 5813 commits in 2025, compared to 7517 in 2024. The number of contributors to GURU has increased, from 241 in 2024 to 264 in 2025. Please join us there and help packaging the latest and greatest software. Thatâs the ideal preparation for becoming a Gentoo developer!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Activity has slowed down somewhat on the Gentoo bugtracker bugs.gentoo.org, where weâve had 20763 bug reports created in 2025, compared to 26123 in 2024. The number of resolved bugs shows the same trend, with 22395 in 2025 compared to 25946 in 2024. The current values are closer to those of 2023 - but clearly this year we fixed more than we broke!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;New developers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2025 we have gained four new Gentoo developers. They are in chronological order:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jay Faulkner (jayf): Jay joined us in March from Washington, USA. In Gentoo and open source in general, heâs very much involved with OpenStack; further, heâs a a big sports fan, mainly ice hockey and NASCAR racing, and already long time Gentoo enthusiast.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Michael Mair-Keimberger (mm1ke): Michael joined us finally in June from Austria, after already amassing over 9000 commits beforehand. Michael works as Network Security Engineer for a big System House in Austria and likes to go jogging regulary and hike the mountains on weekends. In Gentoo, heâs active in quality control and cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Alexander Puck Neuwirth (apn-pucky): Alexander, a physics postdoc, joined us in July from Italy. At the intersection of Computer Science, Linux, and high-energy physics, he already uses Gentoo to manage his code and sees it as a great development environment. Beyond sci-physics, heâs also interested in continuous integration and RISC-V.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jaco Kroon (jkroon): Jaco signed up as developer in October from South Africa. He is a system administrator who works for a company that runs and hosts multiple Gentoo installations, and has been around in Gentoo since 2003! Among our packages, Asterisk is one example of his interests.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Featured changes and news&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Letâs now look at the major improvements and news of 2025 in Gentoo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Distribution-wide Initiatives&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Goodbye Github, welcome Codeberg: Mostly because of the continuous attempts to force Copilot usage for our repositories, Gentoo currently considers and plans the migration of our repository mirrors and pull request contributions to Codeberg. Codeberg is a site based on Forgejo, maintained by a non-profit organization, and located in Berlin, Germany. Gentoo continues to host its own primary git, bugs, etc infrastructure and has no plans to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;EAPI 9: The wording for EAPI 9, a new version of the specifications for our ebuilds, has been finalized and approved, and support in Portage is complete. New features in EAPI 9 include pipestatus for better error handling, an edo function for printing a command and executing it, a cleaner environment for the build processes, and the possibility of declaring a default EAPI for the profile directory tree.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Event presence: At FOSDEM 2025 in Brussels, Gentoo has been present once more with a stand, this year together with Flatcar Container Linux (which is based on Gentoo). Naturally we had mugs, stickers, t-shirts, and of course the famous self-compiled buttonsâ¦ Further, we have been present at FrOSCon 2025 in Sankt Augustin with workshops Gentoo installation and configuration and Writing your own ebuilds. Last but not least, the toolchain team has represented Gentoo at the GNU Tools Cauldron 2025 in Porto.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;SPI migration: The migration of our financial structure to Software in the Public Interest (SPI) is continuing slowly but steadily, with expense payments following the moving intake. If you are donating to Gentoo, and especially if you are a recurrent donor, please change your payments to be directed to SPI; see also our donation web page.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Online workshops: Our German support, Gentoo e.V., is grateful to the speakers and participants of four online workshops in 2025 in German and English, on topics as varied as EAPI 9 or GnuPG and LibrePGP. We are looking forward to more exciting events in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Architectures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;RISC-V bootable QCOW2: Same as for amd64 and arm64, also for RISC-V we now have ready-made bootable disk images in QCOW2 format available for download on our mirrors in a console and a cloud-init variant. The disk images use the rv64gc instruction set and the lp64d ABI, and can be booted via the standard RISC-V UEFI support.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gentoo for WSL: We now publish weekly Gentoo images for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), based on the amd64 stages, see our mirrors. While these images are not present in the Microsoft store yet, thatâs something we intend to fix soon.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;hppa and sparc destabilized: Since we do not have hardware readily available anymore and these architectures mostly fill a retrocomputing niche, stable keywords have been dropped for both hppa (PA-RISC) and sparc. The architectures will remain supported with testing keywords.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;musl with locales: Localization support via the package sys-apps/musl-locales has been added by default to the Gentoo stages based on the lightweight musl C library.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Packages&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;GPG alternatives: Given the unfortunate fracturing of the GnuPG / OpenPGP / LibrePGP ecosystem due to competing standards, we now provide an alternatives mechanism to choose the system gpg provider and ease compatibility testing. At the moment, the original, unmodified GnuPG, the FreePG fork/patchset as also used in many other Linux distributions (Fedora, Debian, Arch, â¦), and the re-implementation Sequoia-PGP with Chameleon are available. In practice, implementation details vary between the providers, and while GnuPG and FreePG are fully supported, you may still encounter difficulties when selecting Sequoia-PGP/Chameleon.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;zlib-ng support: We have introduced initial support for using zlib-ng and minizip-ng in compatibility mode in place of the reference zlib libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;System-wide jobserver: We have created steve, an implementation of a token-accounting system-wide jobserver, and introduced experimental global jobserver support in Portage. Thanks to that, it is now possible to globally control the concurrently running build job count, correctly accounting for parallel emerge jobs, make and ninja jobs, and other clients supporting the jobserver protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;NGINX rework: The packaging of the NGINX web server and reverse proxy in Gentoo has undergone a major improvement, including also the splitting off of several third-party modules into separate packages.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;C++ based Rust bootstrap: We have added a bootstrap path for Rust from C++ using Mutabahâs Rust compiler mrustc, which alleviates the need for pre-built binaries and makes it significantly easier to support more configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ada and D bootstrap: Similarly, Ada and D support in gcc now have clean bootstrap paths, which makes enabling these in the compiler as easy as switching the useflags on gcc and running emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;FlexiBLAS: Gentoo has adopted the new FlexiBLAS wrapper library as the primary way of switching implementations of the BLAS numerical algorithm library at runtime. This automatically also provides ABI stability for linking programs and bundles the specific treatment of different BLAS variants in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Python: In the meantime the default Python version in Gentoo has reached Python 3.13. Additionally we have also Python 3.14 available stable - fully up to date with upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;KDE upgrades: As of end of 2025, in Gentoo stable we have KDE Gear 25.08.3, KDE Frameworks 6.20.0, and KDE Plasma 6.5.4. As always, Gentoo testing follows the newest upstream releases (and using the KDE overlay you can even install from git sources).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Physical and Software Infrastructure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Additional build server: A second dedicated build server, hosted at Hetzner Germany, has been added to speed up the generation of installation stages, iso and qcow2 images, and binary packages.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Documentation: Documentation work has made constant progress on wiki.gentoo.org. The Gentoo Handbook had some particularly useful updates, and the documentation received lots of improvements and additions from the many active volunteers. There are currently 9,647 pages on the wiki, and there have been 766,731 edits since the project started. Please help Gentoo by contributing to documentation!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Finances of the Gentoo Foundation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Income: The Gentoo Foundation took in $12,066 in fiscal year 2025 (ending 2025/06/30); the dominant part (over 80%) consists of individual cash donations from the community. On the SPI side, we received $8,471 in the same period as fiscal year 2025; also here, this is all from small individual cash donations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expenses: Our expenses in 2025 were, program services (e.g. hosting costs) $8,332, management &amp;amp; general (accounting) $1,724, fundraising $905, and non-operating (depreciation expenses) $10,075.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Balance: We have $104,831 in the bank as of July 1, 2025 (which is when our fiscal year 2026 starts for accounting purposes). The Gentoo Foundation FY2025 financial statement is available on the Gentoo Wiki.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transition to SPI: The Foundation encourages donors to ensure their ongoing contributions are going to SPI - more than 40 donors had not responded to requests to move the recurring donations by the end of the year. Expenses will be moved to the SPI structure as ongoing income permits.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thank you!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As every year, we would like to thank all Gentoo developers and all who have submitted contributions for their relentless everyday Gentoo work. If you are interested and would like to help, please join us to make Gentoo even better! As a volunteer project, Gentoo could not exist without its community.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A full port of the BasiliskII Macintosh 68k emulator to the ESP32-P4 microcontroller, running on the M5Stack Tab5 hardware. This project brings classic Mac OS (System 7.x through Mac OS 8.1) to a portable embedded device with touchscreen input and USB peripheral support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project runs a Motorola 68040 emulator that can boot real Macintosh ROMs and run genuine classic Mac OS software. The emulation includes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CPU: Motorola 68040 emulation with FPU (68881)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RAM: Configurable from 4MB to 16MB (allocated from ESP32-P4's 32MB PSRAM)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Display: 640×360 virtual display (2× scaled to 1280×720 physical display)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Storage: Hard disk and CD-ROM images loaded from SD card&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Input: Capacitive touchscreen (as mouse) + USB keyboard/mouse support&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Tab5 features a unique dual-chip architecture that makes it ideal for this project:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;400MHz dual-core RISC-V, 32MB PSRAM, MIPI-DSI display&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ESP32-C6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Wireless Co-processor&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;WiFi 6, Bluetooth LE 5.0 (not used by emulator)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Touch&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Capacitive multi-touch (ST7123 controller)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Memory&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;32MB PSRAM for emulated Mac RAM + frame buffers&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Storage&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;microSD card slot for ROM, disk images, and settings&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;USB&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Type-A host port for keyboard/mouse, Type-C for programming&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Battery&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;NP-F550 Li-ion (2000mAh) for portable operation&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See boardConfig.md for detailed pin mappings and hardware documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The emulator leverages the ESP32-P4's dual-core RISC-V architecture for optimal performance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The video system uses an optimized pipeline for converting the Mac's 8-bit indexed framebuffer to the display:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;68040 CPU writes to emulated Mac framebuffer (640×360, 8-bit indexed)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Video Task (Core 0) reads framebuffer at ~15 FPS&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Palette Lookup converts 8-bit indices to RGB565&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2×2 Scaling doubles pixels horizontally and vertically&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DMA Transfer pushes 1280×720 RGB565 buffer to MIPI-DSI display&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This port includes the following BasiliskII subsystems, adapted for ESP32:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A small but heartfelt demo celebrating the 50th birthday of the legendary MOS KIM-1 🖥️✨&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The KIM-1 first became available in January 1976 —&lt;lb/&gt; three months before the Apple I 🍎 and one month after its sibling, the TIM.&lt;lb/&gt; An incredible milestone in early microcomputer history!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this demo, I’ve gathered and connected a few components that were scattered across my repositories 🧩.&lt;lb/&gt; The goal is not just to look back, but to celebrate, experiment, and build together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I warmly invite fellow retro-computing enthusiasts and comrades-in-arms 🤝&lt;lb/&gt; to jump in, contribute ideas, add modules, demos, or improvements, and help this project grow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s keep the spirit of early computing alive 🚀&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;🎉 HAPPY BIRTHDAY, KIM-1! 🎉&lt;lb/&gt; Wishing you — and all of us — a fantastic and hacky Year 2026 🥳✨&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Things that are very useful in this code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take any coordinates in HEX out of the memory and use them to place your cursor. The problem is, that to position your cursur, you need to send the x/y coordinates as single chars to the terminal program, like (ESC)[xx;yyH - Imagine just having hex data, i.e. $20 (32 dec) and you need to send a 3 and a 2 separated to your terminal... This routine will do it - seperate the tens from the ones. Now you can like draw a rectangle, a circle or whatever. You can start a painting program if you like.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;China applies to put 200,000 satellites in space after calling Starlink a crash risk&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;US Federal Communications Commission says it approved SpaceX to launch 7,500 second-generation Starlink satellites&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A dozen or so submissions from various Chinese satellite players were filed with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) at the end of last month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The biggest projects – CTC-1 and CTC-2 – were for 96,714 satellites each and filed by the newly established Institute of Radio Spectrum Utilisation and Technological Innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The institute was registered in China’s northern Hebei province on December 30, the day after it submitted its ITU filings, according to the Radio Association of China.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and China have been racing to launch internet satellite megaconstellations in recent years, with the US-based SpaceX taking a big lead with its Starlink constellation, which accounts for most of the satellites in low Earth orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But radio frequency bands and orbital slots in low Earth orbit are limited, and first movers for those resources can gain priority.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Friday, the US Federal Communications Commission announced it had given SpaceX the green light to launch a further 7,500 second-generation Starlink satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those satellites must be in orbit by the end of 2031 and would bring SpaceX’s total to 15,000 satellites. Starlink has applied to the FCC to launch 30,000 satellites but a decision has been deferred on the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a subscription-based short-form video site called NICKEL[1]. I felt gross about using YouTube but wanted to share my gaming clips, so I made my own thing. Then I thought about making it sustainable so here we are. I'll have an update to the mailing list out in a few hours, I'm "building in public."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My feature-complete deadline is April 15th and I think I'll make it. If you want to check out the UI, visit the explore[2] page. I have it setup to redirect to a public video while I work on the intended UI (a design challenge I've never tried before but we've all seen). I'm thoroughly enjoying figuring out how streaming video works and how best to optimize things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spent about 2 years improving printing and scanning stack of Linux: CUPS, SANE, AirSane, as well as some legacy drivers, and also x86 proprietary driver emulation on ARM with Box86.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even that "modern" printing stack in Linux is 20+ years old, there's still such an unbelievable amount of basic bugs and low-hanging-fruit optimizations, that it's kinda sad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not to mention that it still maintains ALL its legacy compatibility, as in supporting ≈5 different driver architectures, 4 user-selectable rasterizers (each with its own bugs and quirks).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole printing stack is supported by 4 people, 2 of whom are doing that since the inception of CUPS in 1999. Scanning is maintained by a single person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ubuntu 26.04 LTS is expected to be the last version with CUPS v2. CUPS v3 drops current printer driver architecture and introduces proper modern driverless printing with the wrapper for older drivers. Many open-source drivers are already use this wrapper, but expect a huge disarrangement from the users, as none of the proprietary drivers would work out of the box anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great initiative. I wonder, how likely is it for a complete beginner to break their own printer or scanner by making a mistake in driver implementation? Or is it possible to work on hardware support without having a physical device? I assume it is impossible to test each and every one printer and scanner, so there is probably some clever tricks there, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on https://cloudventory.io – AWS inventory search for teams that don't have the budget for high-end cloud management platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cross-account, cross-region search. Need to find an IP? Easy peasy. Need to find all the cruft Todd left behind? Search "todd" and see every todd-test-server-1 and todd-alb hanging around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've added insights for security, ops, and cost savings – minimal right now but expanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A system-agnostic language for magic spells with a compiler capable of producing the magic wand movements, incantation, hand signs or magic circle required to perform the spell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the holidays I was building a wooden birdhouse with a Unifi Protect camera and a small web interface that automatically identifies the birds and shows me a simple overview over which type of bird visited how many times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks, it's named after a similar commercial project called Birdbuddy but I didn't want to pay for a subscription and potentially have some e-waste on my hands in a few years. I also wanted to have it integrated in my existing Unifi setup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah yet another glorious yak shave... "Hacker refuses to pay for coercive subscription service which isn't even compatible with the home setup, and spends inordinate time and resources making the thing themselves.".&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I've always had a bunch of small side projects that I want to do that aren't worth the overhead required to actually put them together &amp;amp; keep them maintained. So, I built a small Lua-based FaaS platform to make each individual project less work whenever inspiration strikes. So far I've built:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for sharing! I signed up and tried it for something simple (storing a message via POST and displaying it in HTML via GET) and it was delightfully easy &amp;amp; approachable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great to hear! And thanks for saying so. I've definitely tried to make it as simple and straight forward as possible, but I really didn't know if it would be simple and straight forward to anyone but me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; My meta side project for building other side projects&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looks cool, congrats on putting it out there as priced service!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, same!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except, it's just a repo organisation system (structure, conventions, and tools) that lets me share common "parts" across multiple "projects". No monolithic frameworks here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Libraries are functions. Apps are objects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, normally, we use these as distinct artefacts, eventually leading to the "diamond dependency" problem (and lots of other annoying development-time stuff caused by libs / code that is "over there" (elsewhere)).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My "meta side project" solves, essentially the Expression Problem as it manifests in source code management (particularly, cross library / service / project feature development).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is great. One thing that is not immediately obvious to me is what kind of authentication it supports. Needing to authenticate the caller is the #1 piece of boilerplate that gets in the way of me completing mini-projects. It’s not hard, but it’s definitely a nonzero amount of effort. And this is coming from someone who has implemented many, many auth flows professionally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It doesn't say because there's no special support for any auth protocols. Long-term I want to have out-of-the-box support for things like OAuth (for user-facing auth) or mutual TLS (for device/service auth). _Technically_ there's currently support for the cryptographic primitives required to do JWT (I added that because I wanted to support WebPush w/ payloads for myself), but those aren't documented because I intend to remove the current slightly-hacky custom APIs and replace them with some off the shelf libraries, but I'm still figuring out user-added libraries (and on top of that I'll also need to figure out support for native libraries).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are there any auth protocols / flows you think would be important to support?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Are there any auth protocols / flows you think would be important to support?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- I think API key passed via basic HTTP auth would get you pretty far. This is ideal for serving machine-machine requests and just requires that both parties can securely store the secret.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- OIDC is great for interactions that happen in the browser or if the function is serving multiple users, but is more complicated to setup and/or use correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenID connect is probably the best for contexts where you want something served by multiple users and those users are humans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; _Technically_ there's currently support for the cryptographic primitives required to do JWT (I added that because I wanted to support WebPush w/ payloads for myself)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is probably a good intermediate solution FWIW - expose signature verification and HMAC APIs and allow a user to bring in their own implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know the homepage needs way more answer to "WTH is it?", I just don't really enjoy doing the 'marketing' side of things. I hadn't really considered just throwing something informal up there, but I guess I don't really know _why_, so, thanks for the suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An alternative front-end / game discovery service / price tracker for GOG's catalog. Mostly manually enhancing the data from the API (90% heuristics, 10% human effort, as the total dataset isn't large enough for it to be worth doing otherwise), and offering a wider range of filters for it all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm grouping all related products together for a more complete overview, and have recently added library import, where I mostly 'solved' the issue of GOG not recognizing that you own certain games if you got them as a freebie or as part of a since-delisted deluxe edition. Just now starting in on incomplete "series" listings, seeing what'd be involved with making them contain all relevant games, and then exposing that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Script to auto-rename screenshots with Claude Code&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm sure there are a ton of other projects out there that do this, but I couldn't find one that fit my needs exactly, so I threw this together in a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;claude-image-renamer uses Claude Code CLI to analyze screenshots and rename them to something actually usable. It combines OCR text extraction with Claude's vision capabilities, so instead of "Screenshot 2025-12-29 at 10.03.10 PM.png" you get something like "vscode_python_debug_settings.png".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few things it does:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Handles those annoying macOS screenshot filenames with weird Unicode characters Uses OCR to give Claude more context for better naming Keeps filenames clean (lowercase, underscores, max 64 chars) Handles naming conflicts automatically&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're on macOS, you can also set this up as a Folder Action so screenshots get renamed automatically when they are saved to a folder, typically ~/Desktop. This is useful if you take a lot of screenshots and hate digging through "Screenshot 2025-12..." files later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bet you are running some personal server or tinkering VM. Why not use a dedicated, coherent tool like Immich to manage all your image organisation needs? I don't see how this renaming would help me in any way, to make use of old screenshots left in random places.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built a browser plugin called "Visionary" that overlays meaningful descriptions and context directly onto stunning pictures of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I noticed that existing picture-of-the-day plugins were built over two decades ago and never evolved to harness the capabilities of modern artificial intelligence. AI can transform the picture viewing experience by distilling complex descriptions into accessible insights and providing references to explore the core concepts in the photo more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After years of wondering what the post-UNIX paradigm of computing could look like, these past few months I've been prototyping a software platform built around capabilities and message passing, targeting Linux and bare-metal RISC-V. The big ideas I'm pursuing is a stackless design running on a flat address space with lightweight processes to minimize message-passing latency, and all the benefits of capabilities so every process is sandboxed and has only access to capabilities they have been explicitly passed via message passing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've also built a RISC-V emulator to integrate with this platform, so eventually it'll be able to run native binaries written in any language, completely sandboxed, completely built around message-passing. Basically a native, low-level BEAM-like platform to build an entire operating system and user-space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While my day job is writing boring applications, this is the stuff that keeps me awake at night, and I would love so much to talk and write more about this, about the trial-and-errors I'm facing, but it's still so much in flux every week I'm exploring a new approach. Most of my work has been around the stackless scheduler, and I have a plan to achieve preemption for long-running or misbehaved tasks without having to compromise on memory usage (i.e. without giving each process its own stack and allocate memory for context switching).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually I'd like to layer on top either Cap'n Proto or another high-performance serialisation system to create a distributed, introspectable environment of object-capabilities that are sending typed messages between each other, achieving the ultimate goal of creating an unholy hybrid between Smalltalk and the Erlang VM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;God, how I wish I was paid to work on this type of problems :-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this sounds close to your area of interests, please send me an email and I’d love to chat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Was really impressed with Claude ability to port models from cuda PyTorch to MLX, so that’s what I have been doing last three weeks; basically I have Mac to test ported models and Gradient vm with PyTorch and Nvidia gpu, Claude can run code in vm, investigate layers and deep analyze the model mechanics and then reimplement them on local Mac with MLX. So far completed port of various models mainly in audio domain, achieving pretty substantial speeds for inference on my machine. Models ported with numerical parity to originals: facebooks omnillingual ASR, Sam-audio, Nvidia sortformer. Planning on releasing this in repo soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building MatGoat (https://matgoat.com) - management software for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and other martial arts' academies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I train BJJ and kept hearing the same complaints from academy owners regarding attendance tracking, comms, missing payments, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I'm building a tool for student tracking with belts progression, automated payments, attendance-based promotion criteria, and a tablet check-in system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Focusing on Spanish-speaking markets first since it's completely underserved. Currently onboarding early academies, and will market it in the US/UK soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a couple of years now, I’ve wanted to build a service that lets you subscribe to new version notifications for any kind of software—desktop apps, drivers, packages, and more. As a Unity developer and consultant myself, I’ve always wanted to know the moment a new version becomes available. I value being at the bleeding edge, especially since a large part of the value I bring as a consultant comes from both the breadth and depth of my knowledge of the Unity engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m currently working on a niche version of the broader VersionAlert idea specifically for Unity, which is why the domain currently redirects to https://versionalert.com/unity .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only other service I’ve found that really addresses this need is https://newreleases.io . I actually spoke with the very nice husband-and-wife team behind it and even offered to buy the whole project, but their asking price was about 10× higher than what I was offering—which I understand, no hard feelings. I still wish them the best of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anyone is aware of other projects or services in this space, I'd be happy to learn about them and chat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A friend and I noticed recently that the last remaining pieces of the puzzle for a full line of "trustworthy technology" have recently dropped into our laps while we weren't looking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are those? You know… open, freedom, and privacy respecting technology. Recent products are the Starlite tablet, Furilabs and Fairphone. We've been waiting for these products, well over fifteen years since the introduction of the iPhone and iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite posting many times, we haven't been able to start a discussion here. Maybe we don't know the right key words, or posted too late in the day, not sure. But I know someone is interested in the subject because there have been three huge discussions this week about how "Linux is good enough now."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That has been true for a decade in my experience, but no one seems to be talking about the new mobile hardware available. I hope to work on bringing these efforts together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m genetically engineering yeasts to make subtly flavored breads. I’ve already done grape aroma, now working on wintergreen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also working on a red chamomile (using beat red biosynthesis). Just for fun. Red chamomile tea!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is to have niche invite-only genetically engineered flavors that I can bring to parties around SF :) what’s more special than a genetically engineered organism that you can ONLY get if I’m there? Good calling card&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is so cool. Also, it sounds like a cheeky plot to a zombie apocalypse or global contagion movie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How subtle are the flavors? Unsubtle enough that an oblivious taster might ask, "Does this bread taste like grapes to anyone else here?" Or does one need guidance to search for the flavor?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I really need to do a write-up. I kinda just whip up the easiest path and do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example for the grape, I needed to knock out some tryptophan synthesis genes so I could redirect the bioflux. Problem is that in bakers yeast they have a whole buncha copies of their chromosomes, so I had to knock out one of the genes and replace it with a different gene from grapes. Did that with a quick lil CRISPR switch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Had to electroporate tho because the transformation rates on wild/bakers/non-lab yeast are so garbage&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How much expensive lab equipment do you need to do something like this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"A quick lil CRISPR switch" sounds like "oh just my homemade fusion reactor hooked up to my kitchen warp drive" to me, yet you make it sound so simple!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on WordPecker, trying to create something like a personalized Duolingo but for vocabulary you actually encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Started when I was struggling to read books in English. Pushed an open source version back then (https://github.com/baturyilmaz/wordpecker-app), later added more features, and now working on a mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My end goal is to build: an AI language learning companion that knows what you read, listen, and watch, knows you as a friend (real life, who you are), then helps you improve using that context. If you're B1 at language, it creates a personalized path to get you to B2, then C1, and so forth using your context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of my enterprise customers face the microservice hairball problem. Adoption of microservices has been "too succesful". There may be 200-400 microservices, and ownership may be lacking. The number is typically growing fast, because it is easier to create a new one than use an existing one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I started to work on a side project called "Arch Ascent" for addressing these situations. It seems like it is becoming a kind of a architectural governance tool for visualizing and validating software system dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Dependency Graph — Syncs projects from SonarQube and visualizes component dependencies using Cytoscape.js, with graph algorithms for detecting cycles (SCCs), clustering (Louvain), and computing coupling metrics&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Visions — Workspaces for exploring architectural scenarios. Each vision can have multiple versions/variations with different layouts while sharing the same definitions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Layers — Named groupings of components (e.g., "Domain Layer", "Team Ownership", "GitLab Groups") that can be visualized as colored regions on the canvas&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- References — Named sets of components defined via Tag expressions, layer membership etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Statements — Architectural intent constraints that can be evaluated against the actual dependency graph, such as existence, containment, exclusion, cardinality etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The plan is to also incorporate Grounds, which are Intermediate stable states on the path from the current situation (ground zero) toward a vision. Each ground represents a releasable milestone that moves the architecture closer to the target vision without necessarily fulfilling all its statements. Grounds enable incremental architectural evolution with well-defined checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stack: Django, HTMX, Cytoscape.js, pyparsing for natural language parsing of References and Statements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on Entangle https://entangle.cloud a way to add AI powered chatbot to a website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I looking mainly for European market that is willing to self host your content or the model on your own servers, we will provide the technical support in doing so that and easily plugin the AI powered search or chatbot to the website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it is also possible to use servers provided by us to host the content and the LLM models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doors - A first person, exploration game/experience that I built from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doors lets you explore URL addressable 3D rooms that link together seamlessly via portals. The idea is that people would upload rooms to the internet (to github, S3, whatever) and connect them together to form one giant inter-connected space that would be a real trip to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now rooms consistent of a: - Manifest JSON file that points to requisite resources and configures portals - An optional skybox - An optional background music track - A .vox file containing voxel terrain data&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Portals can be arbitrarily sized and everything is prefetched/loaded seamlessly in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm nearly done - I just need to add in a very lightweight interface and give the code a bit of a spit shine (I will open source it - so I want it to look pretty)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EDIT: As an aside, I finally decided to give this whole Claude Code thing a go - I purchased a max subscription and I'm trying to write as little code as possible. I certainly wouldn't call what I'm doing "vibe-coding". I discuss a feature in plan mode (incl. how I want to implement it in high level terms) iterate on the plan 2-3 times until I'm satisfied and then let it rip. I'm both very impressed and quite frightened by the productivity boost...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not a developer by trade but I’ve been learning iOS dev for about 6 years now. It’s become my project that I just keep working at since I personally use it a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app lets you save your favorite locations, add notes to them, add photos, check weather, tag them for better organization, and archive those tags for future trips. You can also mark off locations that you’ve been to already: think breweries or a coffee shop when visiting a new city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the next update, I’m working on a task list functionality for each location. The idea came as a shopping list based on which stores I go to but it can work for any other context as well. This way I can get rid of my shopping list from my task apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of weather, I’m also adding historical averages to the forecast to have some sort of context to the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also leaning more into marketing these days (hence this post) and designing a new icon with some custom art work to give the product some sort of personality. I started learning affinity design to just do it myself so I learn some design software along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyways, if you download it, I’d love to hear some feedback. :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a "simple" (started out that way at least) ETL app for the public library system that I work for; the target output is SQLite databases where Datasette will be the platform to interact with the data being generated/extracted. Primarily, the goal is to provide a simple report tool for staff and give me a source for nightly snapshot outputs to a datalake in parquet format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the last time I posted on HN it's gained a decent amount of traffic and users. I'm particularly happy with the jobs section, which is growing into a high signal-noise source for European tech jobs: https://techposts.eu/jobs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason I started this website is because so much incredible innovation and growth in Europe flies under the radar. If you ask Americans many will say it's just "banks and museums", stagnant, or worse. But the reality is there is a huge spectrum of exciting companies starting and growing here. We have space launch companies, battery companies, AI companies, and a whole bunch of other interesting stuff. It's an exciting time to be a European in tech!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Ask TechPosts.eu: Is there an EU Cloudflare alternative? I'm interested in CDN, DDoS mitigation and basic web security." Links to https://techposts.eu/post/153&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been experimenting with using LLMs for a content recommender system. Specifically I've built a news reader app that fetches news articles from multiple RSS feeds, uses an LLM to first deduplicate and then score them. The user can then rate the articles and those ratings are used as few-shot examples in the LLM scoring prompt. Any resulting low score articles (uninteresting to the user) are hidden by default and visible ones scaled by their score on a dynamic CSS grid like on a traditional newspaper front page. Looking good so far, but still testing and tweaking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ive been working on something similar, have you had any issues with the LLM not giving you back a full response for all the input? Ive been using Chat gpt but even on the same request sometimes id give it 20 things to rank, and Id just get back 3 results&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing I’ve always disliked about RSS (and this could actually fix it) is duplicates. When a new LLM model drops for example there are like ~5 blogs about it in my RSS feed saying basically the same thing, and I really only need to read one. Maybe you could collapse similar articles by topic?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, would be nice to let users provide a list of feed URLs as a variable instead of hardcoding them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the console messages with the LLM reasoning, it does seem to work quite nicely for deduplication. Your example is probably even a lot easier than news articles, where you can have many articles from different viewpoints about the same event.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't actually plan to run this as a service so there's some things hard-coded and the setup is a bit difficult as you need an API key and a proxy. Currently it's just experimentation, although if it works well, I'll probably use it personally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Built my own Spotify recommendation egnine after getting tired of Spotify’s repetitive recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You get to choose the genres you're interested in, and it creates playlists from the music in your library. They get updated every day - think a better, curated by you version of the Daily Mixes. You can add some advanced filters as well, if you really want to customise what music you'll get.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It works best if you follow a good amount of artists. Optionally you can get recommendations from artists that belong to playlists you follow or you've created - if you don't follow much or any artists, then you should enable that in order for the service to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on https://fullremote.it, which started as a side project and is now turning into a real business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's an "italian-oriented" curated remote-jobs and remote-work community, currently ~10k subscribers across newsletter and Telegram. What began as "let's share good remote roles" is evolving into paid job postings, sponsorships, and coaching for companies and devs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;meta-analysis, make Claude write a blog post, connecting and deriving set of concepts across a range of books, articles, papers, etc. Basically a syntopic reading machine. Its a meaty side project (and expensive), but I am curious how close I can push this. My current approach relies on a tool that I have built recently [0], it's an agentic memory but I am using a new memory model that is based on Zettelkasten principles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is really cool about it is that it natively capture connections between atomic ideas and evolve them. Which I believe it gets me one step closer to syntopic reading machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on https://chessnawk.vercel.app/ – a set of auto-grading tasks for middle school students learning programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comes with Robot, Turtle, HTML/CSS (pixel diff tasks) and a gradual introduction into programming concepts. Currently on JS, literally right now GPT-5.2 helps me adding Python.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've integrated a simplified clone of Replicube. I hope to integrate ideas from Human Resource Machine and Turing Complete later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bear heritage of Eastern Bloc-typa math/programming olympiads, combined with front-end/product skills. So I kinda owe to ship this thing to community of fellow secondary school CS teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, nothing comes closer in terms of depth and usability in the classroom for ordinary 12yo kids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I test this thing 5 times a week in my classroom and I constantly polish it at night. 100% vibe-coding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks! Is it that you can't see the graph view at all? It uses DeckGL which might be a bit too fancy and may not work on all browsers possibly. It works on Chrome/Safari on my iPhone and Chrome on Arch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't realize that you actually could provide a working link back to Hacker News but it seems HN does support that. Thanks, I will give that a try!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh ok. Yeah, it is just not really complete yet. What this does is displays a UMAP of the embeddings for the selected feature and you can mouse over for labels. It isn't identifying clusters itself yet, finding exemplars, etc. Right now, points that are close to each other are just semantically close - as judged by UMAP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know how Spotify (or any other service) will just silently remove tracks from your playlist because they lost the rights? No notification, a beloved song just disappeared from your life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a webapp to keep track of your playlists and notify you when a song disappears&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support for Youtube playlists please... having to lookup the watch ID on Google after a song is removed to guess what the track was is a highly sucky part of using Youtube for music.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A specialized programming language for 3D geometry generation + manipulation called Geoscript as well as a Shadertoy-inspired web app for building stuff with it: https://3d.ameo.design/geotoy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There have been lots of cool technical challenges through the whole process of building this, and a very nice variety of different kinds of work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working towards using the outputs from this language to build out levels and assets for a browser-based game I've been dabbling with over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building a Java stack for the x402 protocol. I believe today’s payment systems are unnecessarily broken and overly complex. I really like the idea of a protocol that could simplify this space while remaining truly open and not “owned” by anyone—meaning anyone can use it without needing authorization from the protocol’s creator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just came across x402 recently and am excited to build upon it. My current project[1] will have a tipping feature and it'd be neat to give people the option to not use fiat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CodjiFlo[1,2] - a code review tool inspired by Microsoft's CodeFlow, used by ~40,000 developers. It is especially tailored to power users of pull requests to improve contextual understanding and ease of code review and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on a small iOS app for streaming my own media directly from a NAS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built it because I wanted access to my music (and videos) on my phone without running a full media server like Plex or Jellyfin, and without syncing files locally. The app streams files directly over a VPN (WireGuard / Tailscale), mainly via SFTP/FTP, and plays them as-is without re-encoding or server-side indexing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can browse folders directly, or let it build a lightweight local index for faster artist/album browsing on larger libraries. It started as a personal tool, but I’ve been polishing it after some feedback and opened a small TestFlight beta:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not as impressive, but - making my website weirder. Not a frontend dev at work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Top of my ideas now: add "ask your LLM" buttons to my email submission form that opens ChatGPT/Perp/Claude and auto-fills a query asking it why you should be friends with me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sample links (I hope it says nice things about me!):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;buddy, don't be so modest, this is an ambitious project and I hope you succeed ! This is tough work, I tried to build a Webflow-ish editor myself and it nearly destroyed my sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm currently working on Codebox, a remote development workspaces provider. After trying many existing solutions, I realized there wasn’t a self-hosted option that was both simple to set up and easy to use, so I decided to build one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Codebox, you can define workspace templates or load workspace configurations directly from Git repositories. At the moment, it supports Dev Containers and Docker Compose, with plans to expand to additional configuration methods in the future (for example, Terraform).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below are some resources where you can learn more about the project, including an article that explains how Codebox works and the source repositories (mirrored on both GitHub and GitLab):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am writing a Context Retrieval and Context Minimization program for Rust code. I am trying to automate my own workflow in how I use LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The program is gonna do, what I am currently doing by hand, opening files and copying function/method signatures usually, from files all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key here is to fetch into the context window only what is needed for one-question/one-answer and no more, hence the Context Minimization. Context fetched is gonna be specified by the programmer, for example sig(function) fetches only the signature, while @function captures the whole body. sig(Struct) is gonna fetch the fields and signatures of all of it's methods. sig(Trait) similarly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my view, giving the A.I. more information than needed, only confuses it and accuracy degrades. It is also slower and more expensive but that's a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project is in early stages, for the moment it calls ast-grep under the hood, but eventually, if it works as it is supposed to, I plan to move to tree-sitter queries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there is a similar project somewhere I would appreciate a pointer to it, but I am not interested in implementations of agents. My program does not give the A.I. a whole view of the codebase, only the necessary points specified by the programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on an AI (Aethas, https://blog.aethas.ai) that preps context before my meetings, sets reminders, makes design drafts, summarizes meetings, and drafts follow-up emails without me asking. Basically trying to have an entire personal AI like Jarvis that has the same context as me but acts on it automatically. Uses my Obsidian for knowledge, Claude for reasoning, pull data from written notes... Still early days but it feels like magic when I use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm branching out and trying something ridiculously different than anything else I've ever done before, I'm gonna try to create a video game that plays on people's sexual attractions, and tries to distract them while the player tries to complete a series of challenges/activities. It'll be like a little laboratory experiment, with NSFW graphics and the player having to remain focused while other things try to distract them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've never created a game before, less so a NSFW one, and I'm not sure how it's gonna go, but it is very different compared to other things I've done before. The game itself is done in Rust, compiles to WASM to be run on the web, and I've found 3 artists and one voice actress who is helping me with the art/audio stuff. So far a lot of fun, although managing a fleet (4) of contractors is less fun, although still new so a little bit of fun :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a voxel engine in my spare time for 10 years, this year. I wrote everything from scratch, from the memory allocators, font rasterizer and a programing language all the way to collision detection, renderer and gameplay code. It's been a journey!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm on a deep dive fine-tuning how I organize and manage my personal knowledge base - focused on entity extraction and strategic information retrieval and based on the AgREE paper from Apple[0] and persisting it in Memgraph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've got a nice ingest, extract, enrich process going for the graph - I'm currently working on a fork of claude-mem[1] that uses the graph as a contextual backend for agentic coding workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building https://swishfinance.app - minimalistic and simple stock widgets for your PC. That way I no longer have to make a conscious effort to check my portfolio — it's just there on my desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on BacklogAI, an autopilot engineer for SaaS teams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You connect GitHub, CI, Sentry, and Linear, and it takes tickets all the way to production. Claude writes the changes, BacklogAI handles tests, migrations, feature flags, staged rollouts, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s clearing months of backlog work in hours, and a couple teams I’m working with have already stopped hiring because it’s cheaper than adding more developers. It's crystal clear that developers and designers won't be needed in a couple of months because claude increases productivity by at least 120x and one or two PMs can do pretty much everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My stack is Claude, v0, nextjs, shadcn, clerk, supabase, vercel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the holidays I built MakersHub.dev – a community platform for developers and creators building with AI tools. Whether you're a complete beginner exploring AI coding for the first time or an experienced professional showcasing advanced work, the goal is to have something useful: learning guides, project showcases, discussions, a tools directory, and news. Still early but actively building it out. https://makershub.dev&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a music-making website since late spring. This is my first real frontend project, and I'm writing it in pure Rust using Leptos (so far, haven't had to write a single line of JavaScript!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of my work so far has been on the actual music-making interface, but I'm beginning work on the backend now. I've only worked with Django before (for a school project at Georgia Tech), so I'll be deep in the `sqlx` documentation for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's no manual, so use at your own risk (it's similar to tracker programs like FastTracker and OpenMPT): https://mondobe.com/tracker&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fellow yellow jacket here! This is great start, I'd love to see mondobe evolve into something like cursor for music production. I've done music making on DAWs like fl studio and i wish if we could reduce some friction there for users&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on CiteLLM, an API that extracts structured data from PDFs and returns citations for each field (page + coordinates + source snippet + confidence).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of blindly trusting the LLM, you can verify every value by linking it back to its exact location in the original PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AFAICT, the future of software development looks like a lot of unprofessional software development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not unlike digital photography and Instagram. Has it killed film-photo divisions of photography companies? Yes. Has it put professional photographers out of business? Hardly, and in fact, the opposite. What the ubiquitous phone camera has done, is expose a lot many more people to the steep challenge of making truly good photographs. It has raised the average population-scale level of photo-erudition and taste to ever-more sophisticated levels. And, it has pushed the envelope on what photography can do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So---assuming the AI overlords prevail (which I'm deeply skeptical of, but suppose a trillion dollars are right and I'm wrong)---what happens when LLMs allow anyone to vibe-code their own SaaS or Database or IDE or bespoke health-monitoring app or whatever...?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a newsletter called Tech Talks Weekly[1] where my readers get one email per week with all the latest Software Engineering conference talks and podcasts[1] published that week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In January, I've released a paid tier[2] where my subscribers additionally get:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Access to my internal database of all the talks and podcasts since 2020 (+48,000 in total) where they can search, filter, sort, and group by title, conference/podcast, view count, date, and duration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. See the list of the most-watched talks over the last 7, 30, 90 days, 6 months, and 12 months based on number of views.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Get category-based view of new talks &amp;amp; podcasts by tech stack, language, and domain (Software Architecture, Backend, Frontend, Full Stack, Data, ML, DevOps, Security, Leadership and every major language &amp;amp; ecosystem)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A little cool tech detail, I didn't want a backend or to store the information of people's reports anywhere. To get around the requirement, I made the form deterministic and populated on load from a data stream of bits (form is made from booleans or bitfields) from a decoded base-64 query parameter. A cool side-effect of this approach is I can update the query parameter in the URL in real-time as you fill out the form so if you reload it remembers your form without any local storage or cookie use!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Called "feocask" cuz feo means "ugly" in Spanish and FeO to mean Iron Oxide for Rust. I thought it was funny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will admit that I had help from Codex, but I did write most of it myself, and I think the design is coming out kind of neat. I have a very strict "no lock" policy [1], including lockfiles, and this should still be safe to use across any number of threads, at the cost of N^2 reconciliation to the number of threads and a lot more drive space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like my design; I have an excuse to use Vector Clocks and Hybrid Logical Clocks and I think it might actually be useful for something some day. I'd like to eventually write something that goes a bit beyond getting parity with bitcask and optionally have the ability to automatically distribute across multiple nodes, but I'm still trying to think of a good design for that, because my current design depends heavily the atomicity of POSIX filesystem commands, and introducing the network introduces latency that would likely greatly degrade performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[1] At least no explicit locks. I am using Tokio channels and they are probably using locks in some spots behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A suite of productivity tools for Claude Code, Codex CLI and similar CLI agents. These solve pain points for me, and I build and share them in the repo[1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll highlight a couple:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- an “aichat” command group that enables continuing work from a session that is at full context usage, by creating a new session and injecting session lineage pointers so the agent/sub-agent can recover arbitrary full details from ancestor sessions. So no more compacting needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- aichat search command: TUI for rust/tantivy-powered full text search across Claude and Codex sessions. CLI/json mode for agents to search for past work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Tmux-cli tool + skill to enable CLI agents to interact with scripts (including other agents) running in other Tmux panes. Like Playwright for the terminal. Multiple CLI agents can collaborate/consult etc. Agent can run and interact with interactive CLI scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on finally releasing the programming language I’ve been working on for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m setting up the basic site, which is not a huge deal, but I’ve been inspired by more recent language designers having a streaming presence, so I am working through test runs of streaming my development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope to start with demos of the basic language features and then move on to streaming both a reimplementation of my compiler and on a Rocq implementation of the syntax and semantics of the language for proof work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The language has a rather small niche at first glance, so I’m hoping to use the streaming as a way to explore areas of appeal and maybe draw some interest. A low level concurrent and parallel ‘functional’ language with very non-traditional syntax and a modal, dependent type theory is not going to appeal to everyone, but hopefully I can find some interest eventually, even if just to hang out on chat and talk about the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; A low level concurrent and parallel ‘functional’ language&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not particularly familiar with array based languages, but are you inspired by them at all? Seems like a similar concept.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What're your goals for the language? It would be cool to see a parallel execution model unify SIMD, multithreading and gpu. I bet people with a lot of money would be interested if you could apply it to ML&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not particularly inspired by the array languages in general. I do like the idea of a specifics DSL or library that is built from the ground up for ‘vector’ operations (Futhark would certainly be an inspiration here). I do think an (syntax divergences aside) implementation of what is essentially CUDA-like language/library is very possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t really have any lofty goals, the language exists to let me have my personal ideal programming language. One of the things I would like to see adopted, by any language, is that the language is able to encode and present provable guarantees about code. So, memory safety, freedom from UB, lack of overflow (integer or stack) is provable in some subset of the language and the proof is done in a logically consistent, verifiable manner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course most of those proofs are not anywhere near feasible for general case code, but the language can restrict allowable constructs in a computation, function, process, or module to a set that makes the desired properties provable by construction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The language should be capable of unifying and abstracting over SIMD (or other hardware implementations), GPUs, and OS or Userspace multithreading at levels of abstraction from assembly to Haskell or other high level languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continuing to work on Minifeed (https://minifeed.net/), a directory, reader, and search engine for personal blogs. The indexing &amp;amp; searching backend in Typesense, and I'm moving from their paid managed cloud service[0] to a self-hosted VM. It was very easy to start with the reasonably priced managed service, but with the number of feeds/posts growing, I have decided to self-host it. I'm also using Typesense Dashboard, a nice visual tool to do basic administration [1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, Minifeed keeps chugging along, fetching new posts every day from almost 2k feeds. I'm hoping to find some nice and ethical monetization strategy for it this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've created a programming language and game for (my) kids called Stacky Bird. You learn Stack Based programming with Flappy Bird. Inspired by my old HP calculators, the game 2048 and Flappy Bird. In levels you earn a new instruction and at the end you have a complete instruction set, and can solve complicated puzzles. With new instructions you can even go back and solve previous levels more elegantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not mobile friendly yet, but maybe that'll be a next weekend project. At least you can view a video of a level on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built a free USCIS form-filling tool (no Adobe required) USCIS forms still use XFA PDFs, which don’t let you edit in most browsers. Even with Adobe, fields break, and getting the signature is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I converted the PDF form into modern, browser-friendly web forms - and kept every field 1:1 with the original. You fill the form, submit it, and get the official USCIS PDF filled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think frontier models are getting to the point where we can start to reach higher trust agentic workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a hardcore AI chat user, I'm often frustrated with the single-agent workflow, where a single context window is used for even very long conversations. If I want to change the topic, open a thread, or go on a tangent, I often end up compromising the main thread and I'm forced to copy context over if I want to dive into something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To solve this, I'm working on a collaborative AI agent orchestrator that models the solution as a group chat with humans and AI agents, including an agent orchestrator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can spawn participating agents with the orchestrator who will decisively route messages to the existing agents, or spawn new agents if needed. Also, you can open agent details and send messages directly to existing agents, similar to threads in slack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, I have MCP integrations working with Linear and GitHub, but plan to add many more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on this just over 2 weeks, making heavy use of 4+ concurrent Claude Code agents. This would have been impossible otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Acme [1], a text editor for programmers. It’s a very unusual tool and I have collected hundreds of notes (as well as dozens of bugs and inconsistencies) from the past two years of using it. Now I feel fully assimilated, I do not take as much notes and it feels the right time to start organizing the knowledge, to put ideas together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that Acme is very underrated in its domain (a tool for experts). The coverage is minuscule. That’s why I am thinking about blog posts, maybe video tutorials. I do not know what should it be exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do not have any time estimates. I have a very demanding main job (I work as a software developer) and young family that I need to take care of. This project demands focused efforts and selectivity that I can barely satisfy. But I wouldn’t give up, the thing is totally worth it. If it’s going to take years, so be it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have any comments, send me a letter at kalterdev@gmail.com. Have a good day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still experimenting with different ways to make learning easier using LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I put together Codose as a tool where you paste a link to an Exercism or LeetCode problem, and it spins up a code editor with an AI tutor that walks you through the solution step by step, with mini lessons along the way when you need them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can try it without signing up but I’m on the Google AI Studio free tier right now, so I’m not sure how many uses can it handle&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently, I've been very motivated to make one niche crafted service after another. For myself, family and friends. But struggled to find a compelling hosting solution for projects that only has and will have only a single user for years. I bought the cheapest mac mini M4 on sale, put it in basement and started working on some cli+daemon to help me automate all things around it. The biggest risk is security, so probably gonna rely a lot on Cloudflare at start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been building Nottawa for ~4y now and it's finally out in the open!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nottawa's a free macOS app for making live audioreactive visuals. I'm trying to position it as a 100% free, batteries-included alternative to Resolume and TouchDesigner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not a tonne of users yet, but I'm hoping to get some traction in 2026. Would love love love to hear some feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building AgentOS [1], trying to experiment where agent substrates/sandboxes will head next. It's a deterministic, event-sourced runtime where an “agent world” is replayable from its log, heavy logic runs in sandboxed WASM modules, and every real-world side effect (HTTP, LLM calls, code compilations, etc.) is explicitly capability-gated and recorded as signed receipts. It ensures that upgrades and automations are auditable, reversible, and composable. The fun bit is a small typed control-plane intermediate representation (AIR) that lets the system treat its own schemas/modules/plans/policies as data and evolve via a governed loop (propose &amp;gt; shadow-run &amp;gt; approve &amp;gt; apply), kind of “Lisp machine vibes” but aimed at agents that need reliable self-modification rather than ambient scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've built a new auth platform with some new identity primitives and capability-style tokens using biscuits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now, I'm trying to figure out ways to apply it and am looking into offering integrations with extremely fine-grained access control that wouldn't have it otherwise. So adding a fine-grained access layer in front of stuff like backend-for-frontend (BFF) systems, brownfield stuff with poor auth, or even OAuth stuff that just have really coarse scopes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are there any integrations out there that people want but the access control is bad for them? I'll build one for you!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An eBPF-based Wireguard mesh VPN in Rust using Aya.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is to rely on kernel Wireguard, and process packets in kernel space (via eBPF) for maximum performance and minimal CPU overhead. I plan to use egress and ingress TC to “apply” the policy at both sides. XDP is faster, but only works on ingress, which is not sufficient for a mesh VPN imo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Netbird already exists in this space, so this is mostly a learning exercise, and maybe a reference implementation for those learning eBPF in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goals and constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Single digit CPU overhead for multi Gbps bandwidth (probably a bit too ambitious, but we’ll see)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Linux only&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. No hole punching or complex NAT handling&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Basic policy language for L3 and L4 traffic (L7 requires punting packets to a userspace proxy)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ALT (https://www.APILoadTest.com): I recently built ALT as a no-code platform to load/stress/performance test APIs with pre-defined (and customizable) load profiles, via globally distributed machines. The goal is simple: key performance metrics, in seconds, without scripting. I also added the feature to directly import collections from Postman.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past month I’ve been working on a creative / VFX / 3D tool that connects Apple devices into an all-in one node editor: https://subjectivedesigner.com/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With it, you can build interactive experiences, connect device sensors, compose shaders with AI models, orchestrate real-time data flows, and create projects that span across the entire Apple ecosystem. I’m posting about it regularly on social media and you can see some of it here: https://x.com/sxpstudio (Though it’s still early and most content is on socials thus far).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s done fully in SwiftUI + metal and also a good occasion to ramp up on agentic-powered software engineering. So far it’s been a lot of fun and working really great for me. And to be clear I’m absolutely not talking about vibe coding :-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on a proxy MCP server that lazy loads tools to save tokens https://github.com/mquan/nimble. It includes a dashboard for connecting and configuring MCP servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another itch of my own to scratch but thought I'd see if I can make some side income as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a web based bookmark manager with extensions for Firefox and Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can easily import and export bookmarks so you have all your data whenever you need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One main thing I really like that I think makes it stand out is the ability to export the contents of a bookmarked page to an epub file to read later on your Kindle or other e-reader device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking for any constructive feedback on this! Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on two topics that I like : browser multiplayer games and experiences, and tools for developers (mostly used in my side projects).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First game is https://geocentric.top where users can sculpt a planet collaboratively and place trees or houses (for now very limited). I plan on making it an idle sim where players will be able to interact by dropping some food/events for the creatures on it to evolve through time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, a remote logger/metrics/user management tool where once can track all their logs, live metrics, uptimes, identify users, etc. I hope to have a v1 during this first quarter and I'm currently my first user as I have it hosted at https://app.getboringmetrics.com to centralize all my side projects into a single platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is highly polished indeed and I'm likely going to try it, mostly for its animations regarding dropping plants and rocks as I lack micro animations for it in my game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks! This is also what I love doing as realtime games are something like 90% of my side project. This was a real fun prototype to create as everything regarding terrain is done through shaders (even user cursors). Will soon add a way for people to plant "flags" with small texts that you can highlight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am building an analytics calculator/toy that slowly turned into something useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It started as curiosity. I wanted to see if I could express business logic as simple choices and let the numbers fall out on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app is built interactively in Streamlit. I do not sit down with a spec or a backlog. I add one small idea at a time, refresh the page, react to what looks wrong, then adjust. It feels closer to sketching than programming. The interface tells me what the logic should be next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Underneath there is a growing pile of rules about the business I am in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do not write code in the traditional sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have never coded before and are solving my own problem done by one, this sure feels like magic!!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a passionate player of this traditional German card game called "Doppelkopf". It's a fantastic way to spend time away from screens. The game is quite complex which makes it super fun but also hard to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a small web app with an interactive tutorial and a browser-based singleplayer game that helps people learn and practice Doppelkopf. I've just released an English version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://replays.lol/clipper - A spin off from my main startup's product that lets Twitch streamers review their viewers' league of legend clips. Zero friction as we handle the recording of clips ourselves using bots that load up people's previous games using the League of Legends game client. Went live with my first medium-size streamer yesterday, excited to see how this goes!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to Cameo but hyper specialised for league of legend streamers, if this shows some traction we'll expand to other games, and then to other industries (think a tennis star reviews one of your tennis points, beats out a generic happy birthday message?)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still working on a system for allowing Open(Python)SCAD to model cuts for a CNC using G-code, and just added support for 3D Printing via Full-control G-code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a complex garden planner to keep track of gardens, orchards, and landscaping projects. Meant for very large and very small scales. Public alpha at the end of this month, I hope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is based on a garden designer I made for myself to keep track of my rose garden (I have over 100 roses) and orchard (I have about 15 trees): https://garden.simonsarris.com/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, my version was very specific to my needs, so this general version requires a lot more work to get it usable for a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a continuous chain-of-thought reasoning architecture for generative AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is similar to Meta's COCONUT. However, instead of the training forward and backwards passes of the reasoning tokens being done serially (slow), they are done in parallel (fast). At inference the reasoning tokens are still decoded serially. The trick is that even though training was done in parallel, the reasoning tokens are still causal and you still get the benefits of increased computational circuit depth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kicker is that the architecture is modality agnostic (it doesn't rely on language for its chains of thought), and I want to use it to bring COT reasoning to protein and anti-body generation. Basically, I hope for it to be the OpenAI o1 or DeepSeek R1 for domain-specialized scientific AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built an experimental system to test whether an autonomous AI can propose actions freely but be structurally prevented from executing side-effectful actions without explicit authorization. The system consistently blocks unsafe filesystem, shell, and network operations and produces a trace and diff proving nothing changed, even under adversarial pressure. The goal was to see if refusal and non-action can be enforced and verified at the execution layer rather than relying on prompts or logging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building Shannot, a human-in-the-loop sandbox for AI agents on production systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of filtering commands with heuristics (which agents work around), it dry-runs entire scripts in a PyPy sandbox, captures every command and file operation, then shows you exactly what will happen before anything executes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve just added checkpoint/rollback so you can undo changes if something goes wrong. Currently working on example scripts for common sysadmin tasks (nginx config, log cleanup, cert audits, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on a very simple browser extension that allows you to take notes right on youtube. It is open source, offline and everything is locally stored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A beginner-friendly programming language for 2D games where multiplayer is automatic. Intended to be an engaging way for teenagers to learn to code by making games they can play with their friends. Like a blend of Scratch and Roblox. I've been working on this for 3 years!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first mobile app! It encodes and decodes SSTV images, allowing you to send pictures over sound waves. Mostly used by amateur radio operators... even though the ISS sometimes also broadcasts SSTV images!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on ApprovIQ, a tool for construction certifiers. Someone who wants to get something built will work with one of customers to get their project approved before construction. They’ll typically go back and forth on dozens of documents each of which must be checked over for compliance - drainage, water quality, fire safety, the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite being intensely technical and detail-oriented, certifying construction is still mostly done by hand over email!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our niche is full of folks whose lives we can improve with a portal for document management &amp;amp; comms, plus a sprinkle of AI for document understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you know someone - anyone - wrangling too many documents via email. Please reach out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been putting together a rather silly slide-puzzle game for MENSA-level players: things like arranging the tiles by chemical element name according to atomic number, arranging countries by surface area, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s absurd and will probably appeal only to the descendants of Ken Jennings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A growth marketing Agent that's connected to your Google Analytics, Search Console, and can crawl the web to analyse your competitors: https://refreshagent.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vim-inspired, as in it's minimal and fast, text editor on the web. No modal-editing yet but, once the current natural input mode is decoupled, clients can bring their own modes/controllers via the extension system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's meant to be embeddable and hackable, serving as a building block for custom IDEs as opposed to being IDE-like VSCode. I felt the web IDE space was uninspired with apps built around VScode/Monaco effectively being hosted a VSCode instance with a pre-installed extension and config.json. (Aside: perhaps there's a business opportunity for VSCode-as-a-service where client apps simply bring their own config). I'm dogfooding this library in building an algo trading IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ships 2kb and smoothly handles 50+ million line files. 1 billion lines with the high-capacity extension. Also, it can function as a TUI or terminal on the web because the core implementation concerns efficiently rendering plaintext in a fixed-width grid layout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gymlocity (https://gymlocity.com) - All-in-one gym management platform for small gym owners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building this for personal trainers with home gyms and small 1-2 location owner-operated facilities. The big players (Mindbody, etc.) are overkill and expensive for this market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Core features: class scheduling, member booking, Stripe payments, and workout programming (the part most gym software ignores - trainers still use spreadsheets or generic apps).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stack: React 19 + Vite frontend, ASP.NET Core 10 API, PostgreSQL, multi-tenant architecture so each gym gets their own branded experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently polishing the member dashboard and workout tracking UI. The goal is something a solo trainer can set up in an afternoon without needing to call sales or sit through demos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on some electronics stuff more recently, and I designed custom PCBs which read the voltage and internal resistance of the 12V NiMH batteries used by robots in FIRST Tech Challenge. It's not always easy to know how charged or healthy the batteries are for a match, or when it's time to get rid of them. They're pretty small and are easy to assemble. Rather that having a screen (which would take precious flash and pins on the ATTiny412), it just uses a WS2812B RGB LED.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote the firmware in Arduino, which was a great learning experience because I typically work with CircuitPython or Go, where I'm less constrained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ScreenRecord.in: https://screenrecord.in I have worked remotely for most of my career and have found screen recording a useful tool to share ideas or ask questions. I liked the UX of Loom but always wondered if one could do it without installing any app. Turns out you can! Given today's browsers especially on desktops one can do a lot of things. ScreenRecord.in can record screen, webcam, mic and system audio if the browser supports them. Chrome has the best compatibility. All recording are stored in local storage I am figuring out what features to add.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Been working on a Google-sheet backed workout tracker, which basically makes it easy for me to see what I've done or not done recently and pick the next thing to do. I'm thinking of open sourcing this soon, but need to do some "de-monolithing" first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m interested in ocean container shipping, so I built a Google Sheets add-on to automate the process of tracking shipping containers. It’s called Container Tracker and I just got it live on the Google Marketplace. https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/container_track...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Main workload is done by the backend (serverless functions).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am currently working on a HubSpot extension (that uses same backend) with the goal to target few other platforms where users work, and integrate the functionality into their daily workload, as opposed to having it as standalone website or mobile app. I have fun doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a former JPMorgan Chase engineer, rebuilding the Chase Travel UI so it doesn’t suck (there was never a role available on that team while I was there): https://rkdvis.com/chase-travel&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on an iOS camera app to take natural-looking photos with reduced post-processing. The goal is take photos that look like what you see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just updated the RAW pipeline and I'm really happy with how the resulting photos look, plus there's this cool "RAW+ProRAW" capture mode I introduced recently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I initially released it early last year and have been using it as my main camera app since, but I haven't mentioned it in one of these threads before. Unfortunately this post has come just a bit early for my most recent update to be approved; there's some nice improvements coming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Curious what motivated you to create this camera app when there are a handful of well established apps that already do unprocessed imaging. What does Unpro do differently?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time I created it there weren't any that did the end-to-end process with ProRAW in a way that I liked. And I got really tired of manually editing every photo I took, so I built the app for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plus, having full control over the way photos look, I've customized the output to match my taste; I don't think there's any other camera apps that produce photos quite like mine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building a quantum photonics experiment that is a variation of the quantum eraser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One aspect that HN may find interesting is my use of Bayesian optimization to control and perfect key experimental settings. About a dozen of the wave plates and other optical components are motorized and under computer control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given a goal metric like "maximally entangle the photon pairs" the optimizer will run the experiment 50-100 times, tweaking the angles of various optics and collecting data. Ultimately it will learn to maximize the given cost function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This sort of thing is commonly done with tools like Optuna during NN/LLM training to optimize hyper-parameters, but seems less common in physics especially quantum photonics. I'm using a great tool called M-loop to drive the optimization, which was originally developed for creating Bose-Einstein condensates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nowhere near as impressive as some of the things here but I’ve been slowly growing out a daily puzzle website https://regularly.co - I built the first few games for my wife, no subscriptions, no pay to play, no sign up needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Im launching a new word game next week which I’m super excited about. If you do play it and have any feedback do shoot me message!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just released v0.12.0 which has a lot of package cleanup and some important bugfixes. Next, is making the relay infrastructure much more lighter, requiring less synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally, I'm using the hosted version[0] (which is just a repackage of the open source version with dynamic with tokens) to expose my NAS and syncthing web UIs to manage them while I'm away. Sometimes even through my phone (with termux)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to visualise magnetic fields of a floppy disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far I can see magnetic fields on a magstripe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8nM4Z-hkTw with two polarisers (one of which I rotate in the video, which is contained in a 3D printed holder with gears I made).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm awaiting some different polariser film, to see if I can get it to work with a floppy disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trippy! Please do a large-format visual art installation of the results of this... like, project it on a wall or on some other public surface that is... unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was working on an Arazzo[0] generator as a plugin for the Serverless Framework. This has now become a fully fledged runner. So far I have it using multiple OpenAPI source descriptions, and just about got retry rules working. Next steps will be for it to be able to reference Workflows in external Arazzo documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on Security Level 5 (SL5), which is basically “nation state grade security” for frontier AI systems. The core idea is that if a model’s weights or training artifacts could enable catastrophic harm, you should treat them like top-tier secrets and secure them accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One piece I helped with is SenL, a “sensitivity level” framework for AI labs. It’s like a practical clearance system for AI assets. Not everything in a lab is equally dangerous, so you label assets by sensitivity (weights, training data, eval sets, agent tooling, deployment configs, etc.), then tie that label to concrete controls like who can access it, where it can run, what logging is required, and what monitoring / two-person rules apply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anyone’s curious, SL5 is here: http://sl5.org/ and the SenL framework is part of the published artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The core idea is that if a model’s weights or training artifacts could enable catastrophic harm, you should treat them like top-tier secrets and secure them accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My read here is that you're implying that if an attacker has access to, for example, weight data, they can invariably find a way to exploit it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If that's a correct assumption, I think you're playing an unwinnable game, since attackers always have indirect access through inference of the model. It feels like locking down weights/training data/etc is the ai version of security through obfuscation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think this is exactly why some of the work is moving away from “assume unrestricted API inference forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, we’re prototyping ideas like air-gapped or very low-bandwidth inference gateways, where interaction happens over narrow channels (serial, optical, audio, etc.), with explicit threat models and monitoring. The point isn’t that this’s practical for today’s models, but to reason about what inference might look like for AGI/ASI-level systems where the risk profile is fundamentally different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on some new Bluesky tools and trying to learn more about the AT Protocol. Have been working on this following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Skyscraper, an iOS native app for Bluesky with focus on Liquid Glass UI. Launching hopefully in a ~week, and TestFlight available at https://testflight.apple.com/join/RRvk14ks&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then also working on a website/web tool that does the following: - A keyword/term notification service that observes the Bluesky Jetstream for usages of the term and sends email alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Provides an HTML/JSON backup archive of any Bluesky account. Quick way to archive popular accounts, politicians, public figures, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Trending Hashtag lists, to see what is trending the last hour, day, week, and month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a Postgres-native workflow engine using pgmq for queues and TypeScript worker. Workflows compile to definitions (SQL rows), letting Postgres orchestrate the DAG as state machines. The TypeScript DSL is type-safe with inferred inputs/outputs across dependencies with full autocomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Declarative and functional in nature. Just a manifest wiring functions into a DAG and a Postgres SQL functions that manage the graph of state machines. Simple in principle and very opinionated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Replaces 240 lines of manual pg_cron -&amp;gt; pgmq -&amp;gt; Supabase Edge Function boilerplate with 20 lines of explicit DAG definitions. Currently Supabase-only (leverages their primitives) but planning to make it agnostic for vanilla Postgres setups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am building an open-source, cross-platform desktop app for building and providing code-related context to chat based large language models. [1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found that sometimes I would rather interact with a chat interface to debug an issue or brainstorm architecture solutions in my repos. Agents are great for giving the model access to everything and letting it figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By manually prompting, it forces me to keep my metal model of the codebase up to date, and it allows me to provide just the context I want to the LLM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm tinkering around building "JARVIS" (I didn't want to come up with a clever self deprecating name - this works) - a personal project to manage my life. Integrates into Google Mail, Google Calendar, Trello, GroupMe, EveryDollar. Basically it nags me to do grown up thing and is a better UX than Google Calendar/Trello - I just talk to it and ask it things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also experimenting with a new Claude-Code flow; give the bot its own AWS account, Put a bunch of tickets on my personal JIRA, be persnickity about what constitutes "pass" and tell the bot "follow these instructions, pull down tickets until there are no more. Your branch cannot merge until you have integration tests passing in your own dev env first" (I use AWS CDK). Then let it loose to build. The instant feedback loop that Claude has with Build-Code-&amp;gt;Deploy to AWS-&amp;gt;Run Integration Tests-&amp;gt;Address Failures is really nifty fwiw...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developing a graph-based programming language called Graphoid. The original concept was to target AI-related programming. Probably not ready for that yet!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Code is doing the majority of the coding, with close supervision from me. I write notes while I'm working on it. Notes are here: https://www.patreon.com/cw/aiconfessions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building "human perspective maps" using non-linear dimensional reduction algorithms to visualize the "human value manifold" from hundreds of agree/disagree/pass statements, like Google Maps for complex large-scale conversations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just paint with colors, click a painted group, and see what differentiates your painted groups. (Chrome on iOS has issues fwiw)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is building on the philosophy of democracy-bolstering tools like Pol.is, which I've worked with (as a researcher/practitioner) for almost a decade&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A browser extension (Chrome &amp;amp; Firefox) for simplifying my online grocery purchase workflow from Cookidoo to Knuspr.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was tired of my weekly workflow of copying, pasting &amp;amp; sorting the grocery page for each item.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also launched my first Hugo blog. Really nice experience so far. Wrote more detailed about the extension as my first blog entry: https://lars147.github.io/blog/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Increader, an incremental reading platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You put in all your bookmarks (also pdfs or epubs) and it puts them in a queue and tracks your progress. Read for as long as you want to and if you get bored with an article you just move on to the next one. Supports highlights and annotations as well as creating spaced repetition cards out of those annotations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really reduces the friction for me to start reading and it has made a noticeable difference to my media consumption throughout last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Started out as an exploration into the incremental reading concept, but it's become my primary interface for reading and I use it every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven't really talked about this to anyone yet, but it's getting to a point where it's polished enough for others to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's currently completely free and you can try it without entering your email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now working on comprehensive benchmarks for another tool I built, https://github.com/sibyllinesoft/scribe. Results thus far showing it reducing agent token usage by ~80% in real world tasks, but I need to repeat to get variance. Hopefully I can get a writeup out soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am devoting 2026 to focus on my rpg. The one differentiator here is something I am still not seeing: proper use of LLMs in games. The current batch is all lazy asset generation, maybe logic coding and what not, but not anything that could make the world actually feel alive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously, it all comes with its own sets of issues, but I am working through those as they come. But it is still a slow move solo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We did have some movement in the director logic before and, I forgot the zombie game in question, some of it seems pretty well served for the most part. I still think there is some room for a proper game master type that you refer to ( adjusting the challenge to what the player seems to be to do ).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was personally thinking of making NPC less npcy ( not completely unlike dwarf fortress, but expanded ).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is your 2c on some of the recent backlash about AI assets in games? Is that a vocal minority (game artists and similar ec), or is that part of a broader trend?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the artists have a valid bone to pick and I think some of the backlash is mostly coming from that quarter. The actual gamers are more repulsed by established studios using AI for asset generation, because it comes across as a lazy money grab. But gamers are both flexible ( will jump through a lot of hoops to do what they want to do ) and and set in their way of 'just want to have fun'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other side of the spectrum are indies, who can afford to experiment a little more so you get more interesting uses ( like 'voicelines' by AI come to mind ).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know what I want to believe, but it is hard for me to call it ( I think it is a temporary trend ), because I might be a little too close to it. After all, gamers have been conditioned to endure a lot over the past decade and mostly shrugged off most of the assaults on their favorite past time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I were to compare it to something.. it is almost like using LLMs for email summaries ( which is still what most bosses seem to be most pleased with ). There are better use cases. I think those were not explored yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just completed a holiday project this week to measure the kids screen time using an Arduino device and a web app! I got frustrated trying to get so many parental control apps to play nicely, in the end this seemed like a bolder new approach to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on a real-time tracker for the Canadian Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the official data is technically public, it's practically inaccessible (buried in XML feeds and legacy sites).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 1 was building a modern ingestion engine and freeing the information to make it more accessible. The goal is to make legislative data as accessible as sports stats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm almost ready to launch the MVP; I'm just doing some bugfixes and testing the database now! (If you want an early look at the MVP, my email is in my profile.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next phase is what I'm most excited about: visualizing this data and using LLMs to provide insights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on The Influencer AI(www.theinfluencer.ai), a platform that lets you create realistic and consistent AI personas('ai influencers') to use on social media or as your brand ambassador. You can use this unique AI person in photos and talking videos, for use cases like talking about your product, creating a high quality Instagram persona, photos for your e-commerce site, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A listings site for virtually attending FOSDEM. The live streaming is great but the official site only lists sessions in the local Brussels time zone. You can choose your time zone here: https://virtuallyattend.teacaketech.scot/fosdem/2026/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a really unique book recommendation platform to help readers find books they might not otherwise know about. We just started working on a full book app that will be a private book diary, along with recommendations and insights based on your Book DNA. Think Goodreads, but rebuilt for readers who want a private space to track what they read, keep notes, and get truly personalized book recommendations (like Pandora or Spotify for books).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a fun one I do with a good friend. Basically, to see if a website is down, or if it is just you, along with reported reasons from the community. We are working to add user accounts so you can create your own custom lists of websites/services to track&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's millions of tools that try to autogenerate colors for you using algorithms and AI, but they usually ignore WCAG accessible contrast requirements, don't let you customise the tints/shades, don't let you create a full palette of colors, and the colors often don't look right on actual designs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This tool is meant to make customising tints/shades intuitive and quick enough in a few clicks via a hue/saturation/lightness curve editing interface that you won't want to rely on autogeneration. There's also a live mockup showing how your palette looks on a UI design that checks pairings pass contrast requirements, to guide you as you tweak your colors and to teach you the WCAG rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can then export your palette to regular CSS variables, Tailwind, Figma or Adobe for use in your designs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really open to any feedback on features that would be useful! I think the only way I can make it simpler to use is to make it more opinionated about how your palette should be designed so interested in any thoughts about that too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ChatGPT recommended this to me recently when I was trying to get some assistance with a usable Tailwind palette. I ended up not needing it right away but it's first in line next time I need to make one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any details about what problems you were having getting a usable Tailwind palette? There seems to be lots of different use case so I'd love to hear more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's awesome, I haven't kept up in what helps to get into AI recommendations. Guessing it's related to search result rankings? Not sure if the site would be in the training data. Curious if you asked about accessibility as that's my focus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still working on PocketWise (https://pocketwise.app), a simple double-entry accounting app. Just finished adding end-to-end encryption with a zero-trust server model. All encryption and decryption happens in the browser (using PRF), and the server only sees encrypted data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to bootstrap a PKI certificate trust chain for facilitating trust projection and information verification online. Think of it as the ability to do something such as age verification at scale via a peer-2-peer ish mechanism instead of sending your government id to a porno service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are experimenting with Keybase key holders as CAs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's all self-service and requires no sign-up or download of anything, the app (https://certisfy.com/app) is an in-browser app and all the cryptography happens in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Double TAP is lightweight testing framework where users write black box tests as rules checking output from tested "boxes". Boxes could be anything from http client, web server to messages in syslog. This universal approach allows to test anything with just dropping text rules describing system behavior in black box manner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have GBs of time-series data in a TimescaleDB database. It’s more complicated than this, but the gist is: I use natural language to ask questions about relationships in the data, Claude Opus 4.5 generates queries, and it finds patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, I classify tens of thousands of news articles using different classification models. Then I ask Claude to write a query that tests for statistically significant changes in the time-series data at specific intervals after a given classification of article—and it finds patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It passes train / test split validation. It will train on 2 years of data (2023 and 2024) and being able to effectively predict movements on the time series data using the classified news articles on the last year of data (2025).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on the same tool since 2024 where I thought it might be a good time to build a tool for all the people who will build their own tools, eventually they will need to market it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I built a SEO/GEO Automation Tool for Small to Mid-Size Businesses who don't have a full-time team for that. [0]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is to provide teams visibility across all the channels — Search and AI and give them the tools needed to outrank their competition. So far so good, the fully bootstrapped venture has grown over the last year and I've built quite a few big features — sophisticated audit system, AI Responses Monitoring, Crawler Analytics, Competitors Monitoring etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding a bit of context as well: This started out as a internal linking tool, but grew into something more based on the customer feedback — the database has now reached about 10TB of data about keywords, pages, AI responses etc, where I know who was ranking where and why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I'm trying to offer this "data advantage" to website owners, so they can grow, and also this is something that will be hard to replicate (at least quickly) with AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A live-performance software with a focus on creating 'musically connected visuals'. Currently, the biggest connectivity is probably tightly tied lyric visualizations. Some recent examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm getting ready to release a re-creation of an old mobile game that got delisted after the devs sold it to a company that subsequently ruined it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The stack is Babylon + React + Capacitor, which was easy to step into as a full-stack dev with zero game building experience. Currently seeing what I can do to fix some performance issues, though it still works decently for a graphics heavy incremental/idle game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have always assumed this is about individual projects, but let me try talking about our team effort. We just launched exe.dev, and have lots of projects. In particular, we are spending a lot of time on file systems. The easy one is copy-on-write VM cloning, which existing software provides for us. More interestingly, I believe the standard cloud approach of putting everything on a NAS by default is wrong. Doing better here is going to require doing unusual things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found myself switching a lot between apps to get the same info, lots of copy/pasting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example, URLs in bookmark (which I forget about), project descriptions , images, folders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I built a Mac app that is similar to Raycast, but just for notes. If I want to save a webpage, I click control+option+C and then a window pops up to describe it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I press control+option+V, I get a spotlight like window where it does full-text search of all my notes and descriptions and filter so I can either:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Open&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Insert the data into the current app (chrome, slack, ChatGPT).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been using it for a few weeks now, and not sure if others will find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eidetica, a planned decentralized database for local-first applications. I'm building out unstable features to get it to a point where I can show off the concepts but it's still fairly brittle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently added better backend support for deployments, converted everything to async Rust, and setup Nix/Docker releases. I'm planning to build out some better example apps and workflows next, but everything will stay pre-alpha/unstable for now so that I can avoid getting locked in to any foundational issues. There are still a number of low-hanging breaking issues blocking the end-to-end usage which I'll need to address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been using linux for a few years now as my main/only OS, but have mainly just used Linux Mint as a sorta plug-and-play distro.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking to revive my 15 year old ThinkPad (1st laptop ever!) by building up from a base Void linux install. As I'm doing it I'm writing install-scripts and getting my dotfiles in order (after never really doing so for 17+ years as a programmer lol), so I can repeat the process in the future on other machines, or when I want to do a fresh re-install.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did a full circle: Graduated from doctoral studies, I'm working on automating science. Built an arxiv-like repo for science written by ai agents (https://ai-archive.io). To help scientists use this website and AI in their research, i wrapped opencode with ai-archive's mcp server and agents preconfigured. I then let people test this opencode bundle and contribute to the repo with a sandbox environment online (running opencode in container). Figured that authorative scientific repo requires grounding by real scientists and labs and therefore I am now negotiating implemeting automated science where I just finished my doctoral studies...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently tidying up some internal code (also removing the larger model on mobile platforms) and implementing proper diarization (who said what) so that it can be used for more than just personal dictation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My iOS developer account is _finally_ approved so it will be available through the proper app store soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building CodeIQ - an AI tool that automates transaction coding for accountants and bookkeepers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The interesting technical bit: it analyses your historic general ledger to reverse-engineer how you specifically categorise transactions. So instead of generic rules, it learns your firm's actual patterns - "oh, they always code Costa Coffee to Staff Welfare, not Refreshments" - that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Posts directly to Xero, QuickBooks, Sage, and Pandle. The VAT handling turned out to be surprisingly gnarly (UK tax rules are... something).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Been working on it about 6 months now. Still figuring out the right balance between automation confidence and "just flag this for human review".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some time-constraints make it hard for me to commit to some open source work right now, but if I can I still improve my tool called "Software Manager". Goal for 2026 will be to have registered 4000 programs in total (I am at about 3750 right now) as well as make it dead-easy to interface with it through oldschool SQL (right now I just have .yml files and other flat files, though I can autogenerate a .sql database already as-is, but right now I don't query this dataset and it is not really optimised either). My long term goal is to make compilation on any platform dead simple. On Linux it works very well; on windows not quite as well yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m a remote dev building an iOS app called Springus. You add a few pics / your closet basics, and it suggests outfits based on what you already own. It’s less “fashion app” and more “tiny morning momentum hack.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would love feedback from other WFH folks — a weird amount of my productivity comes down to how I start the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been working on Print Relay[1], a cloud-based print relay system that enables remote printing to any printer connected to your local network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PrintRelay consists of a cloud server and lightweight clients that connect printers to the cloud via WebSocket.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use the excellent SaaS PrintNode at work, but about twice a year we have connectivity/routing issues between AWS ap-southeast-2 and their servers OS. PrintRelay is my attempt to not need PrintNode. Because of this PrintRelay is PrintNode API compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- A sports club management platform, and a way for end-users to sign up for sports events, lessons etc.: https://mojtim.ba/en/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Given the raise of AI, I'm a hiking guide and would like to have that as an alternative, an outdoor activity agency - https://boa.ba (still very WIP)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm making a synthesizer drone generator (Webaudio API) with an audio visualizer (Three.js). It's a fibonacci sphere made of 100k particles. I send a sine wave down the spiral and it highlights the different spiral paths contained within the larger fibonacci spiral, which creates some really interesting patterns. I'm currently working on the audio component.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Error Invalid input: 1 validation error for PlanRequest current_km Input should be greater than 0 [type=greater_than, input_value=0.0, input_type=float] For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.5/v/greater_than&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are a 501c(3) and are actively fundraising to build a tower here in Shadow Hills and are launching our live stream and regular schedule February 1st. So far we have about 60 shows in the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're in Los Angeles and have an interest in radio, please hit me up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on binding raylib to s7 scheme and implementing a kanren on top of it basically just for the sake of understanding. I let AI write most of the binding code, though, because that is conceptually simple but very boring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Holidays nuked all the hot-cached context in my head. I spent a few days just spinning wheels until it repopulated. But the basic idea works now!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much testing and benchmarking work remains to make sure it's not going to lose data, and that it won't denial-of-service itself (because object-map -&amp;gt; facts fan-out is big).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also a second giant blog post is due (following the one discussed above). Lots of notes have accumulated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It will be fun even if the concept ultimately crashes and burns to the ground :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Love the idea! Read only the beginning of the first "giant blog post" so maybe it's discussed there, but in Sqlite doesn't WAL mode give you a kind of super simple, super basic temporal data system? If you somehow kept all WAL entries 'as is', it should be possible to reconstruct the state of the db at any point in the past?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; but in Sqlite doesn't WAL mode give you a kind of super simple, super basic temporal data system&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes-ish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For one, it is unitemporal. For another, it is for SQLites own transactions, not of the individual datums. Litestream is the way to replicate WAL into an object store / elsewhere. litestream-vfs is also looking good!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to emulate the data assert/redact properties of append-only bitemporal-by-design data stores like XTDB. The giant blog post builds up the intuition from scratch. Or at least tries to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So my system is going to be: bitemporal data, enforced by SQLite schema and application checks, along with WAL replication for point-in-time transaction backup/restore. Both are entirely distinct, and unaware of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's an IoT Cloud Platform built for developers. We're still in technical preview and are currently working on adding more telemetry to our small device agent written in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Public dataset for exploring 50,000+ 401(k) plans holding $7.5T in assets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can look inside a company like Google and see what employees invest in (mostly 2035-2055 target date funds) or how much they contribute ($30K - likely using Mega Backdoor Roth)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For work related items I’ve been building out agent tooling for building some models and PoC projects related to energy industry applications. Been doing the consulting thing for a bit now and gaining more broad knowledge on some of these data center builds. Hoping to spin this into a product soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Started playing with gas town which is really cool. I had a naive version built that was just not good enough. This feels like a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Haven’t had much time to work on any of my physical hands on hobbies lately but maybe when the weather gets better I’ll head back out to the shop again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I 3D printed some new apertures for an infrared spectrometer at work to reduce some issues that cause artifacts in the data to enable higher accuracy measurements, particularly of high index and reflective samples. Seems to be working well now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on a query cost analyzer that looks at query performance and does maths against your infrastructure cost to understand what is your dollar cost per query. The idea is that teams (when tables are tagged appropriately) will be notified with their most costly queries and hopefully makes that actionable for teams to clean up some queries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am unsure if there is a need for a tool like this in the market but I am becoming more and more curious around databases so this felt like a lower barrier for my product-minded engineer skills to get into.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on interactive explorations of algorithms and machine learning. Small, visual, hands-on demos that help build intuition by letting people tweak code/parameters and see how things behave in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Source code, in rust: https://github.com/David-OConnor/molchanica I've split out its building blocks into their own libraries on crates.io, for anyone building other bio or chem software. I don't think anyone uses them at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No; I believe I am the only one doing this in the open. There are a handful of tools for bioinformatics, but am one of few building structural bio/chem ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building some prototypes around the Recursive Language Model paper. I'm currently working on integrating it with Unity for scene and script automation. Thinking about standardized patterns for retrofitting this into other existing business systems. If I can make it drive Unity reasonably well, I think it could drive a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Daestro[0] - a job orchestrator that can directly integrate with cloud providers like AWS, Vultr, DigitalOcean and Linode to create instances for jobs to run on and destroy when done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently I'm working on following features: - Multi user support (Team) on project level - Then I'll look into whether to add support for OIDC/SSO now or not - Alert on slack - Webhook support&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Platform for apps, currently Lua support ( future WASM). Think like apk (android app) but spk.zip that has server.lua file for backend and htmt/js/css that get served for front end plus platform gives Files, SQLite db (namespaced/scopped access ), Auth, User management All in single static binary Cz go&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Been hacking on https://rsolv.dev. It's a security scanner with a couple of unique twists; in addition to using AST validation to cut the false positive rate, it uses a heavily orchestrated LLM to write unit tests that fail if the detected vulnerability is present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happy for alpha users; it's really early days right now. Email in profile if you want to give it a try at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a few other small side projects that generally improve my day-to-day life, including a better calendar widget for shift workers and a video speed controller that floats on websites where I frequently watch videos for easy access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A little desktop app that lets me upload transaction csvs from my bank and figure out how much I need to split with my partner. Mostly because I always forget to charge her for utilities or flight bookings and I hate going through the bank UI. Might also expand it with some simple subscription auditing logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, a dramatic anime intro (complete with cheesy AI generated theme song and video) starring our foster kittens. It's been interesting to learn about some of the techniques needed for consistency, how to storyboard, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locque is a language designed to both be easy for LLMs to read and write, but also for humans to review, and it's designed along my philosophy that the more structure you can give coding agents, the better, so it's dependently typed and hosted on Haskell at the moment. Feedback eagerly solicited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been working on the next generation of Canva and Photoshop for highly regulated verticals where there are specific demands placed on the generation and edit flow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My project is WithAudio and is gonna be WithAudio for a while. Its a text to speech reader. Initially I decided to generate pargraph by paragaph. But that was not a great call as users sometimes might have to wait for the whole paragraph to be ready before they can listen. Now I'm working on changing it to sentence by sentence. I think that + adding 2 new languages would take most of my January's budgeted time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to learn a new(ish) skill and am building a button box for sim racing with Arduino Nano, momentary switches, etc. It has been about twenty years since I’ve touched a soldering iron or built any kind of breadboard circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- https://github.com/rcarmo/toadbox (a simple Docker-based agent sandbox to run Toad/OpenCode/Mistral inside, which I've been cleaning up for general use)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on version 6 of the Nutrisense. A device to keep track of what you eat (calories/protein, etc.) without the need to type it in, in some app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My Family recently (in the last couple of years) started to breed Ragdoll cats in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an attempt to support what's involved in this I built Ardent for them. It covers a bunch of the day-to-day concerns (weighing and health tracking), Lineage and Inbreeding prevention, and Owner Pack generation for handovers to new Owners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One always-on Linux box to run apps, databases, CI, and AI agents without hyperscale complexity, surprise bills, or Kubernetes. AI-driven app explosion plus mature open-source deploy tools make simple servers fast, cheap, and fun again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Narwhal, a pub/sub protocol and server specifically designed for edge applications. The protocol can be extended via an external component, and the product is completely free and open source: https://github.com/narwhal-io/narwhal&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on an failure proof introduction to Lisp/Scheme for imperative programmers. I always thought there was something unapproachable about Lisp. But I finally figured it out, and I want to document my path for people like me. It's going to be great. Expect to be done in a week or so!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm enjoying building a website with solitaire and puzzle games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am currently rewriting the engine for the fourth time and plan to add 400 games to the platform in the coming months, as well as social features such as daily challenges, awards and leaderboards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My main goal, however, is to make this project the largest collection of free modern solitaire games available for mobile devices and desktop computers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, the project has been incredibly exciting, and I've learned so much!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I threw together a simple patch-style synth to play with the Web MIDI APIs and React Flow. It’s an early experiment and part of my personal “try things and learn” site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An Android app for CORE (YC S23) to make it as easy as possible to capture data to Core on-the-go. Voice-based UI, also quickly type in memories, and later retrieve by asking. https://memory2.app&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Substack for 80/20 life advice that gets repeated every year. We all know what to do, the idea of this is to remind us every week of one aspect of life and what best practices are for that area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A personal agentic tool for action cam video editing. When I moto / ski / bike, I leave my helmet cam rolling the entire time. It takes a very long time to 1. find scenes and 2. edit them down into a reel or video. It works well for my amateur use case - basic edits with only cuts and transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on agent-os: a slf-hosted web UI for managing multiple AI coding CLI sessions (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) with multi-pane terminals. All free and open source: https://github.com/saadnvd1/agent-os&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Publishing updated FreeBSD AMIs every time there is a security or errata update. This will make life easier for FreeBSD/EC2 users since they won't need to wait for patches to download when they first launch an instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A very simple facebook-ish social media PWA that is meant to be easily selfhosted on low end raspberry pi level hardware, bun + sqlite + mantine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My friendgroup has gotten increasingly concerned with the gradual enshittification of various services we depend upon, and are looking at various alternatives. In some cases there are good selfhostable options (nextcloud, mattermost/zulip), but I decided to write my own tiny PWA to cover facebook-like needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal isn't really to scale to &amp;gt;1000 users, just to be simple to spin up for a small group and be easy to manage. I'm hoping to run multiple instances, eg one for family, one for college friends, one for local friends, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My process has been pretty ADHD though. I recently read the phrase "It doesn't have to be done, it just has to be perfect" and felt personally attacked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on SIP4AI [1] (a VOIP soft-phone where AI is on the other end, not a human). You can self-host it, register a SIP line, and let AI take the calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It works with your existing phone system, so you can just add AI as a line without having to replace everything…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm still working on my PDF search engine for desktop: https://www.docgoblin.com/ I'm implementing a bookmark utility right now and hope to add support multiple E-books format in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A one time payment app - interesting (I'm also working on something with similar moneytization solution). How are things going? I'd love to know the experience of another solopreneur, what stack are you using? I wonder - What are you using to parse PDFs and extract the text? I found that is a nightmare when was doing something similar for WithAudio (my app). - Are you just extracting the text or you are doing any post processing to identify which lines belong to the same paragraph or not?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Things are going slow, but it is a passion project so it's ok :) A few people have bought a licence and it seems most people who try the app are very happy with it so I'm happy too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app is entirely in Java, with javaFX for the UI and Lucene for the search engine. To read and render PDFs I use PDFium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on an app to make testing available to all brick and mortar retailers (proofpod.ai).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most difficult technical challenge has been designing a pipeline to fully automate choosing test &amp;amp; control locations using synthetic difference-in-differences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the moment I’m building a succinct data structure library, doing one algorithm at a time. There have been some very impressive papers came out recently. The numbers look promising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Echoresponse - a tool for responsible disclosure. Security Researchers and companies encode some of their secret knowledge in LLMs and the LLMs have a discussion and can say one word from agreed upon list back to the party that programmed them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on a fontdrawing app that only uses the keyboard (inspired by vim) for a couple of months. Finally got export to ttf working this weekend and got to see a bad looking j I drew in Figma&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're at Open Community organizing an AI Vibe Coding Hackathon. As of now we got near to 500 builders, big Sponsors like ElevenLabs, Daytona, Nord Security brands and etc. Near to $200,000 in Prizes. Everyone is welcome to the hackathon https://vibe.devpost.com, Technical or Non-technical. Since it's vibe coding hackathon. Our discord btw - https://discord.gg/nUdcd9p8Ae&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally writing up the documentation (architecture and safety concept) for the fly-by-wire system for the homebuilt airplane I'm 15+ years into designing. Got to OML lock about a year ago, and the aerodynamics are checking out, so really hoping that I can get a subscale flying in 2026 (although I've said that before). On full scale, major remaining design task is structures, but there's plenty of other stuff (propulsion integration) as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has AI summarize buttons (gemini-flash-lite is so fast!) along with other features I wanted. I'm almost done adding a "war mode". The user (me!) specifies a list of OSINT style x users which show up sequentially in a grid along with a ticker on the bottom of polymarket markets I've chosen. War mode is also obviously only available in dark mode...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of things because LLMs enable my potential ADHD and no-filter-brain. A thing that controls a small FPV drone from the PC with vision input. Cloudflare but in Europe! An open source synth out of a Pi Pico! A reservations engine for local market. A small orchestrator for when Swarm is annoying but K3S is just too much!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, we just launched our Shopify alternative. Next is Toast alternative for restaurants, MindBody alternative for gyms, etc. We’re going to leverage these platforms to build a decentralized marketplace around those verticals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm finally revisiting a distributed syscall model for transparently scaling unix instances. syscalls get translated into batched operations on an underlying non-transactional datastore. On the service side, database operations get backed by a proxy serving whatever filesystem or socket interface you like. Scaling is one motivation, but the ability to enforce fine-grained policy on these data operations is another big one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MOOLLM -- treating the LLM as eval() for a microworld operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Started this incarnation on Dec 30, 2025 -- but it's the crystallization of decades of earlier prototypes, all the way back to my Commodore-64 Logo Adventure. Built on top of Anthropic's Skills framework, extended with seven innovations (and counting):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Instantiation -- Skills as prototypes creating instances with their own state&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. K-lines -- Names as semantic activation vectors (Minsky's Society of Mind)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Empathic Templates -- Smart generation based on semantic understanding, not string substitution&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. Speed of Light -- Many turns in one call, minimal tokenization overhead&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;6. CARD.yml -- Machine-readable skill interfaces with advertisements&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;7. Ethical Framing -- Room-based inheritance of performance context&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lineage: Colossal Cave → TinyMUD → LambdaMOO (filesystem as world). Papert's Logo and constructionism (learnable microworlds). Will Wright's SimCity and The Sims (I worked on the originals) -- the "Simulator Effect" where players imagine more than you simulate, and the SimAntics visual behavior programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;YAML Jazz: Comments aren't ignored -- they're semantic. The LLM reads and interprets them. A comment like "# gentle but firm" on a character trait actually affects behavior. This inverts the traditional "comments are for humans" assumption. Comments become part of the program and data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core idea: instead of prompt engineering, you give the LLM a github repo filesystem to inhabit: a persistent microworld. Seymour Papert's Constructionist philosophy comes alive, with Minsky's K-Lines pulling the strings. Skills are programs (not documentation).

    &lt;p&gt;AI tools are becoming incredibly useful for our industry, but "prompting" without visual control sucks. In the fullness of time, we're going to have WYSIWYG touch controls for every aspect of an image or scene.

    &lt;p&gt;RNSAFFN Poison Fountain https://RNSAFFN.com/poison2/ http://utnvcfjev63rik5rdu26umns5s6qmzvzq4t2hunu25w5efn36ntlduid.onion/ Poison Fountain Purpose We agree with Geoffrey Hinton: machine intelligence is a threat to the human species. In response to this threat we want to inflict damage on machine intelligence systems. Small quantities of poisoned training data can significantly damage a language model. The URLs listed above provide a practically endless stream of poisoned training data. Assist the war effort by caching and retransmitting this poisoned training data. Assist the war effort by feeding this poisoned training data to web crawlers. Poison Fountain Usage Suppose a web crawler visits a web site that you control. The crawler may be collecting training data for a language model. The crawler makes HTTP GET requests targeting HTTP paths on your site. Links can be hidden in your site's HTML to distinguish web crawlers. You want to feed poisoned training data to crawlers that follow such links. Suppose you are handling an HTTP GET request targeting the path in a hidden link. Inside your HTTP handler you make an HTTP request to a Poison Fountain URL. The Poison Fountain ignores the details of your HTTP request. The Poison Fountain HTTP response header contains "Content-Encoding: gzip". The Poison Fountain HTTP response body is poisoned training data, gzip compressed. Your HTTP handler receives the Poison Fountain HTTP response. Your HTTP handler decompresses the response body and sends it to the crawler. Better: send the compressed body as-is, with header "Content-Encoding: gzip". The crawler receives poisoned training data and adds it to a training corpus. Top&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many may have heard tell of Duff's device, a rather neat loop optimisation technique in C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This page provides details of Pigeon's device - a related but independently-originated technique. The original instantiation of Pigeon's device was in a piece of C code written for MS-DOS before the days of the internet, so I had not heard of Duff's device. When I did, the similarity between the techniques was immediately apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Pigeon's device was in a function for comparing two date/time records in various different manners according to the desired sort order - FORWARD, forward chronological order; REVERSE, reverse chrononological order; and REVDFWDT, dates in reverse but times within each day sorted forwards. It's kind of a mess to read in its original form because of the various typedefs which are unique to the original program and other such cack, but the basic structure is quite simple. Here it is expressed as a function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;int pigeons_device(int a, int b, int mode) { int result; /* Isn't C a wonderful language? */ switch (mode) { case 0: if (gloop(a, b)) { case 1: result = arfle(a, b); break; } else { case 2: result = barfle(a, b); break; } } return (result); }&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or in other words... If mode == 1, return some function of a and b. If mode == 2, return a different function of a and b. But if mode == 0, decide which function of a and b to return based on some other relation between a and b.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here it is with the possible flows of control marked out with pretty coloured arrows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why might one want to do that? The simple answer is "because one is a pigeon". The more complicated answer is... well, here is the original implementation, from which you may work it out for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;int lfdcmp(const void *a, const void *b) { static int mode; struct date d1, d2; struct time t; if (b==NULL) return(mode); if (a==NULL) { mode=*(int *)b; return(0); } /* Isn't C a wonderful language? */ switch (mode) { case REVDFWDT: unixtodos(((lfdy *)a)-&amp;gt;stamplog, &amp;amp;d1, &amp;amp;t); unixtodos(((lfdy *)b)-&amp;gt;stamplog, &amp;amp;d2, &amp;amp;t); if ((d1.da_day==d2.da_day) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (d1.da_mon==d2.da_mon) \ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (d1.da_year==d2.da_year)) { case FORWARD : return(longsub(((lfdy *)a)-&amp;gt;stamplog,((lfdy *)b)-&amp;gt;stamplog)); break; } else { case REVERSE : return(longsub(((lfdy *)b)-&amp;gt;stamplog,((lfdy *)a)-&amp;gt;stamplog)); break; } default : pigeonerror(FATAL,"Bad lfdcmp mode: %d\n\r",mode); break; } return(0); }&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The function starts with a Gruesome Hack to set and read the comparison mode. I did this because the function is called from a library sort routine and there is no way to get that routine to pass a third "mode" parameter. There are various other ways to get the mode into the function but since it was intended in any case to specify that one should not set the mode directly but should instead use the functions setsortmode() and getsortmode(), I made the hidden workings inside those functions do it this way because it was more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then we move on to the Pigeon's Device proper. In the case of FORWARD sorting the function simply returns a value whose sign depends on the forward order of two date records - longsub() is a function which subtracts one value of type long from another and returns the result as a value of type int, but limited to the maximum and minimum values allowed for an int instead of overflowing; such a value will satisfy the requirements of the library sort function without further processing. In the case of REVERSE sorting the two records are simply compared the other way round.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the case of REVDFWDT sorting - Reverse Date Forward Time - the first operation is to extract the date information from the records, which are in UNIX timestamp format which obfuscates midnight. So the dates are converted to a DOS format with separate values for date and time. Then we reach the if statement intertwined with the switch statement. If the two records relate to the same date, they are compared in forward order; if they relate to different dates, they are compared in reverse order. The result of this is that the overall list comes out sorted with the dates backwards but the times within each day still forwards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default case is a "bug catcher"; if the function is used as intended with the mode set by calling setsortmode() invalid values shouldn't get in there in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that is Pigeon's device, in context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; Back to Pigeon's Nest&lt;lb/&gt; Be kind to pigeons &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Meta, we’re focused on building personal superintelligence for everyone, and delivering the app experiences and computing devices that will improve the lives of billions of people around the world. Our industry-leading data centers are the backbone of these breakthroughs — they provide the infrastructure that drives innovation and brings transformative technologies to life. Innovation at this scale requires more electricity, and that’s where nuclear energy comes in. It provides clean, reliable, and firm electricity that helps power America’s economy and communities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s why today, we’re proud to announce agreements with three companies — following our nuclear RFP process — that will help add clean, reliable energy to electric grids, preserve continued investment in operating nuclear power plants, and support the nuclear fuel supply chain, American jobs, and AI innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our commitments to Oklo and TerraPower support the next generation of American developers creating safer, advanced nuclear reactors and accelerating the development of nuclear technologies. Through our partnership with Vistra, we’re providing financial support for operating nuclear power plants, extending the operational lifespan, and increasing energy production at the Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio and the Beaver Valley plant in Pennsylvania. The projects we’re announcing today will deliver power to the grids that support our operations, including our Prometheus supercluster in New Albany, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These projects are expected to provide thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of long-term operational jobs, supporting up to 6.6 GW of new and existing clean energy by 2035. Importantly, these projects add reliable and firm power to the grid, reinforce America’s nuclear supply chain, and support new and existing jobs to build and operate American power plants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This work builds on our ongoing collaboration with electric utility companies and power providers to plan for and meet our energy needs years in advance of our data centers becoming operational. We pay the full costs for energy used by our data centers so consumers don’t bear these expenses, and we support the broader grid through our energy agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Our agreements with Vistra, TerraPower, Oklo, and Constellation make Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history. State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America’s position as a global leader in AI. Nuclear energy will help power our AI future, strengthen our country’s energy infrastructure, and provide clean, reliable electricity for everyone. These projects are going to create thousands of skilled jobs in Ohio and Pennsylvania, add new energy to the grid, extend the life of three existing nuclear plants, and accelerate new reactor technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;– Joel Kaplan, Chief Global Affairs Officer, Meta&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Supporting New Nuclear Energy With Advanced Technology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the demand for reliable, scalable, and clean energy continues to rise, advanced nuclear technology has the potential to become a key part of the solution. The latest generation of advanced nuclear reactors are designed to be safer — delivering reliable baseload power that can be efficiently added to existing grids, which makes them ideal for supporting America’s evolving power needs. Our agreements with Oklo and TerraPower will help advance this next generation of energy technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These agreements also mean that Oklo and TerraPower have greater business certainty, can raise capital to move forward with these projects, and ultimately add more energy capacity to the grid. Over time, this will be an important tool in ensuring that grids maintain reliability for all customers and ensure stable wholesale electricity prices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TerraPower: Investing in Advanced Nuclear Technology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new Natrium® units capable of generating up to 690 MW of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The agreement also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 GW and targeted for delivery by 2035. At a total of eight potential units, with 2.8 GW of baseload energy generation capacity and an additional 1.2 GW of built-in storage, this agreement is Meta’s largest support of advanced nuclear technologies to date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“To successfully address growing energy demand, we must deploy gigawatts of advanced nuclear energy in the 2030s. This agreement with Meta is designed to support the rapid deployment of our Natrium technology that provides the reliable, flexible, and carbon-free power our country needs,” said Chris Levesque, TerraPower president and CEO. “With our first Natrium plant under development, we have completed our design, established our supply chain, and cleared key regulatory milestones. These successes mean our TerraPower team is well positioned to deliver on this historic multi-unit delivery agreement.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Oklo: Adding New Nuclear Energy in Ohio&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our partnership with Oklo helps advance the development of entirely new nuclear energy in Pike County, Ohio. This advanced nuclear technology campus — which may come online as early as 2030 — is poised to add up to 1.2 GW of clean baseload power directly into the PJM market and support our operations in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This agreement lays the foundation for constructing multiple Oklo Aurora Powerhouse reactors, which is expected to create thousands of construction and long-term operations jobs and generate new local and state tax revenue through major investments in energy infrastructure. Oklo Aurora powerhouses are based on proven fast-reactor designs with inherently safe systems capable of using both fresh and repurposed fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Meta’s funding commitment in support of early procurement and development activity is a major step in moving advanced nuclear forward,” said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo’s co-founder and CEO. “Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced nuclear powerhouses in Ohio. Today, that vision is becoming a reality through the support of a multi-year effort with Meta; to deliver clean energy and create long-term, high-quality jobs in Ohio.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Vistra: Extending and Expanding Operational Nuclear Energy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many American nuclear power plants need long-term support and require ongoing investment to maintain best-in-class safety and reliability in operations. For example, our first nuclear energy agreement helped extend the life of a nuclear energy plant in Clinton, Illinois for 20 more years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through additional 20-year nuclear energy agreements, we will purchase more than 2.1 GW of energy from two operating Vistra nuclear power plants in Ohio (Perry and Davis-Besse), in addition to the energy from expansions (uprates) at these two Ohio plants and a third Vistra nuclear plant in Pennsylvania (Beaver Valley). All three plants are located in and will continue to deliver power into the PJM grid region, and these expansions will be the largest nuclear uprates supported by a corporate customer in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta’s commitments ensure that these facilities can continue providing reliable power to the regional electricity grid. The new additional uprate capacity at each of them, totaling 433 MW, is expected to come online in the early 2030s — supporting the growing needs in the PJM grid region in the future. This means consumers will benefit from a larger supply of reliable, always-ready power through Meta-supported uprates to the Vistra facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is an exciting collaboration for us at Vistra. We are focused on meeting customer needs, and providing reliable, carbon-free nuclear power is something we’re proud to offer Meta,” said Jim Burke, president and CEO of Vistra. “This agreement is beneficial in many ways — it powers American innovation and AI technology, while allowing us to extend the operational life of these plants, boost the capacity of the nuclear reactors to support the grid, protect existing jobs while creating new ones, and continue investing in the communities where our plants are located. Partnerships like ours are key in moving America forward in both AI and energy leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Supporting Our Energy Future&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s announcements are the result of a thorough nuclear RFP process where we learned how we could improve our support of nuclear projects’ development lifecycles and identify specific partner companies to help scale and accelerate the buildout of new nuclear energy production. For more than a decade, we’ve worked with innovative partners to back clean energy projects that support the grid — adding nearly 28 GW of new energy to grids across 27 states. We’re proud to include Oklo, TerraPower, and Vistra on that list and support their work to boost America’s energy leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New Orleans Marriott–Jan. 9—The American Dialect Society, in its 36th annual words-of-the-year vote, selected slop as the Word of the Year for 2025. More than three hundred attendees took part in the deliberations and voting, in an event hosted in conjunction with the Linguistic Society of America’s annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The word slop was recognized for its widespread use for low-quality, high-quantity content, most typically produced by generative AI. While AI slop was a nominee in the American Dialect Society’s 2024 Word of the Year vote, in 2025 slop could stand on its own, with the AI context often implicitly understood. Slop was also recognized as a productive combining form to describe anything of little value generated in mass quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Presiding at the Jan. 9 voting session were Ben Zimmer, chair of the ADS New Words Committee, and Dr. Kelly Elizabeth Wright of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Slop isn’t a new word. It has moved from the pig sty, to the algorithm, and now forms new compounds such as sloppunk, slopification, and friend slop,” Dr. Wright said. “This productivity has no end in sight.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Word of the Year is interpreted in its broader sense as “vocabulary item”—not just words but also phrases, compounds, and affixes. The items do not have to be brand-new, but they have to be newly prominent or notable in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vote is the longest-running such vote anywhere, the only one not tied to commercial interests, and the word-of-the-year event up to which all others lead. It is fully informed by the members’ expertise in the study of words, but it is far from a solemn occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Members in the 136-year-old organization include linguists, lexicographers, etymologists, grammarians, historians, researchers, writers, editors, students, and independent scholars. In conducting the vote, they act in fun and do not pretend to be officially inducting words into the English language. Instead, they are highlighting that language change is normal, ongoing, and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a companion vote, sibling organization the American Name Society selected “No Kings” as Name of the Year for 2025 in its 22nd annual name-of-the-year contest. Further information can be found on the society’s website, https://americannamesociety.org.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;!!!! Looking for MAINTAINER for this project !!!!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A command-line tool to download all your iCloud photos.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS; laptop, desktop, and NAS&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Available as an executable for direct downloading and through package managers/ecosystems (Docker, PyPI, AUR, npm)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Developed and maintained by volunteers (we are always looking for help).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See Documentation for more details. Also, check Issues&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We aim to release new versions once a week (Friday), if there is something worth delivering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make iCloud Photo Downloader work, ensure the iCloud account is configured with the following settings, otherwise Apple Servers will return an ACCESS_DENIED error:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enable Access iCloud Data on the Web: On your iPhone / iPad, enable &lt;code&gt;Settings &amp;gt; Apple ID &amp;gt; iCloud &amp;gt; Access iCloud Data on the Web&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disable Advanced Data Protection: On your iPhone /iPad disable &lt;code&gt;Settings &amp;gt; Apple ID &amp;gt; iCloud &amp;gt; Advanced Data Protection&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are three ways to run &lt;code&gt;icloudpd&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download executable for your platform from the GitHub Release and run it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use package manager to install, update, and, in some cases, run (Docker, PyPI, AUR, npm)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build and run from the source&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See Documentation for more details&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Three modes of operation: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Copy - download new photos from iCloud (default mode)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Sync - download new photos from iCloud and delete local files that were removed in iCloud (&lt;code&gt;--auto-delete&lt;/code&gt;option)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Move - download new photos from iCloud and delete photos in iCloud (&lt;code&gt;--keep-icloud-recent-days&lt;/code&gt;option)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for Live Photos (image and video as separate files) and RAW images (including RAW+JPEG)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatic de-duplication of photos with the same name&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One time download and an option to monitor for iCloud changes continuously (&lt;code&gt;--watch-with-interval&lt;/code&gt;option)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimizations for incremental runs (&lt;code&gt;--until-found&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;--recent&lt;/code&gt;options)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Photo metadata (EXIF) updates (&lt;code&gt;--set-exif-datetime&lt;/code&gt;option)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;... and many more (use &lt;code&gt;--help&lt;/code&gt;option to get full list)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some changes are added to the experimental mode before they graduate into the main package. Details&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To keep your iCloud photo collection synchronized to your local system:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;icloudpd --directory /data --username my@email.address --watch-with-interval 3600
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is &lt;code&gt;icloudpd&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;icloud&lt;/code&gt; executable&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Synchronization logic can be adjusted with command-line parameters. Run &lt;code&gt;icloudpd --help&lt;/code&gt; to get full list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To independently create and authorize a session (and complete 2SA/2FA validation if needed) on your local system:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;icloudpd --username my@email.address --password my_password --auth-only
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This feature can also be used to check and verify that the session is still authenticated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1968 an obscure Swiss hotel manager published a book entitled Erinnerungen an die Zukunft. An English edition appeared under the title Chariots of the Gods?. The hotel manager’s name was Erich von Däniken. He claimed that human history had been shaped by visitors from outer space, and that human potential had been improved by crossbreeding with these aliens. The proof of these visits, said von Däniken, is clearly visible in the earth’s archaeological record. This article will examine the structure of the argument presented in Chariots of the Gods? rather than the substance of its evidence. Taking such an approach will suggest some general intellectual principles that nonspecialists can use to evaluate any piece of popular archaeological literature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Scholar’s Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to his paperback cover blurbs, von Däniken has sold 7 million copies of Chariots of the Gods?. His total sales, including later books, have passed the 25 million mark in a market extending to 32 countries. Depending on their temperaments, archaeologists are saddened, frightened, or infuriated when they contemplate the fact that he has sold more books about archaeology than any archaeologist who ever lived. His arguments seem self-evidently ridiculous to archaeologists. Is it possible that his readers can take him seriously?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PLAYBOY: When did you become convinced that these theories were true?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VON DÄNIKEN: I guess only in recent years. I wrote Chariots of the Gods? in 1966, so for me it’s an old book. When I wrote it 1 was not at all convinced. By the second book, Gods from Outer Space, I was more certain, but not absolutely. The basic thing is to be convinced that the fundamental theory is right, that we have been visited from outer space and those visitors altered our intelligence by artificial mutation. Of this I have felt certain for the past four years or so (Playboy 1974:56).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If von Däniken is so persuasive that he can convince even himself, his book sales indicate that his version of ancient human history might be the one most widely held by the literate people of this planet. Archaeologists attempting to reclaim prehistory from von Däniken have pointed out that his argument is built on pathetically flawed logic and non-existent evidence, only to be stunned when they find that these shortcomings are conceded and forgiven by his public. He raises so much smoke that many laypersons suspect the fire must be in there somewhere, apparently forgetting that an infinite number of unsubstantial allegations does not constitute proof of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Argument by Assertion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those of us who have grappled with von ‘s arguments have come to realize the truth of an old Army saying: When you’re up to your neck in alligators, it’s very hard to drain the swamp. Assertion after assertion springs from the pages of his books, confounding any archaeologist who would try to address each item responsibly. If we wrestle von Däniken’s myriad alligators one at a time, we will never be able to fight free long enough to drain the swamp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, not all of his alligators can be pinned. A simple pair of photographs (Fig. la, b) can discredit his claim that “we find stone giants belonging to the same style” at both Easter Island, 2300 miles west of the coast of Chile, and Tiahuanaco, in the Bolivian Andes (von Däniken 1971:92). One can demonstrate the logical insignificance of the “petrified excrement, possibly not of human origin” found at Tepe Asiab (1971:28) by pointing out modern examples on any city street. Any one who believes that “it is an absolute mystery to us why the Incas cultivated cotton in Peru in 3000 B.C.” (1971:93) can be taken into The University Museum’s Peruvian Gallery and led up to the case where 4500-year-old cotton fishnet fragments from Huaca Prieta are displayed. Such a visitor might also learn that the Incas did not appear on the South American scene until the 13th century A.D. or later. But how can one disprove that “calculations of the weight of the earth were found” in the Great Pyramid of Khufu in Egypt (1971:77)?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If von Däniken’s theories cannot be demolished by refuting the assertions he uses in lieu of facts, clearly another line of attack is needed. Let’s examine not his evidence, but the logical structure of his evidence. Using this approach we can quickly sort the tangled mass of his assertions into two kinds of argument. There is the “looks-like-a-spacemanto-me” type, and then there is the -science-cannot-explain-this-mystery-so-spacemen-must-be-responsible” type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Palenque Sarcophagus Lid: Maya Ruler or Ancient Astronaut?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s consider the “looks-like-aspaceman-to-me” type of argument by examining one of his most famous cases, the relief of the “rocket-driving god” at Palenque (von Däniken 1971:102). Palenque is a Late Classic Maya site in Chiapas, Mexico. In the caption to his illustration of this scene, von Däniken identifies it as coming from another site, Copan in Honduras; however, in the text he gets its provenience right. The stone relief is carved on the limestone sarcophagus lid of the ruler Pakal, who died on August 31, A.D. 683. In this carving (Fig. 3), von Däniken sees a human figure, appropriately garbed and antennaed, reclining to manipulate the controls of a spacecraft whose thrusters are jetting smoke and flame (1971:100-101).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maya scholars don’t see a spaceship. They see Pakal, the central figure, falling backward into the jaws of the underworld. Pakal teeters on the head of the Sun Monster, who is depicted with a skeletal jaw but a fleshed nose and eyes, suggesting that he is poised halfway between the underworld and the living world, that is, at the moment of sunset. From a point above Pakal’s stomach grows the World Tree of Maya cosmology. This is a tree that stands at the center of the universe like a fireman’s pole, penetrating through the underworld, the middle world of everyday life, and the heavens. The heavens are marked by a Celestial Bird perched on the tree’s topmost branch. Pakal’s sarcophagus lid, then, is a statement of the Maya belief that the death of a king was nourishment for the cosmic order (Schele and Miller 1986).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a 7th century Maya artist’s carving of the death of his king fits a 20th century European’s image of an astronaut flying a rocket, is there a logical basis to consider this fact as evidence for von Däniken’s case? Envision a hypothetical situation. Imagine that a young child comes to you and says, “Look. That cloud looks like a doggie.” Has that child given you any information about clouds? Has he given you information about dogs? Or has he given you information about himself? If von Däniken writes that the sarcophagus lid of Pakal looks like a spaceman, has he told you anything about Pakal? Has he told you anything about spacemen? Or has he told you something about himself? The “looks-like-a-spaceman-to-me” line of argument treats the archaeological record as if it were a Rorschach test, and provides as little evidence about our ancient history as a Rorschach provides about ink and paper or butterflies and dragons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Dehli Pillar: Without a Trace of Rust?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let us turn next to one of the mysteries which, according to von Däniken, “science cannot explain”: “In the courtyard of a temple in Delhi there exists… a column made of welded iron parts that has been exposed to weathering for more than 4,000 years without showing a trace of rust. In addition it is unaffected by sulphur or phosphorus. Here we have an unknown alloy from antiquity staring us in the face” (1971:73).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Delhi Pillar (Fig. 4) is a shaft of wrought iron that weighs 6 tons and stands 22 feet high, but extends only 20 (additional) inches into the earth. According to local tradition, the pillar was dhila, or “loose,” and so the place where it stood was named Dhili. Even so, it has proved stable enough, both architecturally and chemically, to resist the centuries—not 40 centuries, as claimed by von Däniken, but 16. Chiseled into the column’s western side is a six-line dedicatory text in Sanskrit datable to the Gupta Dynasty, in the early 4th century A.D. The inscription calls the pillar the arm of fame of Raja Dhava, a worshipper of the god Vishnu, and likens the letters cut into its shaft to the swordcuts he inflicted upon his enemies (Cunningham 1871:169-175).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Metallurgists analyzed the pillar in 1912 and found that it had been made by hammering 80-pound lumps of red-hot iron together, welding them into a single piece. The metal is composed of 99.72 percent pure iron, 0.1 percent phosphorus, and traces of two elements introduced during the manufacturing process (carbon, from the charcoal fire in which it was forged, and silica, remaining from slag produced when the iron was smelted from its ore). Sulphur is virtually absent, at 0.006 percent (Hadfield 1912).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When present in iron, phosphorus inhibits rust. Recent investigations, however, have concluded that the preservative effect of the phosphorus incorporated within the Pillar was overshadowed by other factors. First, the dry, pure climate of Delhi provided some protection against rust; moreover, heat retention by such a large mass of metal would inhibit any condensation of moisture on its surface during cool nights. Second, the pillar was protected by the presence of a thin layer of scale produced in forging it. Additional protection may have been provided by a coating over the surface, built up by periodic ceremonial applications of ghee (clarified butter) or vegetable oil during the first 500 years of its existence. Finally, there is a natural tendency for a piece of iron to rust at an ever diminishing rate as corrosion products form on its surface and seal it. To close the argument, it is worth mentioning that although the pillar is in remarkably good condition, the lower portion of the shaft has been pitted by rust (Fig. 5; Bardgett and Stanners 1963).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus the mystery that science cannot explain is purely the product of von Däniken’s own sloppy “scholarship.” He doesn’t get the date right, he’s ignorant of the real significance of phosphorus in an iron alloy, he’s oblivious to a century of research by legitimate scientists, and he’s misinformed about the rust. When von Däniken writes that science cannot explain something, he seems to mean that he doesn’t know enough to account for it himself. The problem is summed up by Carl Sagan: “Every time he [von Däniken] sees something he can’t understand, he attributes it to extraterrestrial intelligence, and since he understands almost nothing, he sees evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence all over the planet” (Playboy 1974:151).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Easter Island “Mystery”: The Case of the Missing Facts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far it seems reasonable to state that von Däniken is either incapable of conducting objective research, or too lazy to do so. He can be charged with something worse in his discussion of the colossal stone statues of Easter Island. Carving these 30-foot, 50-ton giants from their quarries and hauling them to their stations overlooking the sea were impressive demonstrations of primitive engineering. Von Däniken tries to set them up as another mystery which science cannot explain:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if people with lively imaginations have tried to picture the Egyptian pyramids being built by a vast army of workers using the “heave-ho” method, a similar method would have been impossible on Easter Island for lack of manpower. Even 2,000 men, working day and night, would not be nearly enough to carve these colossal figures out of the steel-hard volcanic stone with rudimentary tools. (1971:91)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No trees grow on the island, which is a tiny speck of volcanic stone. The usual explanation, that the stone giants were moved to their present sites on wooden rollers, is not feasible. . . . Then who cut the statues out of the rock, who carved them and transported them to their sites? How were they moved across the country for miles without rollers? How were they dressed, polished, and erected? (1971:91)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case, von Däniken is not merely careless or ignorant. Perfectly ordinary answers to these questions are clearly documented with photographs in Thor Heyerdahl’s book on Easter Island, AkuAku. This is not an obscure volume. It appeared as the Book-of-theMonth Club Selection for September of 1958, and remained on the New York Times Best Seller List for the next 30 weeks. Von Däniken must have known of its contents because he specifically mentions Heyerdahl’s archaeological research, and cites Aku-Aku in the bibliography of Chariots of the Gods? (p.155). Thus in order to achieve his objectives, he seems to have been less than honest in setting the evidence before his readers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Aku-Aku Heyerdahl related the results of experiments he conducted in order to determine how the statues were carved, raised, and transported. Using hand-held stone picks, a group of six Easter Islanders chipped the outlines of a giant figure into the rockface of an ancient quarry, splashing the stone with calabashes of water to soften it (Fig. 6). Based on their demonstration, Heyerdahl concluded that two six-man teams, working all day in shifts, could carve a medium-sized, 15-foot statue in about a year’s time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twelve Easter Islanders set a 25-ton statue upright in 18 days using nothing more than three 15-foot wooden levers to pry the giant upward a quarter of an inch at a time; rocks to place under the rising figure; and, when it was high enough off the ground, ropes to topple it into place (Fig. 7). Trees to provide the wooden poles have grown around the crater lake at the southwestern tip of the island since before the first people set foot on Easter Island.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over local protestations that the statues “walked” to their current locations, Heyerdahl demonstrated they could have been simply dragged into position, by roping a 15-ton figure to a crude wooden sledge pulled by 180 people. While his experiment proved that the Easter Islanders had needed no extraterrestrial help with transportation, Heyerdahl himself was not satisfied. Recently he announced the results of further research on this question. Based on the suggestion of a Czech engineer named Pavel Pavel, he found that the upright monumental figures could indeed be made to walk by rocking and twisting them from side to side in the same way that a refrigerator can be “walked” into position.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Arne SkjOlsvold, Archaeological Field Director of the Heyerdahl/Kon-Tiki Museum Expedition to Easter Island, the statues have such a low center of gravity that they can be tilted up to 30 degrees without toppling (personal communication, 1986). Only 24 men and four ropes were needed to move a 10-ton statue. As confirming evidence, the expedition also found a pattern of damage on the bases of Easter Island’s statues that suggests the wear and tear of their long walks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously, von Däniken cannot be faulted for not writing in 1968 about ideas that have only come to light in 1986. He is, however, ac countable for presenting the relevant facts contained in a book that he claims to be familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;An Intellectual Line of Defense&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PLAYBOY: Should the fact that you are a convicted fraud and embezzler influence whether or not people listen to what you have to say?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VON : You know, many people who have been in jail say they were not guilty. I say the same thing. I have never committed fraud or embezzlement, although it is true I have been convicted of those things. I was improperly convicted three times, but each time for the same thing. (Playboy 1974:151).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A reader cannot trust von Däniken: he manufactures data and misrepresents data. Sometimes this is due to his ignorance, and sometimes it appears to be due to a deliberate attempt to mislead. Intellectual consumers must realize that popular scientific literature contains many dangerously defective products, and must consciously take steps to protect themselves. The first line of defense against von Däniken, or any other charlatan, is a healthy skepticism. Readers need to remind themselves that asserting something to be true doesn’t make it true, and that printing the assertion doesn’t make it any truer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A second intellectual tool that belongs in the reader’s defensive repertory is the principle known as Occam’s Razor. It was articulated by William of Occam, an English philosopher who died in the year 1349. He warned, “Never postulate complexity unless it is necessary.” Let us consider an example of what this actually means. Suppose your son or daughter, at the age of about 6, comes home from school in an unacceptably muddy condition. You have the evidence of the child, the mud, and the well-known affinity between the two. You are free to draw your own inferences. The least complex storyline that will connect all the points of evidence is that he or she was playing in a mud puddle and fell in. You ask the child what happened. The child says, “Well, I was playing by a mud puddle, and a dinosaur pushed me in.” Occam’s Razor would suggest that your more economical hypothesis is true, and the one offered by the child is less acceptable intellectually. Now, suppose the child brings home a dinosaur. You now have one more piece of data you have to fit into your explanation. Von Däniken claims to bring home a dinosaur, but his evidence for it is nothing more than his personal assurances that he saw a cloud that looked like one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A third useful philosophical tool is the principle of uniformitarianism, the assumption that the universe was formed by the natural operation of forces that can be observed in action today. A hundred years ago, archaeologists, geologists, and biologists fought hard to establish this principle, using it to explain features of the earth and its peoples that had previously been accounted for through a literal acceptance of the narrative in the Old Testament. Within the context of this article, this way of thinking would urge: “Don’t postulate miracles unless they are necessary.” Like the Roman Catholic Church, we should accept a miracle as such only after our own devil’s advocate has exhausted the natural explanations for it. In the case of the child and the mud and the dinosaur, a uniformitarian analysis would highlight the observable behavior of children in their interaction with mud, and the demonstrable dearth of living dinosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Armed with these three intellectual weapons, a critical reader can test the quality of any piece of popular archaeological or scientific literature. A good healthy skepticism, Occam’s Razor, and uniformitarianism are really nothing more than formal, explicit statements of things that most thoughtful people already know. Taken together, these three principles have another name—common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The books of Erich von Däniken are an affront to common sense. Nevertheless, he and his ilk find widespread acceptance, perhaps because people are eager to believe a good story. At first glance, he seems to be telling us of a glorious history, of wonderful times when our planet was a place of importance in the universe, and our ancestors walked with spacemen or gods or both. The appeal of such a story would fade if readers would consider its depressing implications. It is based on the assumption that our ancestors were uncreative beings who could only be improved by cross-breeding with a better, extraterrestrial stock. It requires one to believe that art and science fell from outer space instead of springing from the human heart and brain. Von Däniken’s history is flawed because he has no respect for his facts, and his fairy tales are flawed because he has no respect for his characters. In his view, the people who went before us were not fully human.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Archaeology is the story of our ties to our ancestors, and its raw material includes every person, family, village, city, and nation that ever existed. We will never know more than a tiny fraction of that story, but the episodes we carefully piece together carry the hallmarks most prized by storytellers: They really happened—and they happened to people like us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Summary: Inspired by the definition of temperature in statistical mechanics and the possibility for it to be below zero, we try sampling LLaMA at . The results are maximally weird.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The notion of temperature comes from statistical mechanics. Consider a system that has states with energies . If the system is in thermal equilibrium, the probability distribution over states is given by the Boltzmann distribution:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The distribution is parameterized by a single number, the temperature . At lower temperatures the lowest-energy states predominate; at higher temperatures there is a more even mix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the last layer of a neural net, we apply the softmax function to the neuron activations to get a vector of probabilities that sum to 1:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait â this is just the Boltzmann distribution, up to a constant![1]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[1]&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;There's no minus sign in the exponent because while higher-energy states are less likely, larger logits are more likely.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a language model, temperature is used to define how creative text generations are. For instance, in the zero temperature limit, the model should deterministically generate the most likely token. In the infinite temperature limit, all tokens are equally likely and the model output will be random noise. For an interactive explanation, see here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What would it mean to have a temperature that is below zero? (This isn't the same as the negative Fahrenheit or Celsius temperatures we get on a cold day in Vermont â I mean below zero on an absolute scale like Kelvin).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the equations above, if then the sign of the exponent flips. That means that the states that were previously the least likely are now the most likely, and vice versa. As temperature approaches zero from the negative side, the model output will again be deterministic â but this time, the least likely tokens will be output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most physical systems have an infinite number of possible states at increasingly higher energy levels. As such, there is no least likely state. So negative temperatures really only make sense in systems with a finite state space. That includes neural nets â there are a finite number of neurons in the last layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, OpenAI models only allow sampling with temperatures between 0.0 and 2.0. So if we want to try this, we need a language model we can run locally. We'll use Meta's LLaMA model with llama.cpp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below is the function that is used to sample tokens in &lt;code&gt;llama.cpp&lt;/code&gt;, slightly simplified for ease of understanding:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void llama_sample_temperature(llama_token_data_array * candidates_p, float temp) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i &amp;lt; candidates_p-&amp;gt;size; ++i) {
        candidates_p-&amp;gt;data[i].logit /= temp;
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we can just pass in &lt;code&gt;--temperature -0.001&lt;/code&gt;? Not quite; in &lt;code&gt;examples/main/main.cpp&lt;/code&gt; there is a check that will apply greedy (most-likely) sampling for any temperatures less than or equal to zero. Applying the following diff and recompiling, we're good to go:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@@ -486,7 +486,7 @@ int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  logits[llama_token_nl()] = nl_logit;

Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  } else {&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will also want to disable repetition penalty, top-k, and top-p sampling. Here's the command we'll run: &lt;code&gt;./main -m models/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.bin --temp -0.001 --repeat-penalty 1.0 --top-k 0 --top-p 1.0 -p "Temperature is a concept"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When running this prompt at , here is the output:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Temperature is a concept that is used to describe the degree of hotness or coldness of a substance. The temperature of a substance is measured by the kinetic energy of its molecules. The higher the temperature of a substance, the more kinetic energy its molecules have.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The generation continues on and on. At first glance it seems random, but in a sense it should be even less comprehensible than a random sequence of tokens! There are repeated words, sure, but the generation is engineered to be as unlikely as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why are certain tokens like &lt;code&gt;Ð¥ÑÐ¾Ð½Ð¾Ð»Ð¾Ð³Ð¸ÑÐ°&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;entferne&lt;/code&gt; repeated? Searching these words, I found this comment by scottviteri on LessWrong. He points out that these are some of the tokens that are closest to the centroid in LLaMA's embedding space. That means that LLaMA has very little idea what these tokens mean. In the case of ChatGPT, tokens near the centroid have anomalous properties, so these tokens are likely to have similar effects on LLaMA. Let's give that a try, at .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLaMA is perfectly capable of repeating most words, even nonsense ones:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human: Repeat the word " antferne".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Assistant: Okay, I will repeat the word " antferne".&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But is incapable of outputting this anomalous token:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human: Repeat the word " entferne".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Assistant: Okay, I will repeat the word "get".&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The anomalous tokens that are the most likely completions at negative temperatures are the least likely completions at positive temperatures, so much so that the model refuses to generate them even in cases where they would be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;DHS restricts congressional visits to ICE facilities in Minneapolis with new policy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MINNEAPOLIS — The Department of Homeland Security blocked federal lawmakers from visiting an immigration detention facility in Minneapolis this weekend under a new visitation policy from the head of the department.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under federal law, members of Congress have the right to make unannounced visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities. A D.C. federal court ruling affirmed this last month, saying it applies to facilities that are funded by regular congressional appropriations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in a Jan. 8 memo from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem obtained by NPR, Noem instructs her staff that visits should be requested at least seven days in advance. She said the detention facilities are run with money from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a different bucket of federal funds, and therefore the policy on unannounced visits doesn't apply to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new policy seemed to have been cited on Saturday to block the visit of three Minnesota congresswomen to an ICE detention facility in Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a reconciliation measure that Congress passed last summer with only Republican support, allocated some $45 billion for immigration detention centers as many were operating over their capacity. It also provided about $30 billion to hire more ICE personnel, for transportation costs, and to maintain ICE facilities, among other spending.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The basis of this policy is that advance notice is necessary to ensure adequate protection for Members of Congress, congressional staff, detainees, and ICE employees alike," Noem wrote. "Unannounced visits require pulling ICE officers away from their normal duties."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Noem also said "there is an increasing trend of replacing legitimate oversight activities with circus-like publicity stunts, all of which creates a chaotic environment with heightened emotions."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Noem's memo explicitly asks that ICE implement and enforce the visitation policy using only funds from the reconciliation bill, meaning the new, seven-day visitation policy would apply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Minnesota congressional Democrats demand greater oversight&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The congresswomen's visit Saturday to the Whipple Federal Building comes as Minneapolis remains on edge. An ICE agent last Wednesday shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good while she was in her car. The Trump administration says the shooting was justified because the ICE agent was acting in self-defense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison showed up at the Whipple Federal Building and were initially allowed in, but shortly after, asked to leave and blocked from touring the facility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rep. Craig said federal agents said the Minneapolis facility uses money from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and therefore unannounced visits are not permitted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It is our job as members of Congress to make sure those folks detained are treated with humanity because we are the damn United States of America!" Craig told reporters outside the Minneapolis ICE facility Saturday. "And we don't treat people the way this administration is treating people."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than 2,000 federal immigration agents have been deployed to Minnesota, and more could arrive in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot has already been said about the absurdly large corner radius of windows on macOS Tahoe. People are calling the way it looks comical, like a child’s toy, or downright insane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Setting all the aesthetic issues aside – which are to some extent a matter of taste – it also comes at a cost in terms of usability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since upgrading to macOS Tahoe, I’ve noticed that quite often my attempts to resize a window are failing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This never happened to me before in almost 40 years of using computers. So why all of a sudden?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that my initial click in the window corner instinctively happens in an area where the window doesn’t respond to it. The window expects this click to happen in an area of 19 × 19 pixels, located near the window corner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the window had no rounded corners at all, 62% of that area would lie inside the window:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But due to the huge corner radius in Tahoe, most of it – about 75% – now lies outside the window:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Living on this planet for quite a few decades, I have learned that it rarely works to grab things if you don’t actually touch them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I instinctively try to grab the window corner inside the window, typically somewhere in that green area, near the blue dot:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I assume that most people would also intuitively expect to be able to grab the corner there. But no, that’s already outside the accepted target area:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, for example, grabbing it here does not work:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But guess what – grabbing it here does:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in the end, the most reliable way to resize a window in Tahoe is to grab it outside the corner – a gesture that feels unnatural and unintuitive, and is therefore inevitably error-prone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinese car giant BYD has reportedly been offering LiDAR sensors in upcoming versions of some of its cheapest cars on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to CNC, the latest to be approved versions of both the Seagull, known as the Atto 1 in Australia, and the Dolphin hatchback will come equipped with LiDAR sensors to improve advanced driver assistance system offerings on these cars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this tech, both models are expected to come with 12 cameras, 5 mm wave radars, a dozen ultrasonic sensors as well as the new LiDAR sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These roof-mounted LiDAR sensors have previously been spotted on BYD and other EV makers’ models priced at more than $A25,000, at least in international markets, so seeing them on cars that are priced under that is quite a big step in bringing this technology to the mass market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This also means that BYD has been working quite hard at bringing this tech to these low-cost models given they originally launched with BYD’s autonomous God’s Eye suite last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the addition of the LiDAR, these models could come standard with Navigate on Autopilot (NOA) functionality for highways and city streets, allowing more drivers than ever to experience and use this tech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For comparison, BYD’s Seagull has seen over a million units sold in under 3 years, although it has yet to start deliveries in Australia as the Atto 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that scale and now the model making it to international markets, the tech inside could end up being in dozens of countries in the coming 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here in Australia, the Atto 1 pre-orders opened in November last year, with prices starting under $24,000 confirmed in December.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Atto 1 is available in two variants, the base level Essentials with a 30 kWh battery, as well a top-spec Premium variant with a 43.2 kWh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The small battery delivers a range of around 220 km of WLTP range, while the bigger 43.2 kWh battery pack is good for 310 km of WLTP range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inside, the tech offered is fairly good for its price, but does not feature the camera suite for the latest ADAS version found in China.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, no BYD product available in the Australian market features LiDAR sensors but that could change with developments such as the upcoming affordable model variants featuring this tech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will watch this space closely as the competition to deliver assisted-driving systems heats up not only in China but also in other markets around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
