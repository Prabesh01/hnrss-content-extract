  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;bidicalc&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any normal spreadsheet, when you change values that are the input to some formulas, the outputs are automatically updated:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could it also work the other way? What if you could also change the output, and have the inputs be updated to match the formula?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past few months I've been &lt;del&gt;obsessed&lt;/del&gt; really curious about this idea. But there were so many questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Would it even be possible at all?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Could it work with very complex formulas? With exponents? With advanced math functions like &lt;code&gt;log()&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;abs()&lt;/code&gt;, etc?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How would the UX work? In a normal spreadsheet, when you click on a cell that has a formula, you get to change the formula's expression. I would need a way to let the user change either the formula's expression or the cell's numeric value.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What should happen if there are multiple possible solutions? Like in the example above, if you set &lt;code&gt;A3&lt;/code&gt;to 100, should the result be 50/50, 20/80, -10000/10100? When there is a infinite number of possible solutions, how to pick one?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Could it work with chained formulas? Could I build a long chain of formulas, update the final value and find the matching inputs all the way backwards?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok, now let's just skip to the good part! Today I'm happy to introduce:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;User guide&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Type of cells&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Variables&lt;lb/&gt; A simple number entered in a cell is a variable: &lt;code&gt;1.0&lt;/code&gt;. It may be changed by the solver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Constant&lt;lb/&gt; A number prefixed by a hash &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; is a constant. It will not be changed by the solver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Text&lt;lb/&gt; Cells can be in text mode. To input text, wrap in double quotes: &lt;code&gt;"Distance (km)"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Formula&lt;lb/&gt; Formulas can be entered in a cell (the traditional &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; prefix is optional), for example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;A1 + A2
A1 + A2*(A3 - A1)^2
exp(A1)
#A1 + H5 * #H6
cos(2*pi())&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result of formulas will be automatically updated when an input they depend on changes. This is the usual forward update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The magic of bidicalc is that once a formula has been computed, you can change the result. Bidicalc will walk "upstream" to change variable cells so that the formula's result matches the change you made. This is the backward update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TIP&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To change a cell formula's expression instead of its result, click on the F icon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Supported functions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Arithmetic operators: addition &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, subtraction&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, multiplication&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, division&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, exponentiation&lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;sqrt(x)&lt;/code&gt;: square root of&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;pow(a, b)&lt;/code&gt;: exponentiation,&lt;mjx-container&gt;raised to the power of&lt;/mjx-container&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;pi()&lt;/code&gt;: the&lt;mjx-container&gt;constant&lt;/mjx-container&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;abs(x)&lt;/code&gt;: absolute value of&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;log(x)&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ln(x)&lt;/code&gt;: natural logarithm of&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;exp(x)&lt;/code&gt;: exponential, the value of&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;cos(x)&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;sin(x)&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;tan(x)&lt;/code&gt;: cosine / sine / tangent&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Keyboard shortcuts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl + &amp;lt;arrows&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; - Navigate the grid&lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt; - Move down&lt;code&gt;Shift-Enter&lt;/code&gt; - Move up&lt;code&gt;Tab&lt;/code&gt; - Move right&lt;code&gt;Shift-Tab&lt;/code&gt; - Move left&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The backwards solver&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solver will try its best to find a solution. However it can fail in different ways:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution is incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;This is a bug and should not happen: please report it on GitHub, thank you!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The solver reports "no solution", but there is one. This could be a bug in the solver, or you have found a particularly difficult root finding problem that has solutions that are very difficult to find using floating point arithmetic. Please report it on GitHub so I can use it to improve the solver 😃&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution is technically correct but unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;This can happen for a large class of problems, typically when there are a lot of free variables (the problem is heavily underdetermined) and the solution manifold is weird. For example, try to solve&lt;code&gt;a*b*c = 1&lt;/code&gt;to see this in action. To combat this, you can:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Set some variables to constants using the hash syntax, i.e.: &lt;code&gt;#50&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Reformulate the problem with fewer free variables.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Wait for me to implement more features like domain restrictions of variables.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Suggest improvements to the open-source solver on GitHub.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set some variables to constants using the hash syntax, i.e.: &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DANGER&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind this is an experiment I made for fun because I like math and spreadsheets. If you need to do root finding to compute the load tolerance of a one milion ton suspended bridge please don't use bidicalc 😄&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How does it work?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even a normal spreadsheet is fairly complex beast. But the novel thing about bidicalc is the backwards solver. Mathematically, updating a spreadsheet "backward" is a (potentially underdetermined) root finding problem, because we are trying to find a vector of unknowns &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The actual root-finding solver is a custom algorithm that I made. It a general purpose algorithm that will find one root of any continuous-almost-everywhere function for which a complete syntactic expression is known. It uses a mix of continuous constraint propagation on interval union arithmetic , directional Newton's method and dichotomic search. It is of course limited by floating point precision and available computation time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bidicalc is written in TypeScript and entirely open-source under the AGPL licence. This means that you can freely reuse, modify, and share bidicalc as long as you make the complete source code of your modified version available under the same licence. If you are interested in buying bidicalc under a different licence please get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven't taken the time to write a full deep-dive mathematical explanation of how it works, but if you are interested in that please let me know. I might find some time to do it if there is interest from fellow math nerds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Future improvements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I kept improving bidicalc until it was perfect I would have never released it. So currently it is imperfect and could be improved in a number of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Domain restriction for variables. Currently the solver may assign any value in the interval &lt;mjx-container&gt;. I'd like to add special syntax so that variable cells can be restricted by the user to a specific interval. This would allow guiding the solver and saying that you only want this cell to be positive, of to be between 1 and 100, for example.&lt;/mjx-container&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Solver improvements. The algorithm works well enough for simple problems so I'm happy to publish in this current state, but could always be improved. There are a milion ways to improve it in the future so that it finds better solutions, particularly for highly underdetermined cases.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;float64 gradients support. Due to a pretty obscure technical limitation of tensorflowjs (that I use to compute gradients), the backward solver is partially limited to single precision, even though the forward solver uses double precision via native JS numbers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UX improvements. I am not very good at front-end dev 😄. I have learned vuejs to be able to make the UX for bidicalc but I'm not great at it. A spreadsheet interface is actually a massive state machine of complex and subtle behavior, it's a very interesting project and tricky to get right. As you can see, I've decided to skip the usual spreadsheet design principle that cells have two selection states: soft selected which enables dragging, selection, etc. and hard selected which enables changing the content of the cell. bidicalc is simply a CSS grid of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;elements.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Move cell computation off the main thread. The solver is single threaded and happens in the UI thread. It should be moved to a web worker to avoid locking the UI.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About me&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My name is Victor Poughon, I enjoy math and open-source software. If you want to see me do more stuff like this consider sponsoring me on GitHub or Buying me a coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Robots designed for the era of AI&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our mission is to free humans from physical labor with robotics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We imagine a future where robots handle the essential, repetitive work and humans are free to create, connect, and pursue what truly matters to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To build that future we’re starting from the ground up with hardware. Our first product is a California-designed and assembled humanoid arm. Surrounding it, we’re developing advanced controls, intuitive data collection, and a full AI stack that makes deployment effortless in real industrial environments. We’re proving it on our own assembly line first.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
  &lt;comments/&gt;
&lt;/doc&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46237081</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 21:00:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Ensuring a National Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence</title><link>https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/eliminating-state-law-obstruction-of-national-artificial-intelligence-policy/</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="cc9ef3447e3218cb"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Section 1. Purpose. United States leadership in Artificial Intelligence (AI) will promote United States national and economic security and dominance across many domains. Pursuant to Executive Order 14179 of January 23, 2025 (Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence), I revoked my predecessor’s attempt to paralyze this industry and directed my Administration to remove barriers to United States AI leadership. My Administration has already done tremendous work to advance that objective, including by updating existing Federal regulatory frameworks to remove barriers to and encourage adoption of AI applications across sectors. These efforts have already delivered tremendous benefits to the American people and led to trillions of dollars of investments across the country. But we remain in the earliest days of this technological revolution and are in a race with adversaries for supremacy within it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To win, United States AI companies must be free to innovate without cumbersome regulation. But excessive State regulation thwarts this imperative. First, State-by-State regulation by definition creates a patchwork of 50 different regulatory regimes that makes compliance more challenging, particularly for start-ups. Second, State laws are increasingly responsible for requiring entities to embed ideological bias within models. For example, a new Colorado law banning “algorithmic discrimination” may even force AI models to produce false results in order to avoid a “differential treatment or impact” on protected groups. Third, State laws sometimes impermissibly regulate beyond State borders, impinging on interstate commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My Administration must act with the Congress to ensure that there is a minimally burdensome national standard — not 50 discordant State ones. The resulting framework must forbid State laws that conflict with the policy set forth in this order. That framework should also ensure that children are protected, censorship is prevented, copyrights are respected, and communities are safeguarded. A carefully crafted national framework can ensure that the United States wins the AI race, as we must.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until such a national standard exists, however, it is imperative that my Administration takes action to check the most onerous and excessive laws emerging from the States that threaten to stymie innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance the United States’ global AI dominance through a minimally burdensome national policy framework for AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sec. 3. AI Litigation Task Force. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General shall establish an AI Litigation Task Force (Task Force) whose sole responsibility shall be to challenge State AI laws inconsistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, including on grounds that such laws unconstitutionally regulate interstate commerce, are preempted by existing Federal regulations, or are otherwise unlawful in the Attorney General’s judgment, including, if appropriate, those laws identified pursuant to section 4 of this order. The Task Force shall consult from time to time with the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President and Counsel to the President regarding the emergence of specific State AI laws that warrant challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sec. 4. Evaluation of State AI Laws. Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, consistent with the Secretary’s authorities under 47 U.S.C. 902(b), shall, in consultation with the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, and the Assistant to the President and Counsel to the President, publish an evaluation of existing State AI laws that identifies onerous laws that conflict with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, as well as laws that should be referred to the Task Force established pursuant to section 3 of this order. That evaluation of State AI laws shall, at a minimum, identify laws that require AI models to alter their truthful outputs, or that may compel AI developers or deployers to disclose or report information in a manner that would violate the First Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution. The evaluation may additionally identify State laws that promote AI innovation consistent with the policy set forth in section 2 of this order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sec. 5. Restrictions on State Funding. (a) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, through the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information, shall issue a Policy Notice specifying the conditions under which States may be eligible for remaining funding under the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) Program that was saved through my Administration’s “Benefit of the Bargain” reforms, consistent with 47 U.S.C. 1702(e)-(f). That Policy Notice must provide that States with onerous AI laws identified pursuant to section 4 of this order are ineligible for non-deployment funds, to the maximum extent allowed by Federal law. The Policy Notice must also describe how a fragmented State regulatory landscape for AI threatens to undermine BEAD-funded deployments, the growth of AI applications reliant on high-speed networks, and BEAD’s mission of delivering universal, high-speed connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(b) Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall assess their discretionary grant programs in consultation with the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto and determine whether agencies may condition such grants on States either not enacting an AI law that conflicts with the policy of this order, including any AI law identified pursuant to section 4 or challenged pursuant to section 3 of this order, or, for those States that have enacted such laws, on those States entering into a binding agreement with the relevant agency not to enforce any such laws during the performance period in which it receives the discretionary funding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sec. 6. Federal Reporting and Disclosure Standard. Within 90 days of the publication of the identification specified in section 4 of this order, the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission shall, in consultation with the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, initiate a proceeding to determine whether to adopt a Federal reporting and disclosure standard for AI models that preempts conflicting State laws.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sec. 7. Preemption of State Laws Mandating Deceptive Conduct in AI Models. Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission shall, in consultation with the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, issue a policy statement on the application of the Federal Trade Commission Act’s prohibition on unfair and deceptive acts or practices under 15 U.S.C. 45 to AI models. That policy statement must explain the circumstances under which State laws that require alterations to the truthful outputs of AI models are preempted by the Federal Trade Commission Act’s prohibition on engaging in deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sec. 8. Legislation. (a) The Special Advisor for AI and Crypto and the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology shall jointly prepare a legislative recommendation establishing a uniform Federal policy framework for AI that preempts State AI laws that conflict with the policy set forth in this order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(b) The legislative recommendation called for in subsection (a) of this section shall not propose preempting otherwise lawful State AI laws relating to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(i) child safety protections;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(ii) AI compute and data center infrastructure, other than generally applicable permitting reforms;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(iii) State government procurement and use of AI; and&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(iv) other topics as shall be determined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sec. 9. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Freeing a Xiaomi Humidifier from the Cloud&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently moved into a new apartment which I used as an opportunity to make our home a little smarter. As a big open source supporter I built my smart home platform with Home Assistant of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are still far too few products that are directly compatible with Home Assistant. Especially in the area of humidifiers where I only found products that rely on a proprietary app or cloud from the manufacturer. Something that I would like to avoid at all costs. For one thing, such dependence is a certain form of planned obsolescence, as the product becomes useless as soon as the app loses its compatibility with new smartphone operating system versions or the manufacturerâs cloud is no longer operated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it was important for me to find a smart humidifier that integrates directly with my Home Assistant setup. To achieve this goal, I identified two options:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Add sensors / actuators to a classic humidifier to make it smart.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Replace the firmware of a smart humidifier with my own source code.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to use the second approach, because it required less effort, since I would have had to implement my own firmware anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, I was faced with the task of finding a suitable humidifier whose firmware I could easily replace. I specifically looked for devices that contained an ESP8266 or ESP32 microcontroller from Espressif, because for these I could easily create a new firmware with ESPHome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESPHome is a system that allows you to control your ESP8266/ESP32 through simple but powerful configuration files and remotely control it through home automation systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to SÃ¶ren Beye /Hypfer , I quickly became aware of the Xiaomi Mi Smart Antibacterial Humidifier, as SÃ¶ren himself wrote his own firmware for this humidifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, his original version of the customized firmware ( /Hypfer/esp8266-deerma-humidifier ) is no longer compatible with the current version of the producr, as Xiaomi has modified the internal communication protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I decided to re-implement the firmware based on ESPHome as an âexternal componentâ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find the code for this component here: /stv0g/esphome-config/components/xiaomi_deerma_humidifier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to Hack your own Humidifier&lt;/head&gt;Section titled âHow to Hack your own Humidifierâ&lt;p&gt;This section is going to walk you through the process of modifying your own Xiaomi Humidifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find the correct model&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internal Mi Model ID of the supported device is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;deerma.humidifier.jsq&lt;/code&gt;. The Model on the packaging being&lt;code&gt;ZNJSQ01DEM&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disassembly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are 4 Philips-head screws hidden under the rubber foot ring which can be easily pealed of. Its usually find to remove the rubber only in areas where the screws are located. That way you can easily reattach it later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the inside, you will find a small Wifi module attached to the back of the housing. Remove the module and solder on the wires as shown in the picture below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wire UART&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last picture, the colors of the wires correspond to the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Orange: GND&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Grey: VCC (3.3 Volt!)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Yellow: GPIO0&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Brown: RX&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Red: TX&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to flash the module, you will need to tie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;GPIO0&lt;/code&gt;to GND and attach a 3.3V serial adapter to the&lt;code&gt;RX&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;TX&lt;/code&gt;pins. I recommend to also to disconnect the module from the humidifier and power it via your Serial to USB adapter via the&lt;code&gt;VCC&lt;/code&gt;pin.&lt;p&gt;To flash the ESP8266 chip you can either use ESPHomeâs build-in web flasher or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;esptool.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create backup of original firmware&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before we flash the new firmware, I recommend to first make a backup of the original Xiaomi firmware by running:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flash new firmware&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, we can flash the new firmware:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

Here are your best options</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/the-ars-technica-guide-to-dumb-tvs/</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="a7ccd93c51a39178"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Smart TVs can feel like a dumb choice if you’re looking for privacy, reliability, and simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s TVs and streaming sticks are usually loaded up with advertisements and user tracking, making offline TVs seem very attractive. But ever since smart TV operating systems began making money, “dumb” TVs have been hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In response, we created this non-smart TV guide that includes much more than dumb TVs. Since non-smart TVs are so rare, this guide also breaks down additional ways to watch TV and movies online and locally without dealing with smart TVs’ evolution toward software-centric features and snooping. We’ll discuss a range of options suitable for various budgets, different experience levels, and different rooms in your home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our best recommendation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a dumb TV guide, but first, let’s briefly highlight the best recommendation for most people: Take your TV offline and plug in an Apple TV box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An Apple TV lets you replace smart TV software with Apple’s cleaner tvOS, and it’s more intuitive than using most smart TVs and other streaming devices. Apple’s tvOS usually runs faster and more reliably, and it isn’t riddled with distracting ads or recommendations. And there’s virtually no learning curve for family members or visitors, something that can’t always be said for DIY alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Critically, Apple TV boxes are also an easy recommendation on the privacy front. The setup process makes it simple for anyone to ensure that the device is using relatively minimal user tracking. You’re likely to use an Apple TV box with the Apple TV app or with an Apple account, which means sending some data to Apple. But Apple has a better reputation for keeping user information in-house, and Apple TV boxes don’t have automatic content recognition (ACR).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built a complete VR setup from scratch to let rats play DOOM. The system includes a motion-tracked treadmill ball, a panoramic headset, an input trigger, and a reward circuit. All hardware and software components are open sourced, including 3D-printable designs, circuit diagrams, firmware, and control software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first version (v1) was built in New York by Viktor, who trained rats to walk through a corridor in DOOM using a simpler rig. That version was featured on Vice and PC Gamer. After moving back home, the project was paused. Public interest reignited development, leading to v2, a more advanced and modular version built in collaboration with electrical engineer Sándor Makra. Akos Blaschek later assisted significantly in documenting the project for open-sourcing, aiming to enable others to replicate and build upon this work. Key metallic components were designed and sourced in collaboration with SZURWIN KFT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;V1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basic ball setup&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rats trained to run forward&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minimal sensors and mechanics&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No panoramic screen&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;V2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New ball driver mechanism for smoother movement&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foldable AMOLED screen with 180° horizontal and 80° vertical FOV, Full HD resolution&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upgraded sensors for movement tracking&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reinforced feeder system with mixing motor&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modular 3D-printable components&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improved electronics reliability and safety&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limitations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We reached the point of rat habituation but didn’t start training. Our rats (Todd, Kojima, Gabe) aged out before full testing. The setup works, but behavioral validation is pending.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hardware&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hardware is a comprehensive VR rig designed for rodents. It consists of a motion-tracked sphere that captures the rat's movements, a custom-built trigger for in-game actions, a curved panoramic screen for visual immersion, and an automated reward system that dispenses sugar water to reinforce behavior. All these components are mounted on a modular aluminum frame, creating a complete, self-contained environment for the rat to interact with the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The headset wraps around the rat’s head with a foldable AMOLED screen. It maximizes immersion without obstructing whisker space. The screen supports Full HD resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The headset frame also integrates several sensory components: two small air nozzles are positioned near the left and right whiskers, capable of delivering targeted air puffs on command (e.g., signaling wall collisions in-game). The frame provides a secure mounting point for the reward system's dispenser tube, placing it near the rat's mouth. Additionally, the design includes placeholders for miniature speakers near each ear, intended for future implementation of stereo audio cues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3D Model: Headset&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locomotion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Movement is captured via a free-spinning ball under the rat. Rotary sensors track displacement and convert it into game motion. The ball can also be driven by motors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These motors are used during training to roll the ball and simulate movement paths before a reward. This guides the rat on where to go, helping form movement-action associations. Like the trigger, this allows for programmatic training sequences with minimal initial input from the animal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3D Model: Stand/Ball&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trigger Input&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shooting input is a custom-built hand-operated lever. Rats pull it with their paws to fire. The lever is held in place by small springs, encased in a 3D-printed housing. It includes a rotary encoder to detect motion and a stepper motor to actuate it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The motor allows programmatic control—pulling the lever to demonstrate shooting. This enables training by pairing visual cues with mechanical motion, reinforcing the association before the rat initiates the action on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3D Model: Trigger&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reward System&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Positive in-game actions trigger a liquid reward: sugar water delivered through a precise dispensing mechanism. The system consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mixer: Continuously stirs the sugar solution to maintain even concentration&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pump + Pressure Sensor: Keeps the line under constant pressure&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solenoid Valve: Magnetic valve that opens to release exact 10 µL doses&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dispenser: Positioned near the mouth for easy access&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This setup ensures accurate, repeatable reward delivery with minimal delay. The reward is synchronized with game events to reinforce desired behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limitations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current system assumes basic rat mobility and grooming behavior. Fine-tuning might be needed for rats of different sizes or temperaments. Trigger placement and reward tube flow may need calibration per subject.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The setup is controlled through a modular Python system. The main entry point is arena_scenario.py, which runs the full control loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system includes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Motion capture: Reads movement from optical flow sensors mounted around the treadmill ball.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locomotion control: Drives the ball motors to guide the rat during training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trigger input: Reads lever pulls, detects voluntary shooting actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reward delivery: Dispenses precise 10 μL sugar water rewards via a controlled solenoid valve and maintains constant line pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DOOM integration: Interfaces with a modified ViZDoom environment for real-time closed-loop behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Training logic: Enforces demonstrations and delivers rewards based on game state and rat behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The software runs on a PC and communicates with a Raspberry Pi via TCP sockets. The Pi handles real-time sensor reading, ball actuation, and reward control; the PC processes the sensor data, runs the game, and sends high-level commands to the Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All major components—movement tracking, ball driving, trigger detection, and reward control—can be operated manually or in closed-loop mode. All control parameters (e.g., motor speeds, reward volumes) are set in Python code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limitations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s no in-built calibration suite. Users must validate sensor alignment and reward timing manually. Some microcontroller firmwares might require tuning based on hardware tolerances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rats successfully learned to navigate the virtual environment and trigger the shooting mechanism. Habituation took approximately two weeks per rat. While advanced training wasn't completed due to time constraints, initial data showed promising engagement with the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limitations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full behavioral validation requires longer training periods. Cross-subject variability wasn't extensively studied. The impact of prolonged VR exposure on rat well-being needs further research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Now?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GNU Unifont is part of the GNU Project. This page contains the latest release of GNU Unifont, with glyphs for every printable code point in the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). The BMP occupies the first 65,536 code points of the Unicode space, denoted as U+0000..U+FFFF. There is also growing coverage of the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP), in the range U+010000..U+01FFFF, and of Michael Everson's ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) with Rebecca Bettencourt's Under-CSUR additions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Commercial Use&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A user has asked if GNU Unifont can be used with commercial (non-free) software. The answer is yes. The GNU Font Embedding Exception and the SIL OFL allow for that. See the next section for details. The main purpose of the licensing is to require derivative fonts that others create to be released to the public under the same licensing terms, not to prohibit the use of those fonts with certain software. Thus, preserving the license terms in derivative fonts provides a public benefit. The licenses also provide acknowledgement of previous Unifont contributors for their volunteer work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Copyright, Derivative Works, and License&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thousands of Unifont glyphs are creations of individual Unifont contributors; those glyphs enjoy copyright protections of various degrees. Some of those contributions are letter forms of established alphabets while others are icon (symbol) designs such as the many animal icons which, as artistic designs, have even stronger international protections. See for example this memorandum of applicable laws of Berne Union member country Germany (where Unifont was created): Unifont Copyright Protections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Derivative variants of Unifont are permitted under the terms of the dual license: GNU GPLv2+ with the GNU Font Embedding Exception and the SIL Open Font License version 1.1. These are free licenses. The remainder of this section provides details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These font files are licensed under the GNU General Public License, either Version 2 or (at your option) a later version, with the exception that embedding the font in a document does not in itself constitute a violation of the GNU GPL. The full terms of the license are in LICENSE.txt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of Unifont version 13.0.04, the fonts are dual-licensed under the SIL Open Font License (OFL) version 1.1 and the GNU GPL 2+ with the GNU font embedding exception. The SIL OFL is available at OFL-1.1.txt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Font Downloads&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard font build — with and without the ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) / Under-CSUR Private Use Area (PUA) glyphs. Download in your favorite format:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; OpenType: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The Standard Unifont OpenType Download: unifont-17.0.03.otf (5 Mbytes)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Unifont Japanese OpenType Version: unifont_jp-17.0.03.otf (5 Mbytes)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Glyphs above the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane: unifont_upper-17.0.03.otf (1 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Unicode ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) PUA Glyphs: unifont_csur-17.0.03.otf (0.5 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specialized versions — built by request:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PSF: A specialized PSF 1 console frame buffer font consisting of 512 glyphs for use with APL, A Programming Language, in console mode (single-user mode on GNU/Linux, etc.), mainly to support GNU APL: Unifont-APL8x16-17.0.03.psf.gz (4 kbytes)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HEX: All the Plane 0 glyphs in Roman's .hex format, for those who wish to experiment: unifont-17.0.03.hex.gz (1 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HEX: The above .hex file with combining circles added: unifont_sample-17.0.03.hex.gz (1 Mbyte)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Windows or Mac OS X, unzip the .ttf.zip file or download the uncompressed .ttf file and copy the font to your Fonts folder. On Microsoft Windows, this folder is located under the Windows folder on your main disk. On a Mac, this is located under the Library folder on your main disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For best appearance on a Mac in a Terminal window, select Terminal from the menu, then Preferences. A Settings window will appear. Make sure that you're on the Text tab in that window. Then make sure that the "Antialias text" box is checked. The OpenType version of the font should then look fine at point sizes of 12pt and larger. The font won't look very legible in a Mac Terminal window unless you select this antialias option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: BDF, PCF, and OpenType files contain dimension and spacing information for each glyph in a font. Some font rendering engines ignore this glyph information that the font file provides. This is especially true of rendering engines designed to handle monospace fonts. Unifont will not display all glyphs correctly with such software. The BDF font follows BDF version 2.1 (not version 2.2) because the the X Window System standardized on version 2.1. The PSF 1 version of Unifont is a monospace font but is limited to 512 glyphs, and is only of use with font rendering engines that support more than 256 glyphs in a console frame buffer font.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All unifont.hex sources are in the full Unifont Utilities download page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Unifont Limitations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unifont only stores one glyph per printable Unicode code point. This means that complex scripts with special forms for letter combinations including consonant combinations and floating vowel marks such as with Indic scripts (Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil, etc.) or letters that change shape depending upon their position in a word (Indic and Arabic scripts) will not render well in Unifont. In those cases, Unifont is only suitable as a font of last resort. Users wishing to properly render such complex scripts should use full OpenType fonts that faithfully display such alternate forms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Drawing New Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you would like to contribute glyphs, please email unifoundry at gmail in advance (not spelled out because of spammers). Several contributors are working on new glyphs, and it would be unfortunate to have multiple persons drawing the same glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Special Note: New Plane 2 and Plane 3 CJK Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The People's Republic of China (PRC) has a set of 15-by-16 pixel Chinese glyphs for Unicode Plane 2 and Plane 3. However, those glyphs are copyrighted and licensed for sale by the Government of the PRC, and thus they cannot be used in a free font. If you happen to have any of those copyrighted 15-by-16 pixel glyphs, please do not send them for inclusion. Unifont includes many glyphs in this range, drawn by Chinese and Japanese volunteers. More are planned for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Release Notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This latest release is part of the GNU Project. You can view the GNU Project Unifont Page on Savannah.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The theoretical maximum number of printable glyphs in the Unicode Plane 0 range is 65,536 code points minus the 2,048 surrogate pair code points, minus the 6,400 Private Use Area code points, minus the two noncharacters (U+FFFE and U+FFFF). This amounts to 57,086 assignable code points apart from the Private Use Area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The theoretical maximum number of printable glyphs in the higher Unicode planes is 65,534; the last two code points in each plane are reserved as noncharacters.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt; 12 September 2023 (Unifont 15.1.01) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;As mentioned during the year leading up to this release, TrueType fonts are no longer produced by the default build; OpenType fonts have taken their place. This change has been driven by the diminishing support for TrueType fonts in the Pango font rendering engine. TrueType fonts can still be built from the distribution tarball using the command "make truetype" in the font directory.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ho-Seok Ee proposed a new Johab encoding for algorithmic Hangul Syllables generation. The resulting scheme uses 6 variations of initial consonants (choseong), 3 of medial vowels and diphthongs (jungseong), and 1 of final consonants (jongseong). The image on the left is partial output from a new supporting Unifont utility,&lt;/td&gt;&lt;code&gt;unijohab2html&lt;/code&gt;, which gives an overview of how the three components of a Hangul syllable combine with each other and outputs any overlaps for a font designer's analysis. A full discussion of this new Johab 6/3/1 encoding appears on the Unifont Hangul Syllables Generation web page. Minseo Lee (ì´ë¯¼ì) provided feedback on the glyphs prior to their release.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; Following a suggestion by Ho-Seok Ee, the &lt;code&gt;hangul-base.hex&lt;/code&gt;file that contains the Johab 6/3/1 glyphs for Hangul syllable formation now begins at code point U+E000. This allows building a Unifont variant with that entire Hangul johab glyph set in the Uniode Plane 0 Private Use Area (PUA) using the command "&lt;code&gt;make PUA=plane00/hangul/hangul-base.hex&lt;/code&gt;". in the font directory. Unifont builds have traditionally left the PUA available for CSUR/UCSUR glyphs, which is still the default; see below for a discussion of the CSUR/UCSUR glyphs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Johnnie Weaver modified "IJ" ligature glyphs U+0132 and U+0133. He also modified U+1E9E LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; Paul Hardy: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modified U+2CC2 COPTIC CAPITAL LETTER CROSSED SHEI and U+2CC3 COPTIC SMALL LETTER CROSSED SHEI for consistency with the redrawn U+03E2 COPTIC CAPITAL LETTER SHEI and U+03E3 COPTIC SMALL LETTER SHEI.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Redrew Ideographic Description Characters (U+2FF0..U+2FFB) for consistency and added new glyphs (U+2FFC..U+2FFF). Also added CJK Strokes glyph U+31EF IDEOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION CHARACTER SUBTRACTION.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modified star glyphs U+2605, U+2606, and U+2BE8 for consistency.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modified several Chinese ideographs and Korean ideographs in CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A (U+3400..U+4DBF) per the Unicode Standard version 15.1.0.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Wen Quan Yi Glyphs: Made modifications to Korean ideographs in CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A (U+3400..U+4DBF) per Unicode 15.1.0 changes. Modified CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A U+3B9D, U+454E, U+49C8 (from æ¹ è¿æ) and U+56B8. Modified CJK Unified Ideographs Extension U+809E and U+891D.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modified Alchemical Symbols (U+1F700..U+1F77F) per Unicode 15.1.0 changes.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt; Added three hexadecimal digit notations to the Plane 0 UCSUR: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;U+EBE0..U+EBEF: Boby Lapointe's "bibi-binary" notation.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;U+EBF0..U+EBFF: Bruce Alan Martin's bit location notation.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;U+ECF0..U+ECFF: Ronald O. Whitaker's triangular notation.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Implemented other glyph changes per the Unicode Standard version 15.1.0.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Several other minor changes; see the ChangeLog file in the main tarball for details.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;1PCF fonts can only include glyphs in Plane 0.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;2Only a subset of Plane 2 and Plane 3 CJK glyphs plus the Plane 1 Copyleft glyph (U+1F12F) are included, to stay within the OpenType limit of 65,536 glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt; 3&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; The table below links to the Japanese glyphs in Plane 2 (Supplementary Ideographic Plane) contained in the &lt;code&gt;unifont_jp&lt;/code&gt; OpenType and TrueType font files.
      Note: These Plane 2 glyphs along with the Plane 0 glyphs in 
      &lt;code&gt;unifont_jp&lt;/code&gt; font files provide complete coverage of the JIS X 0213
      standard.  Only 303 glyphs appear in the files below.  Files with no glyphs appear
      with a gray background.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; This next table links to the Chinese glyphs in Plane 2 (Supplementary Ideographic Plane) contained in &lt;code&gt;unifont&lt;/code&gt; OpenType and TrueType font files.
      Note: These Plane 2 glyphs along with the default Plane 0 glyphs
      in Unifont provide complete coverage of the Table of General Standard Chinese
      Characters (éç¨è§èæ±åè¡¨).  Only 232 glyphs appear in the files below.
      Files with no glyphs appear with a gray background.

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Plane 3 Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plane 3 begins with the CJK Unified Ideographs Extension G block, from U+30000 through U+3134A. This includes the highly complex biang Chinese ideograph and taito Japanese ideograph:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Plane 14 Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; This table links to the two ranges of 256 assigned code points in Plane 14 (Tags and Variation Selector Supplement) that appear in the &lt;code&gt;unifont_upper&lt;/code&gt; OpenType and TrueType font files.

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Plane 0 and Plane 15 Private Use Area Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Finally, this last glyph table shows ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) and Under CSUR glyphs that appear in the &lt;code&gt;unifont_csur&lt;/code&gt; OpenType
      and TrueType font files.  Not all of the Plane 0 CSUR and UCSUR scripts
      have been drawn, but given the esoteric nature of some CSUR and UCSUR scripts
      (including the unavailability of glyph samples for many of the more obscure
      constructed scripts), the boxes in the table all have a green background color
      even if not at 100% coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Contributing Glyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you would like to contribute glyphs to the GNU Unifont effort, you can download the associated PNG file from the tables above (SMP and CSUR need additions). Then draw new glyphs in the 16-by-16 pixel area that is inside the inner box you see in the image on the left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When done, erase the surrounding inner box and ruler lines around the inner box. You can then save the file as a monochrome bitmap image. Then convert the .png file into a .hex file with the unipng2hex utility in the source tarball. Or you can just email the .png file to me as a contribution to this effort and I will do the conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Why is the outer grid so much larger than the 16-by-16 pixel inner box?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A: Because in a future version, unipng2hex, unihex2png, and other utilities should be able to handle larger glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The table below shows the current state of completion of the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (Plane 1). Any range in the table that doesn't have a green background has missing glyphs. To see which scripts are in a particular range, consult the "Supplementary Multilingual Plane" list in the Current Coverage section below. The more red a range appears in the table below, the more glyphs are missing from that range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Current Coverage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Links in this section reference the first block of 256 glyphs where a script begins.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;*Note: Scripts such as Cuneiform, Egyptian Hieroglyphs, and Bamum Supplement will not be drawn on a 16-by-16 pixel grid. There are plans to draw these scripts on a 32-by-32 pixel grid in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plane 14 has two scripts, both of which Unifont covers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="16"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt; GNU Unifont Glyphs &lt;p&gt;Plane 14&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="16"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Range&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Script&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="16"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;U+0E0000..U+0E007F&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Tags&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;U+0E0100..U+0E01EF&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Variations Selectors Supplement&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The list below shows the scripts that are in Michael Everson's ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) and Rebecca Bettencourt's Under-CSUR that have coverage in this release of Unifont:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially I just posted my additions to Roman Czyborra's original unifont.hex file. Then in mid-January 2008, his website went down. So I started posting font updates here. Roman has encouraged me to continue with my additions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roman's website is now back online, and you can read his Unifont description and motivation for its creation on his website, along with his archive of Unifont's changes: http://czyborra.com/unifont.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;TrueType Font Generation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luis Alejandro González Miranda wrote a cool combination of scripts to convert GNU Unifont from .hex format into FontForge .sfd format, then to have FontForge convert this to a TrueType outline font (see the Unicode Utilities web page on this site for more information). Pixels are drawn as outlined squares, so they scale to all point sizes. This works well with GNOME; I haven't tried it with any other Unix windowing environment. I've removed the OpenType SBIT font link from this page because the outline font is much more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luis has given me permission to modify his scripts to convert the latest GNU Unifont versions to TrueType. I've modified his original scripts to handle Unicode combining characters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;JIS X 0213 Kanji&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Jiskan16&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Unifont 12.1.02 added Japanese BDF and TrueType versions, &lt;code&gt;unifont_jp&lt;/code&gt;.  This replaced over 10,000 ideographs
    in the default Unifont font with Japanese kanji from the 16 × 16
    pixel Jiskan 16 font.  The font is available in two files,
    corresponding to the two planes in JIS X 0213.  Both files are
    in the public domain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The comments in the BDF source font files (downloadable from the Japanese Fonts page) credit the following contributors (in order): Toshiyuki Imamura, HANATAKA Shinya, Taichi Kawabata, Koichi Yasuoka, TOYOSHIMA Masayuki, Kazuo Koike, and SATO Yasunao.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the Unifont release, the glyphs from the two JIS X 0213 planes were converted into Unifont .hex files and mapped to code points in Unicode's Plane 0 and Plane 2 for Unifont. The result provides complete representation of the kanji in JIS X 0213 in a free Unicode font.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Izumi16&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unifont 12.1.03 replaced the Jiskan16 glyphs with the public domain Izumi16 glyphs. These provide improvements on the earlier Jiskan16 glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Wen Quan Yi: Spring of Letters (文泉驛 / 文泉驿)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Unifont CJK glyphs were replaced by new CJK glyphs from version 1.1 of Qianqian Fang's Unibit font. The Unibit font began as a combination of the original GNU Unifont glyphs and a basic CJK bitmap font placed in the public domain by the People's Republic of China. It adopted GNU Unifont's scheme of 8x16 and 16x16 glyphs. Qianqian Fang and many others then added about 10,000 more glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qianqian states in the Unibit distribution: "The entire CJK Unified Ideographics (U4E00-U9FA5) and CJK Unified Ideographics Extension A(U3400-U4DB5) blocks were replaced by high-quality glyphs from China National Standard GB19966-2005 (public domain)." Wen Quan Yi volunteeers then edited thousands of these characters. Qianqian also drew the new 22 CJK ideographs in the range U+9FA6..U+9FBB that appear in GNU Unifont.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wen Quan Yi (WQY) means "spring of letters," as in a spring of water. This is an interesting choice of words, as the British spelling of "font" is "fount" (but still pronounced "font"). See his website for more details: http://wqy.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/enindex.cgi, or in Chinese at http://wenq.org/wqy2/index.cgi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following code points in the latest unifont.hex file are taken from the WQY Unibit font (with my additions to complete the U+3000..U+33FF range, particularly the missing Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji), including glyphs updated by the Wen Quan Yi volunteers and other modifications as part of the Unifont font:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+2E80..U+2EFF: CJK Radicals Supplement&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+2F00..U+2FDF: Kangxi Radicals&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+2FF0..U+2FFF: Ideographic Description Characters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+3000..U+303F: CJK Symbols and Punctuation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+31C0..U+31EF: CJK Strokes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+3200..U+32FF: Enclosed CJK Letters and Months&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+3300..U+33FF: CJK Compatibility&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+3400..U+4DBF: CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+4E00..U+9FBF: CJK Unified Ideographs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+F900..U+FAFF: CJK Compatibility Ideographs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;U+FF00..U+FF60: Fullwidth Forms of Roman Letters&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qianqian has given his okay to add these CJK glyphs from the Wen Quan Yi project into GNU Unifont. Likewise, I've told him to incorporate any glyphs he wants from my contributions to GNU Unifont into his Unibit font. In October 2020, Qianqian Fang also granted permission to apply the SIL Open Font License version 1.1 to Wen Quan Yi glyphs in Unifont as a dual license.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What's Next?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the glyphs in the Supplementary Multilingual Plane that could easily be drawn in a 16-by-16 pixel grid have been drawn as of the Unifont 9.0.01 release. There are no plans to draw Tangut. A number of ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) scripts remain to be drawn. If you are interested in contributing glyphs to this effort, please contact me. All new contributions must be licensed under the same license as the rest of Unifont (in a nutshell, GPL 2+ with the GNU font embedding exception and the SIL OFL 1.1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the great work done by contributors in providing ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) glyphs, they are available in font files that have "_csur" in their name.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uvm32 is a minimalist, dependency-free virtual machine sandbox designed for microcontrollers and other resource-constrained devices. Single C file, no dynamic memory allocations, asynchronous design, pure C99.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On an STM32L0 (ARM Cortex-M0+) the required footprint is under 4KB flash/1KB RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uvm32 is a RISC-V emulator, wrapped in a management interface and provided with tools to build efficient code to run in it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As a no-frills alternative to embedded script engines (Lua, Duktape, MicroPython, etc)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As a sandbox to isolate untrusted or unreliable elements of a system&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As a way to allow development in modern systems programming languages where a compiler for the target may not be available (rust-hello)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As a way to write once, run anywhere and avoid maintaining multiple software variants&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bytecode example apps written in C, Zig, Rust and assembly&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-blocking design, preventing misbehaving bytecode from stalling the host&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No assumptions about host IO capabilities (no stdio)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simple, opinionated execution model&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Safe minimally typed FFI&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Small enough for "if this then that" scripts/plugins, capable enough for much more&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Aims for safety over speed, bad code running in the VM should never be able to crash the host&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although based on a fully fledged CPU emulator, uvm32 is intended for executing custom script like logic, not for simulating hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many scripting languages and virtual machines are available for embedding in small systems and they all make tradeoffs in different dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uvm32 aims for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Small footprint (suitable for embedded devices, games and apps)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support well-known programming languages for VM code (with high quality dev tools)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ease of integration into existing software&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flexibility of paradigm (event driven, polling, multi-processor)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Robustness against misbehaving VM code&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uvm32 does not aim for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frictionless FFI (no direct function calls between host and VM code)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maximum possible efficiency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The simplest scripting experience for VM code (a develop-compile-run cycle is expected)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Batteries included" libraries to do stdio, networking, etc&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uvm32 is a tiny virtual machine, all of the code is in uvm32.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A minimal example of a host to run code in is at host-mini.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything else is a more advanced host example, or a sample application which could be run in a host.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple VM host from host-mini&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crackpots ranging from billionaire Peter Thiel to random YouTube influencers claim that science has been stagnating for the past 50 years. They admit that computing is an exception: they don’t pretend that my personal 32GB laptop is not an advance over the 16MB mainframe that served the whole Caltech community when I was there. Instead they claim that advances in computing were driven solely by industrial research, quite overlooking the role of academia and government funding in pushing the VLSI revolution, RISC processor design, networking, hypertext, virtual memory and indeed computers themselves. As for the industrial research, most of it came from just two “blue sky” institutes – Bell Labs and Xerox PARC – that closed a long time ago. LCF-style proof assistants are a world away from mainstream computing, so let’s look at 50 years of progress there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1975–1985: Edinburgh LCF&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first instance of LCF was Stanford LCF, developed by Robin Milner in 1972, but it was not an LCF-style proof assistant! LCF meant “Logic for Computable Functions”, a quirky formalism based on Scott domains and intended for reasoning about small functional programs. But “LCF-style proof assistant” means one that, like Edinburgh LCF, was coded in some form of the ML programming language and provided a proof kernel, encapsulated in an abstract type definition, to ensure that a theorem could only be generated by applying inference rules to axioms or other theorems:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… the ML type discipline is used… so that—whatever complex procedures are defined—all values of type&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;thm&lt;/code&gt;must be theorems, as only inferences can compute such values…. This security releases us from the need to preserve whole proofs… — an important practical gain since large proofs tended to clog up the working space… [Edinburgh LCF, page IV]&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edinburgh LCF was first announced in 1975, which conveniently is exactly 50 years ago, at the almost mythical conference on Proving and Improving Programs held at Arc-et-Senans. The user manual, published in the Springer lecture notes series, came out in 1979. Edinburgh LCF introduced some other principles that people still adhere to today:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;inference rules in the natural deduction style, with a dynamic set of assumptions&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;a goal-directed proof style, where you start with the theorem statement and work backwards&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;a structured system of theories to organise groups of definitions&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edinburgh LCF had its own version of the ML language. It supported a fragment of first-order logic containing the logical symbols $\forall$, $\land$ and $\to$ along with the relation symbols $\equiv$ and $\sqsubseteq$. It introduced proof tactics and also tacticals: operators for combining tactics. Tactics supported goal-directed proof, but Edinburgh LCF had no notion of the current goal or anything to help the user manage the tree of subgoals. Its user interface was simply the ML top level and the various theorem-proving primitives were simply ML functions. ML stood for metalanguage, since managing the process of proof was its exact job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avra Cohn and Robin Milner wrote a report on proving the correctness of a parsing algorithm using Edinburgh LCF. The proof consists of one single induction followed by a little simplification and other reasoning. The report includes a succinct description of Edinburgh LCF. It is a nice snapshot of the state of the art in 1982, when I arrived in Cambridge to join a project run by Robin Milner and Mike Gordon. Full of youthful enthusiasm, I told Mike that it would be great if one day we could formalise the Prime Number Theorem. I hardly knew what the theorem was about or how to prove it, but my college roommate had told me it was really deep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disappointed to discover that we only had $\forall$, $\land$ and $\to$, I set out to fix that, to support full first-order logic. I ended up changing so much (backwards compatibility is overrated) that people eventually shamed me into writing my own user manual. Cambridge LCF never caught on because, well, nobody liked the LCF formalism. But I used it for a development that seemed big at the time: to verify the unification algorithm. This development was later ported to Isabelle. It contains 36 inductions, so we were making progress. And this takes us to 1985, exactly 40 years ago; see also this survey of the state of play. But there was almost no mathematics: no negative numbers and no decimal notation, so you could not even write 2+2=4. As far as the broader computer science community was concerned, we were a joke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1985–1995: Cambridge LCF and HOL&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cambridge LCF was in itself a dead end, but because it included a much faster ML compiler, it ended up being incorporated into a lot of other proof assistants, notably Mike’s HOL88. And just like that, hardware verification became a reality. Although software verification seemed stuck in the doldrums, a couple of production-ready chip designs were verified! Mike’s explanation was that hardware verification was simply easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also in 1985, we got a new standard for the ML language and, soon, two compilers for it. So then I started working on experiments that would lead to Isabelle. It would be like LCF but would support constructive type theory, crucially allowing both unification and backtracking, like in Prolog. But there was no working system yet, just a grant application. And that was the state of play 40 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding secured, Isabelle development started in earnest in 1986. It was coded in Standard ML from the start, while HOL88 was ported from the Cambridge LCF version of ML to Standard ML, emerging as HOL90. Mike acquired a bevy of energetic PhD students, who engaged in verification projects or built extensions for HOL. Versions of HOL were being used in institutes around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stepping aside from HOL for a moment, other proof assistants had made great progress by the mid 1990s. The addition of inductive definitions to the calculus of constructions gave us the calculus of inductive constructions, which in essence is the formalism used today by Rocq and Lean. The very first release of Isabelle/HOL happened in 1991, primarily the work of Tobias Nipkow, though I was soon to join in. Isabelle/ZF, which was my pet project, formalised axiomatic set theory to some quite deep results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I am still not certain whether negative numbers were supported (can somebody help me?). Our weak support for arithmetic may seem odd when our research community was aware that the real numbers had been formalised in AUTOMATH, but we didn’t seem to want them. To many, we were still a joke. This was about to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1995–2005: Proof assistants come of age&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1994, came the Pentium with its FDIV bug: a probably insignificant but detectable error in floating-point division. The subsequent product recall cost Intel nearly half a billion dollars. John Harrison, a student of Mike’s, decided to devote his PhD research to the verification of floating-point arithmetic. By June 1996 he had submitted an extraordinary thesis, Theorem Proving with the Real Numbers, which described a formidable series of achievements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;a formalisation of the real member system in HOL&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;formalised analysis including metric spaces, sequences and series, limits, continuity and differentiation, power series and transcendental functions, integration&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;proper numerals represented internally by symbolic binary, and calculations on them&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;computer algebra techniques including a decision procedure for real algebra&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;tools and techniques for floating-point verification by reference to the IEEE standard&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;This thesis, which I had the privilege to examine, won a Distinguished Dissertation Award and was published as a book by Springer. So by the middle of the 1990s, which was 30 years ago, we had gone from almost no arithmetic to a decent chunk of formalised real analysis that was good enough to verify actual floating-point algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This period also saw something of an arms race in automation. My earlier, Prolog-inspired vision of backtracking search had led to some fairly general automation that was effective not just in standard predicate logic but with any theorems were expressed in a form suitable for forward or backward chaining. I had also done experiments with classical automatic techniques such as model elimination, which, although pathetic compared with automatic provers of that era, was good enough to troll users on the &lt;code&gt;hol-info&lt;/code&gt; mailing list.
Soon I had provoked John Harrison to build a superior version of ME for HOL Light.
Later, Joe Hurd built his &lt;code&gt;metis&lt;/code&gt; superposition prover, which found its way into HOL4.
Not to be outdone, Tobias made Isabelle’s simplifier the best in its class incorporating a number of sophisticated refinements, including some great ideas from Nqthm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty years from the start of this chronology we now had several reasonably mature and powerful systems, including Isabelle/ZF, Isabelle/HOL, multiple versions of the HOL system, and Coq (now Rocq).1 Many of them used Proof General, a common user interface for tactic-based proof assistants based on the Emacs editor. And we had 100MHz machines, some with 64MB of memory! We were ready to do big things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this period, I did a lot of work on the verification of cryptographic protocols, also here. These secure Internet connections and other network communications; they are valuable when you need to know who is on the other end and need to keep messaging secure from eavesdropping and tampering. Among the protocols investigated were the ubiquitous TLS and the late, unlamented SET protocol. These proofs were not at the level of code or bits; buggy implementations could and did emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, the big thing that caught everyone’s eye was George Gonthier’s formalisation (in Coq) of the Four Colour Theorem. Most educated people had heard of the theorem already, and its history is fascinating: numerous proofs had been attempted and rejected since the mid 19th century. The 1977 proof by Appel and Haken was questioned because it relied on a lot of ad-hoc computer code. Suddenly, despite the still unwelcome involvement of computers, no one could doubt the theorem anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the opposite extreme was my own formalisation of Gödel’s proof of the relative consistency of the axiom of choice in Isabelle/ZF. This was the apex of my ZF work, technically difficult but incomprehensible to most people. My early dream of having a formalisation of the Prime Number Theorem came true in 2005 when Jeremy Avigad formalised the theorem in Isabelle. Somewhat later, John Harrison formalised a different proof in HOL Light. And there was much more. Without any doubt, our systems were capable of serious mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most consequential achievement of this period was Mike Gordon’s collaboration with Graham Birtwistle and Anthony Fox to verify the ARM6 processor. Graham, at Leeds, formally specified the instruction set architecture of the processor (i.e. the assembly language level), while Mike and Anthony at Cambridge verified the implementation of that architecture in terms of lower level hardware components. Eventually a number of other processors were similarly specified, and some verified. Without any doubt, our systems were capable of serious verification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite of the focus on applications in this section, system development continued in the run-up to 2005. I am only familiar with Isabelle development, but they were tremendous:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;the Isar language for structured, legible proofs (a break with the LCF idea that the top level must be a programming language, i.e. ML)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;axiomatic type classes, providing principled overloading&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;counterexample finders: Quickcheck and Refute (now Nitpick)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;code generation from the executable fragment of higher-order logic, and reflection&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;sledgehammer was under active development, but only ready a couple of years later.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so much going on, it’s not surprising that our community started doing big things, and other people were starting to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2005–2015: The first landmarks&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not used to phone calls from journalists: for most of my career, formal verification has been seen as (at best) niche. But the journalist on the end of the line was asking for information about seL4, the first operating system kernel ever to be formally verified. Tools for extended static checking were by then able to detect a lot of program faults, but the seL4 verification claimed to cover full functional correctness: the code did exactly what it was supposed to do. There is now an entire ecosystem around seL4, backed by a million lines of Isabelle/HOL proofs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have wanted to verify compilers since forever. The task of fully specifying a programming language, target machine and compiler already seemed impossible, let alone providing the actual proof. With CompCert, that task was finally fulfilled, for a large subset of the C language:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What sets CompCert apart from any other production compiler, is that it is formally verified, using machine- assisted mathematical proofs, to be exempt from mis- compilation issues. In other words, the executable code it produces is proved to behave exactly as specified by the semantics of the source C program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A seemingly intractable problem with compiler verification was how to translate your verified compiler into machine code. For example, CompCert is mostly written in Rocq, which is then extracted to OCaml code. The OCaml compiler had never been verified, so how do we know that its compiled code is correct?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CakeML squares this circle through bootstrapping. CakeML translates from its source language (a dialect of ML) to assembly language, accompanied by a proof that the two pieces of code are equivalent. This work was an outgrowth of the ARM6 project mentioned earlier. Magnus Myreen had developed techniques for automatically and verifiably translating between assembly language and recursive functions in higher-order logic, in both directions. At the start of the bootstrapping process, a tiny compiler was written in pure logic and proved correct. It was now safe to run this compiler and use its tiny language to implement a bigger language. This process ultimately produced a verified compiler in both source form and assembly language form, with a proof of their equivalence, as well as verified extraction from higher-order logic to ML.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end of the decade also saw impressive results in the formalisation of mathematics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Gödel second incompleteness theorem, by yours truly, in Isabelle/HOL&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;the Central Limit Theorem, by Avigad et al., ditto&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;the Flyspeck project, by Hales et al., in Isabelle/HOL and HOL Light&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;the odd order theorem, in Rocq&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without going into details here, each of these was an ambitious proof, combining in various ways deep mathematics, intricate technicalities and sheer bulk. Our community was proud of our achievements. We were no longer a joke, but what exactly we were good for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2015–2025: Breaking through&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This period brought something astonishing: acceptance of proof assistants by many mainstream mathematicians. I mostly recall mathematicians regardeding computers with something close to contempt. Even some logicians regarded formalised mathematics as impossible, somehow fixating on Gödel’s incompleteness or that notorious proof of 1+1=2 on page 360. Regarding my work formalising big chunks of ZF theory, someone commented “only for finite sets obviously”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My EU-funded ALEXANDRIA project started in 2017. My team formalised more advanced and deep mathematics than I ever imagined to be possible, using Isabelle/HOL. (I have told this story in an earlier blogpost.) But ALEXANDRIA alone would not have had much of an impact on mathematical practice. What made a difference was Kevin Buzzard and his enthusiastic, tireless promotion of the idea of formalising mathematics in Lean. He recruited a veritable army. I got the idea of blogging from him, but my blog has not had the same impact. Where are you guys?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, for the first time ever, machine assistance was used to confirm brand-new mathematics that a Fields Medallist had concerns about. Mathematicians will for the most part continue to work the way they always have done, but proof assistants are getting better and better, and they will encroach more and more on the everyday practice of mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Isabelle continued to be useful for verification. I was amazed to hear that that the systems group here in the Computer Lab had completed a major verification using Isabelle/HOL. The tradition is for systems people to despise verification tools for sweeping aside ugly things like overflow and floating point errors, even though they no longer do. Besides, a research tool like Isabelle is only used by its own developer and his students. Times were changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isabelle is also one of the several proof assistants involved with CHERI, a large-scale project reviving the old idea of capabilities to ensure security at the hardware level. CHERI has produced numerous publications, some of which (for example this one and that one) describe very large proofs. These concern the design and implementation of novel computer architectures with fine-grained memory protection, and a design process with formal verification at its heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isabelle has also contributed to the design of WebAssembly, a relatively new platform for web applications. By subjecting the WebAssembly specification to formal scrutiny, Conrad Watt was able to identify a number of issues in time for them to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’d like to mention this announcement (4 December 2025) by Dominic Mulligan of Amazon Web Services (AWS):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over three years, lots of hard work, and 260,000 lines of Isabelle/HOL code later, the Nitro Isolation Engine (NIE) is finally announced alongside Graviton5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with our colleagues in EC2, Annapurna, and AWS AppSec, we have been working to rearchitect the Nitro system for Graviton5+ instances around a small, trusted separation kernel. Written from scratch in Rust, we have additionally specified the behaviour of a core subset of the Nitro Isolation Engine kernel, verified that the implementation meets this specification, and additionally proved deep security properties—confidentiality and integrity—of the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am biased, since I’ve been working with AWS on this exact project, but it’s a big deal. AWS has been using formal verification tools for a considerable time. A notable earlier accomplishment was verify tricky but efficient algorithms using HOL Light, speeding up RSA encryption by a massive factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2025–2035 Becoming ordinary&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, Apple announced new models in their iPhone range, but no crowds formed around Apple Stores. They once did: the iPhone was once regarded as revolutionary. Now, smartphones are a commodity, which is the final stage of a new technology. Formal verification is not ordinary yet. But it’s coming: more and more software will be seen as too important to develop any other way, as is already the case for hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Postscript&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am well aware that there is much outstanding work adjacent to that described here, e.g. using other interactive tools, such as Nqthm and ACL2, PVS and Agda, and much else using Rocq. There have been amazing advances in the broader theorem proving world, also in model checking, SAT/SMT solving and their applications to extended static checking of software. I have related what I personally know. And remember, the point of this post is not (simply) to boast but to demonstrate the progress of our research community, so the more achievements the better. Feel free to add some in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post does not prove anything about other fields of science, such as solid-state physics, molecular biology or mathematics. But it’s fair to assume that such fields have not been idle either. People have proved Fermat’s Last Theorem and the Poincaré conjecture, and settled more obscure questions such as the projective plane of order 10. People have located the remains of King Richard III, who died in 1485, excavating and positively identifying the body by its DNA. People have linked a piece of bloody cloth to Adolf Hitler and diagnosed that he had a specific genetic condition. The immensely complex James Webb Space Telescope was successfully deployed; it is now revealing secrets about the early Universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wonder about the motives of those who claim that science is moribund. Do they have political aims, or just unrealistic expectations? Were they expecting time travel or some sort of warp drive? People need to remember that movies are fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;OpenAI are quietly adopting skills, now available in ChatGPT and Codex CLI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;12th December 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the things that most excited me about Anthropic’s new Skills mechanism back in October is how easy it looked for other platforms to implement. A skill is just a folder with a Markdown file and some optional extra resources and scripts, so any LLM tool with the ability to navigate and read from a filesystem should be capable of using them. It turns out OpenAI are doing exactly that, with skills support quietly showing up in both their Codex CLI tool and now also in ChatGPT itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Skills in ChatGPT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I learned about this from Elias Judin this morning. It turns out the Code Interpreter feature of ChatGPT now has a new &lt;code&gt;/home/oai/skills&lt;/code&gt; folder which you can access simply by prompting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Create a zip file of /home/oai/skills&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried that myself and got back this zip file. Here’s a UI for exploring its content (more about that tool).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far they cover spreadsheets, docx and PDFs. Interestingly their chosen approach for PDFs and documents is to convert them to rendered per-page PNGs and then pass those through their vision-enabled GPT models, presumably to maintain information from layout and graphics that would be lost if they just ran text extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elias shared copies in a GitHub repo. They look very similar to Anthropic’s implementation of the same kind of idea, currently published in their anthropics/skills repository.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried it out by prompting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Create a PDF with a summary of the rimu tree situation right now and what it means for kakapo breeding season&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure enough, GPT-5.2 Thinking started with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Reading skill.md for PDF creation guidelines&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Searching rimu mast and Kākāpō 2025 breeding status&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took just over eleven minutes to produce this PDF, which was long enough that I had Claude Code for web build me a custom PDF viewing tool while I waited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s ChatGPT’s PDF in that tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(I am very excited about Kākāpō breeding season this year.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason it took so long is that it was fastidious about looking at and tweaking its own work. I appreciated that at one point it tried rendering the PDF and noticed that the macrons in kākāpō were not supported by the chosen font, so it switched to something else:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Skills in Codex CLI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, two weeks ago OpenAI’s open source Codex CLI tool landed a PR titled feat: experimental support for skills.md. The most recent docs for that are in docs/skills.md.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The documentation suggests that any folder in &lt;code&gt;~/.codex/skills&lt;/code&gt; will be treated as a skill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I dug around and found the code that generates the prompt that drives the skill system in codex-rs/core/src/skills/render.rs—here’s a Gist with a more readable version of that prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used Claude Opus 4.5’s skill authoring skill to create this skill for creating Datasette plugins, then installed it into my Codex CLI skills folder like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/datasette/skill \
  ~/.codex/skills/datasette-plugin&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have to run Codex with the &lt;code&gt;--enable skills&lt;/code&gt; option. I ran this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd /tmp
mkdir datasette-cowsay
cd datasette-cowsay
codex --enable skills -m gpt-5.2&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then prompted:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;list skills&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Codex replied:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;- datasette-plugins — Writing Datasette plugins using Python + pluggy (file: /Users/simon/.codex/skills/datasette-plugin/SKILL.md)&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;- Discovery — How to find/identify available skills (no SKILL.md path provided in the list)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I said:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Write a Datasette plugin in this folder adding a /-/cowsay?text=hello page that displays a pre with cowsay from PyPI saying that text&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It worked perfectly! Here’s the plugin code it wrote and here’s a copy of the full Codex CLI transcript, generated with my terminal-to-html tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can try that out yourself if you have &lt;code&gt;uvx&lt;/code&gt; installed like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uvx --with https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cowsay/archive/refs/heads/main.zip \
  datasette&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then visit:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;http://127.0.0.1:8001/-/cowsay?text=This+is+pretty+fun
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Skills are a keeper&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I first wrote about skills in October I said Claude Skills are awesome, maybe a bigger deal than MCP. The fact that it’s just turned December and OpenAI have already leaned into them in a big way reinforces to me that I called that one correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills are based on a very light specification, if you could even call it that, but I still think it would be good for these to be formally documented somewhere. This could be a good initiative for the new Agentic AI Foundation (previously) to take on.&lt;/p&gt;

A plea for help</title><link>https://hey.paris/posts/appleid/</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="adccd91d0b62015c"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Summary: A major brick-and-mortar store sold an Apple Gift Card that Apple seemingly took offence to, and locked out my entire Apple ID, effectively bricking my devices and my iCloud Account, Apple Developer ID, and everything associated with it, and I have no recourse. Can you help? Email paris AT paris.id.au (and read on for the details). ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how Apple “Permanently” locked my Apple ID.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am writing this as a desperate measure. After nearly 30 years as a loyal customer, authoring technical books on Apple’s own programming languages (Objective-C and Swift), and spending tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of dollars on devices, apps, conferences, and services, I have been locked out of my personal and professional digital life with no explanation and no recourse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Situation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My Apple ID, which I have held for around 25 years (it was originally a username, before they had to be email addresses; it’s from the iTools era), has been permanently disabled. This isn’t just an email address; it is my core digital identity. It holds terabytes of family photos, my entire message history, and is the key to syncing my work across the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Trigger: The only recent activity on my account was a recent attempt to redeem a $500 Apple Gift Card to pay for my 6TB iCloud+ storage plan. The code failed. The vendor suggested that the card number was likely compromised and agreed to reissue it. Shortly after, my account was locked.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;An Apple Support representative suggested that this was the cause of the issue: indicating that something was likely untoward about this card.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The card was purchased from a major brick-and-mortar retailer (Australians, think Woolworths scale; Americans, think Walmart scale), so if I cannot rely on the provenance of that, and have no recourse, what am I meant to do? We have even sent the receipt, indicating the card’s serial number and purchase location to Apple.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Consequence: My account is flagged as “closed in accordance with the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions”.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Damage: I effectively have over $30,000 worth of previously-active “bricked" hardware. My iPhone, iPad, Watch, and Macs cannot sync, update, or function properly. I have lost access to thousands of dollars in purchased software and media.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Apple representatives claim that only the “Media and Services” side of my account is blocked, but now my devices have signed me out of iMessage (and I can’t sign back in), and I can’t even sign out of the blocked iCloud account because… it’s barred from the sign-out API, as far as I can tell.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I can’t even login to the “Secure File Transfer” system Apple uses to exchange information, because it relies on an Apple ID. Most of the ways Apple has suggested seeking help from them involve signing in to an Apple service to upload something, or communicate with them. This doesn’t work as the account is locked.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I can’t even download my iCloud Photos, as:&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;There are repeated auth-errors on my account, so I can’t make Photos work;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I don’t have a 6TB device to sync them to, even if I could.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Support Nightmare&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I contacted Apple Support immediately (Case ID: 102774292094). The experience was terrifyingly dismissive:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No Information: Support staff refused to tell me why the account was banned or provide specific details on the decision.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No Escalation: When I begged for an escalation to Executive Customer Relations (ECR), noting that I would lose the ability to do my job and that my devices were useless, I was told that “an additional escalation won’t lead to a different outcome”.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Many of the reps I’ve spoken to have suggested strange things, one of the strangest was telling me that I could physically go to Apple’s Australian HQ at Level 3, 20 Martin Place, Sydney, and plead my case. They even put me on hold for 5 minutes while they looked up the address.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The “New Account” Trap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most insultingly, the official advice from the Senior Advisor was to “create a new Apple account… and update the payment information”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This advice is technically disastrous:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Legal Catch: Apple’s Terms and Conditions rely on “Termination of Access.” By closing my account, they have revoked my license to use their services.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Technical Trap: If I follow their advice and create a new account on my current devices (which are likely hardware-flagged due to the gift card error), the new account will likely be linked to the banned one and disabled for circumventing security measures.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Developer Risk: As a professional Apple Developer, attempting to “dodge” a ban by creating a new ID could lead to my Developer Program membership being permanently blacklisted, amongst other things.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who I Am&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not a casual user. I have literally written the book on Apple development (taking over the Learning Cocoa with Objective-C series, which Apple themselves used to write, for O’Reilly Media, and then 20+ books following that). I help run the longest-running Apple developer event not run by Apple themselves, /dev/world. I have effectively been an evangelist for this company’s technology for my entire professional life. We had an app on the App Store on Day 1 in every sense of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My Plea&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am asking for a human at Apple to review this case. I suspect an automated fraud flag regarding the bad gift card triggered a nuclear response that frontline support cannot override. I have escalated this through my many friends in WWDR and SRE at Apple, with no success.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am desperate to resolve this and restore my digital life. If you can help, please email paris AT paris.id.au&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; In my 30’s, I exercised to look good. In my 50’s, to stay fit. In my 70’s, to stay ambulatory. In my 80’s, to avoid assisted living. Now in my 90’s, I’m just doing it out of pure defiance&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;THE Dick van Dyke, from Mary Poppins, Diagnosis: Murder, ans so many more?! I always thought it was just a coincidental same name as I never saw videos about this. Oh my! This guy is amazing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months ago I found The Dick Van Dyke Show free to watch on Youtube. I had seen a number of the episodes in passing over the years, but never really watched it. It's really quite a good show. Highly recommended, even if YouTube's viewing experience for TV series is sub-par.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had no idea he's an animator, that's so cool! In that video he says "Lightwave is so deep, I won't live long enough to see everything that's in it". I'm glad he's proven wrong there!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know his son Barry. He said his first memory he has was his Dad doing real time drawings for people telling stories. He was behind the story teller on stage on giant pads of paper as a comedy bit at night clubs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He also remembers having giant bags of toys dumped on the floor of the hotel rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many A-listers are polymaths. For example, Phil Hartman, used to be Phil Hartmann (extra "n"), and designed some of the most iconic album covers of the 1970s, and Steve Martin is one of the best banjo players out there. It used to be part of his standup bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dick Van Dyke came from the tail end of Vaudeville, where performers had to have a whole variety of skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember: Every one of these folks that hits the limelight, beat out thousands of others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We think our vocation is competitive? Showbiz says "Hold my beer."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hedy Lamarr was a prolific inventor. Among other things, she developed a frequency-hopping spread spectrum radio transmission technique for torpedo guidance and donated the patent to the US Navy during WW2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just looked it up and saw he did an album cover for Steely Dan. It reminded me that Chevy Chase was an early drummer for Steely Dan (well, before they became "Steely Dan")&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Steve Martin is one of the best banjo players out there&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And he’s great with a lasso!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love his albums with Edie Brickell, he’s good with Steep Canyon Rangers, and more recently have heard him shine with Alison Brown (banjo), Sierra Hull (mandolin), and others in his latest tour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for the top banjo players technically, you might check out Béla Fleck, Jens Kruger, Noam Pikelny, Tony Trischka, Bill Keith, Don Reno, and Earl Scruggs. I’ve personally heard superhuman performances by Jens Kruger in-person and I grew up on Scruggs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Makes sense. My grandpa is one year his junior and you would never see him react too strongly to anything, even though grandma (also still alive) always had an, ahem, fiery personality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also he refuses to sit and moves around all the time, venturing outside every day from their apartment four floors above ground without a lift.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly his own father didn't make it to his 60s, so there's certainly a lifestyle component to this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;YouTube's CEO Neal Mohan is the latest in a line of tech bosses who have admitted to limiting their children's social media use, as the harms of being online for young people have become more evident.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mohan, who took the helm of YouTube's leadership in 2023, was just named Time's 2025 CEO of the Year. He said in an interview with the magazine that his children's use of media platforms is controlled and restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We do limit their time on YouTube and other platforms and other forms of media. On weekdays we tend to be more strict, on weekends we tend to be less so. We're not perfect by any stretch," Mohan said in one TikTok video posted by Time Magazine on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He stressed "everything in moderation" is what works best for him and his wife, and that extends to other online services and platforms. Mohan has three children: two sons and one daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experts have continued to sound the alarm on how excessive smartphones and social media use has harmed children and teenagers. Jonathan Haidt, NYU professor and author of "The Anxious Generation," has advocated for children to not have smartphones before the age of 14 and no access to social media before the age of 16.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Let them have a flip phone, but remember, a smartphone isn't really a phone. They could make phone calls on it, but it's a multi-purpose device by which the world can get to your children," Haidt said in an interview with CNBC's Tania Bryer earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This week, Australia became the first country to formally bar users under the age of 16 from accessing major social media platforms. Ahead of the legislation's passage last year, a YouGov survey found that 77% of Australians backed the under-16 social media ban. Still, the rollout has faced some resistance since becoming law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mohan said in a more extensive interview with Time on Wednesday that he feels a "paramount responsibility" to young people and giving parents greater control over how their kids use the platform. YouTube Kids was launched in 2015 as a child-friendly version of the Google-owned platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He said his goal is "to make it easy for all parents" to manage their children's YouTube use "in a way that is suitable to their household," especially as every parent has a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bill Gates, Mark Cuban&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several tech bosses have taken a similar approach. YouTube's former CEO Susan Wojcicki, also barred her children from browsing videos on the app, unless they were using YouTube Kids. She also limited the amount of time they spent on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I allow my younger kids to use YouTube Kids, but I limit the amount of time that they're on it," Wojcicki told CNBC in 2019. "I think too much of anything is not a good thing."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder, is amongst the tech titans who are against allowing young people too much screen time. With three children, now adults, Gates openly talked about not giving them cell phones until they were in their teens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We don't have cell phones at the table when we are having a meal, we didn't give our kids cell phones until they were 14 and they complained other kids got them earlier," Gates said years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, billionaire Mark Cuban would even resort to installing Cisco routers and using management software to monitor which apps his children were on and shut off their phone activity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why We Built Another Object Storage (And Why It's Different)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High-performance object storage exists, but the economics make it unusable at scale. FractalBits breaks out of the high-performance trap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Crowded Market, But An Unsolved Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Object storage is the backbone of modern data infrastructure. AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, MinIO, Ceph, newer players like Tigris Data—the market is saturated. So why build another one?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the fundamental assumptions behind these systems are shifting. High performance is no longer optional—but having high performance available isn’t the same as being able to afford using it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Beyond “Cold Storage”: Why Performance Matters Now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional object storage had a clear priority order: cost first, performance later. This worked fine for archiving backups and storing large, rarely accessed files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But today, object storage is increasingly the primary data layer for AI, analytics, and cloud-native applications. Latency directly translates to compute costs—stalled GPUs waiting on I/O are expensive GPUs doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High-performance object storage exists now. S3 Express One Zone, for example, delivers single-digit millisecond latency. But there’s a catch: the per-request pricing makes it prohibitively expensive to actually use at high IOPS. As one analysis put it, it’s “the right technology, at the right time with the wrong price” [1]. You have the performance on paper, but you can’t afford to run your workload at full speed. That’s the high-performance trap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The New Challenge: AI and Analytical Workloads&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern workloads, especially in AI, impose demands that strain traditional designs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Small Objects at Scale: AI training datasets often consist of millions of small files (images, text snippets, feature vectors). A study of typical AI training workloads found over 60% of objects are 512KB or smaller [2]. This shifts the bottleneck from bandwidth to metadata performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Latency Sensitivity: Training loops and inference pipelines are bottlenecked by I/O. When fetching thousands of small objects per batch, per-object latency compounds quickly, stalling expensive GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Need for Directories: S3’s flat namespace is a mismatch for many workflows. Data scientists expect atomic renames and efficient directory listings—operations that are either slow or missing in classic object stores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;”Why Not Just Use a Filesystem?”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A reasonable question: if you want directories and atomic rename, why not just use a filesystem like AWS EFS? Object stores and filesystems are different concepts—why blur the line?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer is that the line is already blurring, driven by real workload demands. AWS themselves recognized this when they introduced S3 Express One Zone with explicit “directory bucket” semantics and atomic rename support (currently single-object) [3]. Google Cloud has made similar moves toward hierarchical namespace support [4]. The industry is converging on this because the clean separation between “object storage for scale” and “filesystem for semantics” doesn’t match how modern applications actually work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re not trying to build a POSIX filesystem. But the subset of filesystem semantics that matter for data workflows—efficient directory listings, atomic rename for safe data handoffs—these belong in object storage. The alternative is forcing every application to build fragile workarounds on top of a flat namespace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where Current Solutions Hit a Wall&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Existing systems struggle with these patterns in predictable ways:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The High-Performance Trap: High-performance tiers like S3 Express One Zone solve the latency problem, but the per-request cost means you can’t actually use that performance at scale. At 10K PUT/s, you’re looking at ~$29K/month in request fees alone. The performance is there; the economics aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Small Object Tax: With cloud object storage, you pay per request. Storing billions of 4KB objects means your API request costs can exceed your storage costs. The more objects you have, the worse it gets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Missing Directory Semantics: The lack of atomic rename forces complex workarounds in applications, limiting what you can build directly on object storage. Most systems with rename support rely on inode-like structures that struggle with scalability and performance—adding to the per-IOPS cost burden.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introducing FractalBits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built FractalBits to break out of the high-performance trap: delivering performance you can actually afford to use at scale. In our benchmarks, we achieved nearly 1M GET/s on 4KB objects with a cluster totaling 64 cores across all data and metadata nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our focus:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High IOPS at a cost that makes sense—so you can actually run your workload at full speed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Native directory semantics, including atomic rename.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Strong consistency—no eventual consistency surprises.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Cost Difference&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what the gap looks like for a small-object intensive workload (4KB objects, 10K IOPS):&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;FractalBits&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;S3 costs based on public pricing ($0.00113/1K PUTs, $0.00003/1K GETs, $0.11/GB/Month). FractalBits estimated using 1-year reserved instance pricing for required compute (e.g., i8g.2xlarge for data, m7g.4xlarge for metadata). Your savings will vary based on workload, but the magnitude is indicative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Key: Our Metadata Engine&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At our core is a metadata engine built on an on-disk radix tree, optimized for path-like keys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most object stores use LSM-trees (good for writes, variable read latency) or B+ trees (predictable reads, write amplification). We chose a radix tree because it naturally mirrors a filesystem hierarchy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prefix Sharing: Common path segments (e.g., &lt;code&gt;/datasets/cifar10/&lt;/code&gt;) are stored once, saving memory and speeding up traversal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Efficient Directory Operations: Listing a directory becomes a subtree scan. Atomic rename is essentially updating a pointer at the branch point, not copying data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crash Consistency: We use physiological logging to ensure metadata integrity and fast recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike most systems that use inode-based (or inode-like) structures to support directory features, we use a full-path approach for better scalability and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the way, we implemented the core engine in Zig for control and predictable performance.&lt;lb/&gt; Why Zig?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;comptime&lt;/code&gt;metaprogramming generates optimized code paths for different node types at compile time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Manual memory management means no GC pauses and predictable latency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Direct SIMD access for parallel key comparisons within tree nodes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;io_uring in std library, so that we can easily try more recent io_uring kernel features (registered buffers, nvme IOPoll etc).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Gateway: Rust-Based S3-Compatible API server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our S3-compatible API server, built in Rust, manages the data path:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Safety &amp;amp; Concurrency: Rust’s ownership model gives us thread safety without a garbage collector—important for high-concurrency request handling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Async I/O: Built on Tokio for handling thousands of concurrent connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Production-Ready Frameworks: We support both axum and actix-web, defaulting to actix-web. Its thread-per-core architecture aligns with our design for maximum performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Model: Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FractalBits deploys as a managed software layer within your own cloud account (currently AWS only).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cost transparency—you pay the cloud provider’s raw costs for VMs and disks, no egress fees to us&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data sovereignty—your data never leaves your cloud tenant&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Low latency—deploy in the same region/VPC as your compute&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For us: We leverage the cloud’s proven infrastructure instead of building it from scratch, letting us focus on the storage engine itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The object storage market has high-performance options, but the economics often make that performance unusable at scale. And systems that do offer directory semantics often struggle with performance or scalability. Getting both at a reasonable cost is still rare. We think there’s room for a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FractalBits is our answer. We’re early in this journey and learning from users who are pushing these limits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hitting the performance or cost wall with your current object storage? We’d be interested to hear about your use case.&lt;/p&gt;
