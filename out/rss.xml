  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes! Absolutely. Communicator is a fully standalone smartphone that runs Android 16, with all the apps, 5G connectivity and Wi-fi. We think many people will use this as their primary phone while others will use it as a complement to a flagship iPhone, Galaxy, Pixel, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weâre on track to ship Clicks Communicator orders later this year. Shipping timelines will be confirmed once manufacturing enters its final stage. Early customers will receive priority fulfillment. Follow along at @ClicksKeys on Instagram and www.Clicks.tech&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communicator will support 5G, 4GLTE, 3G/2G global bands and be sold unlocked. &lt;lb/&gt;5G NR: n41, n77, n78, n1, n2, n3, n5, n7, n8, n12, n13, n14, n20, n25, n26, n28, n38, n40, n41, n48, n66, n71, n77, n78&lt;lb/&gt;5G NR (4Ã4 MIMO): n1, n2, n3, n7, n25, n38, n40, n41, n48, n66, n77, n78LTE (4G):&lt;lb/&gt;FDD: B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B7, B8, B12, B13, B14, B17, B18, B19, B20, B25, B26, B28, B66, B71&lt;lb/&gt;TDD: B34, B38, B39, B40, B41, B42, B483G / 2G:&lt;lb/&gt;WCDMA: B1, B2, B4, B5, B6, B8, B9, B19&lt;lb/&gt;GSM: B2, B3, B5, B8&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communicator will be sold unlocked, supporting a number of the most popular 5G, 4GLTE, 3G/2G global bands. We will evaluate carrier certification as we approach availability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a real keyboard with the QWERTY layout, Communicator supports languages that use the Latin alphabet: English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Dutch, Japanese, Estonian, Faroese, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Turkish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this stage of development itâs too early to project battery life. Battery life has been a core design priority from day one. Thatâs why weâre combining a 4,000 mAh silicon-carbon battery with a 4.03â AMOLED display and a modern 4-nanometer SoC that will work together to deliver an efficient power management experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communicator will run Android 16. Weâre comfortable committing to 2 years of Android updates and 5 years of security updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communicator uses a modern 4-nanometer, 5G IoT SoC platform from MediaTek&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communicator packs a 4.03â AMOLED display with a 1080 x 1200 resolution&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Main (rear facing) camera: 50MP, autofocus with optical image stabilization&lt;lb/&gt;Front facing camera: 24MP fixed focus&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reservation program allows you to reserve a Clicks Communicator prior to general availability. By placing a reservation, you secure priority access to purchase a Clicks Communicator when ordering opens. There are two options available: a Reservation Deposit of $199 USD (applied toward the final purchase price at checkout) or a Full Reservation of $399 USD (Early Bird Price), which represents payment of the full purchase price in advance. When ordering opens ahead of shipment, reservation holders will be invited to configure and complete their Communicator order. Please see the full Terms of Reservation for details on our reservation program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. You may cancel at any time before your reservation converts into an order for a full refund.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reservation holders will be invited to configure their Communicator closer to our first production run. Stay tuned for updates!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Voice over internet calling (like WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook) will carry over from your primary phone. If you want to make and receive traditional phone calls over cellular networks, a second SIM/phone number will be required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes! Communicator will support both a physical (nano) SIM card and eSIM. The nano-SIM slot is found beneath the back cover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The limited warranty runs for a period of one year from the date of delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Closer to availability we will contact customers who have purchased reservations to configure your Communicator (colors, covers, etc.). You will be asked to confirm your shipping address at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weâre focused on shipping Communicator with QWERTY at this time. QWERTY will support a broad range of latin character based language. We will monitor interest in other keyboard layouts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We currently ship to the United States, Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica, Guatemala, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan, Oman, Turkey, Egypt, Australia, New Zealand, Paraguay, and across Europe, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Poland, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Austria, Sweden, Greece, Ireland, Croatia, Portugal, Denmark, Slovenia, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Finland, Lithuania, Montenegro, Guernsey, Gibraltar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iceland, the Isle of Man, Kosovo, and Hungary.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;POSSE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;POSSE is an abbreviation for Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere, the practice of posting content on your own site first, then publishing copies or sharing links to third parties (like social media silos) with original post links to provide viewers a path to directly interacting with your content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;▶️ watch Zach’s 1min* video intro to POSSE&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let your friends read your posts, their way. POSSE lets your friends keep using whatever they use to read your stuff (e.g. social media silos like Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter, Neocities, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stay in touch with friends now, not some theoretical future. POSSE is about staying in touch with current friends now, rather than the potential of staying in touch with friends in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Friends are more important than federation. By focusing on relationships that matter to people rather than architectural ideals, from a human perspective, POSSE is more important than federation. Additionally, if federated approaches take a POSSE approach first, they will likely get better adoption (everyone wants to stay in touch with their friends), and thereby more rapidly approach that federated future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;POSSE is beyond blogging. It's a key part of why and how the IndieWeb movement is different from just "everyone blog on their own site", and also different from "everyone just install and run (YourFavoriteSocialSoftware)" etc. monoculture solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why In General&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;POSSE is considered a robust and preferable syndication model for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reduce 3rd party dependence. By posting directly to your own site, you're not dependent on 3rd Party services to do so -- if you can access your site, you can publish your content. On the contrary with PESOS, when the 3rd party site is down, you are unable to add content.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ownership. By posting first on your own site, you create a direct ownership chain that can be traced back to you without any intervening 3rd party services (silos) TOS's getting in the way (which is a vulnerability of PESOS).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Own canonical URLs to your content. Canonical URLs to your content are on your domain.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Copies can cite the original. By posting content first to your own site (and thus creating a permalink for it), copies that you post on 3rd Party services can link or cite the original on your site (see syndication_formats and POSSE Notes to Twitter)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Better search. Searching public content on your own domain (with any web search engine of your choice) works better than depending on silos exclusively to search your posts (e.g. Twitter for a while only showed recent tweets in search results. Facebook still has very poor search results).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;backfeed can be used to pull in (reverse syndicate) responses from other services&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;allows taking advantage of other services' social layers and aggregation features while storing the canonical copy of your content on your own site&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;...&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why Link To Your Original&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Common POSSE practice is to link from POSSE copies to your original, using a permashortlink. Here are a few reasons why:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Discovery of your original content. discovery of your original content from the copies on 3rd party services is enabled by the permashortlinks to your originals posted on said services&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Subvert spammers who copy your posts. When spammers (e.g. @sin3rss) mindlessly copy from your POSSE copies and repost, they also copy the link back to the original, and thus provide more distribution for people to find and view your original post. "2011-01-09 internet aikido" of a sort.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Better ranking for your original posts. If/when your POSSE copies are themselves copied by others and (re)posted elsewhere (e.g. manual retweets, RSS bots etc.), when the copies link to your original posts, search engines figure that out by following those links back to the original and ranking it higher.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How to implement&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section is for web developers implementing POSSE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;In General&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, when your content posting software posts something, it should also post a copy to the silo destinations of your choice, with an original post link (e.g. permashortlink or permashortcitation) back to your original.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The details of how to do so vary per destination. See the silo-specific sections below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have posted the copy to the silo, you should:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;link to the syndicated copy from the original in a posts-elsewhere section on your post.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;User Interface&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best user interface (UI) is automatic, dependable, and invisible. If you can implement POSSEing in a way that always does exactly what you want, predictably, then no explicit UI is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Preview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One way to provide more predictability and inspire confidence is to show what will be POSSEd (within the limitations of the destination) as a preview before publishing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(needs screenshot)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twitter is perhaps the most popular POSSE destination and a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you can start posting notes (tweets) to your own site and POSSEing to Twitter, instead of posting directly to Twitter, you have taken a big step towards owning your data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Details:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;API Access - posting new tweets works nicely due to permanent API tokens, and the return value contains a URL to the posted &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;As of 2022-11, Twitter is rejecting new API access for applications used to POSSE/backfeed on the grounds that they may violate twitter’s rules and/or policies — Barnaby Walters&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Supports very complete web action endpoints, so semi-manual posting is easy to implement &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;What are these endpoints? Is this still the case in 2022? — Barnaby Walters&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See POSSE to Twitter for details on how to POSSE both notes and articles (blog posts) to Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two options for POSSEing to Facebook currently:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Manually crosspost&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Semi-automatically with the Bridgy browser extension for Facebook&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Medium&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can create posts via the posts API&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Medium also supports manual POSSE via the Import Post function, which preserves rel-canonical links to the original URL&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shane Becker and Ben Werdmüller manually POSSE to Medium&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chris Aldrich uses the WordPress Medium Plugin to POSSE to Medium. They also support bulk migration (aka mass POSSE) for porting across lots of posts after which posts can be POSSEd by means of their plugin.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Aaron Gustafson Wrote a Jekyll plugin to POSSE to Medium.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;WordPress&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How does veganstraightedge.com do it? (all his articles are manually POSSEd to WordPress.com)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Chris Aldrich uses a WordPress plugin WordPress Crosspost to POSSE from a self-hosted WordPress install to WordPress.com.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Plain Text Notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some destinations (e.g. SMS or push notifications) may require a pure plain text representation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;h-entry_to_text is a method of generating a plain text representation from an arbitrary h-entry&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Software&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software and libraries to implement POSSE:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PHP &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The POSSE namespace in php-helpers (might be moved to a separate package) contains various truncation, preparation and syndication functions including HTML =&amp;gt; plaintext µblog syntax converter&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Python &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;SiloRider is a command-line tool, implemented in Python, that lets you implement POSSE to various services (Twitter and Mastodon as of 2018-08-01).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Feed2Toot is another command-line python tool that parses any number of RSS feeds and posts their content on ActivityPub based services (tested with: Mastodon, Pleroma). Contains some neat bells and whistles like advanced post filtering, numerous options for feed parsing and toot formatting.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Docker &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;POSSE Party: self-hosted software for POSSE&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Services&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bridgy Publish is POSSE-as-a-service. It supports Twitter, Flickr, GitHub and Mastodon. You can use it interactively or programmatically via webmention.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mugged Tweets - will POSSE a note to a mug (may require first POSSEing to Twitter)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IFTTT allows automatically reposting content with an RSS or Atom feed to a number of silos incuding Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;EchoFeed&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Publishing Flows&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's at least two ways to implement a POSSE content posting flow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Client to site to silo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The user writes a piece of content using a publishing client &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Optional: client provides UI for selecting which 3rd party services to push to if it knows about them, with optional customizations for per service&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Having finished the content, the user publishes content to their server (optionally: with metadata of which 3rd party services and any customizations thereof) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Optional: client can generate a permalink knowing the state of the server, and publish to that permalink&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The server publishes the content, generates a permalink and summary (and/or customized content suited to 3rd party services) if necessary&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The server posts copies with permalinks to 3rd party services&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;User only has to interact with one site over the internet, their own&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Syndication can be done fully automatically by the server&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;any?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Client to site and silo&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The user writes a piece of content using a publishing client&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Having finished the content, the user publishes it to their server&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The client queries the server for the URL of the content it just pushed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The publishing client presents the user with an interface for selecting: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Which 3rd party services to publish to&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The exact content published to the services, pre-filled with a summary based on the produced content&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The user selects the services and submits the form&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The publishing client posts the content summaries out to the 3rd party services&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More user control over timing and editing of copies of content to 3rd party services&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Syndication requires a manual step each time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dependent on client connectivity directly to 3rd party services (problematic in flakey mobile situations, or when client is publishing using domain-censored internet access).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;IndieWeb Examples&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following IndieWebCamp participants' sites support a POSSE architecture. If you have an implementation, add it, make screenshots or a screencast or blog about it and post the details/link here. In date order (earliest first) :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tantek&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tantek.com as of 2010-01-01[1] (2010-01-26 Twitter syndication started[2] and caught up[3][4]). Tantek Çelik implemented POSSE in Falcon on tantek.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;all self-hosted posts are openly with PuSH v0.4 + h-feed and Atom real-time syndicated with a PubsubHubbub hub to StatusNet, other subscribers etc. (also to Google Buzz til it shutdown)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;note (and article titles), reply, RSVP posts are snowflake copied by the personal site server to Twitter with permashortlink citation links/references (see Whistle for details) back to the original. Copies of notes to Twitter are also automatically recopied from there to Facebook.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;likes of tweets are "copied" (more like propagated) to Twitter using Bridgy publish&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Barnaby Walters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Waterpigs.co.uk as of 2012-03-12. Barnaby Walters implemented POSSE over at waterpigs.co.uk&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;as of 2012-09-25 all collections (notes, articles, activity) are PuSH-subscribable feeds.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using the Client to Server to 3rd Parties flow --Waterpigs.co.uk 06:08, 25 September 2012 (PDT)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Syndicating to Twitter + Facebook&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As of 2014-06-19 Taproot can now optionally post additional POSSE tweets when updating a note or article — example of updated note and POSSE tweet for the update. Note that Bridgy successfully backfeeds silo interactions from the update tweet as well as the original POSSE tweet&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Brennan Novak&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;brennannovak.com as of 2012-07-01[5][6]. Brennan Novak implemented POSSE on his site brennannovak.com with copies posted to Twitter and Facebook&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Aaron Parecki&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;aaronparecki.com as of 2012-08-19[7][8]. Aaron Parecki implemented POSSE on his site aaronparecki.com with copies posted to Twitter containing permashortlinks back to originals on his own site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;User:Sandeep.io First post POSSE'd on 2012-11-05. I primarily syndicate to Twitter using a very lo-fi solution of adding silo (Facebook, Twiiter, Google+) provided share links to each post that I can manually click to prefill content, edit and post. I've avoided API integration because of the extensive experience I've had using Facebook API and dealing with it's random changes. "Integration" has high costs sometimes so I keep it as simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;werd.io as of 2013-05-31 [9]. Ben Werdmuller implemented POSSE in his idno platform via plugins. New content has an associated Activity Streams object type; POSSE plugins listen for post events associated with those object types and syndicate appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Notes and articles are syndicated to Twitter and Facebook&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Images are syndicated to Facebook, Flickr and Twitter&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Places are syndicated to Foursquare&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More plugins are very easily possible; the Foursquare plugin took about an hour to build&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;glennjones.net as of 2014-01-14 Glenn Jones The blog implemented POSSE using a new version of transmat.io system. New content added to transmat is associated with objects types. A POSSE twitter plugins listens for post events syndicating content. At moment only notes are syndicated.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;adactio.com as of 2014-05-27 Jeremy Keith has implemented POSSE using his own custom CMS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Notes have been POSSEd since he first started posting them on his own site, on 2014-05-27 (Note POSSE copy may say 2014-05-26 presumably because of timezone differences, Jeremy's is in BST, while a PDT viewer sees datetime adjusted accordingly). See also related blog post 2014-06-01.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Photos have been POSSEd to Twitter since he first started posting them on his own site on 2014-07-05 and to Flickr since 2014-07-08. Examples: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;http://adactio.com/notes/6978/&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;http://adactio.com/notes/7021 - first photo POSSEd to both Twitter and Flickr:&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Previously working on Wordpress but he was not keen on the UX.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Has reply contexts working but has to manually copy the ID.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Not yet POSSEing photos but plans to.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Currently he has to manually copy the tweet from the main text box to a 140 character limit tweet text box. He plans to make that automatic.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;ludovic.chabant.com as of 2018-07-30 Ludovic Chabant has implement POSSE to Twitter and Mastodon from PieCrust CMS, using SiloRider&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SiloRider is CMS independent -- it only relies on Microformats found in the published markup.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;New articles are posted as title and link.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;New microblogging updates are mostly copied verbatim (if the fit the external service's character limits), and support photo posts, including multi-photo posts.&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;The fediverse using fed.brid.gy&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This syndication happens automatically whenever James posts a note using his Micropub client or his Microsub feed reader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;... add more here ...&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;... Add a link to your POSSE–enabled site and the date you started syndicating copies of your content out to 3rd party social sharing/publishing services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Partial POSSE sites&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sites which only POSSE some of their content, and still post directly to the same silo they POSSE to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other partial POSSE sites:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;User:Hupili.net implements a partial POSSE with the following setups: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;SNSAPI is a lightweight middleware to unify the data structure and interfaces of different social networking services. It gives the scripting flexibility for developer users to manipulate social silos.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;SNSRouter is a web UI built upon SNSAPI where one can read an aggregated timeline from different sites, mass forward messages, and update statuses on all channels.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;As is said in one of the description paragraph above, this model is not truly POSSE. One can not (hardly) distinguish original/ syndicated status. I'm planning to put a page with permlink on my site upon each status update and then use SNSAPI to syndicate to other silos.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other Approaches&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;COPE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;COPE is short for Create Once, Publish Everywhere (COPE), which explicitly lacks a first "Publish Once" step, and thus is more about duplicating the content across various destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without a first "Publish Once" step on a site you "Own", and thus lacking original post permalinks, the COPE strategy fails to actually draw people to any one canonical place to read/view your stuff, and thus all it does is grow (likely) disjoint audiences across other people’s sites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Articles:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2009-10-13 COPE: Create Once, Publish Everywhere by Daniel Jacobson, Director of Application Development for NPR. (Original https://www.programmableweb.com/news/cope-create-once-publish-everywhere/2009/10/13 offline due to site-death of programmableweb.com in 2022)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2019-10-28 Create Once, Publish Everywhere With WordPress by Leonardo Losovitz in Smashing Magazine&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2019 WordCamp Taipei talk: Create Once, Publish Everywhere video on WordPress.tv&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;POSE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;POSE, Publish Once Syndicate Everywhere, was a broader predecessor of POSSE that also included publishing once on one particular silo, and then syndicating out to other silos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;PESOS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A similar but opposite approach is PESOS where content is posted first to 3rd party services and then copied/syndicated into a personal site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If exact copies of content are posted on both a personal site and 3rd party services, there's no way to tell (short of comparing possibly non-existent sub-second accurate published dates) whether a site is using POSSE or PESOS. Sites can provably support POSSE by including perma(short)links in syndicated copies that link/reference back to published originals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;PESETAS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PESETAS is like PESOS but copying/syndicating everything to a particular silo (without any involvement of a personal site).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, most silos support cross-posting to Twitter, thus you could connect everything to your Twitter account and always (auto-)cross-post there to keep a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;E.g. Tumblr has a UI for cross-posting to Twitter. See Webapps StackExchange post for documentation and screenshots of UI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tumblr is a better PESETAS destination however, since it is well established, allows for a wider variety of content, and allows more text, and links to URLs directly instead of linkwrapping them like Twitter does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Brainstorming&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;CRUD&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the above, and to date (2013-222), POSSE has solely described syndicating the Creation of content on your site (publishing) to other sites. This model has been quite successful and perhaps may be sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, it is worth exploring the potential utility of a full CRUD protocol for POSSE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Create&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create is the POSSE default. You create content on your site, you POSSE your creates to other sites. All of this is described above, and in silo-specific details on silo pages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Read&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read as a verb is interesting when applied to POSSE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a minimum, it's useful to implement storing links to syndicated copies of your content to provide for the future possibility of reading from downstream POSSE copies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;u-syndication for how to markup links to syndicated copies of your content&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;syndication-link-use-cases for why to do so&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actual direct uses of Reading from downstream POSSE copies:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;reverse-syndication / backfeed of activity around the POSSE copy onto your original:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, keeping a u-syndication link to the POSSE copy enables deleting it to perform an Update or a Delete action, as described in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Update&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a POSSE destination allows updates/edits, then when you edit your post, you could propagate that update to the downstream POSSE copy as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;E.g. Facebook allows editing the text of a post (including any links in the text), person tags, but not the image of a photo post&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the destination disallows updates/edits, like Twitter, it is still possible to virtually POSSE updates by deleting the POSSE tweet and reposting, i.e.:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider only POSSEing updates to Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;if no one has replied to it yet (otherwise you'd break a threaded conversation on Twitter)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;if your changes would be shown in the truncated copy on Twitter (i.e. if your changes are past the 140 (more like 120) character horizon, no point in churning the Twitter copy).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;within a very short time window, maybe like 2-5 minutes, because otherwise the update will be seen as a duplicate to people who are reading you on Twitter.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of these concerns are regarding the experience that you provide to your friends reading your tweets on Twitter, which of course should be the whole (design) reason you're bothering to POSSE to Twitter in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For details, see silo-specific POSSE sections:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Facebook: POSSE to Facebook (to-do: needs details re: edit text ok, but no photo editing, photo posts need delete/repost to simulate POSSE update)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flickr: (UI supports manually updating the image of a photo post, but is that available in the API? and if so, file a Bridgy Publish feature request GitHub issue to support POSSE Update to Flickr (including the image of a photo post)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Twitter: POSSE to Twitter (to-do: copy the above delete/repost strategy to there)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;...&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Delete&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deletes seem fairly straightforward to POSSE, especially to services which themselves propagate deletes to clients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;E.g. one can delete a note on Twitter at any point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to updates, consider:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;if there are already replies to a POSSE copy (or activity like favorites/retweets), consider keeping it to keep conversation threading (and others' favorites/retweets).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, if you really feel like deleting the content from your site and POSSE copies (e.g. on Twitter), go ahead and do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is an opportunity for the UI for the deletion of a post to check to see if there's been any activity (replies, favorites, retweets) on the POSSE copy before performing the delete. One possible implementation could involve the UI informing the user of this activity (or lack of it) and reconfirming the delete request on a per-service basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p/&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;IndieWeb Examples&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Grant Richmond supports POSSE deletes on twitter as of 2018-10-10, by checking if a post on his site has been unpublished / deleted and sending the appropriate api request for likes, reposts and notes.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FAQ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Worry about search engines and duplicates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Do we need to worry about search engines penalizing apparently duplicate posts?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A: That's why the POSSE copies SHOULD always link back to the originals. So that search engines can infer that the copies are just copies. Ideally POSSE copies on silos should use rel-canonical to link back to the originals, but even without explicit rel-canonical, the explicit link back to the original is a strong hint that it is an original.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is also an advantage of POSSE over PESOS. With PESOS - there's no way to tell what's the original and what's the copy - so they do look like duplicates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;POSSE-post-discovery and backlinks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Brid.gy can use posse-post-discovery to find the relationship between a syndicated post and the original when there is not explicit link. Does this mean I should stop adding backlinks to syndicated copies?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A: POSSEing without a backlink is considered a last resort, and has some costs associated with it. See posse-post-discovery#Tradeoffs for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2010-05-26 POSSE first described online as a concept in Tantek Celik on DiSo 2.0: Down to Brass Tacks(archived monkinetic original) : &lt;p&gt;Publish on your own site, own your URLs, your permalinks, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Syndicate out to other sites. Your text updates to Twitter, your checkins to Foursquare, your photos to Flickr etc.&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;sometime before 2014-06-21[11]: POSE (Publish Once Syndicate Everywhere) term defined at some point prior to POSSE. Conceptually it was looser than POSSE, as "once" could be interpreted as on a silo rather than your "own site", which POSSE (and the conceptual predecessors) made explicit.&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt; Ars Technica) How Google’s AMP project speeds up the Web—by sandblasting HTML (&lt;p&gt;[…] this nudges publishers toward an idea that's big in the IndieWeb movement: Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere (or POSSE for short).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to own the canonical copy of the content on your own site but then to send that content everywhere you can. Or rather, everywhere you want to reach your readers. Facebook Instant Article? Sure, hook up the RSS feed. Apple News? Send the feed over there, too. AMP? Sure, generate an AMP page. No need to stop there—tap the new Medium API and half a dozen others as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading is a fragmented experience. Some people will love reading on the Web, some via RSS in their favorite reader, some in Facebook Instant Articles, some via AMP pages on Twitter, some via Lynx in their terminal running on a restored TRS-80 (seriously, it can be done. See below). The beauty of the POSSE approach is that you can reach them all from a single, canonical source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Web's sake, let's hope Google sticks with AMP long enough to convince publishers that the real future is speeding up their own pages and embracing a POSSE-style approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Was Daft Punk Having a Laugh When They Chose the Tempo of Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google "harder better faster stronger bpm" and Google’s “AI Overview” will tell you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Daft Punk’s “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger” generally sits around 123 BPM (Beats Per Minute), though some analyses find it slightly higher (like 123.48 BPM) or list different BPMs in remixes/workouts, with exact figures varying slightly by source and version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spotify’s metadata database, SongBPM, and most other online BPM databases list it at exactly 123.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I think our helmet-clad robot friends might have been making a little joke that we’ve apparently all missed. The BPM of Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger is actually 123.45.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do I know this? It so happens that for over 10 years I’ve written an app called Tempi that shows the BPM of music in real time, so I know a little bit about the science and algorithms behind music tempo detection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most tempo detection software works basically the same way:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A specialized algorithm called the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) collects overlapping energy levels at different frequency bands.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Those levels are refined into well-defined peaks that represent rhythmic events in the track.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Another algorithm (autocorrelation) looks for patterns, or more accurately periodicity, in those peaks.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But these patterns are tricky because there’s all kinds of noise, performance inaccuracies, and rhythmic harmonics throwing things off. All that is to say, a) it’s complicated and b) it’s not perfectly accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I make changes to my own system of course I need some way to know if it’s getting better or worse, so I have a test library of hundreds of song snippets that I score it against. One of these songs is Daft Punk’s HBFS, and early on I noticed something strange about that track.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost all electronic music is synced to a sequencer and so obviously is going to have a very steady tempo. But while the vast majority of electronic music tracks I test have an “integral” tempo – meaning their tempo is exactly some round number like 95, and not a fraction like 95.2 – my software always finds the BPM of HBFS to be somewhere between 123 and 124, but not exactly either. For years I’ve chalked this up to inconsistencies with my system and didn’t think much of it. But lately I’ve made improvements to the system so that it’s much more accurate and it now tells me the BPM of HBFS is 123.4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that got me thinking, “Hmm. Did these guys pick that tempo because they have a sense of humor? And if so, how far would they take it?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get to the bottom of this I needed to establish what the BPM of HBFS really is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;And that’s actually pretty easy to do…&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a Venn diagram showing the overlap between human and computer capabilities in the digital realm:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Computers can do almost all “computer-y” things (i.e. things that can be entirely done on a computer) MUCH better, faster, (and stronger?) than humans. But for the time being there remain a few things that humans can do very easily which computers find difficult. Along with counting traffic lights and crosswalks, one of those things is finding the exact BPM of a song. Not an estimate like most software does, but the exact value with extreme precision across the entire song. Anyone with a basic sense of rhythm and an audio app can do this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open the song in an audio app like Logic, Audition, Ableton, Reaper, ProTools, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zoom in on the waveform a little bit so you can see the shape of the beats.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find the first obvious beat – meaning it has a well-defined waveform peak – and the last obvious beat. Let’s call these “bookend” beats.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Measure the exact duration in seconds between the bookend beats.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Play the song and count all the beats starting at the first bookend beat and ending at the last bookend beat. (If you have an old school calculator, an easy way to do this is type “1+1=” and then just keep tapping “=” to add 1 on each beat.)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then to get the exact tempo of the track, averaged throughout the entire thing, use this formula:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bpm = 60 * (number_of_beats - 1) / duration&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Computers have a rough time of this because they don’t really know how to “keep a beat”, and the algorithms that can find the beat do a lot better when they already know the estimated BPM, which is obviously a chicken/egg problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the first bookend beat in HBFS I used the first beat after the “whooshing” intro, at around 5.58s. The last bookend beat I used the last “work” at about the 3:41.85 mark. (“Never” and “Over” aren’t good candidates because you can’t see their waveform peaks.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That gives exactly 446 beats or 445 intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried this with two different copies of HBFS. The Discovery CD rip I have of the song has a duration between the bookend beats of 216.282, so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bpm = 60 * 445 / 216.282 = 123.4499403556&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “YouTube official audio” track I tested has a duration of 216.276, so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bpm = 60 * 445 / 216.276 = 123.4533651445&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Discovery CD version has obviously undergone less processing over time than the YouTube version so I tend to think it’s more representative, and it’s very close to 123.45 – only a 0.00005964 difference! But even the more modern YouTube version closely rounds to 123.45.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So hopefully I’ve put this fact to rest:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The BPM of Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger is 123.45.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;But…was this intentional, or just a happy accident?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The year is 1999 or 2000. Would the gear Daft Punk uses even support fractional BPMs? And if so out to how many decimal places?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From their 2001 interview with Remix Magazine (archive.org) we know that Bangalter says:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our sequencing is done either on an E-mu SP-1200, an Akai MPC, or a PC with Logic Audio software. We do not work on things in just one way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And from later interviews we know the Akai MPC was specifically an MPC-3000. (Oh, and that’s Emagic’s Logic, not Apple’s. Apple didn’t acquire Emagic until 2002.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did the E-mu support fractional BPMs? Yes, but only to 1 decimal place:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Akai MPC-3000? Yep, also to 1 decimal place:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What about Emagic’s Logic?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oooh, look at that. Logic supported BPMs to *4* decimal places.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But while we know those three sequencers were used on the Discovery album, I’m not sure anyone else knows which one was specifically used on HBFS. I’ve searched and searched and it seems this detail has just never been revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And to confuse matters more, in a 2013 interview with Time Magazine, Bangalter says:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So we’ve never actually made music with computers! [laughs] Neither Homework nor Discovery nor even Human After All were made with computers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Was he contradicting himself from 12 years before? Or did he forget? Or maybe it’s a terminology thing?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That the CD version is so close to exactly 123.45 makes me think this was intentional. And if it was? Well played, robots. You managed to leave a little Easter egg hiding in plain sight for 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update: A Hacker News reader pointed out that I accidentally reversed the durations of the YouTube clip and the CD rip. Fixed!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lots of the CVE world seems to focus on “security bugs” but I’ve found that it is not all that well known exactly how the Linux kernel security process works. I gave a talk about this back in 2023 and at other conferences since then, attempting to explain how it works, but I also thought it would be good to explain this all in writing as it is required to know this when trying to understand how the Linux kernel CNA issues CVEs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a post in the series about the Linux kernel CVE release process:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux kernel versions, how the Linux kernel releases are numbered.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tracking kernel commits across branches, how to keep track of Linux kernel commits as they move from the main release branch into the different stable releases in an automated way.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux kernel security work (this post), how the Linux kernel security team works to fix reported security bugs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;tl;dr&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Summary up front for those not wanting to read a wall of text:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Linux kernel security team work to fix reported issues as quickly as possible and get the fixes merged to public trees, and do not do any announcements anywhere.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Linux kernel security team and the CVE team are different groups of people, all of whom do this work on their own recognition, not associated with any company.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Only send plain text emails to the kernel security team.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Do not email the kernel security team and expect to get a CVE assigned.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Reactive, not proactive, security work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Linux kernel security team is group of Linux kernel developers who are responsible for triaging potential security bugs that are reported to them, and get them fixed as soon as possible. They do this work as “reactive” for security issues, independent of the great “proactive” kernel security work that the Kernel Self-protection project has been doing for the past 10+ years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Kernel security team&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As can be seen in the in-kernel documentation to contact the security team, just email the address in that document the potential issue that you have found, without using HTML or any binary attachments, and the developers there will take the report and usually ask questions and work to resolve the issue if it turns out to actually be a real security issue. Many issues reported are not, and so the reporter is told to send their bug report to the respective mailing list and work on it with the developers there, in public.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When reporting a bug, just send a simple, plain text email to the security alias. Do not send an email that contains a binary attachment as opening unsolicited binary files is not anything anyone should be doing. Also do not use markdown formatting, just plain text. Also, no encryption is needed, as it will not work due to the email alias handling (i.e. one address to many individuals.) If you are forced to use encryption to report security problems, please reconsider this policy as it feels counterproductive (UK government, this means you…)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The members of the security team contain a handful of core kernel developers that have experience dealing with security bugs, and represent different major subsystems of the kernel. They do this work as individuals, and specifically can NOT tell their employer, or anyone else, anything that is discussed on the security alias before it is resolved. This arrangement has allowed the kernel security team to remain independent and continue to operate across the different governments that the members operate in, and it looks to become the normal way project security teams work with the advent of the European Union’s new CRA law coming into affect which places requirements on response time of companies that receive notice of potential security issues in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How the fix happens&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way the security team works is when a bug is reported, if the members do not have experience in that specific subsystem, they drag the maintainers of that subsystem into the email chain, and work to get the bug resolved. If a subsystem has a continued number of bugs reported over time, the maintainer can be “asked” if they wish to join the alias to help remove the additional “hop” of bug triage happening. This is what has caused the alias members to naturally grow over time to end up representing the major portions of the kernel with the most issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideally the bug reporter also provides a working fix for the issue, allowing them to get the proper credit for the fix but of course that does not always happen. If no fix is provided, the developers involve work to resolve the bug as soon as they can, and when they agree it is resolved, get it merged into the main kernel branch and the stable kernel releases as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;No embargoes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the documentation states, no embargoes longer than 7 days are allowed, once a working fix is made, as there’s no real reason to hold off on getting a fix merged at that time. Only very few changes ever have any embargo at all, as it’s more bother than it is worth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the bug is fixed in the kernel trees, the developer’s work is finished, and it is up to the reporter if they wish to “announce” a bugfix or not. The kernel security team on their own do not do any reporting or external communication at all. Only later, if the fix is warranted to justify a CVE being assigned, is the commit announced as a security fix, but that work is done by the kernel CVE team, NOT the kernel security team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More about how the kernel CVE team works in a later post in this series…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A bug is a bug is a bug&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This “do not announce anything” policy has been present in the kernel security team since the very beginning, and as you can imagine, has caused much “disagreement” by those outside of the kernel community. This came up soon after the kernel security team was established in a 2008 email thread with Linus:&lt;/p&gt;

  Umm. What part of "they are just normal bugs" did you have issues with?
  I expressly told you that security bugs should not be marked as such,
  because bugs are bugs.

  &amp;gt; in other words, it's all the more reason to have the commit say it's
  &amp;gt; fixing a security issue.

  No.

  &amp;gt; &amp;gt; I'm just saying that why mark things, when the marking have no meaning?
  &amp;gt; &amp;gt; People who believe in them are just _wrong_.
  &amp;gt;
  &amp;gt; what is wrong in particular?

  You have two cases:

  - people think the marking is somehow trustworthy.

    People are WRONG, and are misled by the partial markings, thinking that
    unmarked bugfixes are "less important". They aren't.

  - People don't think it matters

    People are right, and the marking is pointless.
    In either case it's just stupid to mark them. I don't want to do it,
    because I don't want to perpetuate the myth of "security fixes" as a
    separate thing from "plain regular bug fixes".

    They're all fixes. They're all important. As are new features, for that
    matter.

  &amp;gt; when you know that you're about to commit a patch that fixes a security
  &amp;gt; bug, why is it wrong to say so in the commit?

  It's pointless and wrong because it makes people think that other bugs
  aren't potential security fixes.

  What was unclear about that?

  Linus
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole email thread is worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;No one knows how you use open source&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The primary reason why the kernel does not do any security announcements is that almost any bugfix at the level of an operating system kernel can be a “security issue” given the issues involved (memory leaks, denial of service, information leaks, etc.) Also, given that Linux is open source, the developers involved in fixing problems do NOT know how Linux is being used. A simple bugfix for a minor thing for one user could be a major system vulnerability fix for a different user, all depending on how Linux is being used. Ben Hawkes said it best in a wonderful essay about “What is a good Linux kernel bug”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;âIt’s hard to capture the fact that a bug can be super serious in one type of deployment, somewhat important in another, or no big deal at all – and that the bug can be all of this at the same time. Vulnerability remediation is hard.â â Ben Hawkes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Always remember, kernel developers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;do not know your use case.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;do not know what code you use.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;do not want to know any of this.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, overall, the kernel security bug policy can be boiled down to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix known bugs as soon as possible.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Get releases out to users as quickly as possible.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those that are always worried “what if a bugfix causes problems”, they should remember that a fix for a known bug is better than the potential of a fix causing a future problem as future problems, when found, will be fixed then. You never want to have “known bugfixes” not resolved on your system at any time. So much so that recent laws will soon be preventing you that being allowed for many countries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hardware security issues&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As history has shown us with Spectre and Meltdown, this “no embargo” policy does not always work well when working with problems that cross operating systems and hardware platforms, possibly requiring firmware or microcode updates. Because of this, the kernel developers have been forced to come up with a “Hardware Security policy” to handle these types of issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This different workflow involves the creation of a special encrypted and restricted email list containing just the needed kernel and hardware developers that are required to get the problem solved. With this process, embargoes are grumpily tolerated for now. Many different hardware bugs have been resolved in Linux over the years through this process, but as a participant in some of these efforts, it is clunky, awkward, and often times extremely slow. The kernel developers involved really do not like this process, and hopefully this will be phased out over time as many hardware issues have been resolved in the past year without having to get this special process involved at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, due to the CRA timelines, long embargo times will probably not even be possible for hardware companies to handle. How that is going to interact with microcode and firmware updates in the next few years is going to be an “interesting” thing to watch evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How this all started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Way back in 2005, there was not any “official” way to contact anyone about kernel security bugs. It was just an ad-hock group of people that developers “knew” they could email problems to. That obviously did not really scale, and was not helpful for anyone who did not know how the kernel developers worked. This came to a head in 2005 with this email from Steve Bergman:&lt;/p&gt;

Subject: Proper procedure for reporting possible security vulnerabilities?
Date: Mon, 10 Jan 2005 10:46:57 -0600

There seems to be some confusion in certain quarters as to the proper
procedure for reporting possible kernel security issues.

REPORTING-BUGS says send bug reports to the maintainer of that area of
the kernel. However, what about areas for which a maintainer is not
listed? (e.g. VM) It seems that some take that to mean send it
directly to Linus and if you don't hear something back quickly, release
an exploit to the wild.

So what is the preferred procedure and is it documented somewhere?
Should it be made more prominent?

Thanks for any information,
Steve Bergman
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That naturally kicked off a bit of discussion, so 36 emails later, the idea of a central email alias that could handle reported security issues was decided on and a few months later, was written up by Chris Wright:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;No security announcements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As stated earlier, the kernel security team does not do any sort of announcements at all, or any public statements anywhere. They are also not responsible for assigning CVE ids to any kernel bugfixes, that is a different team’s responsibility that happens after kernel bugfixes are in public kernel releases, and almost never before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because they do not do any announcements, there is also no “early announcement” list, despite many companies constantly asking to “join the security pre-announcement security list” requests we get.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The primary reason there is no pre-announcement list is overall they should always be considered public and contain leaks. Otherwise, why would your government allow them to exist? Unless the list is for a project that is not really used by anyone…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I once wrote about how profiler output can be misleading. Someone commented that you donât need profilers - just Ctrl-C your program in a debugger instead, and youâll see the call stack where your program probably spends most of its time. I admit that I sneered at the idea at the time, because, despite those commentsâ almost aggressive enthusiasm, this method doesnât actually work on the hard problems. But as my outlook on life worsened with age, I came to think that Ctrl-C profiling deserves a shout-out, because itâs very effective against stupid problems encountered by lazy people operating in unfriendly environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mean, Iâve tended to dismiss the stupid problems and focus on the hard ones, but is this a good approach in the real world? Today Iâm quite ready to accept that most of life is stupid problems encountered by lazy people operating in unfriendly environments. Certainly, one learning experience was becoming such a person myself, by stepping into a senior management role1 and then going back to programming after a few years. Now Iâm lazy because I got used to not doing anything myself, and Iâm in an environment which is unfriendly to me, because I forgot how things work, or they no longer work the way they used to. And while Iâm a bit ashamed to admit this as someone whoâs developed several profilers himself, Iâm often not really in the mood to figure out how to use a profiler in a given setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, hereâs a program taking a minute to start up. Well, only in the debug build; this must be why nobody fixed it, but we really should, it sucks to wait for a full minute every time you rebuild &amp;amp; rerun. So I Ctrl-C the thing, and what do you know, thereâs one billion stack frames from the nlohmann JSON parser, I guess it all gets inlined in the release build; must be what they call âzero-cost abstractionâ2. Another Ctrl-C, another call stack, coming from a different place but again ending up parsing JSON. And I donât know what the fix was - a different JSON parser, or compiling some code with optimizations even in the debug build - but someone fixed it after my Ctrl-C-based report.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or letâs say Iâm trying to switch to the LLD linker from gold, to speed up the linking. Why not the even faster mold? - because Iâm on MIPS, and mold doesnât support MIPS. But LLD is pretty fast, too; the core was written by the same person, after all. And then I open a core dump from a binary linked with LLD, and gdb is really slow. Hmm. It should have been faster, actually, because Iâve also added &lt;code&gt;--gdb-index&lt;/code&gt;, which tells the linker to create, I guess, some index for gdb, making gdb faster than its
slow default behavior, which is reserved for the unfortunate people who donât know the cool flags. But Iâm not seeing faster,
Iâm seeing slower. What gives?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, I run gdb under gdb, and Ctrl-C it while itâs struggling with the core dump. Thereâs some callstack with &lt;code&gt;dwarf_decode_macro_bytes&lt;/code&gt;. Google quickly brings up some relevant issues, such as âUsing -ggdb3 and linking with ld.lld leads to cpu/memory hog in
gdbâ (Status: UNCONFIRMED) and âlld doesn't generate
DW_MACRO_import like ld.bfd doesâ (Status: RESOLVED WONTFIX.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apparently gcc generates some DWARF data that gdb is slow to handle. The GNU linker fixes this data, so that gdb doesnât end up handling it slowly. LLD refuses to emulate this behavior of the GNU linker, because itâs gccâs fault to have produced that DWARF data in the first place. And gdb refuses to handle LLDâs output efficiently, because itâs LLDâs fault to not have handled gccâs output the way the GNU linker does. So I just remove &lt;code&gt;-ggdb3&lt;/code&gt; - it gives you a bit richer debug info, but itâs
not worth the slower linking with gold instead of LLD, nor the slowdown in gdb that you get with LLD. And everyone links happily
ever after.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which goes to show that Ctrl-C profiling is often enough to solve a simple problem, and itâs usually much easier than learning how to use a profiler and how to properly read its output. You can connect a debugger to almost anything, all the way down to some chip with nothing like a standard OS that could work with a standard profiler. You can connect a debugger to almost anything especially if itâs slow - for example, maybe itâs hard to actually invoke the program under gdb because its invocation is buried somewhere very deep, but if itâs slow, you can &lt;code&gt;gdb /proc/$pid/exe $pid&lt;/code&gt; after it was
started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A debugger also needs less to work with than a profiler. Unlike perf, gdb will give you a callstack even if the program was compiled without frame pointer support. And you certainly donât need a special build, like gprofâs &lt;code&gt;-pg&lt;/code&gt;, or to run on a slow
simulator, like callgrind / KCachegrind. And then the output of a profiler might be easy to
misinterpret - and Iâve only scratched the surface the last time I wrote about it.
Eyeballing a few callstacks is more straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why then do we need profilers at all? Here is a very partial list of reasons, in no particular order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Letâs say, completely hypothetically, that youâve switched to the LLD linker, and your program is now 2-3% slower. If you Ctrl-C it, youâll see the same callstacks as with the version linked with gold. But if you have a profiler running on a simulator, similarly to callgrind, then you can find the functions with the most slowdown - and they might not be the ones taking the most time overall, they just have the most slowdown relatively to the old version - and then you can look at the assembly listings and see how much time was spent running each instruction. And then youâll see that the new version has branch-to-address-from-register instructions where the old version had branch-to-constant-offset instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then you will learn about MIPS ârelocation relaxationâ (used also in RISC-V AFAIK.) The compiler âassumes the worstâ and generates code loading a function address into a register, and then jumping to the address stored in that register. Then, if youâre lucky, the linker realizes that it has actually placed the function close enough to the caller for that caller to branch to the function using a constant offset. (Fixed-sized RISC branch instructions cannot encode constant offsets larger than a certain value, so the function needs to be close enough to the caller for the distance to fit into the offset encoding.) And then the linker ârelaxesâ the expensive branch-from-register instruction into a cheaper branch-to-constant-offset instruction. And it turns out that the LLD version youâre using doesnât implement relocation relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course you, or should I say me, wouldnât need that very, very fancy simulator-based profiler if you werenât the idiot using LLD 9 when LLD 14 was already available, with relocation relaxation implemented back in LLD 10. (I wish Iâd saved the discussion in the mailing list around this patch; now I canât find it anywhere. There was nobody confident enough in their MIPS knowledge to review the patch, but you donât merge patches without a review, do you? There was even a message saying âHappy anniversary to the relocation relaxation patch!â a year after it was submitted without having been merged. Eventually someone said something like âwe have to either merge or reject it, or weâre being rudeâ and someone else said âwell, the patch author knows MIPS better than any of us, so letâs just merge it.â)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, despite having been an idiot here, I maintain that you donât have to be an idiot to have this sort of problem, which a profiler will help solve, and Ctrl-C profiling will not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The broader issue is that Ctrl-C is essentially a sampling profiler - one with an unusually low sampling frequency, but a sampling profiler nonetheless. Very small changes spread across a program are obviously invisible to a sampling profiler. Also, sampling profilers are bad at tail latency - if something is usually fast but occasionally slow, you wonât be there to Ctrl-C it when itâs slow. (Of course, if âslowâ means 100 ms instead of the usual 25 ms, you wouldnât manage to Ctrl-C it in time even if you were there - that low sampling frequency comes with some downsides.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Systems involving many threads, processes or machinesâ¦ our esteemed ârandom pausingâ technique, aka Ctrl-C profiling, is often not great to use with these. And at this point I feel that the idea of replacing all of the various profilers with Ctrl-C is too ridiculous to bother with more counterarguments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, there are many various kinds of profilers, making it a question which kind to use, and how much legwork finding the problem will take on top of using it. Simulation-based profilers donât have the problem of losing data to a low sampling frequency - they analyze full instruction traces - but theyâre too slow for anything like a production environment. So you might need some measurements that you can run in production, and then a way to rerun the program on the simulator using inputs that were observed to cause a slowdown in production based on these measurements. Tracing profilers like ftrace / KernelShark are great for looking at examples of tail latency, but they will not reliably take you to the places in the code where the time is spent. Sampling profilers can run in production and take you to the right place in the code, but theyâre a poor match for code that runs slowly but only occasionally, and even worse for code that occasionally gets stuck waiting for something. And most of these tools have a bunch of non-trivial prerequisites, config knobs and likely ways to misread their output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conversely, Ctrl-C in a debugger is easy, makes you look very effective when it actually works, and costs almost nothing to try even when it doesnât really help in the end. Whatâs not to like?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I often find myself recommending something primitive or ugly, which might actually do better than the âproperâ approach, or it might have less risky failure modes in the hands of typical users, or it might be easier to tailor to your needs than a more elaborate solution. âProfile with Ctrl-Câ fits right in - certainly very primitive, yet often compares surprisingly favorably with more sophisticated alternatives. And therefore, I must give Ctrl-C profiling my warmest endorsement!&lt;/p&gt;

We propose Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a general inference strategy that treats long prompts as part of an external environment and allows the LLM to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt. We find that RLMs successfully handle inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows and, even for shorter prompts, dramatically outperform the quality of base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse long-context tasks, while having comparable (or cheaper) cost per query.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Corviont runs MapLibre UI, vector tiles, Valhalla routing, and SQLite geocoding entirely offline on edge or on-prem devices - with a local map updater shipping next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Monaco demo is the full Corviont stack in miniature: a MapLibre UI talking to local APIs for tiles, routing, and geocoding - all running in Docker on your machine or edge device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monaco packaged as a single PMTiles file, served locally with no external tile servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Valhalla container exposing an HTTP API for offline routing between arbitrary points.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLite database built from Nominatim data, powering forward and reverse geocoding via a lightweight API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MapLibre frontend wired to these local endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Corviont is built for devices that can’t rely on a fast, cheap, always-on connection.&lt;lb/&gt;🏭 Edge &amp;amp; industrial devices&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run on industrial PCs, gateways, or embedded boxes so maps and routing keep working even when the WAN link is slow or down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;🚢 Remote and offshore deployments&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Install on vessels and remote sites with intermittent or satellite-only connectivity so tiles, routing, and search stay instant and local.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;🚚 Field fleets &amp;amp; mobile units&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use in vehicles and temporary field setups where devices go offline or change networks, without breaking your app’s map &amp;amp; routing UX.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;️🛡️ Privacy and compliance-sensitive environments&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep location queries and routes inside your own network; all map, routing, and geocoding requests terminate on your devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Monaco demo is the first step. It’s the same architecture we’ll use for larger regions and real fleets - here’s what’s on the way:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;🧩 Local map updater&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A small background service that pulls new map bundles, verifies them, and switches the active dataset without downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;🗂 Custom overlays&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Load your own POIs, geofences, or operational layers (GeoJSON) on top of the base map, rendered directly in the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;📍 Richer geocoding output&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better address results with house numbers, and optional geometry for streets and areas (not just centrepoints) in forward and reverse search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;🧱 More edge platforms &amp;amp; targets&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First-class integrations for Portainer and Mender, plus deployment examples for K3s/Kubernetes and edge runtimes on AWS and Azure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If any of these are critical for you, or if something important to your use case isn’t listed here, tell us in the form below. Your input directly influences what we build first.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;With 2025 wrapped up, I can finally answer a question I’m curious about every year: who were the most popular bloggers of Hacker News?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who counts as a blogger?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I explain more in my methodology page, but it’s basically anyone who blogs as an individual rather than as part of a company or a team. For example, John Graham-Cumming blogged while he was the CTO of Cloudflare, so I count his personal blog but not his posts to the Cloudflare company blog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#1 Simon Willison🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the third straight year, Simon Willison was the most popular blogger on Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first, Simon’s position at #1 feels obvious: he wrote about AI in a year when everyone’s obsessed with AI. But there are tons of AI bloggers, and Simon is the only one who’s popular on HN, so what sets Simon apart?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, Simon isn’t selling you anything. Simon writes about LLMs as a power user not as a sales pitch from some startup’s VP of product. He tries every AI tool he can get his hands on with no allegiance to any particular vendor. That allows him to write about how new AI tools fit into the ecosystem at large. It’s like getting restaurant recommendations from someone who eats out 20 times a week as opposed to someone who owns 20 restaurant chains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simon is also one of the most prolific bloggers on Hacker News. In 2025 alone, he wrote over 1,000 blog posts, though only 118 were full-length articles (“only”).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simon often finds ideas within walled-garden platforms (e.g., TikTok, Twitter) and simply brings them to the open web, where it’s easier for HN to discuss. Some of his most popular posts were just short quotes or links with a bit of commentary. “I’m worried that they put co-pilot in Excel” is just a quote from a video he watched on TikTok. “A computer can never be held accountable” is Simon summarizing a few tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simon has said these types of posts are easy to write yet high in value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sharing interesting links with commentary is a low effort, high value way to contribute to internet life at large.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;—Simon Willison, “My approach to running a link blog”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#2 Jeff Geerling🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is Jeff’s most successful year on Hacker News, beating his #5 finish in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The #2 spot was an extremely tight race this year. Jeff’s posts totaled 10,813 upvotes, edging out the #3 blogger by just 9 points (a 0.08% difference). The #4 finisher was just 100 points behind that. Past stories can still accrue upvotes, so this could still flip, but these were the rankings as of midnight on Dec. 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff is a popular YouTube creator with over 1M subscribers. He covers some of HN’s favorite topics, like Raspberry Pi computers, self-hosted software, and computer hardware. YouTube videos rarely succeed on Hacker News, so when Jeff publishes a new video, he often publishes an accompanying blog post. Jeff isn’t the only YouTuber who does this, but he’s one of the few who does it well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve seen other YouTube creators try to repurpose their videos by auto-generating a transcript and calling that a blog post. Jeff approaches his blog more thoughtfully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff started out as a blogger, and he still treats his blog readers as first-class citizens. He structures his articles to fit the text medium rather than just lazily scraping dialog from his videos. You can read his post about upgrading storage on his Mac mini and not even realize it’s adapted from a video.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#3 Sean Goedecke🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sean came out of nowhere as a blogging powerhouse this year. He’d been blogging sporadically since 2020, but he hit a turning point at the end of 2024 with “How I ship projects at big tech companies.” It was one of HN’s top 100 posts of the year and remains Sean’s most popular post on HN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After his first success on HN, Sean went from publishing every few months to multiple times per week, becoming a regular fixture on the front page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sean is a Staff Software Engineer at GitHub and previously worked at Zendesk. Like Simon, Sean is extremely prolific. He wrote 140 posts this year. Of those, 47 reached the front page. I’ve had a few years where a lot of my posts reached the front page, but for me that was about 10 articles. I can’t imagine what it’s like to have a new article on HN almost every week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sean explains his strategy in “Writing a tech blog people want to read”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;the recipe for a popular post is to have a clear opinion about working in tech that many people disagree with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think Sean’s insight is true, but he’s selling his own writing a bit short. To me, Sean’s greatest strength is his ability to explain big tech organizational politics to engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most junior to mid-level developers don’t care about company politics. They think of office politics as something that strong technical thinkers shouldn’t have to waste brain cells on. As a result, they can’t understand why they can’t get promoted or how their company’s codebase got so bad. Sean’s posts explain these phenomena in a way that’s clear and intelligible to engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sean’s posts are also a good example of how much luck comes into play on Hacker News, especially for less established authors. Sean’s top three posts of the year all flopped on their first submission and didn’t succeed until their second or third try, sometimes months later. Even then, only a third of his posts reached the front page at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#4 Brian Krebs🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brian Krebs is an independent investigative journalist who covers cybercrime. He’s one of HN’s most popular bloggers of all time, second only to Paul Graham, the creator of HN. For 11 of the last 12 years, Brian has been one of HN’s top 10 bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2025, Brian mostly stuck to his usual beat of deeply investigated cybersecurity stories, but his second most popular story of the year was a sobering post about the Trump administration’s steps to undermine free speech in the US. It immediately shot to the #1 slot and stayed there for several hours. Unfortunately, too many users flagged the post, and it was moderated off the front page, which is often the fate of political stories on HN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#5 Neal Agarwal🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neal’s work isn’t what you might think of as blog posts; they’re more like interactive art. Some of his posts are games that parody the web, while others are straight-faced visual essays about topics he finds interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was Neal’s most successful year on HN. Everything he published reached the front page, with about half hitting #1, and the rest peaking at #2. Stimulation Clicker was the 4th most popular post of the entire year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other notes🔗&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;John Gruber finished the year in #6 despite wondering aloud back in March whether Hacker News had shadowbanned his blog. It was his best year on Hacker News since 2011 and his first appearance in the top 10 since 2020.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mahad Kalam finished at #21 for the year with a single blog post, which became the top post of the year. Byran Huang appeared right behind him, also with a single blog post, which became the #3 most upvoted post of the year.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

                  }&lt;lb/&gt; 
                &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
                   module hello_world;&lt;lb/&gt; import std::io;&lt;lb/&gt; &lt;lb/&gt; fn void main() &lt;lb/&gt;{&lt;lb/&gt;  io::printn("Hello, world!");  &lt;lb/&gt;
                  }&lt;lb/&gt; 
                &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C3 fits right into your C/C++ application with full C ABI compatibility out of the box: no need for special "C compatible" types or functions, no limitations on what C3 features you can use from C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple and straightforward module system that doesn't get in the way, with defaults that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C3 empowers you with precise, purpose-built operator overloading — no C++ baggage, just clean, expressive code. Ideal for vectors, matrices, and fixed-point math that reads exactly how it should.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; C3 is a programming language that builds on the syntax and semantics of the C language, with the goal of evolving it while still retaining familiarity for C programmers.&lt;lb/&gt; Thanks to full ABI compatibility with C, it's possible to mix C and C3 in the same project with no effort. As a demonstration, vkQuake was compiled with a small portion of the code converted to C3 and compiled with the c3c compiler. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlock the full power of compile-time code with macros that read like functions — clearer, stronger, and miles beyond C’s preprocessor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C3 brings programming-by-contract to the mainstream with unobtrusive contracts that are used to express both runtime and compile-time constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Error handling that combines the best parts of "Result" errors with the easy use of exceptions and integrates seamlessly with C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C3 generic modules offer superior simplicity and clarity for creating generic types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Type introspection is available both at compile time and runtime, powering flexible macros and functions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Write asm as regular inline code without using strings or cryptic constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Feel confident in your code's correctness: in debug mode the compiler inserts extensive runtime bounds checks and value checks, which together with contracts will let you catch bugs early.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No more anonymous "segmentation fault" errors: the C3 standard library enables detailed stacktraces out of the box for your debug builds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Xr0 is a verifier for C. It eliminates many stubborn instances of undefined behaviour, like use-after-frees, double frees, null pointer dereferences and the use of uninitialised memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Xr0 uses C-like annotations to verify code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void *
alloc() ~ [ return malloc(1); ] /* caller must free */
{
        return malloc(1);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re attached to every function that is potentially unsafe and express what its callers need to know to use it safely:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void *
alloc_if(int x) ~ [ if (x) return malloc(1); ] /* caller must free if x != 0 */
{
        if (x) {
                return malloc(1);
        } else {
                return NULL;
        }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The really subtle safety bugs creep in through layers of function calls. Xr0 makes this impossible, because everything needed to secure safety is distributed through every function call, so that no subtle mistake can creep in. It “quantum entangles” the safety semantics of every part of the program with every other part. Think of it like a infinitely rich type system that rises to the demands of your program’s structure. You still have to make the code safe; Xr0 just checks your work. Thus Xr0 is magical like the wand, not the magician. The real magic comes from the programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Xr0 is a work in progress and currently verifies a subset of C89. Its most significant limitation is we haven’t yet implemented verification for loops and recursive functions, so these are being bridged by axiomatic annotations. Xr0 1.0.0 will enable programming in C with no undefined behaviour, but for now it’s useful for verifying sections of programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Xr0 is written in pure C and is open source. View it on GitHub or SourceHut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best way to understand Xr0 is to try it. If you want to see how Xr0 works, be sure to use the debugger, which you can learn about here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read the tutorial to learn more, and then if you want to go deeper, engage with our theses, which explain how Xr0 will make C safe, and take a look at our vision and roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today we have a fun one. A few months ago, I was at Xsight Labs in California and saw the company’s E1 DPU PCIe card. A few weeks after that, a 1U chassis arrived. We wanted to start our series with a quick look at the really neat DPU, as this is far different from the DPUs we covered a few years ago. If you have not heard of Xsight Labs, we first covered them in 2020, and their X2 switch chip just had a major milestone win, Powering SpaceX Starlink V3 networking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to see a few more angles, we have a short.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Xsight Labs E1 DPU Overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Xsight Labs is building is not a NIC, or a NIC with a few compute cores attached. Instead, it is more of a miniature server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Xsight Labs E1 1U platform is much larger than the PCIe card, but that is really the point. The platform we are using is designed to not just be a network offload in a server. Instead, it is designed to be more flexible so that you can build more around the architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting with the E1 DPU, this is a 64-core Arm Neoverse N2 part built in TSMC 5nm, and you can stick four DDR5-5200 ECC RDIMMs alongside it in the 1RU server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just to give you some sense, here is the block diagram for the part:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other than the DDR5 memory that we showed, there is a lot more going on. Our unit is still more of a development platform, which you can see from the USB headers. Still there is something neat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Onboard, there are two 400G MACs for a total of 800Gbps of networking. This platform is different because Xsight Labs has validated it with the SONiC-DASH Hero 800G test. That may not sound exciting, but SONiC is the open-source NOS right now running in many organizations. The Hero 800G test is one to validate that the NIC can keep 800Gbps of traffic moving with 120 million connections and 12 million connections per second with zero dropped packets. I think they actually used Keysight CyPerf to test this (I need to double check) which is what you are seeing on STH on everything from the NVIDIA ConnectX-8 C8240 800G Dual 400G NIC Review to lower-end 10G gateway devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just as a fun one, here are the heatsinks for the two QSFP112 400Gbps ports:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company says that it passed the SONiC-DASH 800G Hero test with 19% headroom, and further room for optimization. That is important for a few reasons. First, the E1 does not have a NIC IP attached to it along with its compute cores. It is actually using the Arm Neoverse N2 cores to do the networking thanks to features like DPDK. That is very different from many other DPUs on the market that we discussed a few months ago in the Substack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, the extra headroom means that CPU cycles are free to do other tasks. That is where the next set of features comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you look around the chassis, you will see a number of PCIe slots that expose PCIe from the DPU that you can see in the block diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those include dual slot PCIe Gen5 x16 slots at the front.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike the NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPU where there are explicit versions for both the NIC version and the one that acts as a PCIe root as a “Self-Hosted” DPU, the Xsight Labs E1 can do both. Indeed, it can have x16 or x4/x4/x4/x4 bifurcation of its slots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the ability to push traffic through two 400Gbps ports (800Gbps), and 32 PCIe Gen5 lanes (roughly 800Gbps) the idea is that those free CPU cycles can do other work. For example, we showed off the Xsight Labs E1 800G 64-Core Arm DPU Shown for Hammerspace AI Storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you look at the chassis above, it houses five sleds in a 1OU (that is O for Open, not 0) server. As a result, we get 320 Arm Neoverse N2 cores, and 40 SSDs. Since each sled has eight SSDs, which are roughly 800Gbps of storage, and then 800Gbps of networking, it is almost like putting forty PCIe Gen5 SSDs directly on the network, running the storage stack on the DPU between the SSDs and the network ports. While that is an example with SSDs, one could easily see PCIe GPUs or other accelerators also being attached to the E1 in those card slots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final Words&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another neat point about this DPU, aside from the architecture, is that it is early. NVIDIA BlueField-4 will utilize 64 Arm cores and 800G networking as well, but we had the E1 DPU in our studio before the formal GA launch of the BlueField-4, which is expected in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you may have surmised, this is really kicking off a series using the DPU. In the next piece, we are going to do something simple, yet profound. If you saw this week’s Lenovo ThinkCentre neo 50q Tiny QC Review, that consumer Arm system could not install Ubuntu Linux from an ISO, which is very different from the experience we had with the ASRock Rack AMPONED8-2T/BCM with Ampere AmpereOne A192-32X Arm CPU. The next piece in this series is just getting the OS running on this from an ISO, and it is an important server milestone, yet one that other DPUs do not do. For example, our Intel E2100 DPU does not support this and is therefore very difficult to get running outside of narrow use cases. This E1 is an exciting platform, so we have a lot to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
