  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Agency for Cultural Affairs submitted a recommendation to education minister Toshiko Abe on Wednesday to replace the government’s romanization system for the Japanese language, the first such overhaul in 70 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agency is recommending replacing the government’s long-standing Kunrei system with more widely used Hepburn-style spellings. The changes are expected to be approved within the current fiscal year and gradually rolled out in textbooks and other materials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under the Kunrei system, codified by Cabinet notification in 1954, phonemes for ち and ふ are written as ti and hu. Most Japanese schools still teach the style in romanization studies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the Hepburn system, which renders them as chi and fu, has become dominant both in Japan and abroad, making the impact of the change likely most evident in educational materials such as school textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The council’s recommendation also adopts Hepburn spellings for し, じ and つ as shi, ji, and tsu, compared to the Kunrei spellings of si, zi and tu. It specifies that double consonants, as in てっぱん, should be written by repeating the consonant, while long vowels such as in かあさん can be indicated with either a macron (kāsan) or doubled letters (kaasan).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personal and organizational names will be left to the preference of individuals and entities concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The government began reviewing official romanization rules in 2022, with then-education minister Masahito Moriyama formally requesting a reassessment last year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sega broke ground in the late 90s with one of the first digital game distribution systems for consoles. Sega Channel offered access to a rotating library of Sega Genesis titles, along with game tips, demos, and even a few exclusive games that never came out in the United States in any other format. In an era of dial-up internet, Sega Channel delivered game data over television cable — a novel approach that gave the service its name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the years since, Sega Channel has been shrouded in a bit of mystery. The service was discontinued in 1998, and the lack of retrievable game data and documentation around Sega Channel has led to decades of speculation about it. We’ve mostly been left with magazine articles and second-hand accounts. Once in a while, one or two Sega Channel ROMs will show up online. How do you preserve a service like Sega Channel?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the last two years, we’ve been working on a large-scale project to preserve the history of Sega Channel. Today, we unveiled our findings in a new YouTube video.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll cut to the chase: In collaboration with multiple parties, we have recovered over 100 new Sega Channel ROMs, including system data, exclusive games, and even prototypes that were never published. We’ve also digitized internal paperwork and correspondence that reveals how Sega Channel operated, how it was marketed, and what would’ve come next for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project kicked off in 2024, when we met former Sega Channel vice president of programming Michael Shorrock at the Game Developers Expo. Our booth that year highlighted interesting games from outside the traditional game industry, including Where in North Dakota is Carmen Sandiego?, which our director Frank Cifaldi recovered back in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By complete coincidence, one of the items we put out was a promotional brochure for Broderbund Software… featuring Michael Shorrock on the cover! We got talking with Michael about our work, and we realized we both wanted to preserve and celebrate the history of Sega Channel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time this was happening, we were contacted by a community member named Ray (going by the pseudonym Sega Channel Guy). He had been contacting former Sega Channel staff to see if they still had any old swag or had saved things from the company. In the process, he came into possession of a collection of tape backups containing an unquantifiable amount of internal data from Sega Channel… including a significant number of game and system ROMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We realized we could put these two threads together! With Michael’s own collection and Ray’s data backups, we could tell a cohesive, wide-ranging story about what Sega Channel was and that was actually distributed through this service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two end products from this process. The first is the Michael Shorrock collection, a new collection in our digital library. You can view the correspondence, notes, and presentations from Michael Shorrock’s personal collection, which shed light on the formation of Sega Channel and their audience. From these papers, you can also learn about Express Games: an unannounced successor that would have brought Sega’s cable data delivery service to computers and replaced Sega Channel entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other output here is the collection of Sega Channel ROM data. We’ve donated the data from the 144* new ROMs we recovered to the team at Gaming Alexandria, which will be sharing access to the files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Our video states that we recovered 142 unique ROMs. However, after uploading the video, we realized we miscounted! There are two additional Sega Channel variant ROM in this collection. The actual total is 144. This does not include the two outliers mentioned in the video, which were previously recovered by users on Sonic Retro in November 2024 but went mostly unreported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This collection includes nearly 100 unique system ROMs, covering almost every version of the system that was distributed to consumers from 1994 to mid-1997. This batch also includes system ROM prototypes and some truly unusual experiments, like a Sega Genesis web browser that would’ve delivered compressed, static websites over television cable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of great interest to fans, this collection of ROMs also has dozens of previously undumped game variants and Sega Channel exclusives. This includes Garfield: Caught in the Act – The Lost Levels and The Flintstones, two games that were previously believed to be permanently lost and unrecoverable. These are both interesting from a development standpoint; both games appear to have their roots as abandoned projects that were repurposed as Sega Channel-exclusive content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also included are the previously unpreserved limited editions of Sega Genesis games. These versions have been cut down to fit within Sega Channel’s filesize limit, sometimes omitting content or splitting the game into multiple parts. We’re not sure anyone is especially eager to play a version of Super Street Fighter II missing half the characters, but we’re glad to have it documented.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a few exceptions, this recovery project has accounted for almost all outstanding Sega Channel games. We believe this also means there are now digital backup copies of every unique Sega Genesis game released in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has been a years-long project that wouldn’t have been possible without support from the broader gaming community. Besides Michael Shorrock and Ray, we want to give special thanks to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sega Retro, The Cutting Room Floor, and Hidden Palace for documenting everything we’ve known about Sega Channel up to this point.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RisingFromRuins and Nathan Misner (infochunk) for putting all the pieces together to crack the Sega Channel data formats.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dustin Hubbard (Hubz) from Gaming Alexandria for working with us to share this ROM data.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rob Curl from the Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment, who flagged us down at GDC to let us know that Michael Shorrock had seen a picture of himself at our booth and brought him over to say hello.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also want to give a special thanks to Chuck Guzis, a long-time expert on data tapes, who digitized Ray’s Sega Channel backups for us in 2024. Chuck’s business Sydex was, for a long time, the go-to vendor for working with data tapes, and we’ve used his services in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shortly before launching this project, we learned that Chuck passed away over the summer. His death leaves a hole in our community and our collective expertise. We know that the gaming community (and specifically the Sega community) will be excited by all this new documentation and data; we hope that their excitement is a testament to what Chuck’s work meant to the digital preservation community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Complete list of recovered titles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a list of all Sega Channel-specific game data recovered from this project and shared with Gaming Alexandria. This does not include the 97 unique pieces of menu data ROMs and system software that were also recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;WildSnake&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wrath of the Demon&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Yogi Bear [Yogi Bear’s Cartoon Capers]&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data differences:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Body Count (US revision)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maui Mallard in Cold Shadow&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Primal Rage&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pulseman&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Richard Scarry’s Busytown*&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shining Force II&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Super Hang-On&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wacky Worlds Creativity Studio&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;X-Men 2: Clone Wars&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* These games were previously found on a CD obtained by a user on the Sonic Retro forums in November 2024. However, these ROMs were overshadowed by the recovery of the Sega Channel exclusive games The Chessmaster and Klondike from the same CD. Although our copies of these ROMs are not unique, we included them on this list to make sure their existence doesn’t get lost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A footnote for hardcore Sega fans&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe this recovery project accounts for all unique Sega Channel exclusive games. But the most hardcore fans might be wondering: What about Ozone Kid? In a feature article on Sega Channel from the June 1995 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly (p.29), Ozone Kid was identified as the first Sega Channel exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can confirm that this game was never actually distributed through Sega Channel. According to data recovered by Ray, The Environmental Detective (as it was titled prior to cancellation) was slated for release alongside the Sega Channel test markets, but it was pulled from their programming plans in July 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading the between the lines in Sega Channel’s internal project tracking, the game appears to have suffered from a variety of problems over several months. When the game was finally shelved, Sega issued a “partial test report based on items found at the time code was pulled,” suggesting there were still major issues when it was removed from their plans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever you compile using Rust, the compiler goes through different passes and in the end, generated binary code for the target processor. By default, it uses LLVM as backend to generate the binary code, but more backends exist like cranelift and GCC. This post is about how it's possible for one compiler to use different backend to generate binaries, in particular GCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before going into details, we need to describe how compilers actually work. They read source code and convert it internally into a format they can manipulate, commonly called Abstract Syntax Tree (shortened "AST").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, compilers go through multiple passes, and often each pass has their own AST. Let's take a short and very incomplete example with the Rust compiler passes. We have 4 steps (again, this is simplified!):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each step generates a new AST with new information if no error was encountered and provides it to the next pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little side-note: If enough people are interested by this topic, I can write a (much) longer explanation of these passes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now that we have a high-level idea of Rust compiler passes, what is the difference between "front-end" and "back-end" exactly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We consider the front-end to be the part handling (high-level non-exhaustive list) code parsing, linting, type-checking and borrow-checking (steps 1 to 3). When all this is done, it means the code is valid and needs to be translated to the target processor instructions set. To do so, we call LLVM/GCC which will translate the Rust compiler AST into assembly code (step 4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rust compiler backends are the bridge between the Rust compiler AST and the actual code generator. They receive the AST and call the LLVM/GCC/... API which will in turn run their passes, optimize and finally generate the assembly code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLVM being much more recent than GCC (2003 vs 1987), a lot of older processors are not supported and will never be. So if you want to write a Rust program on an old platform like Dreamcast, you have no choice to either write your own backend or use the GCC backend (or the &lt;code&gt;gccrs&lt;/code&gt; front-end once ready).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the readers interested in doing so, there is a guide explaining how to build Rust programs for Dreamcast here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GCC backend is different than gccrs which is a front-end for GCC written in C++, which doesn't reuse the front-end of &lt;code&gt;rustc&lt;/code&gt;, meaning they need to reimplement parsing, type-checking, linting, borrow-checking, compilation errors, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the GCC backend (the crate name is &lt;code&gt;rustc_codegen_gcc&lt;/code&gt;) is just "yet another backend codegen" of the Rust compiler, like LLVM or Cranelift, only meant to generate the binary from the Rust compiler input. It's a bridge between Rust compiler's AST and the codegen API.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that note: GCC doesn't provide a nice library to give access to its internals (unlike LLVM). So we have to use &lt;code&gt;libgccjit&lt;/code&gt; which, unlike the "jit" ("just in time", meaning compiling sub-parts of the code on the fly, only when needed for performance reasons and often used in script languages like Javascript) part in its name implies, can be used as "aot" ("ahead of time", meaning you compile everything at once, allowing you to spend more time on optimization). To do so we use bindings, which are split in two parts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;gccjit-sys&lt;/code&gt; which redeclares the C items we need.&lt;code&gt;gccjit&lt;/code&gt; which provides a nice API over &lt;code&gt;gccjit-sys&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;p&gt;If you want to write your own compiler and use GCC as codegen, you can do it thanks to &lt;code&gt;libgccjit&lt;/code&gt;. And if you write it in Rust, you can even use the Rust bindings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rustc has a crate named &lt;code&gt;rustc_codegen_ssa&lt;/code&gt; which provides an abstract interface that a backend needs to implement through traits like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full list is available here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One last thing you need to write in your backend:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Run #[no_mangle]
pub fn _rustc_codegen_backend() -&amp;gt; Box&amp;lt;dyn CodegenBackend&amp;gt; {
    // This is the entrypoint.
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the function that will be called by rustc to run your backend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's take an example: how the GCC backend creates a constant string. I picked this one because it's small enough to showcase how things work while not being too much information to digest at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the ConstCodegenMethods trait, there is a const_str method. This is the method we will implement to declare a constant string.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the method implementation so far looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Run impl&amp;lt;'gcc, 'tcx&amp;gt; ConstCodegenMethods for CodegenCx&amp;lt;'gcc, 'tcx&amp;gt; {
    /// Returns the pointer to the string and its length.
    fn const_str(&amp;amp;self, s: &amp;amp;str) -&amp;gt; (RValue&amp;lt;'gcc&amp;gt;, RValue&amp;lt;'gcc&amp;gt;) {
        // Call GCC API to declare this string.
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to pause here to give some extra explanations: &lt;code&gt;CodegenCx&lt;/code&gt; is the type on which most &lt;code&gt;rustc_codegen_ssa&lt;/code&gt; traits will be implemented. It is created in each ExtraBackendMethods::compile_codegen_unit call and passed down from there to generate the code for this module. You can consider it the same as a cache. It keeps the list of items declared, like functions, types, globals, etc. But also information such as "boolean type", "i8 type" and equivalents so we don't need to recompute them every time we need them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok so now let's actually implement it. We have a few things to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;*const u8&lt;/code&gt;) into the C type (&lt;code&gt;*const char&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;p&gt;Let's translate it into code with a lot of comments to help understanding what's going on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Run fn const_str(&amp;amp;self, s: &amp;amp;str) -&amp;gt; (RValue&amp;lt;'gcc&amp;gt;, RValue&amp;lt;'gcc&amp;gt;) {
    // We get the const string cache.
    let mut const_str_cache = self.const_str_cache.borrow_mut();
    // We get the address of the stored string and we add it to the cache and
    // return its address.
    let str_global = const_str_cache.get(s).copied().unwrap_or_else(|| {
        // We call the `GCC` API to create a new const string.
        let string = self.context.new_string_literal(s);
        // We name the const.
        let sym = self.generate_local_symbol_name("str");
        // We declare it.
        let global = self.declare_private_global(&amp;amp;sym, self.val_ty(string));
        // All done, we can add it to the cache and return it.
        const_str_cache.insert(s.to_owned(), global);
        global
    });
    let len = s.len();
    // We cast the pointer to the target architecture string pointer type.
    let cs = self.const_ptrcast(
        str_global.get_address(None),
        self.type_ptr_to(self.layout_of(self.tcx.types.str_).gcc_type(self)),
    );
    // And we return the pointer and its length.
    (cs, self.const_usize(len as _))
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the codegen backends can also add more information to the underlying binary code generator. For example, in Rust, we use references a lot. A reference is basically a pointer that cannot be &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;. We need to give this information as well!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both GCC and LLVM, you can add attributes to a lot of items, like arguments of functions. So every time we see an argument behind a reference, we add the &lt;code&gt;nonnnull()&lt;/code&gt; attribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's show an example with this Rust function:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Run fn t(a: &amp;amp;i32) -&amp;gt; i32 {
    *a
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C equivalent looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;int t(int *a) {
  if (!a) {
    return -1;
  }
  return *a;
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compiled with the &lt;code&gt;-O3&lt;/code&gt; option, it generates this assembly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;t:
        test    rdi, rdi              ; Check if `a` is 0
        je      .L5                   ; If `a` is 0, we jump to `.L1`
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR [rdi]  ; We store `*a` value into `eax` registry
        ret                           ; We exit the function
.L5:
        mov     eax, -1               ; We store `-1` into `eax` registry
        ret                           ; We exit&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Rust compiler knows that &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; can never be &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, so the codegen adds &lt;code&gt;_attribute_((nonnull(1)))&lt;/code&gt; on the function:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;_attribute_((nonnull(1)))
int t(int *a) {
  if (!a) {
    return -1;
  }
  return *a;
}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which generates this assembly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;t:
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR [rdi]
        ret&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the codegen knows that the &lt;code&gt;if (!a)&lt;/code&gt; condition will never be true, why keeping it around?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it's just one example of extra information/optimization we do in the Rust backends. And that doesn't even cover in the slighest the monstruous amount of optimizations the codegen themselves do. If you want to have more examples of such optimizations, I strongly recommend reading the "Advent of Compiler Optimizations" blog posts written by Matt Godbolt (the developer of godbolt.org, another priceless tool).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now you know what a Rust backend is, and why GCC backend is also an interesting thing to have while also learning about some optimizations we do behind developers back. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This blog post was made thanks to my cat hanging to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why blood flow is not a reliable indicator of the brain's energy requirements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;40 percent of MRI signals do not correspond to actual brain activity&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU) found that an increased fMRI signal is associated with reduced brain activity in around 40 percent of cases. At the same time, they observed decreased fMRI signals in regions with elevated activity. First author Dr. Samira Epp emphasizes: “This contradicts the long-standing assumption that increased brain activity is always accompanied by an increased blood flow to meet higher oxygen demand. Since tens of thousands of fMRI studies worldwide are based on this assumption, our results could lead to opposite interpretations in many of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Test tasks reveal deviations from the standard interpretation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PD Dr. Valentin Riedl, now Professor at FAU, and his colleague Epp examined more than 40 healthy participants during their time at TUM. Each was given several experimental tasks – such as mental arithmetic or autobiographical memory recall – which are known to produce predictable fMRI signal changes in distributed brain regions. During these experiments, the researchers simultaneously measured the actual oxygen consumption using a novel quantitative MRI technique.&lt;lb/&gt; Depending on the task and the brain region, the physiological results varied. Increased oxygen consumption – for instance in areas involved in calculation – did not coincide with the expected rise in blood flow. Instead, the quantitative analyses showed that these regions met their additional energy demand by extracting more oxygen from the unchanged blood supply. Thus, they used the oxygen available in the blood more efficiently without requiring greater perfusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Implications for interpreting brain disorders&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Riedl, these insights also affect the interpretation of research findings in brain disorders: “Many fMRI studies on psychiatric or neurological diseases – from depression to Alzheimer’s – interpret changes in blood flow as a reliable signal of neuronal under- or over-activation. Given the limited validity of such measurements, this must now be reassessed. Especially in patient groups with vascular changes – for instance due to aging or vascular disease – the measured values may primarily reflect vascular differences rather than neuronal deficits.” Previous animal studies already point in this direction.&lt;lb/&gt; The researchers therefore propose complementing the conventional MRI approach with quantitative measurements. In the long term, this combination could form the basis for energy-based brain models: rather than showing activation maps that depend on assumptions about blood flow, future analyses could display values indicating how much oxygen – and therefore energy – is actually consumed for information processing. This opens new perspectives for examining aging, psychiatric, or neurodegenerative diseases in terms of absolute changes in energy metabolism – and for understanding them more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mozilla’s next chapter: Building the world’s most trusted software company&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, I step into the role of CEO of Mozilla Corporation. It is a privilege to lead an organization with a long history of standing up for people and building technology that puts them first. The internet is changing fast, and so are the expectations people bring to the products they use every day. Mozilla has a critical role to play at this moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to thank Laura Chambers for her exceptional leadership. As interim CEO, Laura led Mozilla through a defining moment in the web’s history — navigating AI’s arrival, a major antitrust case, double-digit mobile growth in Firefox, and the early success of our revenue diversification strategy. She brought clarity, stability, and focus to the organization, and I’m grateful for her leadership through this transition and am glad she’ll continue to be part of Mozilla, returning to her role on the Mozilla board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I joined Mozilla, it was clear that trust was going to become the defining issue in technology and the browser would be where this battle would play out. AI was already reshaping how people search, shop, and make decisions in ways that were hard to see and even harder to understand. I saw how easily people could lose their footing in experiences that feel personal but operate in ways that are anything but clear. And I knew this would become a defining issue, especially in the browser, where so many decisions about privacy, data, and transparency now originate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People want software that is fast, modern, but also honest about what it does. They want to understand what’s happening and to have real choices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mozilla and Firefox can be that choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Few companies share our strengths. People trust our brand. Firefox brings us global reach. Our teams know how to build reliable, independent software at scale, and our business model puts the user first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Mozilla moves forward, we will focus on becoming the trusted software company. This is not a slogan. It is a direction that guides how we build and how we grow. It means three things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;First: Every product we build must give people agency in how it works. Privacy, data use, and AI must be clear and understandable. Controls must be simple. AI should always be a choice — something people can easily turn off. People should know why a feature works the way it does and what value they get from it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Second: our business model must align with trust. We will grow through transparent monetization that people recognize and value.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Third: Firefox will grow from a browser into a broader ecosystem of trusted software. Firefox will remain our anchor. It will evolve into a modern AI browser and support a portfolio of new and trusted software additions.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will measure our progress against a double bottom line. Our work must advance our mission and succeed in the market. In the next three years, that means investing in AI that reflects the Mozilla Manifesto. It means diversifying revenue beyond search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Success means Firefox grows across generations. Mozilla builds new revenue engines. Our principles become a differentiator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will move with urgency. AI is changing software. Browsers are becoming the control point for digital life. Regulation is shifting defaults. These shifts play to Mozilla’s strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we stay focused, Mozilla will grow in relevance and resilience. Firefox will reach new audiences. Our portfolio will strengthen our independence. Our approach to building trusted software will set a high standard for the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mozilla is ready for this moment. I am excited for the work ahead and grateful for the trust placed in me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Writing a blatant Telegram clone using Qt, QML and Rust. And C++.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This was a fun project for a couple of days, but I will probably shelve it for now so I can continue what I was already working on before. Read on to follow along with my journey.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Spoilers: I didn’t get very far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get ready for an Opinion Dump of an intro:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have fond memories from 10 years ago of using Qt, and especially QML. It’s just so easy to think of a design and make it happen with QML. I chose to use Svelte for building Web Apps™ while it was still very beta just because it was the closest experience to QML I came across.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust is pretty great. Also been a huge fan of that since like 2012 when I saw an example on the front page where the compiler validated pointer usage at compile time without adding any extra work at run time. Basically black magic after trying to fix the worst kind of bugs in C++.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I became a full time Full Stack Web Developer against all my intentions. I like making user interfaces and solving hard problems though, so it’s not so bad. I have been wanting to make a properly “native” application for a while though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder if anyone out there is a full time Full Stack Film Developer (that sounded funnier in my head).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like Telegram a lot, because I believe they have put the most love into their user interfaces out of all the chat programs I have seen. Also “Saved Messages” and being able to access all my messages from the last 10 years is pretty great. I also think Telegram is kinda lame in every other respect. I started trying out Element (a Matrix client) last week. The Android app is very decent these days, but the desktop app while clearly quite nice just doesn’t spark joy like Telegram’s desktop app. I played around with a bunch of other Matrix desktop clients just to see if the experience would be closer to Telegram, I could write a pros and cons list but that’s not why we’re here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “Element X” app (the X is for Xtreme, I guess) uses a Rust library called &lt;code&gt;matrix-rust-sdk&lt;/code&gt;, which apparently solves many of the problems you might face while making a Matrix client. That might be useful later on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, here’s a random project I started working on just because I felt like it would be fun to use QML again while trying to generally use Rust instead of C++.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goal: Create a Telegram clone, whatever you already read the title.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Day One, Hour Zero&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve wanted to try using QML as the UI for a Rust app for a while, so that’s the driving force here. I’ve looked at some stuff in the past, but first I want to properly learn about what’s available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;qmetaobject-rs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;cxx-qt&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Some other stuff that seems less good to build an app on top of, sorry everyone.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In hindsight I know I wanted:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;cargo run&lt;/code&gt;to be decently fast, both clean and incremental&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hot reloading&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ability to access all functionality of Qt if I wanted&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started with cxx-qt because it seemed like the most official way to do Qt development, and definitely lets you access all Qt functionality. I made a super bare bones “open a window” program which got me excited, and I committed it to a git repo and everything. I may have spent like 30 minutes at this point coming up with a name for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provoke&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t mind it. It’s in italics so it must be fancy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I then spent hours trying to find ways to make cxx-qt not do some really expensive code generation and recompilation step every time I saved, then found out that VS Code was running &lt;code&gt;cargo check&lt;/code&gt; one way while in the terminal &lt;code&gt;cargo check&lt;/code&gt; was doing some other thing, and effectively blowing the cache every time I switched from one to the other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway it all made me a bit sad and I just wanted to write some delicious QML for goodness sake, so I moved on to qmetaobject-rs knowing that it can’t just access literally any Qt type I like, but maybe it will let me write some QML sooner, and not have an upsetting building experience?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically, yes, I got some QML running like immediately, and the builds are super fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But not fast enough, I want some kind of hot reloading. I’m not putting up with this after using Svelte for years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actual good hot reloading is not very trivial to implement, but I don’t need it to be actually good. After a couple of failed attempts due to restrictions with qmetaobject-rs’s design (I do actually recommend qmetaobject-rs btw, it’s good), I ended up hacking together a thing that registers a “HotReload” object with QML, which internally keeps a “should hot reload?” &lt;code&gt;Arc&amp;lt;AtomicBool&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. When a QML file modification is detected, another “anything changed?” bool is set to true, then when the window gains focus and it sees that something has been modified, it sets that bool to true then literally quits the app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I then have a loop that checks if hot reloading has been requested and boots up the event loop again and loads the new QML files. To answer your question from two sentences ago, I originally immediately rebooted the app when a file changed, but that closed the window and opened the window again over the top of Vee Ess Cohde, and I press Ctrl+S a lot. I then added a button to the window that I needed to click to make the reload happen, but the file-modification-then-window-focus trigger is much, much better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Watch the files:
let (tx, rx) = std::sync::mpsc::channel();
let mut watcher = notify::recommended_watcher(tx).unwrap();
watcher.configure(notify::Config::default().with_compare_contents(true)).unwrap();
watcher.watch(Path::new(qml_folder), notify::RecursiveMode::Recursive).unwrap();

let thread_dirty_state = dirty_state.clone();
std::thread::spawn(move || {
	while let Ok(change) = rx.recv() {
		if let Ok(change) = change {
			if let notify::EventKind::Modify(modification) = change.kind {
				thread_dirty_state.store(true, std::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst);
			}
		}
	}
});

// The event loop, loop:
loop {
	hot_reload_state.store(false, std::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst);
	let mut engine = QmlEngine::new();
	println!("------");
	println!("RELOAD");

	engine.set_property("HotReload".into(), hot_reload.pinned().into());
	engine.load_file(format!("{qml_folder}main.qml").into());
	engine.exec();

	if !hot_reload_state.load(std::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst) {
		break;
	}
}

// Implementation of the HotReload object that gets registered with QML.
impl HotReload {
	fn reload_if_dirty(&amp;amp;self) {
		if self.dirty_state.load(std::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst) {
			self.reload();
		}
	}

	fn reload(&amp;amp;self) {
		self.dirty_state.store(false, std::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst);
		self.reload_state.store(true, std::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst);
		QCoreApplication::quit();
	}
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Then from QML, the main window does this:
onActiveChanged: {
	HotReload.reload_if_dirty()
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can’t say it’s amazing, but it was easy to implement and it gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;QML has a Language Server now which is awesome, but I couldn’t figure out how to get it working so I just opened up Qt Creator and edited QML there (Qt Creator is actually very good, perhaps unexpectedly so for those who haven’t used it). I then did something later on which made the language server work so I could just use VS Code to edit it with all my lovely custom configs and keyboard shortcuts. I’m still not sure what I did to make it work. Might look into that later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well that was fun, moving on…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hour Five&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The great Telegram Ripping-Off begins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the splitter that goes between the chat list sidebar and the actual chat. The sidebar has a 65px “collapsed” mode where it only shows icons of the chats, but the “normal” minimum is 260px. The right of the split can be min 380px. The provided splitter widget didn’t have enough features, so I just made my own one. That’s the great thing about a good UI language, you can just make your own one of a thing and it will be fun and not sad (just keep accessibility in mind even if you don’t implement it during the prototyping stage).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here it is!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note how the mouse cursor doesn’t stay as ↔ when it’s not exactly on the splitter. The built-in QML splitter had that problem 15 years ago, and it’s still like that now :(&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I could access &lt;code&gt;QGuiApplication::setOverrideCursor&lt;/code&gt; I could make my splitter not have that problem, but as it stands, with my simple qmetaobject-rs project and 0% C++, I just can’t. Oh well, I’ll look into it later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a little bit buggy and the mouse doesn’t always line up with the splitter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3am, same day&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got a bit carried away. My commit messages since the last section were: &lt;code&gt;Various UI work&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;More UI stuff&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Sidebar collapsing is much more advanced&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;More UI work&lt;/code&gt;. Highly descriptive. I basically re-learned a tonne of stuff about QML, including how to make nice animations, and was honestly quite pleased with myself with how close I got some of the interactions to Telegram. There will be a lot more of that coming up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just watch the following motion picture!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I even created my own implementation of that Material Design growing-circle-inside-of-another-circular-mask thingo. I spent too long on this because I found what I wanted: OpacityMask, but realised it’s in the &lt;code&gt;Qt5Compat.GraphicalEffects&lt;/code&gt; package because it’s basically deprecated. I then spent ages trying to figure out how to use MultiEffect to do the same thing and found that its mask feature seems to treat alpha as a boolean (could be wrong here, I just couldn’t make it work), then I went down the next rabbit hole of writing a custom shader effect, then because that was obnoxiously difficult to get ShaderEffect working, I just went back to using &lt;code&gt;OpacityMask&lt;/code&gt;. Problem solved I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Next Day, or Same Day, Depending On How You Think About It&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I made a chat bubble. That little tail thing in the bottom right was fun. It’s in the bottom left if someone else sent the message, how thoughtful. I used Inkscape to make a little thingy like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then copy-pasted the path into a PathSvg item in QML:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;path: (root.other
	? "m 40,-8 c 4.418278,0 8,3.581722 8,8 v 16 c 0,4.418278 -3.581722,8 -8,8 H 0 C 8.836556,24 16,16.836556 16,8 V 0 c 0,-4.418278 3.581722,-8 8,-8 z"
	: "M 8,-8 C 3.581722,-8 0,-4.418278 0,0 v 16 c 0,4.418278 3.581722,8 8,8 H 48 C 39.163444,24 32,16.836556 32,8 V 0 c 0,-4.418278 -3.581722,-8 -8,-8 z"
)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But who cares about that when Telegram has this very cool, swoonworthy emoji-reaction popup!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s Telegram, not my work. Wait, so it has one row of 7 emojis, but then you click the expand button and that row becomes the first row of emojis in a scroll view, following a search box that appears above, also inside the scroll view. Also, the expand button fades away, revealing that the row had 8 emojis the whole time?!?!? What snazziness to live up to. Let me have a go:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait, did that emoji reaction popup just go outside the window? Be still my beating heart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So that’s cool. What else is there?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Message selection, what a rush!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fancy Animations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The secret to pulling off a fancy synchronised animation without having to set up some complicated animation framework, is to just use a &lt;code&gt;NumberAnimation&lt;/code&gt; and some maths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I might have a bit of state like &lt;code&gt;property bool expand&lt;/code&gt;, and I want stuff to animate whenever &lt;code&gt;expand&lt;/code&gt; changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just follow along with my simple step-by-step instructions!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make another&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;real&lt;/code&gt;property with “ness” tacked on the end, and bind it to the state property&lt;code&gt;property real expandness: expand ? 1 : 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;real&lt;/code&gt;number animate whenever it changes:&lt;code&gt;Behavior on expandness { NumberAnimation { duration: 500; easing.type: Easing.InOutQuad } }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bind stuff to it:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;opacity: 1 - expandness&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;height: lerp(0, topSectionContent.height, expandness)&lt;/code&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;radius: lerp(barHeight / 2, 5, expandness)&lt;/code&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;etc. etc.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once I figured out those steps, I started using the technique everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Minimise to the System Tray&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just in case you didn’t notice, Spectacle is Recording.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I am glad I downloaded 1.6mb to watch that just then. Why is he expanding and collapsing the side bar again again and again? I thought he already did that in a previous video?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look closer!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was surprisingly hard to record ‘cause I drew a rectangle around the system tray icon then when I clicked record, the “stop recording” system tray icon appeared and pushed my icon out of view :(&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s my first attempt:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Captivating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first I was going to use a Rust library to implement the tray icon, then I remembered that Qt actually comes with that functionality. My main concern was the possibility of making the number appear in the icon without it being a huge pain. I was thinking I would have to get some C++ action going to make this work, then after much too long, I realised that &lt;code&gt;QSystemTrayIcon&lt;/code&gt; is actually in the QWidgets library so I’d have to pull all that in just to get it working! Then a lightbulb appeared. What if QML has its own version? The answer to that is yes, it’s called &lt;code&gt;SystemTrayIcon&lt;/code&gt;, but it’s under &lt;code&gt;Qt.labs.platform&lt;/code&gt; which means it’s experimental. Good thing I don’t care about that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the trick was to get the number on the icon, like I mentioned before. The &lt;code&gt;icon.source&lt;/code&gt; property of &lt;code&gt;SystemTrayIcon&lt;/code&gt; takes a URL to an icon. That’s awkward. What am I to do? Create some kind of virtual file system that I can upload new icon pictures to that have the number overlay? Create 100 icons for all the possible counts? Is there some kind of built-in way to get a URL to a custom picture in Qt? That would be pretty fancy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out Qt is pretty fancy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s actually pretty sweet. Basically what you do is create a normal UI with QML:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Image {
	id: trayImageItem
	source: "qrc:/icons/icon_margin.svg"
	width: 64
	height: 64

	Rectangle {
		anchors.right: parent.right
		anchors.rightMargin: 1
		anchors.bottom: parent.bottom
		anchors.bottomMargin: 1
		width: messageCountText.implicitWidth + 6
		height: messageCountText.implicitHeight
		color: "#f23c34"
		radius: 16
		visible: root.messageCount &amp;gt; 0

		Text {
			id: messageCountText
			x: 3
			text: root.messageCount &amp;gt; 99 ? "＋" : root.messageCount
			color: "white"
			opacity: 0.9
			font.pixelSize: 30
			font.weight: Font.Bold
		}
	}
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then create a &lt;code&gt;ShaderEffectSource&lt;/code&gt;, which captures a new image of the &lt;code&gt;trayImageItem&lt;/code&gt; whenever it changes (even if it is invisible, which is very important in this situation):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ShaderEffectSource {
	id: trayImageSource
	anchors.fill: trayImageItem
	sourceItem: trayImageItem
	visible: false
	live: true
	hideSource: true
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then whenever the message count changes, I call &lt;code&gt;updateTrayIcon()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;function updateTrayIcon() {
	trayImageSource.grabToImage(result =&amp;gt; {
		trayIcon.icon.source = result.url
	})
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;result.url&lt;/code&gt; looks something like &lt;code&gt;itemgrabber:#1&lt;/code&gt;, so basically Qt implements exactly that crazy idea I described above. Neat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system tray task convinced me to finally make an icon:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn’t want a speech bubble, it’s already been done, and I wouldn’t want this app to be mistaken for any app that’s already on the market. I was thinking of a horn or something, but it needed to kinda fill the space so I went for a megaphone look. It also kinda looks like an axe, which goes well with the name Provoke I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Alright, time for some C++&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven’t written any C++ in years. It still lives on in my brain though, in the “things that are extremely complicated and over-engineered, but actually kind of awesome” section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do not want to make my build much more complicated to make this work, or add more complexity than it deserves. I just want to be able to access some stuff in Qt that isn’t exposed to Rust or QML yet, without it being a pain to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After some research I decided the best way to go about that would be to just use Qt properly the way it was intended, but keep it slim. Following was much experimentation then a chosen solution:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make a folder called “cpp”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Put a CMakeLists.txt file in it, and a cpp/hpp pair&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)

project(provokecpp LANGUAGES CXX)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

set(CMAKE_AUTOMOC ON)

find_package(Qt6 COMPONENTS Core Gui Qml REQUIRED)

qt_add_library(provokecpp STATIC
	provokecpp.cpp
	provokecpp.hpp
)

target_link_libraries(provokecpp
	Qt6::Core
	Qt6::Gui
	Qt6::Qml
)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write some QObjects the old-fashioned way, then &lt;code&gt;extern "C"&lt;/code&gt;a function which registers stuff with QML.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;QObject* provoke_tools_singleton_provider(QQmlEngine* engine, QJSEngine* jsEngine) {
	return new ProvokeTools();
}

extern "C" void register_provoke_qml_types() {
	qmlRegisterSingletonType&amp;lt;ProvokeTools&amp;gt;("provoke", 1, 0, "ProvokeTools", provoke_tools_singleton_provider);
	// This sounds like it would solve that problem that I had with my Splitter!
	qmlRegisterType&amp;lt;OverrideMouseCursor&amp;gt;("provoke", 1, 0, "OverrideMouseCursor");
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“You keep talking about Rust, but mostly you’ve just written QML and C++, I feel ripped off” - Fair enough, but I intend to use Rust for the “model” layer and any custom UI elements and logic that call for native code. That stuff just hasn’t really come up yet.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add a &lt;code&gt;build.rs&lt;/code&gt;file and use the&lt;code&gt;cmake&lt;/code&gt;crate to build the “cpp” folder. I find this part quite cool, as you don’t even see it running the C++ compiler when you do&lt;code&gt;cargo run&lt;/code&gt;and all the build stuff happens in the&lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt;folder with everything else. It even caches the result and only re-runs the C++ build if a dependency changes:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;fn main() {
	let dest = cmake::Config::new("cpp")
		.build_target("all")
		.build();

	println!("cargo::rerun-if-changed=cpp/CMakeLists.txt");
	println!("cargo::rerun-if-changed=cpp/provokecpp.cpp");
	println!("cargo::rerun-if-changed=cpp/provokecpp.hpp");
	
	println!("cargo::rustc-link-search=native={}/build", dest.display());
	println!("cargo::rustc-link-lib=static=provokecpp");
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;From Rust, import the symbol and call it on startup:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;unsafe extern "C" {
	unsafe fn register_provoke_qml_types();
}

..

register_provoke_qml_types();
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t exactly innovative, but there were lots of ways to go about solving this problem. It’s a nice setup, and I can forget it’s even there. It builds pretty much instantly (for now). I can even export more &lt;code&gt;extern "C"&lt;/code&gt; functions as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;And then I wrote the important news alert that you just finished reading&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I Can’t Believe It’s Not Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I keep mistaking it for the real Telegram so I think the illusion is working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other is my favourite language, I’m surprised I didn’t use it more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will he keep working on it? Will it grow to become the worlds most popular messenger app due to its superior user experience? Will he even keep working on it after this? Will he go back to working on that game engine? Or that sewing pattern CAD idea? Will there ever be another blog post on this website?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;alpr.watch&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your local government might be discussing surveillance tech like Flock cameras, facial recognition, or automated license plate readers right now. This map helps you find those meetings and take action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why this matters: Municipalities across the US are quietly adopting surveillance technologies in rapidly growing numbers with over 80,000 cameras already out on the streets. These systems track residents' movements, collect biometric data, and build massive databases of our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;alpr.watch scans meeting agendas for keywords like "flock," "license plate reader," "alpr," and more. Each pin on the map shows where these conversations are happening so that you can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Understanding Mass Surveillance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What is ALPR?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) systems use cameras and artificial intelligence to capture, read, and store license plate data from every passing vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These systems work 24/7 creating a massive database of where vehicles, and by extension, people, travel. Every trip to the grocery store, doctor's office, or place of worship gets recorded and stored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What is Flock Safety?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flock Safety is one of the largest manufacturers of ALPR cameras in the United States, marketing their systems to neighborhoods and law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flock cameras capture license plates, vehicle make/model, color, and other identifying features. This data is shared across a massive network of agencies and jurisdictions, creating a surveillance web that tracks millions of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Slippery Slope&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;History shows that surveillance systems expand beyond their original scope:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Systems marketed for "solving crimes" get used for immigration enforcement&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Temporary programs become permanent infrastructure&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data sharing agreements grow to include more agencies&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Technology advances enable new invasive uses&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Regulations and oversight consistently lag behind deployment&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Organizations Fighting for Your Privacy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These groups and individuals are leading the fight against mass surveillance. Consider supporting their work or getting involved locally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leading nonprofit defending digital privacy and civil liberties. eff.org&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fighting surveillance overreach through litigation and advocacy nationwide. aclu.org&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Digital rights organization mobilizing grassroots opposition to surveillance. fightforthefuture.org&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Litigating against invasive surveillance in New York and beyond. stopspying.org&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This civil liberties law firm has filed lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of Flock's mass, warrantless surveillance ij.org&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About Artie&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Artie is a fully-managed change data capture (CDC) streaming platform that replicates production databases into data warehouses and lakes - in real time, with zero maintenance. We make high-volume data replication simple, reliable, and scalable for engineering teams.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our platform powers mission-critical use cases including fraud and risk monitoring, inventory visibility, customer-facing analytics, and AI/ML workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re trusted by teams like Substack, Alloy, and ClickUp, and backed by top-tier investors including Y Combinator, General Catalyst, Pathlight, and the founders of Dropbox and Mode.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Artie is built for engineers who care about performance, reliability, and operational simplicity - and we’re growing fast. This role is your chance to shape our GTM from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About the Role&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’re hiring our first Senior Enterprise AEs to help scale Artie’s sales motion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is not a “run the playbook” role. You’ll refine the playbook - defining what great full-cycle enterprise sales looks like for a deeply technical platform. You’ll partner directly with founders, influence product strategy, and set the bar for future AEs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What you’ll do&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Run full-cycle enterprise sales &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Own deals end-to-end: sourcing, qualification, discovery, demos, POCs, procurement, and closing&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Navigate 6-12 month cycles with engineering, data, security, finance, and legal stakeholders&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Multi-thread deeply and build strong, technical champions&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Drive technical discovery &amp;amp; solutioning &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Understand customer architectures and pain points (SQL Server, Postgres, MySQL, Kafka, Snowflake, VPCs, networking)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Map these to Artie’s capabilities with clarity and confidence&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Whiteboard solutions with staff engineers and data architects&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Lead rigorous evaluations &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Build structured POC plans&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Partner with engineering to define success criteria&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Drive toward clear, mutual action plans&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Source your own pipeline &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;There is no SDR team - you source 80%+ of pipeline through outbound, events, founder referrals, and creative prospecting&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Use your curiosity and rigor to start real technical conversations&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Sell the vision and business value (not features) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Translate deep technical concepts (e.g. log-based CDC, Kafka buffering) into ROI, TCO reduction, and platform reliability&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Inspire our buyers with how Artie can unlock new opportunities for their company&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What we’re looking for&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Enterprise sales mastery: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;5+ years of full cycle AE experience in enterprise or upper/mid-market&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Consistent track record of closing $100-300K+ ACV deals&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Comfortable navigating 6-12 month cycles and complex procurement&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Proven experience run full-cycle deals without SDR or SE support&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Deep technical fluency: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Experience selling dev tools, data infra, or cloud platforms to technical buyers&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Able to confidently explain concepts like log-based CDC, Kafka, schema evolution, or cloud networking basics (VPCs, peering, security reviews)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Comfortable whiteboarding with staff-level engineers and technical stakeholders&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fluent discussing database, streaming, and cloud architecture concepts with engineering teams&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Outbound-first mindset: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Self-sourced a significant portion of pipeline in previous roles&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Consistent and persistent prospector who finds creative ways to engage prospects&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Extreme ownership: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Never drop the ball - internally or externally&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Drives alignment, writes structured follow-ups, and runs mutual action plans&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Consultative and curious: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Asks layered questions, uncovers deep pain, and guides prospects to clarity and value&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Collaborative and self-aware: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Knows when to pull in help - from CTO deep dives to executive alignment with CEO&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Works closely with teammates to win complex deals together&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Willing to work in-person, 5 days/week at our SF office (relocation covered)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What you’ll get&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;A Seat at the Table: Join as a founding GTM member with real influence on company direction.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;End-to-End Ownership: Drive the full GTM lifecycle—strategy, execution, and iteration.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Tight Product Loop: Collaborate closely with product and leadership to shape what we build and why.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Compensation &amp;amp; Benefits&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;$150-175K base salary ($300-350K OTE) depending on experience&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Equity: ~0.1%&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Healthcare, 401(k), unlimited PTO&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Lunch &amp;amp; dinner provided&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Visa sponsorship available&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Coming soon: Simpler pricing and a better experience for GitHub Actions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On January 1, 2026, GitHub will reduce the price of GitHub-hosted runners by up to 39% depending on the machine type used. The free usage minute quotas will remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On March 1, 2026, GitHub will introduce a new $0.002 per minute GitHub Actions cloud platform charge that will apply to self-hosted runner usage. Any usage subject to this charge will count toward the minutes included in your plan, as explained in our GitHub Actions billing documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Runner usage in public repositories will remain free. There will be no changes in price structure for GitHub Enterprise Server customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Deeper investment in the Actions self-hosted experience&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are increasing our investment into our self-hosted experience to ensure that we can provide autoscaling for scenarios beyond just Linux containers. This will include new approaches to scaling, new platform support, Windows support, and more as we move through the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more details about the product investments we’re making in Actions, please visit our Executive Insights page.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re releasing a new version of ChatGPT Images(opens in a new window), powered by our new flagship image generation model. Now, whether you’re creating something from scratch or editing a photo, you’ll get the output you’re picturing. It makes precise edits while keeping details intact, and generates images up to 4x faster. Alongside, we’re introducing a new Images feature(opens in a new window) within ChatGPT, designed to make image generation delightful—to spark inspiration and make creative exploration effortless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Images model is rolling out today in ChatGPT for all users, and is available in the API as GPT Image 1.5. The new Images experience in ChatGPT is also rolling out today for most users, with Business and Enterprise access coming later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, when you ask for edits to an uploaded image, the model adheres to your intent more reliably—down to the small details—changing only what you ask for while keeping elements like lighting, composition, and people’s appearance consistent across inputs, outputs, and subsequent edits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unlocks results that match your intent—more useful photo edits, more believable clothing and hairstyle try-ons, alongside stylistic filters and conceptual transformations that retain the essence of the original image. Together, these improvements mean ChatGPT can act as a creative studio in your pocket, capable of both practical edits and expressive reimaginings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model excels at different types of editing—including adding, subtracting, combining, blending, and transposing—so you get the changes you want without losing what makes the image special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model’s creativity shines through transformations that change and add elements—like text and layout—to bring ideas to life, while preserving important details. These transformations work for both simple and more intricate concepts, and are easy to try using preset styles and ideas in the new ChatGPT Images(opens in a new window) feature—no written prompt required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model follows instructions more reliably than our initial version. This enables more precise edits as well as more intricate original compositions, where relationships between elements are preserved as intended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;New&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Previous&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model takes another step ahead in text rendering, capable of handling denser and smaller text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model also improves on additional dimensions that translate to more immediately usable outputs, like rendering many small faces and how natural outputs look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;New&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Previous&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to generating images by describing what you’d like to see in a message, we’re introducing a dedicated home for Images(opens in a new window) in ChatGPT—available in the sidebar through the mobile app and on chatgpt.com—to make exploring and trying images faster and easier. It includes dozens of preset filters and prompts to jump-start inspiration, updated regularly to reflect emerging trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these upgrades let you create images that better match your vision, from small edits to full reimaginings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We reran many of the examples from our initial image generation launch to evaluate performance. The model shows clear improvements across a range of cases, though results remain imperfect. While this release represents meaningful progress, there is still significant room for improvement in future iterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;New&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Previous&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT Image 1.5 in the API(opens in a new window) delivers all the same improvements as ChatGPT Images: it’s stronger at image preservation and editing than GPT Image 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll see more consistent preservation of branded logos and key visuals across edits, making it well suited for marketing and brand work like graphics and logo creation, and for ecommerce teams generating full product image catalogs (variants, scenes, and angles) from a single-source image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image inputs and outputs are now 20% cheaper in GPT Image 1.5 as compared to GPT Image 1, so you can generate and iterate on more images with the same budget.&lt;lb/&gt;You can try the new model in the OpenAI Playground(opens in a new window), peruse the gallery(opens in a new window), or read the prompt guide(opens in a new window) for inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprises and startups across industries, including creative tools, e-commerce, marketing software, and more are already using GPT Image 1.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;New&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Previous&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new ChatGPT Images(opens in a new window) model is rolling out now to all ChatGPT users and API users globally today across surfaces. It works across models, so you don’t need to select anything in order to use it. The version of ChatGPT Images that launched earlier this year will remain available to all users as a custom GPT(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe we’re still at the beginning of what image generation can enable. Today’s update is a meaningful step forward with more to come, from finer-grained edits to richer, more detailed outputs across languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Author&lt;/head&gt;OpenAI&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Contributors&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project Leadership&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel Goh — Research Lead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adele Li — Product Lead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Peebles — Sora Lead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aditya Ramesh — World Simulation Lead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Chen — Chief Research Officer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prafulla Dhariwal — Multimodal Lead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core Team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex Fang, Alex Yu, Ben Wang, Bing Liang, Boyuan Chen, Charlie Nash, David Medina, Dibya Bhattacharjee, Jianfeng Wang, Kenji Hata, Kiwhan Song, Mengchao Zhong, Mike Starr, Yuguang Yang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research Contributors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bram Wallace, Dmytro Okhonko, Haitang Hu, Kshitij Gupta, Li Jing, Lu Liu, Peter Zhokhov, Qiming Yuan, Senthil Purushwalkam, Yizhen Zhang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core Inference&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adam Tart, Alyssa Huang, Andrew Braunstein, Jane Park, Karen Li, Tomer Kaftan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research Collaborators&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aditya Ramesh, Alex Nichol, Andrew Kondrich, Andrew Liu, Benedikt Winter, Bill Peebles, Connor Holmes, Cyril Zhang, Daniel Geng, Eric Mintun, James Betker, Jamie Kiros, Manuka Stratta, Martin Li, Raoul de Liedekerke, Ricky Wang, Ruslan Vasilev, Vladimir Chalyshev, Welton Wang, Wyatt Thompson, Yaming Lin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inference Collaborators&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jiayu Bai, Kevin King, Stanley Hsieh, Weiyi Zheng&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data &amp;amp; Evaluation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexandra Barr, Aparna Dutta, Arshi Bhatnagar, Chao Yu, Charlotte Cole, Dragos Oprica, Emma Tang, Gowrishankar Sunder, Henry Baer, Ian Sohl, James Park, Jason Xu, Lennon Szi-chieh Yu, Peilin Yang, Somay Jain, Wesam Manassra, Xiaolei Zhu, Yilei Qian&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applied&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affonso Reis, Alan Gou, Alexandra Vodopianova, Amandeep Grewal, Andi Liu, Andrew Sima, Angus Fletcher, Antonia Woodford, Arun Eswara, Benny Wong, Bharat Rangan, Boyang Niu, Bridget Collins, Bryan Brandow, Callie Riggins Zetino, Chris Wendel, Ethan Chang, Gilman Tolle, Greg Hochmuth, Ibrahim Okuyucu, Jesse Chand, Jesse Hendrickson, Jiayu Bai, Jimmy Lin, Johan Cervantes, Kan Wu, Liam Esparraguera, Maja Wichrowska, Matthew Ferrari, Murat Yesildal, Nikunj Handa, Nithanth Kudige, Ola Okelola, Osman Khwaja, Peter Argany, Peter Bakkum, Peter Vidani, Richard Zadorozny, Rohan Sahai, Savelii Bondini, Sean Chang, Vickie Duong, Victoria Huang, Xiaolin Hao, Xueqing Li&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety, Safety Systems, Integrity, Policy &amp;amp; Trust&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby Fanlo Susk, Adam Wells, Aleah Houze, Annie Cheng, Artyi Xu, Carolina Paz, David Abelman, Femi Alamu, Jeremiah Currier, Jesika Haria, Mariya Guryeva, Max Burkhardt, Paige Walker, Pedro Aguilar, Rutsu Koshimizu, Sam Toizer, Savannah Heon, Tom Rubin, Tonia Osadebe, Willow Primack, Zoe Stoll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product Operations, Program Management and Governance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antonio Di Francesco, Filippo Raso, Grace Wu, Josh Metherd, Ruth Costigan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ally Bennett, Tony Song, Tyce Walters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communications, Marketing, Community, Design &amp;amp; Creative&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akash Iyer, Alex Baker-Whitcomb, Angie Luo, Anne Oburgh, Antonia Richmond, Annie Tsang, Ashley Tyra, Bailey Richardson, Brandon McGraw, Cary Hudson, Dana Palmie, Evan Corrigan, Gaby Raila, Indgila Samad Ali, James Anderson, Jeremy Schwartz, Jordan Liss, Juan Garza, Julie Steele, Kara Zichittella, Karn Piluntanadilok, Kendal Peirce, Kim Baschet, Leah Anise, Livvy Pierce, Maria Clara M.

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Too Fast to Think: The Hidden Fatigue of AI Vibe Coding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Getting to the limits of what developers can do&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After vibe coding for some time, I feel fatigue. I’m coding Marvai - a package manager for prompts on my own, with a combination of Claude Code and Cursor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I use Claude Code for code generation, bug fixing, test writing, test fixing, security checks etc.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Claude Code is especially useful to fix linting errors from nilaway or staticcheck - for a developer those are boring and tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I use Cursor for augmented coding, generate functions, adapt copy&amp;amp;pasted code, for refactoring, fix error handling, and many other tedious tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I have been a coder for 40 years and I have seen many tools for developers that haven’t worked, like Model Driven Development MDD/MDA and executable UML.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With AI I’m now much faster at generating code and building features than I ever was before. The combination of Claude Code and Cursor is a real speedup.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I encountered a new phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Again and again I feel fatigue. I finish a feature, and another feature, concetrate on reviewing the code the AI generated, and fix a bug and finish a feature with such velocity and I feel fatigue after some hours - sometimes as soon as one hour. AI working at such speed, finishing things to accept or review, feels too much for my brain to process or keep up with. I need to pause for some time before I can start again.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I haven’t felt this before as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I first encountered the concept of cognitive load in the book Team Toplogies. The idea there is to structure teams in a way that the cognitive load for developers is not too small and not to big. The more responsibilities a team and it’s members get, the bigger the cognitive load. And if you put many different topics on a team, the cognitive load for the team becomes too big for the team to work.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a young adult I was working in a plastic factory, sitting at a machine. The machine produced vacuum cleaner cases, had it’s rhythm, it finished vacuum cleaner cases on it’s own schedule, made a “PING” when finished, opened the door and I had to grab the casing and put it down (and package it in fine paper etc. which took some time). The machine would close while I was finishing the casing. And for some time it was stressful, working to the rhythm of the machine. Then I got accustomed to the speed and rhythm, until my boss increased the frequency. Living by machine time is what I sometimes feel with Vibe Coding and Cursor generating code or Claude fixing a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I had waiting times with compiling and waited for the machine to finish, but it feels differently, with vibe coding it feels like the machine is in control not me.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With traditional coding, the speed of your output matches the complexity of the task and the speed of your coding. This gives your brain time to process what is happening. With vibe coding the coding happens so fast, that my brain can’t process what is happening in real time, and thoughts are getting clogged up. Complex tasks are compressed into seconds or minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;My brain does not get the baking time to mentally process architecture, decisions and edge cases the AI creates - not enough time to put the AI output into one coherent picture. I’m running a marathon at the pace of a sprint - speeds don’t match.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One reason developers are developers is the dopamine loop.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You write code, it doesn’t work, you fix it, it works, great! Dopamine rush. Several dozens or a hundred times a day. Now this loop speeds up. Faster and faster we run around that loop, and get washed with Dopamine - and your brain gets overwhelmed. And stress hormones at the same time! You get fatigue - instead of the usually happiness and satisfaction of coding.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With coding there is a limit to context switching. A context switch in coding is like dumping the cache of your brain and reloading the cache of your brain with a new context. This takes time and energy. You need to build a mental model of the code, to decide what to change and how to change it and then writing the changes out into source code, the essence of coding.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With vibe coding the frequency of content switches speeds up tremendously - with the AI fixing and creating many different things in different packages or modules with one go. Even when I &amp;lt;tab&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;tab&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;tab&amp;gt; in Cursor, each change is a micro-content switch from function to function.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Each context switch takes energy, every context switch is heavy lifting for your brain. Normally this materializes as the fact that it takes time to context switch. With AI in the driver seat, context switches are forced on you faster and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When each context switch takes energy, fast energy switches from feature delivered to feature delivered, vibe coding drains your energy - fatigue!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With AI it seems we all become managers, we all become reviewers. The core of the role is changing from turning requirements into code to managing AI output - more like a team lead manages the output of a team, but on a much deeper level. Your responsibility grows to manage a team of five with vibe coding, while still being a developer being responsible for the code. It’s like being a traffic officer in the middle of a busy intersection - which is a stressful job on it’s own - while also overseeing five intersections in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reviewing, directing and guiding an AI puts more stress on you than writing code, where your writing matches your thinking and doesn’t jump ahead, with you in a rush to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What can be said:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Me and many more I assume feel fatigue from vibe coding&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We need deliberate pacing when working with AI tools&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We need AI-aware retrospectives to understand what is going on - perhaps having a daily retrospective to get the mind and the code in sync again&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We need to be aware of new mental health challenges for AI coders&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We might need to let go of micro managing AIs and trust the AI more - stop trying to bridge the gap between managing an AI and controlling it’s output&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I don’t think we’ve figured out yet where this is going. AI has made us faster than we’ve ever been, but our brains haven’t caught up to the pace. We’re like early pilots flying with autopilot—capable, but drained. We need new rhythms, new boundaries, and new ways of thinking about what it means to “code.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maybe the future of coding isn’t just faster. Maybe it’s also slower in a way, on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;No Graphics API&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My name is Sebastian Aaltonen. I have been writing graphics code for 30 years. I shipped my first 3d accelerated game in 1999. Since then I have been working with almost every gaming console generation (Nokia N-Gage, Nintendo DS/Switch, Sony Playstation/Portable, Microsoft Xbox) and every PC graphics API (DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan). For the last 4 years I have been building a new renderer for HypeHype targeting WebGPU, Metal (Mac &amp;amp; iOS) and Vulkan (Android). During my career I have been building several Ubisoft internal engines, optimizing Unreal Engine 4 and leading the Unity DOTS graphics team. I am a member of the Vulkan Advisory Panel and an Arm Ambassador.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This blog post includes lots of low level hardware details. When writing this post I used “GPT5 Thinking” AI model to cross reference public Linux open source drivers to confirm my knowledge and to ensure no NDA information is present in this blog post. Sources: AMD RDNA ISA documents and GPUOpen, Nvidia PTX ISA documents, Intel PRM, Linux open source GPU drivers (Mesa, Freedreno, Turnip, Asahi) and vendor optimization guides/presentations. The blog post has been screened by several industry insiders before the public release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Low-level graphics APIs change the industry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, a significant shift occurred in real-time computer graphics with the introduction of new low-level PC graphics APIs. AMD had won both Xbox One (2013) and Playstation 4 (2013) contracts. Their new Graphics Core Next (GCN) architecture became the de-facto lead development platform for AAA games. PC graphics APIs at that time, DirectX 11 and OpenGL 4.5, had heavy driver overhead and were designed for single threaded rendering. AAA developers demanded higher performance APIs for PC. DICE joined with AMD to create a low level AMD GCN specific API for the PC called Mantle. As a response, Microsoft, Khronos and Apple started developing their own low-level APIs: DirectX 12, Vulkan and Metal were born.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The initial reception of these new low-level APIs was mixed. Synthetic benchmarks and demos showed substantial performance increases, but performance gains couldn’t be seen in major game engines such as Unreal and Unity. At Ubisoft, our teams noticed that porting existing DirectX 11 renderers to DirectX 12 often resulted in performance regression. Something wasn’t right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Existing high-level APIs featured minimal persistent state, with fine-grained state setters and individual data inputs bound to the shader just prior to draw call submission. New low-level APIs aimed to make draw calls cheaper by ahead-of-time bundling shader pipeline state and bindings into persistent objects. GPU architectures were highly heterogeneous back in the day. Doing the data remapping, validation, and uploading ahead of time was a big gain. However, the rendering hardware interfaces (RHI) of existing game engines were designed for fine grained immediate mode rendering, while the new low-level APIs required bundling data in persistent objects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To address this incompatibility, a new low-level graphics remapping layer grew beneath the RHI. This layer assumed the complexity previously handled by the OpenGL and DirectX 11 graphics drivers, tracking resources and managing mappings between the fine-grained dynamic user-land state and the persistent low-level GPU state. Graphics programmers started specializing into two distinct roles: low-level graphics programmers, who focused on the new low-level “driver” layer and the RHI, and high-level graphics programmers, who built visual graphics algorithms on top of the RHI. Visual programming was also getting more complex due to physically based lighting models, compute shaders and later ray-tracing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Modern APIs?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DirectX 12, Vulkan, and Metal are often referred to as “modern APIs”. These APIs are now 10 years old. They were initially designed to support GPUs that are now 13 years old, an incredibly long time in GPU history. Older GPU architectures were optimized for traditional vertex and pixel shader tasks rather than the compute-intensive generic workloads prevalent today. They had vendor specific binding models and data paths. Hardware differences had to be wrapped under the same API. Ahead-of-time created persistent objects were crucial in offloading the mapping, uploading, validation and binding costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast, the console APIs and Mantle were exclusively designed for AMD's GCN architecture, a forward-thinking design for its time. GCN boasted a comprehensive read/write cache hierarchy and scalar registers capable of storing texture and buffer descriptors, effectively treating everything as memory. No complex API for remapping the data was required, and significantly less ahead-of-time work was needed. The console APIs and Mantle had much less API complexity due to targeting a single modern GPU architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A decade has passed, and GPUs have undergone a significant evolution. All modern GPU architectures now feature complete cache hierarchies with coherent last-level caches. CPUs can write directly to GPU memory using PCIe REBAR or UMA and 64-bit GPU pointers are directly supported in shaders. Texture samplers are bindless, eliminating the need for a CPU driver to configure the descriptor bindings. Texture descriptors can be directly stored in arrays within the GPU memory (often called descriptor heaps). If we were to design an API tailored for modern GPUs today, it wouldn’t need most of these persistent “retained mode” objects. The compromises that DirectX 12.0, Metal 1 and Vulkan 1.0 had to make are not needed anymore. We could simplify the API drastically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The past decade has revealed the weaknesses of the modern APIs. The PSO permutation explosion is the biggest problem we need to solve. Vendors (Valve, Nvidia, etc) have massive cloud servers storing terabytes of PSOs for each different architecture/driver combination. User's local PSO cache size can exceed 100GB. No wonder the gamers are complaining that loading takes ages and stutter is all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The history of GPUs and APIs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we talk about stripping the API surface, we need to understand why graphics APIs were historically designed this way. OpenGL wasn't intentionally slow, nor was Vulkan intentionally complex. 10-20 years ago GPU hardware was highly diverse and undergoing rapid evolution. Designing a cross-platform API for such a diverse set of hardware required compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start with a classic: The 3dFX Voodoo 2 12MB (1998) was a three chip design: A single rasterizer chip connected to a 4MB framebuffer memory and two texture sampling chips, each connected to their own 4MB texture memory. There was no geometry pipeline and no programmable shaders. CPU sent pre-transformed triangle vertices to the rasterizer. The rasterizer had a configurable blending equation to control how the vertex colors and the two texture sampler results were combined together. Texture samplers could not read each-other’s memory or the framebuffer. Thus there was no support for multiple render passes. Since the hardware was incapable of window composition, it had a loopback cable to connect your dedicated 2d video card. 3d rendering only worked in exclusive fullscreen mode. A 3d graphics card was a highly specialized piece of hardware, with little in common with the current GPUs and their massive programmable SIMD arrays. Hardware of this era had a massive impact on DirectX (1995) and OpenGL (1992) design. Backwards compatibility played a huge role. APIs improved iteratively. These 30 year old API designs still impact the way we write software today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia’s Geforce 256 coined the term GPU. It had a geometry processor in addition to the rasterizer. The geometry processor, rasterizer and texture sampling units were all integrated in the same die and shared memory. DirectX 7 introduced two new concepts: render target textures and uniform constants. Multipass rendering meant that texture samplers could read the rasterizer output, invalidating the 3dFX Voodoo 2 separate memory design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The geometry processor API featured uniform data inputs for transform matrices (float4x4), light positions, and colors (float4). GPU implementations varied among manufacturers, many opting to embed a small constant memory block within the geometry engine. But this wasn’t the only way to do it. In the OpenGL API each shader had its own persistent uniforms. This design enabled the driver to embed constants directly in the shader's instruction stream, an API peculiarity that still persists in OpenGL 4.6 and ES 3.2 today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPUs back then didn’t have generic read &amp;amp; write caches. Rasterizer had screen local cache for blending and depth buffering and texture samplers leaned on linearly interpolated vertex UVs for data prefetching. When shaders were introduced in DirectX 8 shader model 1.0 (SM 1.0), the pixel shader stage didn’t support calculating texture UVs. UVs were calculated at vertex granularity, interpolated by the hardware and passed directly to the texture samplers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DirectX 9 brought a substantial increase in shader instruction limits, but shader model 2.0 didn’t expose any new data paths. Both vertex and pixel shaders still operated as 1:1 input:output machines, allowing users to only customize the transform math of the vertex position and attributes and the pixel color. Programmable load and store were not supported. The fixed-function input blocks persisted: vertex fetch, uniform (constant) memory and texture sampler. Vertex shader was a separate execution unit. It gained new features like the ability to index constants (limited to float4 arrays) but still lacked texture sampling support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DirectX 9 shader model 3.0 increased the instruction limit to 65536 making it difficult for humans to write and maintain shader assembly anymore. Higher level shading languages were born: HLSL (2002) and GLSL (2002-2004). These languages adapted the 1:1 elementwise transform design. Each shader invocation operated on a single data element: vertex or pixel. Framework-style shader design heavily affected the graphics API design in the following years. It was a nice way to abstract hardware differences back in the day, but is showing scaling pains today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DirectX 11 was a significant shift in the data model, introducing support for compute shaders, generic read-write buffers and indirect drawing. The GPU could now fully feed itself. The inclusion of generic buffers enabled shader programs to access and modify programmable memory locations, which forced hardware vendors to implement generic cache hierarchies. Shaders evolved beyond simple 1:1 data transformations, marking the end of specialized, hardcoded data paths. GPU hardware started to shift towards a generic SIMD design. SIMD units were now executing all the different shader types: vertex, pixel, geometry, hull, domain and compute. Today the framework has 16 different shader entry points. This adds a lot of API surface and makes composition difficult. As a result GLSL and HLSL still don’t have a flourishing library ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DirectX 11 featured a whole zoo of buffer types, each designed to accommodate specific hardware data path peculiarities: typed SRV &amp;amp; UAV, byte address SRV &amp;amp; UAV, structured SRV &amp;amp; UAV, append &amp;amp; consume (with counter), constant, vertex, and index buffers. Like textures, buffers in DirectX utilize an opaque descriptor. Descriptors are hardware specific (commonly 128-256 bit) data blobs encoding the size, format, properties and data address of the resource in GPU memory. DirectX 11 GPUs leveraged their texture samplers for buffer load (gather) operations. This was natural since the sampler already had a type conversion hardware and a small read-only data cache. Typed buffers supported the same formats as textures, and DirectX used the same SRV (shader resource view) abstraction for both textures and buffers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of opaque buffer descriptors meant that the buffer format was not known at shader compile time. This was fine for read-only buffers as they were handled by the texture sampler. Read-write buffer (UAV in DirectX) was initially limited to 32-bit and 128-bit (vec4) types. Subsequent API and hardware revisions gradually addressed typed UAV load limitations, but the core issues persisted: a descriptor requires an indirection (contains a pointer), compiler optimizations are limited (data type is known only at runtime), format conversion hardware introduces latency (vs raw L1$ load), expand at load reserves registers for longer time (vs expand at use), descriptor management adds CPU driver complexity, and the API is complex (ten different buffer types).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In DirectX 11 the structured buffers were the only buffer type allowing an user defined struct type. All other buffer types represented a homogeneous array of simple scalar/vector elements. Unfortunately, structured buffers were not layout compatible with other buffer types. Users were not allowed to have structured buffer views to typed buffers, byte address buffers, or vertex/index buffers. The reason was that structured buffers had special AoSoA swizzle optimization under the hood, which was important for older vec4 architectures. This hardware specific optimization limited the structured buffer usability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DirectX 12 made all buffers linear in memory, making them compatible with each other. SM 6.2 also added load&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; syntactic sugar for the byte address buffer, allowing clean struct loading syntax from arbitrary offset. All the old buffer types are still supported for backwards compatibility reasons and all the buffers still use opaque descriptors. HLSL is still missing support for 64-bit GPU pointers. In contrast, the Nvidia CUDA computing platform (2007) fully leaned on 64-bit pointers, but its popularity was initially limited to academic use. Today it is the leading AI platform and is heavily affecting the hardware design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support for 16-bit registers and 16-bit math was disorganized when DirectX 12 launched. Microsoft initially made a questionable decision to not backport DirectX 12 to Windows 7. Shader binaries targeting Windows 8 supported 16-bit types, but most gamers continued using Windows 7. Developers didn’t want to ship two sets of shaders. OpenGL lowp/mediump specification was also messy. Bit depths were not properly standardized. Mediump was a popular optimization in mobile games, but most PC drivers ignored it, making game developer’s life miserable. AAA games mostly ignored 16-bit math until PS4 Pro launched in 2016 with double rate fp16 support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the rise of AI, ray-tracing, and GPU-driven rendering, GPU vendors started focusing on optimizing their raw data load paths and providing larger and faster generic caches. Routing loads though the texture sampler (type conversion) added too much latency, as dependent load chains are common in modern shaders. Hardware got native support for narrow 8-bit, 16-bit, and 64-bit types and pointers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most vendors ditched their fixed function vertex fetch hardware, emitting standard raw load instructions in the vertex shader instead. Fully programmable vertex fetch allowed developers to write new algorithms such as clustered GPU-driven rendering. Fixed function hardware transistor budget could be used elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mesh shaders represent the culmination of rasterizer evolution, eliminating the need for index deduplication hardware and post-transform caches. In this paradigm, all inputs are treated as raw memory. The user is responsible for dividing the mesh into self-contained meshlets that internally share vertices. This process is often done offline. The GPU no longer needs to do parallel index deduplication for each draw call, saving power and transistors. Given that gaming accounts for only 10% of Nvidia's revenue today, while AI represents 90% and ray-tracing continues to grow, it is likely only a matter of time before the fixed function geometry hardware is stripped to bare minimum and drivers automatically convert vertex shaders to mesh shaders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mobile GPUs are tile-based renderers. Tilers bin the individual triangles to small tiles (commonly between 16x16 to 64x64 pixels) . Mesh shaders are too coarse grained for this purpose. Binning meshlets to tiny tiles would cause significant geometry overshading. There’s no clear convergence path. We still need to support the vertex shader path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;10 years ago when DirectX 12.0, Vulkan 1.0 and Metal 1.0 arrived, the existing GPU hardware didn’t widely support bindless resources. APIs adapted complex binding models to abstract the hardware differences. DirectX allowed indexing up to 128 resources per stage, Vulkan and Metal didn’t initially support descriptor indexing at all. Developers had to continue using traditional workarounds to reduce the bindings change overhead, such as packing textures into atlases and merging meshes together. The GPU hardware has evolved significantly during the past decade and converged to generic bindless SIMD design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s investigate how much simpler the graphics API and the shader language would become if we designed them solely for modern bindless hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Modern GPU memory management&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start our journey discussing memory management. Legacy graphics APIs abstracted the GPU memory management completely. Abstraction was necessary, as old GPUs had split memories and/or special data paths with various cache coherency concerns. When DirectX 12 and Vulkan arrived 10 years ago, the GPU hardware had matured enough to expose placement heaps to the user. Consoles had already exposed memory for a few generations and developers requested similar flexibility for PC and mobile. Apple introduced placement heaps 4 years after Vulkan and DirectX 12 in Metal 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern APIs require the user to enumerate the heap types to find out what kind of memory the GPU driver has to offer. It’s a good practice to preallocate memory in big chunks and suballocate it using a user-land allocator. However, there’s a design flaw in Vulkan: You have to create your texture/buffer object first. Then you can ask which heap types are compatible with the new resource. This forces the user into a lazy allocation pattern, which can cause performance hitches and memory spikes at runtime. This also makes it difficult to wrap a GPU memory allocation into a cross-platform library. AMD VMA, for example, creates both the Vulkan-specific buffer/texture object in addition to allocating memory. We want to fully separate these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today the CPU has full visibility into the GPU memory. Integrated GPUs have UMA, and modern discrete GPUs have PCIe Resizable BAR. The whole GPU heap can be mapped. Vulkan heap API naturally supports CPU mapped GPU heaps. DirectX 12 got support in 2023 (HEAP_TYPE_GPU_UPLOAD).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CUDA has a simple design for GPU memory allocation: The GPU malloc API takes the size as input and returns a mapped CPU pointer. The GPU free API frees the memory. CUDA doesn’t support CPU mapped GPU memory. The GPU reads the CPU memory though the PCIe bus. CUDA also supports GPU memory allocations, but they can’t be directly written by the CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We combine CUDA malloc design with CPU mapped GPU memory (UMA/ReBAR). It's the best of both worlds: The data is fast for the CPU to write and fast for the GPU to read, yet we maintain the clean, easy to use design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Allocate GPU memory for array of 1024 uint32
uint32* numbers = gpuMalloc(1024 * sizeof(uint32));

// Directly initialize (CPU mapped GPU pointer)
for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 1024; i++) numbers[i] = random();

gpuFree(numbers);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Default gpuMalloc alignment is 16 bytes (vec4 alignment). If you need wider alignment use gpuMalloc(size, alignment) overload. My example code uses gpuMalloc&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; wrapper, doing gpuMalloc(elements * sizeof(T), alignof(T)).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing data directly into GPU memory is optimal for small data like draw arguments, uniforms and descriptors. For large persistent data, we still want to perform a copy operation. GPUs store textures in a swizzled layout similar to Morton-order to improve cache locality. DirectX 11.3 and 12 tried to standardize the swizzle layout, but couldn’t get all GPU manufacturers onboard. The common way to perform texture swizzling is to use a driver provided copy command. The copy command reads linear texture data from a CPU mapped “upload” heap and writes to a swizzled layout in a private GPU heap. Every modern GPU also has lossless delta color compression (DCC). Modern GPUs copy engines are capable of DCC compression and decompression. DCC and Morton swizzle are the main reasons we want to copy textures into a private GPU heap. Recently, GPUs have also added generic lossless memory compression for buffer data. If the memory heap is CPU mapped, the GPU can’t enable vendor specific lossless compression, as the CPU wouldn’t know how to read or write it. A copy command must be used to compress the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need a memory type parameter in the GPU malloc function to add support for private GPU memory. The standard memory type should be CPU mapped GPU memory (write combined CPU access). It is fast for the GPU to read, and the CPU can directly write to it just like it was a CPU memory pointer. GPU-only memory is used for textures and big GPU-only buffers. The CPU can’t directly write to these GPU pointers. The user writes the data to CPU mapped GPU memory first and then issues a copy command, which transforms the data to optimal compressed format. Modern texture samplers and display engines can read compressed GPU data directly, so there’s no need for subsequent data layout transforms (see chapter: Modern barriers). The uploaded data is ready to use immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have two types of GPU pointers, a CPU mapped virtual address and a GPU virtual address. The GPU can only dereference GPU addresses. All pointers in GPU data structures must use GPU addresses. CPU mapped addresses are only used for CPU writes. CUDA has an API to transform a CPU mapped address to a GPU address (cudaHostGetDevicePointer). Metal 4 buffer object has two getters: .contents (CPU mapped address) and .gpuAddress (GPU address). Since the gpuMalloc API returns a pointer, not a managed object handle (like Metal), we choose the CUDA approach (gpuHostToDevicePointer). This API call is not free. The driver likely implements it using a hash map (if other than base addresses need to be translated, we need a tree). Preferably we call the address translation once per allocation and cache in a user land struct (void *cpu, void *gpu). This is the approach my userland GPUBumpAllocator uses (see appendix for full implementation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Load a mesh using a 3rd party library
auto mesh = createMesh("mesh.obj");
auto upload = uploadBumpAllocator.allocate(mesh.byteSize); // Custom bump allocator (wraps a gpuMalloc ptr)
mesh.load(upload.cpu);

// Allocate GPU-only memory and copy into it
void* meshGpu = gpuMalloc(mesh.byteSize, MEMORY_GPU);
gpuMemCpy(commandBuffer, meshGpu, upload.gpu);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulkan recently got a new extension called VK_EXT_host_image_copy. The driver implements a direct CPU to GPU image copy operation, performing the hardware specific texture swizzle on CPU. This extension is currently only available on UMA architectures, but there’s no technical reason why it’s not available on PCIe ReBAR as well. Unfortunately this API doesn’t support DCC. It would be too expensive to perform DCC compression on the CPU. The extension is mainly useful for block compressed textures, as they don’t require DCC. It can’t universally replace hardware copy to GPU private memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s also a need for a third memory type, CPU-cached, for readback purposes. This memory type is slower for the GPU to write due to cache coherency with the CPU. Games only use readback seldomly. Common use cases are screenshots and virtual texturing readback. GPGPU algorithms such as AI training and inference lean on efficient communication between the CPU and the GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we mix the simplicity of CUDA malloc with CPU-mapped GPU memory we get a flexible and fast GPU memory allocation system with minimal API surface. This is an excellent starting point for a minimalistic modern graphics API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Modern data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CUDA, Metal and OpenCL leverage C/C++ shader languages featuring 64-bit pointer semantics. These languages support loading and storing of structs from/to any appropriately aligned GPU memory location. The compiler handles behind-the-scenes optimizations, including wide loads (combine), register mappings, and bit extractions. Many modern GPUs offer free instruction modifiers for extracting 8/16-bit portions of a register, allowing the compiler to pack 8-bit and 16-bit values into a single register. This keeps the shader code clean and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you load a struct of eight 32-bit values, the compiler will most likely emit two 128-bit wide loads (each filling 4 registers), a 4x reduction in load instruction count. Wide loads are significantly faster, especially if the struct contains narrow 8 and 16-bit fields. GPUs are ALU dense and have big register files, but compared to CPUs their memory paths are relatively slow. A CPU often has two load ports each doing a load per cycle. On a modern GPU we can achieve one SIMD load per 4 cycles. Wide load + unpack in the shader is often the most efficient way to handle data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compact 8-16 bit data has been traditionally stored in texel buffers (Buffer&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;) in DirectX games. Modern GPUs are optimized for compute workloads. Raw buffer load instructions nowadays have up to 2x higher throughput and up to 3x lower latency than texel buffers. Texel buffers are no longer the optimal choice on modern GPUs. Texel buffers do not support structured data, the user is forced to split their data into SoA layout in multiple texel buffers. Each texel buffer has its own descriptor, which must be loaded before the data can be accessed. This consumes resources (SGPRs, descriptor cache slots) and adds startup latency compared to using a single 64-bit raw pointer. SoA data layout also results in significantly more cache misses for non-linear index lookups (examples: material, texture, triangle, instance, bone id). Texel buffers offer free conversion of normalized ([0,1] and [-1,1]) types to floating point registers. It’s true that there’s no ALU cost, but you lose wide load support (combine loads) and the instruction goes through the slow texture sampler hardware path. Narrow texel buffer loads also add register bloat. RGBA8_UNORM load to vec4 allocates four vector registers immediately. The sampler hardware will eventually write the value to these registers. Compilers try to maximize the distance of load→use by moving load instructions in the beginning of the shader. This hides the load latency by ALU and allows overlapping multiple loads. If we instead use wide raw loads, our uint8x4 data consumes just a single 32-bit register. We unpack the 8-bit channels on use. The register life time is much shorter. Modern GPUs can directly access 16-bit low/high halves of registers without unpack, and some can even do 8-bit (AMD SDWA modifier). Packed double rate math makes 2x16 bit conversion instructions faster. Some GPU architectures (Nvidia, AMD) can also do 64-bit pointer raw loads directly from VRAM into groupshared memory, further reducing the register bloat needed for latency hiding. By using 64-bit pointers, game engines benefit from AI hardware optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pointer based systems make memory alignment explicit. When you are allocating a buffer object in DirectX or Vulkan, you need to query the API for alignment. Buffer bind offsets must also be properly aligned. Vulkan has an API for querying the bind offset alignment and DirectX has fixed alignment rules. Alignment contract allows the low level shader compiler to emit optimal code (such as aligned 4x32-byte wide loads). The DirectX ByteAddressBuffer abstraction has a design flaw: load2, load3 and load4 instructions only require 4-byte alignment. The new SM 6.2 load&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; also only requires elementwise alignment (half4 = 2, float4 = 4). Some GPU vendors (like Nvidia) have to split ByteAddressBuffer.load4 into four individual load instructions. The buffer abstraction can’t always shield the user from bad codegen. It makes bad codegen hard to fix. C/C++ based languages (CUDA, Metal) allow the user to explicitly declare struct alignment with the alignas attribute. We use alignas(16) in all our example code root structs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, GPU writes are only visible to the threads inside the same thread group (= inside a compute unit). This allows non-coherent L1$ design. Visibility is commonly provided by barriers. If the user needs memory visibility between the groups in a single dispatch, they decorate the buffer binding with the [globallycoherent] attribute. The shader compiler emits coherent load/store instructions for accesses of that buffer. Since we use 64-bit pointers instead of buffer objects, we offer explicit coherent load/store instructions. The syntax is similar to atomic load/store. Similarly we can provide non-temporal load/store instructions that bypass the whole cache hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulkan supports 64-bit pointers using the (2019) VK_KHR_buffer_device_address extension (https://docs.vulkan.org/samples/latest/samples/extensions/buffer_device_address/README.html). Buffer device address extension is widely supported by all GPU vendors (including mobile), but is not a part of core Vulkan 1.4. The main issue with BDA is lack of pointer support in the GLSL and the HLSL shader languages. The user has to use raw 64-bit integers instead. A 64-bit integer can be cast to a struct. Structs are defined with custom BDA syntax. Array indexing requires declaring an extra BDA struct type with an array in it, if the user wants the compiler to generate the index addressing math. Debugging support is currently limited. Usability matters a lot and BDA will remain a niche until HLSL and GLSL support pointers natively. This is a stark contrast to CUDA, OpenCL and Metal, where native pointer support is a language core pillar and debugging works flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DirectX 12 has no support for pointers in shaders. As a consequence, HLSL doesn’t allow passing arrays as function parameters. Simple things like having a material array inside UBO/SSBO requires hacking around with macros. It’s impossible to make reusable functions for reductions (prefix sum, sort, etc), since groupshared memory arrays can’t be passed between functions. You could of course declare a separate global array for each utility header/library, but the compiler will allocate groupshared memory for each of them separately, reducing occupancy. There’s no easy way to alias groupshared memory. GLSL has identical issues. Pointer based languages like CUDA and Metal MSL don’t have such issues with arrays. CUDA has a vast ecosystem of 3rd party libraries, and this ecosystem makes Nvidia the most valued company on the planet. Graphics shading languages need to evolve to meet modern standards. We need a library ecosystem too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will be using a C/C++ style shading language similar to CUDA and Metal MSL in my examples, with some HLSL-style system value (SV) semantics mixed in for the graphics specific bits and pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Root arguments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operating system threading APIs commonly provide a single 64-bit void pointer to the thread function. The operating system doesn’t care about the user’s data input layout. Let’s apply the same ideology to the GPU kernel data inputs. The shader kernel receives a single 64-bit pointer, which we cast to our desired struct (by the kernel function signature). Developers can use the same shared C/C++ header in both CPU and GPU side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Common header...
struct alignas(16) Data
{
    // Uniform data
    float16x4 color; // 16-bit float vector
    uint16x2 offset; // 16-bit integer vector
    const uint8* lut; // pointer to 8-bit data array

    // Pointers to in/out data arrays
    const uint32* input;
    uint32* output;
};

// CPU code...
gpuSetPipeline(commandBuffer, computePipeline);

auto data = myBumpAllocator.allocate&amp;lt;Data&amp;gt;(); // Custom bump allocator (wraps gpuMalloc ptr, see appendix)
data.cpu-&amp;gt;color = {1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f};
data.cpu-&amp;gt;offset = {16, 0};
data.cpu-&amp;gt;lut = luts.gpu + 64; // GPU pointers support pointer math (no need for offset API)
data.cpu-&amp;gt;input = input.gpu;
data.cpu-&amp;gt;output = output.gpu;

gpuDispatch(commandBuffer, data.gpu, uvec3(128, 1, 1));

// GPU kernel...
[groupsize = (64, 1, 1)]
void main(uint32x3 threadId : SV_ThreadID, const Data* data)
{
    uint32 value = data-&amp;gt;input[threadId.x]; 
    // TODO: Code using color, offset, lut, etc...
    data-&amp;gt;output[threadId.x] = value;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the example code we use a simple linear bump allocator (myBumpAllocator) for allocating GPU arguments (see appendix for implementation). It returns a struct {void* cpu, void *gpu}. The CPU pointer is used for writing directly to persistently mapped GPU memory and the GPU pointer can be stored to GPU data structures or passed as dispatch command argument.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most GPUs preload root uniforms (including 64-bit pointers) into constant or scalar registers just before launching a wave. This optimization remains viable: the draw/dispatch command carries the base data pointer. All the input uniforms (including pointers to other data) are found at small fixed offsets from the base pointer. Since shaders are pre-compiled and further optimized into device-specific microcode during the PSO creation, drivers have ample opportunity to set up register preloading and similar root data optimizations. Users should put the most important data in the beginning of the root struct as root data size is limited in some architectures. Our root struct has no hard size limit. The shader compiler will emit standard (scalar/uniform) memory loads for the remaining fields. The root data pointer provided to the shader is const. Shader can’t modify the root input data, as it might be still used by the command processor for preloading data to new waves. Output is done through non-const pointers (see Data::output in above example). By forcing the root data to be const, we also allow GPU drivers to perform their special uniform data path optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do we need a special uniform buffer type? Modern shader compilers perform automatic uniformity analysis. If all inputs to an instruction are uniform, the output is also uniform. Uniformity propagates over the shader. All modern architectures have scalar registers/loads or a similar construct (SIMD1 on Intel). Uniformity analysis is used to convert vector loads into scalar loads, which saves registers and reduces latency. Uniformity analysis doesn’t care about the buffer type (UBO vs SSBO). The resource must be readonly (this is why you should always decorate SSBO with readonly attribute in GLSL or prefer SRV over UAV in DirectX 12). The compiler also needs to be able to prove that the pointer is not aliased. The C/C++ const keyword means that data can’t be modified though this pointer, it doesn’t guarantee that other read-write pointers might alias the same memory region. C99 added the restrict keyword for this purpose and CUDA kernels use it frequently. Root pointers in Metal are no-alias (restrict) by default, and so are buffer objects in Vulkan and DirectX 12. We should adopt the same convention to give the compiler more freedom to do optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shader compiler is not always able to prove address uniformity at compile time. Modern GPUs opportunistically optimize dynamic uniform address loads. If the memory controller detects that all lanes of a vector load instruction have a uniform address, it emits a single lane load instead of a SIMD wide gather. The result is replicated to all lanes. This optimization is transparent, and doesn’t affect shader code generation or register allocation. Dynamically uniform data is a much smaller performance hit than it used to be in the past, especially when combined with the new fast raw load paths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some GPU vendors (ARM Mali and Qualcomm Adreno) take the uniformity analysis a step further. The shader compiler extracts uniform loads and uniform math. A scalar preamble runs before the shader. Uniform memory loads and math is executed once for the whole draw/dispatch and the results are stored in special hardware constant registers (the same registers used by root constants).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the above optimizations together provide a better way of handling uniform data than the classic 16KB/64KB uniform/constant buffer abstraction. Many GPUs still have special uniform registers for root constants, system values and the preamble (see above paragraph).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Texture bindings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideally, texture descriptors would behave like any other data in GPU memory, allowing them to be freely mixed in structs with other data. However, this level of flexibility isn't universally supported by all modern GPUs. Fortunately bindless texture sampler designs have converged over the last decade, with only two primary methods remaining: 256-bit raw descriptors and the indexed descriptor heap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMDs raw descriptor method loads 256-bit descriptors directly from GPU memory into the compute unit’s scalar registers. Eight subsequent 32-bit scalar registers contain a single descriptor. During the SIMD texture sample instruction, the shader core sends a 256-bit texture descriptor and per-lane UVs to the sampler unit. This provides the sampler all the data it needs to address and load texels without any indirections. The drawback is that the 256-bit descriptor takes a lot of register space and needs to be resent to the sampler for each sample instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The indexed descriptor heap approach uses 32-bit indices (20 bits for old Intel iGPUs). 32-bit indices are trivial to store in structs, load into standard SIMD registers and efficient to pass around. During a SIMD sample instruction, the shader core sends the texture index and the per-lane UVs to the sampler unit. The sampler fetches the descriptor from the descriptor heap: heap base address + texture index * stride (256-bits in modern GPUs). The texture heap base address is either abstracted by the driver (Vulkan and Metal) or provided by the user (SetDescriptorHeaps in DirectX 12). Changing the texture heap base address may result in an internal pipeline barrier (on older hardware). On modern GPUs the texture heap 64-bit base address is often part of each sample instruction data, allowing sampling from multiple heaps seamlessly (64-bit base + 32-bit offset per lane). The sampler unit has a tiny internal descriptor cache to avoid indirect reads after the first access. Descriptor caches must be invalidated whenever the descriptor heap is modified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few years ago it looked like AMDs scalar register based texture descriptors were the winning formula in the long run. Scalar registers are more flexible than a descriptor heap, allowing descriptors to be embedded inside GPU data structures directly. But there’s a downside. Modern GPU workloads such as ray-tracing and deferred texturing (Nanite) lean on non-uniform texture indices. The texture heap index is not uniform over a SIMD wave. A 32-bit heap index is just 4 bytes, we can send it per lane. In contrast, a 256-bit descriptor is 32 bytes. It is not feasible to fetch and send a full 256-bit descriptor per lane. Modern Nvidia, Apple and Qualcomm GPUs support per-lane descriptor index mode in their sample instructions, making the non-uniform case more efficient. The sampler unit performs an internal loop if required. Inputs/outputs to/from sampler units are sent once, regardless of the heap index coherence. AMDs scalar register based descriptor architecture requires the shader compiler to generate a scalarization loop around the texture sample instruction. This costs extra ALU cycles and requires sending and receiving (partially masked) sampler data multiple times. It’s one of the reasons why Nvidia is faster in ray-tracing than AMD. ARM and Intel use 32-bit heap indices too (like Nvidia, Qualcomm and Apple), but their latest architectures don’t yet have a per-lane heap index mode. They emit a similar scalarization loop as AMD for the non-uniform index case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of these differences can be wrapped under an unified texture descriptor heap abstraction. The de-facto texture descriptor size is 256 bits (192 bits on Apple for a separate texture descriptor, sampler is the remaining 32 bits). The texture heap can be presented as a homogeneous array of 256-bit descriptor blobs. Indexing is trivial. DirectX 12 shader model 6.6 provides a texture heap abstraction like this, but doesn’t allow direct CPU or compute shader write access to the descriptor heap memory. A set of APIs are used for creating descriptors and copying descriptors from the CPU to the GPU. The GPU is not allowed to write the descriptors. Today, we can remove this API abstraction completely by allowing direct CPU and GPU write to the descriptor heap. All we need is a simple (user-land) driver helper function for creating a 256-bit (uint64[4]) hardware specific descriptor blob. Modern GPUs have UMA or PCIe ReBAR. The CPU can directly write descriptor blobs into GPU memory. Users can also use compute shaders to copy or generate descriptors. The shader language has a descriptor creation intrinsic too. It returns a hardware specific uint64x4 descriptor blob (analogous to the CPU API). This approach cuts the API complexity drastically and is both faster and more flexible than the DirectX 12 descriptor update model. Vulkan’s VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer (https://www.khronos.org/blog/vk-ext-descriptor-buffer) extension (2022) is similar to my proposal, allowing direct CPU and GPU write. It is supported by most vendors, but unfortunately is not part of the Vulkan 1.4 core spec.&lt;/p&gt;

auto pngImage = pngLoad("cat.png");

pngImage.load(uploadMemory.cpu);

// Allocate GPU memory for our texture (optimal layout with metadata)

void *texturePtr = gpuMalloc(textureSizeAlign.size, textureSizeAlign.align, MEMORY_GPU);
GpuTexture texture = gpuCreateTexture(textureDesc, texturePtr);

    &lt;p&gt;It is almost possible to get rid of the CPU side texture object (GpuTexture) completely. Unfortunately the triangle rasterizer units of all modern GPUs are not yet bindless. The CPU driver needs to prepare command packets to bind render targets, depth-stencil buffers, clear and resolve. These APIs don’t use the 256-bit GPU texture descriptor. We need driver specific extra CPU data (stored in the GpuTexture object).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simplest way to reference a texture in a shader is to use a 32-bit index. A single index can also represent the starting offset of a range of descriptors. This offers a straightforward way to implement the DirectX 12 descriptor table abstraction and the Vulkan descriptor set abstraction without an API. We also get an elegant solution to the fast material switch use case: All we need is a single 64-bit GPU pointer, pointing to a material data struct (containing material properties + 32-bit texture heap start index). Vulkan vkCmdBindDescriptorSets and DirectX 12 SetGraphicsRootDescriptorTable are relatively fast API calls, but they are nowhere as fast as writing a single 64-bit pointer to persistently mapped GPU memory. A lot of complexity is removed by not needing to create, update and delete resource binding API objects. CPU time is also saved as the user no longer needs to maintain a hash map of descriptor sets, a common approach to solve the immediate vs retained mode discrepancy in game engines.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Metal 4 manages the texture descriptor heap automatically. Texture objects have .gpuResourceID, which is a 64-bit heap index (Xcode GPU debugger reveals small values such as 0x3). You can directly write texture IDs into GPU structs, as you would use texture indices in DirectX SM 6.6 and Vulkan (descriptor buffer extension). As the heap management in Metal is automatic, users can’t allocate texture descriptors in contiguous ranges. It’s a common practice to store a 32-bit index to the first texture in the range and calculate the indices for other textures in the set (see above code example). Metal doesn’t support this. The user has to write a 64-bit texture handle for each texture separately. To address a set of 5 textures, you need 40 bytes in Metal (5 * 64-bit). Vulkan and DirectX 12 only need 4 bytes (1 * 32-bit). Apple GPU hardware is able to implement SM 6.6 texture heaps. The limitation is the Metal API (software).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Texel buffers can be still supported for backwards compatibility. DirectX 12 stores texel buffer descriptors in the same heap with texture descriptors. A texel buffer functions similarly to a 1d texture (unfiltered tfetch path). Since texel buffers would be mainly used for backwards compatibility, driver vendors wouldn’t need to jump over the hoops to replace them with faster code paths such as raw memory loads behind the scenes. I am not a big fan of driver background threads and shader replacements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Non-uniform texture index needs to use NonUniformResourceIndex notation similar to GLSL and HLSL. This tells the low level GPU shader compiler to emit a special texture instruction with per-lane heap index, or a scalarization loop for GPUs that only support uniform descriptors. Since buffers are not descriptors, we never need NonUniformResourceIndex for buffers. We simply pass a 64-bit pointer per lane. It works on all modern GPUs. No scalarization loop, no mess. Additionally, the language should natively support ptr[index] notation for memory loads, where the index is 32-bits. Some GPUs support raw memory load instructions with 32-bit per lane offset. It reduces the register pressure. Feedback to GPU vendors: Please add the missing 64-bit shared base + 32-bit per lane offset raw load instruction and 16-bit uv(w) texture load instructions, if your architecture is still missing them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Modern bindless texturing lets us remove all texture binding APIs. A global indexable texture heap makes all textures visible to all shaders. Texture data still needs to be loaded into GPU memory by copy commands (to enable DCC and Morton swizzle). Texture descriptor creation still needs a thin GPU specific user land API. The texture heap can be exposed directly to both the CPU and the GPU as a raw GPU memory array, removing most of the texture heap API complexity compared to DirectX 12 SM 6.6.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Shader pipelines&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since our shader root data is just a single 64-bit pointer and our textures are just 32-bit indices, the shader pipeline creation becomes dead simple. There’s no need to define texture bindings, buffer bindings, bind groups (descriptor sets, argument buffers) or the root signature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;auto shaderIR = loadFile("computeShader.ir");
GpuPipeline computePipeline = gpuCreateComputePipeline(shaderIR);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DirectX 12 and Vulkan utilize complex APIs to bind and set up root signatures, push descriptors, push constants, and descriptor sets. A modern GPU driver essentially constructs a single struct into GPU memory and passes its pointer to the command processor. We have shown that such API complexity is unnecessary. The user simply writes the root struct into persistently mapped GPU memory and passes a 64-bit GPU pointer directly to the draw/dispatch function. Users can also include 64-bit pointers and 32-bit texture heap indices inside their structs to build any indirect data layout that fits their needs. Root bindings APIs and the whole DX12 buffer zoo can be replaced efficiently with 64-bit pointers. This simplifies the shader pipeline creation drastically. We don’t need to define the data layout at all. We successfully removed a massive chunk of API complexity while providing more flexibility to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Static constants&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulkan, Metal and WebGPU have a concept of static (specialization) constants, locked in at shader pipeline creation. The driver's internal shader compiler applies these constants as literals in the input shader IR and does constant propagation and dead code elimination pass afterward. This can be used to create multiple permutations of the same shader at pipeline creation, reducing the time and storage required for offline compiling all the shader permutations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulkan and Metal have a set of APIs and a special shader syntax for describing the shader specialization constants and their values. It would be nicer to simply provide a C struct that matches the constant struct defined in the shader side. That would require minimal API surface and would bring important improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulkan’s specialization constants have a design flaw. Specialization constants can’t modify the descriptor set layouts. Data inputs and outputs are fixed. The user could hack around the limitation by implementing an uber-layout containing all potential inputs/outputs and skip updating unused descriptors, but this is cumbersome and sub-optimal. Our proposed design doesn’t have the same problem. One can simply branch by a constant (the other side is dead code eliminated) and reinterpret the shader data input pointer as a different struct. One could also mimic the C++ inheritance data layout. Use a common layout for the beginning of the input struct and put specialized data at the end. Static polymorphism can be achieved cleanly. Runtime performance is identical to hand optimized shader. The specialization struct can also include GPU pointers, allowing the user to hardcode runtime memory locations, avoiding indirections. This has never been possible in a shader language before. Instead, the GPU vendors had to use background threads to analyze the shaders to do similar shader replacement optimizations at runtime, increasing the CPU cost and the driver complexity significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Common header...

    int32 qualityLevel;

    {
        // Dead code eliminated
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shader permutation hell is one of the biggest issues in modern graphics today. Gamers are complaining about stutter, devs are complaining about offline shader compilation taking hours. This new design gives the user added flexibility. They can toggle between static and dynamic behavior inside the shader, making it easy to have a generic fallback and specialization on demand. This design reduces the number of shader permutations and the runtime stalls caused by pipeline creation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Barriers and fences&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most hated feature in modern graphics APIs must be the barriers. Barriers serve two purposes: enforce producer-to-consumer execution dependencies and transition textures between layouts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many graphics programmers have an incorrect mental model about the GPU synchronization. A common belief is that GPU synchronization is based on fine-grained texture and buffer dependencies. In reality, modern GPU hardware doesn’t really care about individual resources. We spend lots of CPU cycles in userland preparing a list of individual resources and how their layouts change, but modern GPU drivers practically throw that list away. The abstraction doesn’t match reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern bindless architecture gives the GPU a lot of freedom. A shader can write to any 64-bit pointer or any texture in the global descriptor heap. The CPU doesn't know what decisions the GPU is going to make. How is it supposed to emit transition barriers for each affected resource? This is a clear mismatch between bindless architecture and classic CPU-driven rendering APIs today. Let’s investigate why the APIs were designed like this 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD GCN had a big influence on modern graphics API design. GCN was ahead of its time with async compute and bindless texturing (using scalar registers to store descriptors), but it also had crucial limitations in its delta color compression (DCC) and cache design. These limitations are a great example why the barrier model we have today is so complex. GCN didn’t have a coherent last-level cache. ROPs (raster operations = pixel shader outputs) had special non-coherent caches directly connected to the VRAM. The driver had to first flush the ROP caches to memory and then invalidate the L2$ to make pixel shader writes visible to shaders and samplers. The command processor also wasn’t a client of the L2$. Indirect arguments written in compute shaders weren’t visible to the command processor without invalidating the whole L2$ and flushing all dirty lines into VRAM. GCN 3 introduced delta color compression (DCC) for ROPs, but AMD’s texture samplers were not able to directly read DCC compressed textures or compressed depth buffers. The driver had to perform an internal decompress compute shader to eliminate the compression. The display engine could not read DCC compressed textures either. The common case of sampling a render target required two internal barriers and flushing all caches (wait for ROPs, flush ROP cache and L2$, run decompress compute shader, wait for compute).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD’s new RDNA architecture has several crucial improvements: It has a coherent L2$ covering all memory operations. ROPs and the command processor are clients of the L2$. The only non-coherent caches are the tiny L0$ and K$ (scalar cache) inside the compute units. A barrier now requires only flushing the outstanding writes in the tiny caches into the higher level cache. The driver no longer has to flush the last-level (L2) cache into the VRAM, making barriers significantly faster. RDNA’s improved display engine is capable of reading DCC compressed textures and a (de)compressor sits between the L2$ and the L0$ texture cache. There’s no need to decompress textures into VRAM before sampling, removing the need for texture layout transitions (compressed / uncompressed). All desktop and mobile GPU vendors have reached similar conclusions: Bandwidth is the bottleneck today. We should never waste bandwidth decoding resources into VRAM. Layout transitions are no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resource lists are the most annoying aspect of barriers in DirectX 12 and Vulkan. Users are expected to track the state of each resource individually, and tell the graphics API their previous and next state for each barrier. This was necessary on 10 year old GPUs as vendors hid various decompress commands under the barrier API. The barrier command functioned as the decompress command, so it had to know which resources required decompression. Today’s hardware doesn’t need texture layouts or decompress steps. Vulkan just got a new VK_KHR_unified_image_layouts (https://www.khronos.org/blog/so-long-image-layouts-simplifying-vulkan-synchronisation) extension (2025), removing the image layout transitions from the barrier command. But it still requires the user to list individual textures and buffers. Why is this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main reason is legacy API and tooling compatibility. People are used to thinking about resource dependencies and the existing Vulkan and DirectX 12 validation layers are designed that way. However, the barrier command executed by the GPU contains no information about textures or buffers at all. The resource list is consumed solely by the driver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our modern driver loops through your resource list and populates a set of flags. Drivers no longer need to worry about resource layouts or last level cache coherency, but there still exists tiny non-coherent caches that need flushing in special cases. Modern GPUs flush the majority of the non-coherent caches automatically in every barrier. For example the AMD L0$ and K$ (scalar cache) are always flushed, since every pass writes some outputs and these outputs live in some of these caches. Fine grained tracking of all write addresses would be too expensive. Tiny non-coherent caches tend to be inclusive. Modified lines get flushed to the next cache level. This is fast and doesn’t produce VRAM traffic. Some architectures have special caches that are not automatically flushed. Examples: descriptor caches in the texture samplers (see above chapter), rasterizer ROP caches and HiZ caches. The command processor commonly runs ahead to reduce the wave spawn latency. If we write indirect arguments in a shader, we need to inform the GPU to stall the command processor prefetcher to avoid a race. The GPU doesn’t actually know whether your compute shader was writing into an indirect argument buffer or not. In DirectX 12 the buffer is transitioned to D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_INDIRECT_ARGUMENT and in Vulkan the consumer dependency has a special stage VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_DRAW_INDIRECT_BIT. When a barrier has a resource transition like this or a stage dependency like this, the driver will include command processor prefetcher stall flag into the barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A modern barrier design replaces the resource list with a single bitfield describing what happens to these special non-coherent caches. Special cases include: Invalidate texture descriptors, invalidate draw arguments and invalidate depth caches. These flags are needed when we generate draw arguments, write to the descriptor heap or write to a depth buffer with a compute shader. Most barriers don’t need special cache invalidation flags.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some GPUs still need to decompress data in special cases. For example during a copy or a clear command (fast clear eliminate if clear color has changed). Copy and clear commands take the affected resource as a parameter. The driver can take necessary steps to decode the data if needed. We don’t need a resource list in our barrier for these special cases. Not all formats and usage flags support compression. The driver will keep the data uncompressed in these cases, instead of transitioning it back and forth, wasting bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A standard UAV barrier (compute → compute) is trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gpuBarrier(commandBuffer, STAGE_COMPUTE, STAGE_COMPUTE);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you write to the texture descriptor heap (uncommon), you need to add a special flag.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gpuBarrier(commandBuffer, STAGE_COMPUTE, STAGE_COMPUTE, HAZARD_DESCRIPTORS);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A barrier between rasterizer output and pixel shader is a common case for offscreen render target → sampling. Our example has dependency stages set up in a way that the barrier doesn’t block vertex shaders, allowing vertex shading (and tile binning on mobile GPUs) to overlap with previous passes. A barrier with raster output stage (or later) as the producer automatically flushes non-coherent ROP caches if the GPU architecture needs that. We don’t need an explicit flag for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gpuBarrier(commandBuffer, STAGE_RASTER_COLOR_OUT | STAGE_RASTER_DEPTH_OUT, STAGE_PIXEL_SHADER);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users only describe the queue execution dependencies: producer and consumer stage masks. There’s no need to track the individual texture and buffer resource states, removing a lot of complexity and saving a significant amount of CPU time versus the current DirectX 12 and Vulkan designs. Metal 2 has a modern barrier design already: it doesn’t use resource lists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many GPUs have custom scratchpads memories: Groupshared memory inside each compute unit, tile memory, large shared scratchpads like the Qualcomm GMEM. These memories are managed automatically by the driver. Temporary scratchpads like groupshared memory are never stored to memory. Tile memories are stored automatically by the tile rasterizer (store op == store). Uniform registers are read-only and pre-populated before each draw call. Scratchpads and uniform registers don’t have cache coherency protocols and don’t interact with the barriers directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern GPUs support a synchronization command that writes a value to memory when a shader stage is finished, and a command that waits for a value to appear in memory location before a shader stage is allowed to begin (wait includes optional cache flush semantics). This is equivalent to splitting the barrier into two: the producer and the consumer. DirectX 12 split barriers and Vulkan event→wait are examples of this design. Splitting the barrier into consumer→producer allows putting independent work between them, avoiding draining the GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulkan event→wait (and DX12 split barriers) see barely any use. The main reason is that normal barriers are already highly complicated, and developers want to avoid extra complexity. Driver support for split barriers also hasn’t been perfect in the past. Removing the resource lists simplifies the split barriers significantly. We can also make split barriers semantically similar to timeline semaphores: Signal command writes to a monotonically increasing 64-bit value (atomic max) and wait command waits for the value to be &amp;gt;= N (greater equal). The counter is just a GPU memory pointer, no persistent API object is required. This provides us with a significantly simpler event→wait API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gpuSignalAfter(commandBuffer, STAGE_RASTER_COLOR_OUT, gpuPtr, counter, SIGNAL_ATOMIC_MAX);
// Put independent work here
gpuWaitBefore(commandBuffer, STAGE_PIXEL_SHADER, gpuPtr, counter++, OP_GREATER_EQUAL);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This API is much simpler than the existing VkEvent API, yet offers improved flexibility. In the above example we implemented the timeline semaphore semantics, but we can implement other patterns too, such as waiting multiple producers using a bitmask: mark bits with SIGNAL_ATOMIC_OR and wait for all bits in a mask to be set (mask is an optional parameter in the gpuWaitBefore command).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPU→CPU synchronization was initially messy in Vulkan and Metal. Users needed a separate fence object for each submit. N buffering was a common technique for reusing the objects. This is a similar usability issue as discussed above regarding VkEvent. DirectX 12 was the first API to solve the GPU→CPU synchronization cleanly with timeline semaphores. Vulkan 1.2 and Metal 2 adapted the same design later. A timeline semaphore needs only a single 64-bit monotonically increasing counter. This reduces complexity over the older Vulkan and Metal fence APIs, which many engines still use today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT 2

GpuSemaphore frameSemaphore = gpuCreateSemaphore(0);
uint64 nextFrame = 1;

while (running)
{
    if (nextFrame &amp;gt; FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT) 
    {
        gpuWaitSemaphore(frameSemaphore, nextFrame - FRAMES_IN_FLIGHT);
    }
    
    // Render the frame here

    gpuSubmit(queue, {commandBuffer}, frameSemaphore, nextFrame++);
}

gpuDestroySemaphore(frameSemaphore);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our proposed barrier design is a massive improvement over DirectX 12 and Vulkan. It reduces the API complexity significantly. Users no longer need to track individual resources. Our simple hazard tracking has queue + stage granularity. This matches what GPU hardware does today. Game engine graphics backends can be simplified and CPU cycles are saved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Command buffers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulkan and DirectX 12 were designed to promote the pre-creation and reuse of resources. Early Vulkan examples recorded a single command buffer at startup, replaying it every frame. Developers quickly discovered that command buffer reuse was impractical. Real game environments are dynamic and the camera is in constant motion. The visible object set changes frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Game engines ignored prerecorded command buffers entirely. Metal and WebGPU feature transient command buffers, which are created just before recording and disappear after GPU has finished rendering. This eliminates the need for command buffer management and prevents multiple submissions of the same commands. GPU vendors recommend one shot command buffers (a resettable command pool per frame in flight) in Vulkan too, as it simplifies the driver’s internal memory management (bump allocator vs heap allocator). The best practices match Metal and WebGPU design. Persistent command buffer objects can be removed. That API complexity didn’t provide anything worth using.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;while (running)

    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start with a burning question: Do we need graphics shaders anymore? UE5 Nanite uses compute shaders to plot pixels using 64-bit atomics. High bits contain the pixel depth and low bits contain the payload. Atomic-min ensures that the closest surface remains. This technique was first presented at SIGGRAPH 2015 by Media Molecule Dreams (Alex Evans). Hardware rasterizer still has some advantages, like hierarchical/early depth-stencil tests. Nanite has to lean solely on coarse cluster culling, which results in extra overdraw with kitbashed content. Ubisoft (me and Ulrich Haar) presented this two-pass cluster culling algorithm at SIGGRAPH 2015. Ubisoft used cluster culling in combination with the hardware rasterizer for more fine grained culling. Today’s GPUs are bindless and much better suited for GPU-driven workloads like this. 10 years ago Ubisoft had to lean on virtual texturing (all textures in the same atlas) instead of bindless texturing. Despite many compute-only rasterizers today (Nanite, SDF sphere tracing, DDA voxel tracing) the hardware rasterizer still remains the most used technique for rendering triangles in games today. It’s definitely worth discussing how to make the rasterization pipeline more flexible and easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The modern shader framework has grown to 16 shader entry points. We have eight entry points for rasterization (pixel, vertex, geometry, hull, domain, patch constant, mesh and amplification), and six for ray-tracing (ray generation, miss, closest hit, any hit, intersection and callable). In comparison, CUDA has a single entry point: kernel. This makes CUDA composable. CUDA has a healthy ecosystem of 3rd party libraries. New GPU hardware blocks such as the tensor cores (AI) are exposed as intrinsic functions. This is how it all started in the graphics land as well: texture sampling was our first intrinsic function. Today, texture sampling is fully bindless and doesn’t even require driver setup. This is the design developers prefer. Simple, easy to compose, and extend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recently got more intrinsics: inline raytracing and cooperative matrix (wave matrix in DirectX 12, subgroup matrix in Metal). I am hoping that this is the new direction. We should start tearing down the massive 16 shader framework and replacing it with intrinsics that can be composed in a flexible way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solving the shader framework complexity is a massive topic. To keep the scope of this blog post in check, I will today only discuss compute shaders and raster pipelines. I am going to be writing a followup about simplifying the shader framework, including modern topics such as ray-tracing, shader execution reordering (SER), dynamic register allocation extensions and Apple’s new L1$ backed register file (called dynamic caching).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Raster pipelines&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two relevant raster pipelines today: Vertex+pixel and mesh+pixel. Mobile GPUs employing tile based deferred rendering (TBDR) perform per-triangle binning. Tile size is commonly between 16x16 to 64x64 pixels, making meshlets too coarse grained primitive for binning. Meshlet has no clear 1:1 lane to vertex mapping, there’s no straightforward way to run a partial mesh shader wave for selected triangles. This is the main reason mobile GPU vendors haven’t been keen to adapt the desktop centric mesh shader API designed by Nvidia and AMD. Vertex shaders are still important for mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will not be discussing geometry, hull, domain, and patch constant (tessellation) shaders. The graphics community widely considers these shader types as failed experiments. They all have crucial performance issues in their design. In all relevant use cases, you can run a compute prepass generating an index buffer to outperform these stages. Additionally, mesh shaders allow generating a compact 8-bit index buffer into on-chip memory, further increasing the performance gap over these legacy shader stages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our goal is to build a modern PSO abstraction with a minimal amount of baked state. One of the main critiques of Vulkan and DirectX 12 has been the pipeline permutation explosion. The less state we have inside the PSO, the less pipeline permutations we get. There are two main areas to improve: graphics shader data bindings and the rasterizer state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Graphics shader bindings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vertex+pixel shader pipeline needs several additional inputs compared to a compute kernel: vertex buffers, index buffer, rasterizer state, render target views and a depth-stencil view. Let’s start by discussing the shader visible data bindings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vertex buffer bindings are easy to solve: We simply remove them. Modern GPUs have fast raw load paths. Most GPU vendors have been emulating vertex fetch hardware already for several generations. Their low level shader compiler reads the user defined vertex layout and emits appropriate raw load instructions in the beginning of the vertex shader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vertex bindings declaration is another example of a special C/C++ API for defining a struct memory layout. It adds complexity and forces compiling multiple PSO permutations for different layouts. We simply replace the vertex buffers with standard C/C++ structs. No API is required.&lt;/p&gt;

    // TODO: Normal transform here
    return { .position = position, .normal = normal, .uv = vertex.uv };
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same is true for per-instance data and multiple vertex streams. We can implement them efficiently with raw memory loads. When we use raw load instructions, we can dynamically adjust the vertex stride, branch over secondary vertex buffer loads and calculate our vertex indices using custom formulas to implement clustered GPU-driven rendering, particle quad expansion, higher order surfaces, efficient terrain rendering and many other algorithms. Additional shader entry points and binding APIs are not needed. We can use our new static constant system to dead code eliminate vertex streams at pipeline creation or provide a static vertex stride if we so prefer. All the old optimization strategies still exist, but we can now mix and match techniques freely to match our renderer’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;

    float32x4 position = matrix * vertexPosition.position;

    // TODO: Normal transform here

    return { .position = position, .normal = normal, .uv = vertexAttributes.uv };
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The index buffer binding is still special. GPUs have index deduplication hardware. We don’t want to run the vertex shader twice for the same vertex. The index deduplication hardware packs the vertex waves eliminating duplicate vertices. Index buffering is still a crucial optimization today. Non-indexed geometry executes 3 vertex shader invocations (lanes) per triangle. A perfect grid has two triangles per cell, thus it only needs one vertex shader invocation per two triangles (ignoring the last row/column). Modern offline vertex cache optimizers output meshes with around 0.7 vertices per triangle efficiency. We can achieve around 4x to 6x reduction in vertex shading cost with index buffer in real world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The index buffer hardware nowadays connects to the same cache hierarchy as all the other GPU units. Index buffer is simply an extra GPU pointer in the drawIndexed call. That’s the sole API surface we need for index buffering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mesh shaders lean on offline vertex deduplication. A common implementation shades one vertex per lane, and outputs it into on-chip memory. An 8-bit local index buffer tells the rasterizer which 3 vertices are used by each triangle. Since all the meshlet outputs are available at once and are already transformed in on-chip storage, there’s no need to deduplicate or pack vertices after triangle setup. This is why mesh shaders don’t need the index deduplication hardware or the post transform cache. All mesh shader inputs are raw data. No extra API surface is needed beyond the gpuDrawMeshlets command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My example mesh shader uses 128 lane thread groups. Nvidia supports up to 126 vertices and 64 triangles per output meshlet. AMD supports 256 vertices and 128 triangles. The shader masks out excess lanes. Since there’s never more than 64 triangles, you might also opt for a 64 lane thread group for optimal triangle lane utilization and do a two iteration loop for vertex shading. My triangle fetch logic is just a single memory load instruction, wasting half of the lanes there isn’t a problem. I chose the extra parallelism for vertex shading instead. Optimal choices depend on your workload and the target hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both vertex shaders and mesh shaders use pixel shaders. Rasterizer spawns pixel shader work based on triangle pixel coverage, HiZ, and early depth/stencil test results. Hardware can pack multiple triangles and multiple instances in the same pixel shader wave. Pixel shaders itself aren’t that special. Nowadays pixel shaders run on the same SIMD cores as all the other shader types. There are some special inputs available: interpolated vertex outputs, screen location, sample index and coverage mask, triangle id, triangle facing, etc. Special inputs are declared as kernel function parameters using the system value (: SV) semantics, similar to existing APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Pixel shader...
const Texture textureHeap[];

struct VertexIn // Matching vertex shader output struct layout
{
    float16x4 normal;
    float32x2 uv;
};

struct PixelOut 
{
    float16x4 color : SV_Color0;

PixelOut main(const VertexIn &amp;amp;vertex, const DataPixel* data)
{
    Texture texture = textureHeap[data-&amp;gt;textureIndex];
    Sampler sampler = {.minFilter = LINEAR, .magFilter = LINEAR};

    float32x4 color = sample(texture, sampler, vertex.uv);
    return { .color = color };
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The removal of data bindings makes vertex and pixel shaders simpler to use. All of the complex data bindings APIs are replaced by a 64-bit GPU pointer. Users are able to write flexible vertex fetch code to avoid creating a PSO permutation per vertex layout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Rasterizer state&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legacy APIs (OpenGL and DirectX 9) had fine grained commands for setting all the shader inputs and rasterizer states. The driver had to build shader pipelines on demand. Hardware specific rasterizer, blender, and input assembler command packets were constructed from the shadow state that combined all individual fine grained states. Vulkan 1.0 and DirectX 12 chose the fully opposite design. All state is baked in the PSO ahead of time. Only a select few states, such as viewport rect, scissor rect, and stencil values, can be changed dynamically. This resulted in a massive explosion of PSO permutations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PSO creation is expensive, as it requires calling the GPU driver’s low-level shader compiler. PSO permutations consume a significant amount of storage and RAM. Changing the PSO is the most expensive state change. The small performance advantages that some vendors achieved by embedding render state directly into the shader microcode were overshadowed by the performance issues caused by significantly amplified pipeline creation, binding and data management costs everywhere. The pendulum swung too far to the opposite side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern GPUs are ALU dense. Nvidia and AMD recently doubled their ALU rate with additional pipelines. Apple also doubled their fp32 pipelines in their M-series chips. Simple states resulting only in a constant replacement in the shader should not require pipeline duplication, even if it adds an extra ALU instruction or wastes an uniform register. Most shaders today are not ALU bound. The cost is often not measurable, but the benefits of having less permutations are significant. Vulkan 1.3 is a big step in the right direction. A lot of baked PSO states can now be set dynamically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we investigate deeper, we notice that all GPUs use command packets for configuring their rasterizer and depth-stencil units. These command packets are not directly tied to the shader microcode. We don’t need to modify the shader microcode to change the rasterizer and depth-stencil state. Metal has a separate depth-stencil state object and a separate command for applying it. A separate state object reduces the PSO permutations and reduces the expensive shader binding calls. Vulkan 1.3 dynamic state achieves similar PSO permutation reduction, but is more fine grained. Metal’s design is a better match for the actual hardware command packets. Bigger packets reduce the API bloat and overhead. DirectX 12 unfortunately still bundles most of the depth-stencil state inside the PSO (stencil ref and depth bias are the only dynamic state). In our design the depth-stencil state is a separate object.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;GpuDepthStencilDesc depthStencilDesc = 
{
    .depthMode = DEPTH_READ | DEPTH_WRITE,
    .depthTest = OP_LESS_EQUAL,
    .depthBias = 0.0f,
    .depthBiasSlopeFactor = 0.0f,
    .depthBiasClamp = 0.0f,

    },

GpuDepthStencilDesc depthStencilDesc =

    .depthMode = DEPTH_READ | DEPTH_WRITE,

};

GpuDepthStencilState depthStencilState = gpuCreateDepthStencilState(depthStencilDesc);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Immediate mode (desktop) GPUs have similar command packets for configuring the alpha blender unit. If we were designing DirectX 13, we would simply split the blend state object out of the PSO and call it a day. But we are designing a cross platform API, and blending works completely differently on mobile GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mobile GPUs (TBDR) have always supported programmable blending. A render tile fits into a scratchpad memory close to the compute unit (such as the groupshared memory), allowing pixel shaders a direct low latency read+write access to previously rasterized pixels. Most mobile GPUs don’t have any fixed function blending hardware. When a traditional graphics API is used, the driver's low level shader compiler adds blending instructions at the end of the shader. This is analogous to the vertex fetch code generation (described above). If we were designing an API solely for mobile GPUs, we would get rid of the blend state APIs completely, just like we got rid of the vertex buffers. Mobile centric APIs expose a framebuffer fetch intrinsic to efficiently obtain current pixel’s previous color. The user can write any blending formula they want, including complex formulas to implement advanced algorithms such as order independent transparency. The user can also write a generic parametrised formula to eliminate the PSO permutation explosion. As we can see, both the desktop and the mobile GPUs have their own ways to reduce the pipeline permutations regarding blending, the limitation is the current APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulkan subpasses were designed to wrap framebuffer fetch into a cross platform API. This was another misstep in Vulkan design. Vulkan inherited a simple low level design from Mantle, but Vulkan was designed as an OpenGL replacement, so it had to target all mobile and desktop GPU architectures. Wrapping two entirely different architecture types under the same API isn’t easy. Subpasses ended up being a high level concept inside a low level API. A subpass could define an entire chain of render passes but pretend that it’s just a single render pass. Subpasses increased driver complexity and made the shader and renderpass APIs needlessly complex. Users were forced to create complex persistent multi-render pass objects ahead of time and pass those objects into shader pipeline creation. Shader pipelines became multi-pipelines under the hood (one pipeline per sub-pass). Vulkan added all of this complexity simply to avoid exposing the framebuffer fetch intrinsic to the shader language. To add insult to injury, the subpasses weren’t even good enough to solve the programmable blending. Pixel ordering is only preserved at pass boundaries. Subpasses were only useful for narrow 1:1 multi-pass use cases. Vulkan 1.3 scrapped the subpasses and introduced “dynamic rendering”. Users no longer need to create persistent render pass objects, just like in Metal, DirectX 12 and WebGPU. This is a great example of how a complex framework can be tempting for API designers, but developers prefer simple shader intrinsics. Game engines already support building different shaders to different platforms. Apple’s Metal examples do the same: Framebuffer fetch is used on iOS and a traditional multipass algorithm on Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s apparent that we can’t abstract hardware differences regarding blending and framebuffer fetch. Vulkan 1.0 tried that and failed miserably. The correct solution is to provide the user a choice. They can choose to embed the blend state into the PSO. This works on all platforms and is the perfect approach for shaders that don’t suffer from blend state related pipeline permutation issues. Mobile GPU’s internal driver shader compiler adds the blending instructions in the end of the pixel shader as usual. On immediate mode (desktop) GPUs (and some mobile GPUs), the user can choose to use separate blend state objects. This reduces the amount of PSO permutations and makes it faster to change the blend state at runtime, as a full pipeline change is not needed (only a blend state configuration packet is sent).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;GpuBlendDesc blendDesc = 
{
    .colorOp = OP_ONE,
    .srcColorFactor = FACTOR_SRC_ALPHA,
    .dstColorFactor = FACTOR_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA,
    .alphaOp = OP_ONE,
    .srcAlphaFactor = FACTOR_SRC_ALPHA,
    .dstAlphaFactor = FACTOR_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA,
    .colorWriteMask = 0xf
};

// Create blend state object (needs feature flag)
GpuBlendState blendState = gpuCreateBlendState(blendDesc);

// Set dynamic blend state (needs feature flag)
gpuSetBlendState(commandBuffer, blendState);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On mobile GPUs the user can embed the blend state into the PSO as usual, or choose to use framebuffer fetch to write a custom blending formula. If the mobile developer wants to avoid compiling multiple PSO permutations for different alpha blending modes, they can write a general formula parametrized with dynamic draw struct inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Standard percentage blend formula (added automatically by internal shader compiler)
dst.rgb = src.rgb * src.a + dst.rgb * (1.0 - src.a);
dst.a = src.a * src.a + dst.a * (1.0 - src.a);

// Custom formula supporting all blend modes used by HypeHype
const BlendParameters&amp;amp; p = data-&amp;gt;blendParameters;
vec4 fs = src.a * vec4(p.sc_sa.xxx + p.sc_one.xxx, p.sa_sa + p.sa_one) + dst.rgba * vec4(p.sc_dc.xxx, sa_da);
vec4 fd = (1.0 - src.a) * vec4(p.dc_1msa.xxx, p.da_1msa) + vec4(p.dc_one.xxx, p.da_one);
dst.rgb = src.rgb * fs.rgb + dst.rgb * fd.rgb;
dst.a  = src.a * fs.a + dst.a * fd.a;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the blend state is separated from the PSO, it’s possible we lose some automatic dead code optimizations. If the user wants to disable the color output, they traditionally use the colorWriteMask in the blend state. Since the blend state is burned in the PSO, the compiler can do dead code elimination based on it. To allow similar dead code optimizations, we have writeMask for each color target in the PSO.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dual source blending is a special blend mode requiring two color outputs from the pixel shader. Dual source blending only supports a single render target. Since our blend state can be separate, we need to have a supportDualSourceBlending field in our PSO desc. When enabled, the shader compiler knows the second output is for dual source blending. The validation layer would complain if the output is not present. A pixel shader exporting two colors can be used without dual source blending (the second color is ignored), but there’s a small cost for exporting two colors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The remaining rendering state in the PSO is minimal: primitive topology, render target and depth-stencil target formats, MSAA sample count and alpha to coverage. All of this state affects the generated shader microcode so it needs to stay in the PSO. We never want to rebuild the shader PSO microcode due to a state change. If an embedded blend state is used, it's also burned in the PSO. This leaves us with a simple raster state struct for PSO creation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;GpuRasterDesc rasterDesc = 
{
    .topology = TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_LIST,
    .cull = CULL_CCW,
    .alphaToCoverage = false,
    .supportDualSourceBlending = false,

        { .format = FORMAT_RGB10_A2_UNORM },
        { .format = FORMAT_RGBA8_UNORM }
    },
    .blendstate = GpuBlendDesc { ... }			// optional (embedded blend state, otherwise dynamic)
};

// A minimal way to descibe the above (using C++ API struct default values):
GpuRasterDesc rasterDesc = 
{
    .depthFormat = FORMAT_D32_FLOAT,
    .colorTargets = 
    {
        { .format = FORMAT_RG11B10_FLOAT	},
        { .format = FORMAT_RGB10_A2_UNORM },
        { .format = FORMAT_RGBA8_UNORM }
    },
};

// Pixel + vertex shader
auto vertexIR = loadFile("vertexShader.ir");
auto pixelIR = loadFile("pixelShader.ir");
GpuPipeline graphicsPipeline = gpuCreateGraphicsPipeline(vertexIR, pixelIR, rasterDesc);

// Mesh shader
auto meshletIR = loadFile("meshShader.ir");
auto pixelIR = loadFile("pixelShader.ir");
GpuPipeline graphicsMeshletPipeline = gpuCreateGraphicsMeshletPipeline(meshletIR, pixelIR, rasterDesc);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HypeHype’s Vulkan shader PSO initialization backend code is 400 lines, and I would consider it compact compared to other engines I have been developing. Here, we managed to initialize a pixel + vertex shader with just 18 lines of code. It’s easy to read and understand. Yet, there’s no compromise on performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rendering with the raster pipeline is similar to rendering with a compute pipeline. Instead of providing one data pointer, we provide two since there’s two kernel entry points: One for vertex shader and one for pixel shader. Metal has a separate set of data binding slots for vertex and pixel shaders. DirectX, Vulkan and WebGPU use a visibility mask (vertex, pixel, compute, etc) for each individual binding. Many engines choose to bind the same data to both vertex and pixel shader. This is a fine practice on DirectX, Vulkan and WebGPU as you can combine the mask bits, but doubles the binding calls on Metal. Our proposed approach using two data pointers is the best of both worlds. You can simply pass the same pointer twice if you want to use the same data in both the vertex and the pixel shader. Or you can provide independent data pointers, if you prefer full separation between the shader stages. The shader compiler does dead code elimination and constant/scalar preload optimizations separately for pixel and vertex shader. Neither data sharing nor data duplication results in bad performance. The user can choose whatever fits their design.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Our goal was to reduce the PSO permutation explosion by minimizing the remaining state inside the PSO. The depth-stencil can be separated on all architectures. The blend state separation is possible on desktop hardware, but most mobile hardware burns the blend equation at the end of the pixel shader microcode. Exposing the framebuffer fetch intrinsics directly to the user is a much better idea than Vulkan’s failed subpass approach. Users can write their own blend formulas unlocking new rendering algorithms, or they can author general parametrized blending formulas to reduce the PSO count.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Indirect drawing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standard draw/dispatch commands utilize C/C++ function parameters to provide the arguments: thread group dimensions, index count, instance count, etc. Indirect draw calls allow the user to provide a GPU buffer + offset pair instead as the draw argument source, a crucial addition enabling GPU-driven rendering. Our version uses a single GPU pointer instead of the usual buffer object + offset pair, simplifying the API slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gpuDispatchIndirect(commandBuffer, data.gpu, arguments.gpu);
gpuDrawIndexedInstancedIndirect(commandBuffer, dataVertex.gpu, dataPixel.gpu, arguments.gpu);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of our arguments are GPU pointers. Both the data and the arguments are indirect. This is a great improvement over existing APIs. DirectX 12, Vulkan and Metal don’t support indirect root arguments. The CPU has to provide them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indirect multidraw (MDI) should also be supported. The draw count comes from a GPU address. MDI parameters are: an array of root data (GPU pointer, for both vertex and pixel), an array of draw arguments (GPU pointer), and stride for the root data array (for both vertex and pixel). Stride = 0 naturally means that the same root data is replicated for each draw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gpuDrawIndexedInstancedIndirectMulti(commandBuffer, dataVertex.gpu, sizeof(DataVertex), dataPixel.gpu, sizeof(DataPixel), arguments.gpu, drawCount.gpu);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulkan’s multidraw doesn’t allow changing bindings per draw call. You can use gl_DrawID to index into a buffer which contains your draw data structs. This adds an indirection in the shader. You need to use either descriptor indexing or the new descriptor buffer extension to fetch textures. DirectX 12 ExecuteIndirect has a configurable command signature, allowing the user to manually setup a root constant per draw, but this doesn’t hit the fast path on all GPU command processors. ExecuteIndirect tier 1.1 (2024) added a new optional counter increment feature: D3D12_INDIRECT_ARGUMENT_TYPE_INCREMENTING_CONSTANT. This can be used to implement draw ID. SM6.8 (2024) finally added support for SV_StartInstanceLocation, allowing the user to directly embed a constant in the indirect draw arguments. Unlike SV_InstanceID, the new SV_StartInstanceLocation is uniform across the whole draw call, providing optimal codegen for indexed loads (uniform/scalar path). The data fetch still requires an indirection. GPU-generated root data is not supported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we generate draw arguments or root data on the GPU, we need to ensure that the command processor waits for the dispatch to finish. Modern command processors prefetch commands and their arguments to hide the latency. We have a flag in our barrier to prevent this. The best practice is to batch update all your draw arguments and root data to avoid fine-grained barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;gpuBarrier(commandBuffer, STAGE_COMPUTE, STAGE_COMPUTE, HAZARD_DRAW_ARGUMENTS);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lack of indirect shader selection is a significant limitation in the current PC and mobile graphics APIs. Indirect shader selection can be implemented using multi-pipelines similar to ray-tracing. Metal also supports indirect command creation (Nvidia has a similar Vulkan extension). An efficient way to skip over draw calls is a valuable subset. DirectX work graphs and CUDA dynamic parallelism allow a shader to spawn more waves on demand. Unfortunately, the APIs to access these hardware improvements is still highly platform specific and scattered in multiple shader entry points. There’s no clear standardization. My followup post will discuss the shader framework and cover this topic in depth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our proposed design makes indirect drawing extremely powerful. Both the shader root data and the draw parameters can be indirectly provided by the GPU. These advantages power up multi-draw, allowing clean and efficient per-draw data bindings with no hacks. The future of indirect drawing and the shader framework will be discussed in a followup post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Render passes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rasterizer hardware needs to be prepared for rendering before we can start drawing. Common operations include binding render target and depth-stencil views and clearing color and depth. Clear might trigger a fast clear elimination if the clear color is changed. This is transparently handled by the clear command. On mobile GPUs, tiles are stored from on-chip storage to VRAM during rendering. Vulkan, Metal and WebGPU use render pass abstraction for clearing, loading and storing the render target. DirectX 12 added render pass support in the 2018 update in order to optimize rendering on the latest Intel (Gen11) and the Qualcomm (Adreno 630) GPUs. The render pass abstraction doesn’t add notable API complexity, so it's an easy choice for a modern cross platform API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DirectX12 has render target views and depth-stencil views, and separate descriptor heaps to store them. This is just an API abstraction. These heaps are simply CPU memory allocated by the driver. Render target and depth-stencil views are not GPU descriptors. The rasterizer API is not bindless. The CPU driver sets up the rasterizer using command packets. In Vulkan and Metal you pass the existing texture/view objects to the beginRenderPass directly. The driver gets the required information from the texture object behind the scenes. Our proposed GpuTexture object fits this job. Rasterization output is the main reason we still need a CPU-side texture object. We write texture descriptors directly into GPU memory. The CPU side driver can’t access those.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;GpuRenderPassDesc renderPassDesc =
{
    .depthTarget = {.texture = deptStencilTexture, .loadOp = CLEAR, .storeOp = DONT_CARE, .clearValue = 1.0f},
    .stencilTarget = {.texture = deptStencilTexture, .loadOp = CLEAR, .storeOp = DONT_CARE, .clearValue = 0},
    .colorTargets =
    {
        {.texture = gBufferColor, .loadOp = LOAD, .storeOp = STORE, .clearColor = {0,0,0,0}},
        {.texture = gBufferNormal, .loadOp = LOAD, .storeOp = STORE, .clearColor = {0,0,0,0}},
        {.texture = gBufferPBR, .loadOp = LOAD, .storeOp = STORE, .clearColor = {0,0,0,0}}
    }
};

gpuBeginRenderPass(commandBuffer, renderPassDesc);
// Add draw calls here!
gpuEndRenderPass(commandBuffer);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be nice to have bindless render passes, bindless/indirect (multi-)clear commands, indirect scissor/viewport rectangles (array), etc. Unfortunately many GPUs today still need the CPU driver to set up their rasterizer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A note about barriers: Render pass begin/end commands don’t automatically emit barriers. The user can render multiple render passes simultaneously, if they write to disjoint render targets. A barrier between the raster output stage (or later) and the consumer stage will flush the tiny ROP caches if the GPU architecture needs it. Not having an automatic barrier between the render passes is also crucial for efficient depth prepass implementations (ROP caches are not flushed needlessly).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Prototype API&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My prototype API fits in one screen: 150 lines of code. The blog post is titled “No Graphics API”. That’s obviously an impossible goal today, but we got close enough. WebGPU has a smaller feature set and features a ~2700 line API (Emscripten C header). Vulkan header is ~20,000 lines, but it supports ray-tracing, and many other features our minimalistic API doesn’t yet support. We didn’t have to trade off performance to achieve the reduction in API complexity. For this feature set, our API offers more flexibility than existing APIs. A fully extended summer 2025 Vulkan 1.4 can do all the same things in practice, but is significantly more complex to use and has more API overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;How can we debug code that doesn’t bind buffer and texture objects and doesn’t call an API to describe the memory layout explicitly? C/C++ debuggers have been doing that for decades. There’s no special operating system APIs for describing your software’s memory layout. The debugger is able to follow 64-bit pointer chains and use the debug symbol data provided by your compiler. This includes the memory layouts of your structs and classes. CUDA and Metal use C/C++ based shading languages with full 64-bit pointer semantics. Both have robust debuggers that traverse pointer chains without issues. The texture descriptor heap is just GPU memory. The debugger can index it, load a texture descriptor, show the descriptor data and visualize the texels. All of this works already in the Xcode Metal debugger. Click on a texture or a sampler handle in any struct in any GPU address. Debugger will visualize it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern GPUs virtualize memory. Each process has their own page table. The GPU capture has a separate replayer process with its own virtual address space. If the replayer would naively replay all the allocations, it would get a different GPU virtual address for each memory allocation. This was fine for legacy APIs as it wasn’t possible to directly store GPU addresses in your data structures. A modern API needs special replay memory allocation APIs that force the replayer to mirror the exact GPU virtual memory layout. DX12 and Vulkan BDA have public APIs for this: RecreateAt and VkMemoryOpaqueCaptureAddressAllocateInfo. Metal and CUDA debuggers do the same using internal undocumented APIs. A public API is preferable as it allows open source tools like RenderDoc to function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t raw pointers bring security concerns? Can’t you just read/write other apps' memory? This is not possible due to virtual memory. You can only access your own memory pages. If you accidentally use a stale pointer or overflow, you will get a page fault. Page faults are possible with existing buffer based APIs. DirectX 12 and Vulkan don’t clamp your storage (byteaddress/structured) buffer addresses. OOB causes a page fault. Users can also accidentally free a memory heap and continue using stale buffer or texture descriptors to get a page fault. Nothing really changes. An access to an unmapped region is a page fault and the application crashes. This is familiar to C/C++ programmers. If you want robustness, you can use ptr + size pairs. That’s exactly how WebGPU is implemented. The WebGPU shader compiler (Tint or Naga) emits an extra clamp instruction for each buffer access, including vertex accesses (index buffer value out of bounds). WebGL didn’t allow shading index buffer data with other data. WebGL scanned through the indices on the CPU side (making index buffer update very slow). Back then custom vertex fetch was not possible. The hardware page faulted before the shader even ran.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Translation layers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being able to run existing software is crucial. Translation layers such as ANGLE, Proton and MoltenVK play a crucial role in the portability and deprecation process of legacy APIs. Let’s talk about translating DirectX 12, Vulkan and Metal to our new API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MoltenVK (Vulkan to Metal translation layer) proves that Vulkan’s buffer centric API can be translated to Metal’s 64-bit pointer based ecosystem. MoltenVK translates Vulkan’s descriptor sets into Metal’s argument buffers. The generated argument buffers are standard GPU structs containing a 64-bit GPU pointer per buffer binding and a 64-bit texture ID per texture binding. We can do better by allocating a contiguous range of texture descriptors in our texture heap for each descriptor set, and storing a single 32-bit base index instead of a 64-bit texture ID for each texture binding. This is possible since our API has a user managed texture heap unlike Metal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MoltenVK maps descriptor sets to Metal API root bind slots. We generate a root struct with up to eight 64-bit pointer fields, each pointing to a descriptor set struct (see above). Root constants are translated into value fields and root descriptors (root buffers) are translated into 64-bit pointers. The efficiency should be identical, assuming the GPU driver preloads our root struct fields into uniform/scalar registers (as discussed in the root arguments chapter).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our API uses 64-bit pointer semantics like Metal. We can use the same techniques employed by MoltenVK to translate the buffer load/store instructions in the shader. MoltenVK also supports translating Vulkan’s new buffer device address extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proton (DX12 to Vulkan translation layer) proves that DirectX 12 SM 6.6 descriptor heap can be translated to Vulkan’s new descriptor buffer extension. Proton also translates other DirectX 12 features to Vulkan. We have already shown that Vulkan to Metal translation is possible with MoltenVK, transitively proving that translation from DirectX 12 to Metal should be possible. The biggest missing feature in MoltenVK is the SM 6.6 style descriptor heap (Vulkan’s descriptor buffer extension). Metal doesn’t expose the descriptor heap directly to the user. Our new proposed API has no such limitation. Our descriptor heap semantics are a superset to SM 6.6 descriptor heap and a close match to Vulkan’s descriptor buffer extension. Translation is straightforward. Vulkan’s extension also adds a special flag for descriptor invalidate, matching our HAZARD_DESCRIPTORS. DirectX 12 descriptor heap API is easy to translate, as it’s just a thin wrapper over the raw descriptor array in GPU memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To support Metal 4.0, we need to implement Metal’s driver managed texture descriptor heap. This can be implemented using a simple freelist over our texture heap. Metal uses 64-bit texture handles which are implemented as direct heap indices on modern Apple Silicon devices. Metal allows using the texture handles in shaders directly as textures. This is syntactic sugar for textureHeap[uint64(handle)]. A Metal texture handle is translated into uint64 by our shader translator, maintaining identical GPU memory layout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our API doesn’t support vertex buffers. WebGPU doesn’t use hardware vertex buffers either, yet it implements the classic vertex buffer abstraction. WGSL shader translator (Tint or Naga) adds one storage buffer binding per vertex stream and emits vertex load instructions in the beginning of the vertex shader. Custom vertex fetch allows emitting clamp instructions to avoid OOB behavior. A misbehaving website can’t crash the web browser. Our own shader translator adds a 64-bit pointer to the root struct for each vertex stream, generates a struct matching its layout and emits vertex struct load instructions in the beginning of the vertex shader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have shown that it’s possible to write translation layers to run DirectX 12, Vulkan and Metal applications on top of our new API. Since WebGPU is implemented on top of these APIs by browsers, we can run WebGPU applications too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Min spec hardware&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia Turing (RTX 2000 series, 2018) introduced ray-tracing, tensor cores, mesh shaders, low latency raw memory paths, bigger &amp;amp; faster caches, scalar unit, secondary integer pipeline and many other future looking features. Officially PCIe ReBAR support launched with RTX 3000 series, but there exists hacked Turing drivers that support it too, indicating that the hardware is capable of it. This 7 year old GPU supports everything we need. Nvidia just ended GTX 1000 series driver support in fall 2025. All currently supported Nvidia GPUs could be supported by our new API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMD RDNA2 (RX 6000 series, 2020) matched Nvidia’s feature set with ray-tracing and mesh shaders. One year earlier, RDNA 1 introduced coherent L2$, new L1$ level, fast L0$, generic DCC read/write paths, fastpath unfiltered loads and a modern SIMD32 architecture. PCIe ReBAR is officially supported (brand name “Smart Access Memory”). This 5 year old GPU supports everything we need. AMD ended GCN driver support already in 2021. Today RDNA 1 &amp;amp; RDNA 2 only receive bug fixes and security updates, RDNA 3 is the oldest GPU receiving game optimizations. All the currently supported AMD GPUs could be supported by our API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel Alchemist / Xe1 (2022) were the first Intel chips with SM 6.6 global indexable heap support. These chips also support ray-tracing, mesh shaders, PCIe ReBAR (discrete) and UMA (integrated). These 3 year old Intel GPUs support everything we need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple M1 / A14 (MacBook M1, iPhone 12, 2020) support Metal 4.0. Metal 4.0 guarantees GPU memory visibility to CPU (UMA on both phones and computers), and allows the user to write 64-bit pointers and 64-bit texture handles directly into GPU memory. Metal 4.0 has a new residency set API, solving a crucial usability issue with bindless resource management in the old useResource/useHeap APIs. iOS 26 still supports iPhone 11. Developers are not allowed to ship apps that require Metal 4.0 just yet. iOS 27 likely deprecates iPhone 11 support next year. On Mac, if you drop Intel Mac support, you have guaranteed Metal 4.0 support. M1-M5 = 5 generations = 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ARM Mali-G710 (2021) is ARMs first modern architecture. It introduced their new command stream frontend (CSF), reducing the CPU dependency of draw call building and adding crucial features like multi-draw indirect and compute queues. Non-uniform index texture sampling is significantly faster and the AFBC lossless compressor now supports 16-bit floating point targets. G710 supports Vulkan BDA and descriptor buffer extensions and is capable of supporting the new 2025 unified image layout extension with future drivers. The Mali-G715 (2022) introduced support for ray-tracing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qualcomm Adreno 650 (2019) supports Vulkan BDA, descriptor buffer and unified image layout extensions, 16-bit storage/math, dynamic rendering and extended dynamic state with the latest Turnip open source drivers. Adreno 740 (2022) introduced support for ray-tracing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PowerVR DXT (Pixel 10, 2025) is PowerVRs first architecture that supports Vulkan descriptor buffer and buffer device address extensions. It also supports 64-bit atomics, 8-bit and 16-bit storage/math, dynamic rendering, extended dynamic state and all the other features we require.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern graphics API have improved gradually in the past 10 years. Six years after DirectX 12 launch, SM 6.6 (2021) introduced the modern global texture heap, allowing fully bindless renderer design. Metal 4.0 (2025) and CUDA have a clean 64-bit pointer based shader architecture with minimal binding API surface. Vulkan has the most restrictive standard, but extensions such as buffer device access (2020), descriptor buffer (2022) and unified image layouts (2025) add support for modern bindless infrastructure, but tools are still lagging behind. As of today, there’s no single API that meets all our requirements, but if we combine their best bits together, we can build the perfect API for modern hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;10 years ago, modern APIs were designed for CPU-driven binding models. New bindless features were presented as optional features and extensions. A clean break would improve the usability and reduce the API bloat and driver complexity significantly. It’s extremely difficult to get the whole industry behind a brand new API. I am hoping that vendors are willing to drop backwards compatibility in their new major API versions (Vulkan 2.0, DirectX 13) to embrace the fully bindless GPU architecture we have today. A new bindless API design would solve the mismatch between the API and the game engine RHI, allowing us to get rid of the hash maps and fine grained resource tracking. Metal 4.0 is close to this goal, but it is still missing the global indexable texture heap. A 64-bit texture handle can’t represent a range of textures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HLSL and GLSL shading languages were designed over 20 years ago as a framework of 1:1 elementwise transform functions (vertex, pixel, geometry, hull, domain, etc). Memory access is abstracted and array handling is cumbersome as there’s no support for pointers. Despite 20 years of existence, HLSL and GLSL have failed to accumulate a library ecosystem. CUDA in contrast is a composable language exposing memory directly and new features (such as AI tensor cores) though intrinsics. CUDA has a broad library ecosystem, which has propelled Nvidia into $4T valuation. We should learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WebGPU note: WebGPU design is based on 10 year old core Vulkan 1.0 with extra restrictions. WebGPU doesn’t support bindless resources, 64-bit GPU pointers or persistently mapped GPU memory. It feels like a mix between DirectX 11 and Vulkan 1.0. It is a great improvement for web graphics, but doesn’t meet modern bindless API standards. I will discuss WebGPU in a separate blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My prototype API shows what is achievable with modern GPU architectures today, if we mix the best bits from all the latest APIs. It is possible to build an API that is simpler to use than DirectX 11 and Metal 1.0, yet it offers better performance and flexibility than DirectX 12 and Vulkan. We should embrace the modern bindless hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Appendix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple user land GPU bump allocator used in all example code. We call gpuHostToDevicePointer once in the temp allocator constructor. We can perform standard pointer arithmetic (such as offset) on GPU pointers. Traditional Vulkan/DX12 buffer APIs require a separate offset. This simplifies the API and user code (ptr vs handle+offset pair). A production ready temp allocator would implement overflow handing (grow, flush, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;template&amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt;
struct GPUTempAllocation&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;
{
    T* cpu;
    T* gpu;
}

struct GPUBumpAllocator
{
    uint8 *cpu;
    uint8 *gpu;
    uint32 offset = 0;
    uint32 size;

    TempBumpAllocator(uint32 size) : size(size)
    {
        cpu = gpuMalloc(size);
        gpu = gpuHostToDevicePointer(cpu);
    }

    TempAllocation&amp;lt;uint8&amp;gt; alloc(int bytes, int align = 16)
    {
        offset = alignRoundUp(offset, align);
        if (offset + bytes &amp;gt; size) offset = 0; // Simple ring wrap (no overflow detection)
        TempAllocation&amp;lt;uint8&amp;gt; alloc = { .cpu = cpu + offset, . gpu = gpu + offset };
        offset += bytes;
        return alloc;
    }

    template&amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt; 
    T* alloc(int count = 1)
    {
        TempAllocation&amp;lt;uint8&amp;gt; mem = alloc(sizeof(T) * count, alignof(T));
        return TempAllocation&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; { .cpu = (T*)mem.cpu, . gpu = (T*)mem.gpu };
    }
};&lt;/code&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Letta Code: A Memory-First Coding Agent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Letta Code is a memory-first coding agent, designed for working with agents that learn over time. When working with coding agents today, interactions happen in independent sessions. Letta Code is built around long-lived agents that persist across sessions and improve with use. Rather than working in independent sessions, each session is tied to a persisted agent that learns. Letta Code is also the #1 model-agnostic OSS harness on TerminalBench, and achieves comparable performance to harnesses built by LLM providers (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI) on their own models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Continual Learning &amp;amp; Memory for Coding AgentsÂ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents today accumulate valuable experience: they receive the userâs preferences and feedback, review significant parts of code, and observe the outcomes of taking actions like running scripts or commands. Yet today this experience is largely wasted. Letta agents learn from experience through agentic context engineering, long-term memory, and skill learning. The more you work with an agent, the more context and memory it accumulates, and the better it becomes.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Memory InitializationÂ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you get started with Letta Code, you can run an `/init` command to encourage your agent to learn about your existing project. This will trigger your agent to run deep research on your local codebase, forming memories and rewriting its system prompt (through memory blocks) as it learns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your agent will continue to learn automatically, but you can also explicitly trigger your agent to reflect and learn with the `/remember` command.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Skill LearningÂ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many tasks that we work on with coding agents are repeated or follow similar patterns - for example API patterns or running DB migrations. Once youâve worked with an agent to coach it through a complex task, you can trigger it to learn a skill from its experience, so the agent itself or other agents can reference the skill for similar tasks in the future. Skill learning can dramatically improve performance on future similar tasks, as we showed with recent results on TerminalBench.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On our team, some skills that agents have contributed (with the help of human engineers) are:Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Generating DB migrations on schema changes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Creating PostHog dashboards with the PostHog CLI&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Best practices for API changesÂ Â Â&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since skills are simply &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; files, they can be managed in git repositories for versioning - or even used by other coding agents that support skills.Â &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Persisted State&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents can also lookup past conversations (or even conversations of other agents) through the Letta API. The builtin `/search` command allows you to easily search through messages, so you can find the agent you worked on something with. The Letta API supports vector, full-text, and hybrid search over messages and available tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Letta Code is the #1 model-agnostic OSS coding harnessÂ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Letta Code adds statefulness and learning to coding agents, but is the #1 model-agnostic, OSS harness on Terminal-Bench. Letta Codeâs performance is comparable to provider-specific harnesses (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Codex) across model providers, and significantly outperforms the previous leading model-agnostic harness, Terminus 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that even without memory, you can expect Letta Code agents to work just as well with a frontier model as they would with a specific harness built by the model provider.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting Started with Letta CodeÂ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To try out Letta Code, you can install it with &lt;code&gt;npm install -g @letta-ai/letta-code&lt;/code&gt; or install from source (see the full documentation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Letta Code can be used with the Letta Developer Platform, or with a self-hosted Letta server.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: ty is an extremely fast Python type checker and language server, written in Rust, and designed as an alternative to tools like mypy, Pyright, and Pylance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we're announcing the Beta release of ty. We now use ty exclusively in our own projects and are ready to recommend it to motivated users for production use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Astral, we build high-performance developer tools for the Python ecosystem. We're best known for uv, our Python package manager, and Ruff, our linter and formatter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we're announcing the Beta release of the next tool in the Astral toolchain: ty, an extremely fast Python type checker and language server, written in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Type checking the home-assistant project on the command-line, without caching (M4).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ty was designed from the ground up to power a language server. The entire ty architecture is built around "incrementality", enabling us to selectively re-run only the necessary computations when a user (e.g.) edits a file or modifies an individual function. This makes live updates extremely fast in the context of an editor or long-lived process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can install ty today with &lt;code&gt;uv tool install ty@latest&lt;/code&gt;, or via our
VS Code extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like Ruff and uv, ty's implementation was grounded in some of our core product principles:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An obsessive focus on performance. Without caching, ty is consistently between 10x and 60x faster than mypy and Pyright. When run in an editor, the gap is even more dramatic. As an example, after editing a load-bearing file in the PyTorch repository, ty recomputes diagnostics in 4.7ms: 80x faster than Pyright (386ms) and 500x faster than Pyrefly (2.38 seconds). ty is very fast!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Correct, pragmatic, and ergonomic. With features like first-class intersection types, advanced type narrowing, and sophisticated reachability analysis, ty pushes forward the state of the art in Python type checking, providing more accurate feedback and avoiding assumptions about user intent that often lead to false positives. Our goal with ty is not only to build a faster type checker; we want to build a better type checker, and one that balances correctness with a deep focus on the end-user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Built in the open. ty was built by our core team alongside dozens of active contributors under the MIT license, and the same goes for our editor extensions. You can run ty anywhere that you write Python (including in the browser).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even compared to other Rust-based language servers like Pyrefly, ty can run orders of magnitude faster when performing incremental updates on large projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Editing a central file in the PyTorch repository with ty (left) and Pyrefly (right). ty's incremental architecture is designed to make live updates extremely fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ty also includes a best-in-class diagnostic system, inspired by the Rust compiler's own world-class error messages. A single ty diagnostic can pull in context from multiple files at once to explain not only what's wrong, but why (and, often, how to fix it).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When assigning an invalid value to a dictionary key, ty surfaces both the type mismatch at the assignment site and the corresponding item declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diagnostic output is the primary user interface for a type checker; we prioritized our diagnostic system from the start (with both humans and agents in mind) and view it as a first-class feature in ty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When importing an unresolved module, ty surfaces both the unresolved import at the import site and the corresponding Python version configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you use VS Code, Cursor, or a similar editor, we recommend installing the ty VS Code extension. The ty language server supports all the capabilities that you'd expect for a modern language server (Go to Definition, Symbol Rename, Auto-Complete, Auto-Import, Semantic Syntax Highlighting, Inlay Hints, etc.), and runs in any editor that implements the Language Server Protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following the Beta release, our immediate priority is supporting early adopters. From there, we're working towards a Stable release next year, with the gap between the Beta and Stable milestones largely focusing on: (1) stability and bug fixes, (2) completing the long tail of features in the Python typing specification, and (3) first-class support for popular third-party libraries like Pydantic and Django.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a longer time horizon, though, ty will power semantic capabilities across the Astral toolchain: dead code elimination, unused dependency detection, SemVer-compatible upgrade enforcement, CVE reachability analysis, type-aware linting, and more (including some that are too ambitious to say out loud just yet).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to make Python the most productive programming ecosystem on Earth. Just as with Ruff and uv, our commitment from here is that ty will get significantly better every week by working closely with our users. Thank you for building with us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Acknowledgements #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ty is the most sophisticated product we've built, and its design and implementation have surfaced some of the hardest technical problems we've seen at Astral. Working on ty requires a deep understanding of type theory, Python runtime semantics, and how the Python ecosystem actually uses Python.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd like to thank all those that contributed directly to the development of ty, including: Douglas Creager, Alex Waygood, David Peter, Micha Reiser, Andrew Gallant, Aria Desires, Carl Meyer, Zanie Blue, Ibraheem Ahmed, Dhruv Manilawala, Jack O'Connor, Zsolt Dollenstein, Shunsuke Shibayama, Matthew Mckee, Brent Westbrook, UnboundVariable, Shaygan Hooshyari, Justin Chapman, InSync, Bhuminjay Soni, Abhijeet Prasad Bodas, Rasmus Nygren, lipefree, Eric Mark Martin, Tomer Bin, Luca Chiodini, Brandt Bucher, Dylan Wilson, Eric Jolibois, Felix Scherz, Leandro Braga, Renkai Ge, Sumana Harihareswara, Takayuki Maeda, Max Mynter, med1844, William Woodruff, Chandra Kiran G, DetachHead, Emil Sadek, Jo, Joren Hammudoglu, Mahmoud Saada, Manuel Mendez, Mark Z.

    &lt;p&gt;We'd also like to thank the Salsa team (especially Niko Matsakis, David Barsky, and Lukas Wirth) for their support and collaboration; the Elixir team (especially José Valim, Giuseppe Castagna, and Guillaume Duboc), whose work strongly influenced our approach to gradual types and intersections; and a few members of the broader Python typing community: Eric Traut, Jelle Zijlstra, Jia Chen, Sam Goldman, Shantanu Jain, and Steven Troxler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, on a personal level, I'd like to highlight the core team (Alex, Andrew, Aria, Carl, David, Dhruv, Doug, Ibraheem, Jack, and Micha), who created ty from nothing and pushed it to be great from Day 1.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A deterministic command-line tool for validating GPU PCIe link health, bandwidth, and real-world PCIe utilization using only observable hardware data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This tool answers one question reliably:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Is my GPU’s PCIe link behaving as it should, and can I prove it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No registry hacks. No BIOS assumptions. No “magic” optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only measurable link state, copy throughput, and hardware counters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This tool performs hardware-observable PCIe diagnostics and reports factual results with deterministic verdicts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It measures and reports directly from GPU hardware:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PCIe current and maximum link generation and width (via NVML)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Peak Host→Device and Device→Host copy bandwidth using CUDA memcpy timing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sustained PCIe utilization under load using NVML TX/RX counters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Efficiency relative to theoretical PCIe payload bandwidth&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clear VERDICT from observable conditions only&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tool does not attempt to tune, fix, or modify system configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OK — The negotiated PCIe link and measured throughput are consistent with expected behavior.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DEGRADED — The GPU is operating below its maximum supported PCIe generation or width.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UNDERPERFORMING — The full link is negotiated, but sustained bandwidth is significantly lower than expected.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Verdicts are rule-based and derived only from measured data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern systems frequently exhibit PCIe issues that are difficult to diagnose:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPUs negotiating x8 / x4 / x1 instead of x16&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PCIe generation downgrades after BIOS or firmware updates&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Slot bifurcation, riser cable, or motherboard lane-sharing issues&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reduced PCIe bandwidth occurring while system status is reported as normal&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Confusion between PCIe transport limits and workload bottlenecks&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This tool exists to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reproducible PCIe diagnostic baseline&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hardware-level proof of PCIe behavior&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Isolate link negotiation from kernel/workload effects&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Tested on Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On some Linux systems, PCIe and NVML diagnostics require elevated privileges due to kernel and driver access controls. If log files were previously created using &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;, the results directory may become root-owned. In that case, subsequent runs may prompt for a password when appending logs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To restore normal user access to the results directory:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo chown -R $USER:$USER results/&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;make&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or manually:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;nvcc -O3 pcie_diagnostic_pro.cu -lnvidia-ml -Xcompiler -pthread -o pcie_diag&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;./pcie_diag 1024&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;./pcie_diag 1024 --log --csv ./pcie_diag 1024 --log --json ./pcie_diag 1024 --log --csv --json&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Logs are written to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;results/csv/pcie_log.csv&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;results/json/pcie_sessions.json&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;improves measurement stability&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;./pcie_diag 1024 --integrity&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enables read-only inspection of PCIe Advanced Error Reporting (AER) counters via Linux sysfs, if exposed by the platform.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If counters are unavailable on the platform, integrity checks are automatically skipped with clear reporting.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When running in multi-GPU mode (&lt;code&gt;--all-gpus&lt;/code&gt;), each detected GPU is evaluated independently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One result row (CSV) or object (JSON) is emitted per GPU per run.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each entry includes device UUID and PCIe BDF for unambiguous attribution.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-GPU configurations have not been exhaustively validated on all platforms.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Users are encouraged to verify results on their specific hardware.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;./pcie_diag 1024 --all-gpus --log --csv
./pcie_diag 1024 --all-gpus --log --json 
./pcie_diag 1024 --gpu-index 1     # Target single GPU by index&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CSV and JSON logs include stable device identifiers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Device UUIDs are reported at runtime via NVML for consistent identification across runs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UUIDs shown in documentation are intentionally redacted&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Logs are append-friendly for time-series analysis and automated monitoring&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This tool evaluates PCIe transport behavior only&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It does not measure kernel performance or application-level efficiency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It does not modify BIOS, firmware, registry, or PCIe configuration&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It reports observable facts only and never infers beyond available data&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memcpy timing and PCIe behavior were cross-validated during development using Nsight Systems.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nsight is not required to use this tool and is referenced only as an external correctness check.&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Prediction: AI will make formal verification go mainstream&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Published by Martin Kleppmann on 08 Dec 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Much has been said about the effects that AI will have on software development, but there is an angle I havenât seen talked about: I believe that AI will bring formal verification, which for decades has been a bit of a fringe pursuit, into the software engineering mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Proof assistants and proof-oriented programming languages such as Rocq, Isabelle, Lean, F*, and Agda have been around for a long time. They make it possible to write a formal specification that some piece of code is supposed to satisfy, and then mathematically prove that the code always satisfies that spec (even on weird edge cases that you didnât think of testing). These tools have been used to develop some large formally verified software systems, such as an operating system kernel, a C compiler, and a cryptographic protocol stack.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At present, formal verification is mostly used by research projects, and it is uncommon for industrial software engineers to use formal methods (even those working on classic high-assurance software such as medical devices and aircraft). The reason is that writing those proofs is both very difficult (requiring PhD-level training) and very laborious.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For example, as of 2009, the formally verified seL4 microkernel consisted of 8,700 lines of C code, but proving it correct required 20 person-years and 200,000 lines of Isabelle code â or 23 lines of proof and half a person-day for every single line of implementation. Moreover, there are maybe a few hundred people in the world (wild guess) who know how to write such proofs, since it requires a lot of arcane knowledge about the proof system.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To put it in simple economic terms: for most systems, the expected cost of bugs is lower than the expected cost of using the proof techniques that would eliminate those bugs. Part of the reason is perhaps that bugs are a negative externality: itâs not the software developer who bears the cost of the bugs, but the users. But even if the software developer were to bear the cost, formal verification is simply very hard and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At least, that was the case until recently. Now, LLM-based coding assistants are getting pretty good not only at writing implementation code, but also at writing proof scripts in various languages. At present, a human with specialist expertise still has to guide the process, but itâs not hard to extrapolate and imagine that process becoming fully automated in the next few years. And when that happens, it will totally change the economics of formal verification.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If formal verification becomes vastly cheaper, then we can afford to verify much more software. But on top of that, AI also creates a need to formally verify more software: rather than having humans review AI-generated code, Iâd much rather have the AI prove to me that the code it has generated is correct. If it can do that, Iâll take AI-generated code over handcrafted code (with all its artisanal bugs) any day!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In fact, I would argue that writing proof scripts is one of the best applications for LLMs. It doesnât matter if they hallucinate nonsense, because the proof checker will reject any invalid proof and force the AI agent to retry. The proof checker is a small amount of code that is itself verified, making it virtually impossible to sneak an invalid proof past the checker.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That doesnât mean software will suddenly be bug-free. As the verification process itself becomes automated, the challenge will move to correctly defining the specification: that is, how do you know that the properties that were proved are actually the properties that you cared about? Reading and writing such formal specifications still requires expertise and careful thought. But writing the spec is vastly easier and quicker than writing the proof by hand, so this is progress.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I could also imagine AI agents helping with the process of writing the specifications, translating between formal language and natural language. Here there is the potential for subtleties to be lost in translation, but this seems like a manageable risk.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I find it exciting to think that we could just specify in a high-level, declarative way the properties that we want some piece of code to have, and then to vibe code the implementation along with a proof that it satisfies the specification. That would totally change the nature of software development: we wouldnât even need to bother looking at the AI-generated code any more, just like we donât bother looking at the machine code generated by a compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In summary: 1. formal verification is about to become vastly cheaper; 2. AI-generated code needs formal verification so that we can skip human review and still be sure that it works; 3. the precision of formal verification counteracts the imprecise and probabilistic nature of LLMs. These three things taken together mean formal verification is likely to go mainstream in the foreseeable future. I suspect that soon the limiting factor will not be the technology, but the culture change required for people to realise that formal methods have become viable in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To find a safe space for his kid to chat with friends while playing Minecraft, Brian Scott had to go back to the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chat went back, that is, to an IRC-like interface, run through a terminal. The connection and setup remain futuristic, because Scott used Tailscale, and tsnet, to build chat-tails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chat-tails is the opposite of everything modern chat apps are offering. Nobody can get in without someone doing some work to invite them. All the chats are ephemeral, stored nowhere easy to reach, unsearchable. There are no voice chats, plug-ins, avatars, or images at all, really, unless you count ASCII art. And that’s just the way Brian wanted it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s about, hey, you have this private space, across your friends’ tailnets, where you can chat, about the game you’re playing or whatever you’re doing,” Scott told me. “It’s supposed to be more like the days where you were all on the same LAN, you would bring your computers together and have a gaming session. Now you can kind of have that same type of feeling, no matter where you are in the world—just a nice private area where you can chat.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How it works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two ways of running chat-tails: “Regular mode” and “Tailscale mode.” In Regular Mode, you run &lt;code&gt;./chat-server&lt;/code&gt;, feed it a port number, room name, and maximum number of users, and then it creates the chat, on your local network. You can log into your router and enable a port forward, if you want, every time you create the chat and want to let others in—but opening up a telnet-style chat port on your home router, the one you’re having your kids chat on, seems like a pretty bad idea. Your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In “Tailscale Mode,” you do all the same things, except you provide two more things. One is a &lt;code&gt;--hostname&lt;/code&gt;, which makes the chat accessible (to Tailscale users with whom you’ve shared this chat) at your Tailscale domain, like &lt;code&gt;hostname.something.ts.net&lt;/code&gt;. The other thing you give it is an auth key, connecting it to Tailscale. With that, any device on the tailnet, or shared into it, can access the chat through an &lt;code&gt;nc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;telnet&lt;/code&gt; command, like &lt;code&gt;telnet hostname.something.ts.net 2323&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then you are chatting, in a terminal. Type some text, hit enter, and everyone sees it. There are four other commands, as of this writing: &lt;code&gt;/who&lt;/code&gt; lists the users, &lt;code&gt;/help&lt;/code&gt; shows you these four commands, &lt;code&gt;/me&lt;/code&gt; gives your text the italicized “action” flavor (“reaches for an ice-cold Diet Coke”), and &lt;code&gt;/quit&lt;/code&gt;, it quits. That’s the app, and while it might pick up some features over time (it added history options just recently), it’s doing just what it should right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building an old-school chat space&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scott is not a full-time code-writing developer, but has about 10 years’ experience working with Go. He had been eyeing the tsnet library for some time, thinking of projects that might fit a melding of Go and Tailscale. When his chat inspiration (chatspiration?) struck, he spent “about two days” learning and tinkering with the library for the first big effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The tsnet (library) was actually the easiest thing,” Brian said. With the networking and verification pieces sorted, he just had to focus on the surprisingly hard task of getting text that one person types in a terminal to show up as text that another terminal user reads. “If you’re thinking of building something like Discord, you would incorporate some kinds of websocket communication, streamline everything across the wire. But for a terminal-based chat app, it’s really just TCP and UDP, just straight-up connections you’re actually dealing with.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Making the chat look nicer than just a terminal line was helped along by bubbletea, a free and open-source terminal UI library. “While I was making this thing very minimal, I wanted to also make it very pleasing,” Brian said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyone with experience building in Go could extend it or modify it, Brian said. He has looked at Go libraries for things like rendering images in terminal chat, and thought about how Taildrop could be used in a chat where everybody’s using Tailscale. Chat-tails is low-profile enough to easily run on a Raspberry Pi or similarly single-board computer (SBC); it might be leveraged as a portable, ephemeral chat to bring to events. Or it could just become a way for groups with a certain retro bent to replace their personal Slack or Discord setups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for now, it’s a fun way to offer his child and friends a safe learning space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You launch it on top of Tailscale, scale it as big as you want, and now your community is not only learning about VPN technology, but also the basics of SSH, terminal, things like that,” Brian said. “It feels good, very retro-futuristic, and fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;More community apps like this&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brian’s chat-tails is included in our community projects hub. Built something neat with Tailscale? Submit it by email community@tailscale.com.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Reverse-Engineering the RK3588 NPU: Hacking Memory Limits to Run Vision Transformers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Author's Note: I am currently an MS CS student at CU Boulder specializing in Edge AI &amp;amp; Embedded Systems. I am actively looking for Summer 2026 Internships where I can optimize difficult workloads on constrained silicon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The “Unsupported” Hardware Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you look at the spec sheet for the Rockchip RK3588 (the chip inside the Orange Pi 5), it looks like a beast. It promises 6 TOPS of NPU performance. For $100, that’s a steal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if you try to run modern AI on it—specifically the Vision Encoder from SmolVLM—that promise falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard Computer Vision SDK (&lt;code&gt;rknn-toolkit2&lt;/code&gt;) is optimized for older, predictable CNNs (like ResNet). When I fed it the SigLIP Vision Transformer used by SmolVLM, the driver choked. Even though the model is “smol,” the massive Attention matrices it generates triggered cryptic hex errors and refused to compile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This left me with one option: running the model on the CPU. The result? A single image inference took ~30 seconds. The 6 TOPS accelerator sat idle while the CPU struggled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn’t accept that. I decided to reverse-engineer the NPU to find out exactly why it was failing, and how to force it to run at full speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Context: Why do it the hard way? (First Principles)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A quick note for those following the ecosystem: You might see projects like QEngineering running the newer SmolVLM-v2 on Rockchip’s &lt;code&gt;rknn-llm&lt;/code&gt; SDK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That approach uses a specialized “black box” toolchain designed specifically for Transformers. Rockchip engineers have likely already implemented complex memory management inside that SDK to handle these models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My project targets the original SmolVLM-v1, but more importantly, I built it on the legacy &lt;code&gt;rknn-toolkit2&lt;/code&gt; stack. Why hack the legacy stack? I wanted to take a “First Principles” approach. I didn’t want to use a black-box solver. I wanted to understand why the hardware was crashing on Attention layers and if I could find universal architectural patterns—like manual tiling and graph sharding—that could force any Transformer to run on any constrained edge accelerator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Detective Work: What is Error &lt;code&gt;0xe010&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rockchip doesn’t publish a public Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). When I tried to compile the Attention layers, the driver kept spitting out an undocumented error: &lt;code&gt;REGTASK Overflow (0xe010)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hypothesized this was a memory overflow. Even though the model parameters are small (~96M), the intermediate activation matrices for a 1024-token sequence are huge (~25MB).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote a script to generate synthetic ONNX graphs to probe the hardware limits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;8KB Tensor: Pass.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;16KB Tensor: Pass.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;32KB Tensor: Pass.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;32.1KB Tensor: CRASH.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discovery: The NPU has a hardware-enforced 32KB L1 SRAM Scratchpad for vector operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard compiler was trying to shove a 25MB Attention matrix into a 32KB slot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Fix: Nano-Tiling &amp;amp; The “Poison Pill”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To solve the 32KB limit, I wrote a “Nano-Tiling” algorithm in PyTorch. I manually sliced the massive 1024-token sequence into tiny &lt;code&gt;32x32&lt;/code&gt; tiles that fit perfectly into the 32KB scratchpad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here is where it got messy. The &lt;code&gt;rknn&lt;/code&gt; compiler is “smart.” It looked at my tiled graph, decided it was inefficient, and fused the operators back together into a single giant block… which immediately crashed the hardware again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had to trick the compiler. I needed a way to tell it: “Do not merge these nodes.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I introduced a topological barrier I call the “Poison Pill.” I injected a dummy operation that looks mathematically significant to the dependency graph (preventing fusion) but is mathematically irrelevant to the model output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# The "Poison Pill"
# 1. Take a slice (forcing a strided access)
slice_x = x[..., :1]

# 2. Apply a non-linear op (breaks compiler fusion heuristics)
# 3. Scale it down to near-zero so it doesn't affect the math
poison = torch.sigmoid(slice_x) * 1e-6 

# 4. Inject dependency
# The compiler sees 'out' depends on 'poison' and creates a barrier.
out = out + poison
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By injecting this into the graph, I successfully forced the compiler to respect my tiling logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The “SigLIP Cliff”: Solving Accuracy Collapse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting it to run was step one. Getting it to be right was step two. When I first got the NPU running, the output was garbage. The cosine similarity compared to the original model was 0.02 (pure noise).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The culprit was the architecture of SigLIP. Unlike standard models, SigLIP has massive activation “spikes” (values around 300.0) sitting next to tiny visual signals (values around 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NPU quantization (INT8) works by mapping the range to -128/+127.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you zoom out to capture the 300.0, the 0.05 rounds down to 0. Signal lost.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you zoom in to capture the 0.05, the 300.0 overflows to infinity. Math crash.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I implemented a “Sandwich” Domain Shift:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; CPU Pre-Scale: Multiply the input by &lt;code&gt;0.1&lt;/code&gt;. Now the max value is 30.0 (Safe for FP16).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NPU Execution: Run the heavy compute in this scaled-down “safe zone.”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; CPU Post-Scale: Multiply the output by &lt;code&gt;10.0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This simple trick restored the signal fidelity from 0.02 to 0.999 (effectively bit-exact).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Architecture: Custom Runtime Scheduler&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, to bypass driver timeouts caused by the sheer number of tiles (thousands of tiny operations), I physically cut the model graph into 26 separate binary files (shards).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote a custom User-Space Runtime in Python that acts as an orchestrator. It manually loads these shards onto the RK3588’s 3 separate NPU cores and fires them in a synchronized round-robin schedule (Core 0 -&amp;gt; Core 1 -&amp;gt; Core 2).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By ignoring the vendor’s “Unsupported” warnings and re-architecting the software to match the silicon’s physical reality, the results were drastic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Metric&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;CPU Baseline (PyTorch)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;SHARD (My Method)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Latency&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~30.0 seconds&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&amp;lt; 1.8 seconds&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Speedup&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1x&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;15x&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Accuracy&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Reference&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.999 (FP32 Match)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project challenged the binary notion of “Supported Hardware.” The RK3588 didn’t support the SigLIP encoder out of the box on the standard SDK, but the silicon was always capable of it. It just needed an engineer to dig into the register overflow codes and manage the memory manually.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;MIT professor shot at his Massachusetts home dies&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Massachusetts university professor who was shot at his home has died, campus officials say.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nuno F Gomes Loureiro, 47, a nuclear science and engineering professor from Portugal, was shot "multiple times" on Monday and died on Tuesday morning in hospital, according to Brookline police and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) officials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Police said officers responded to a call for gunshots at an apartment at about 8:30pm local time. Loureiro was taken by ambulance to a Boston hospital, where he died on Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No one is in custody and police are treating the incident as "an active and ongoing homicide investigation", the Norfolk County District Attorney's Office said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CBS News, the BBC's US media partner, reported that a neighbour said he heard "three loud bangs" Monday evening and thought somebody in the apartment building was kicking in a door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long-time resident Anne Greenwald told CBS that the professor had a young family and went to school nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loureiro majored in Physics at Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon in 2000 and obtained a Phd in physics at Imperial College London in 2005, according to his faculty web page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The theoretical physicist and fusion scientist was known for his award-winning research in magnetised plasma dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Magnetised plasma dynamics is the study of the state of matter in which the motion of charged particles is influenced by the presence of an external magnetic field, according to Nature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loureiro joined MIT's faculty in 2016 and was named director of MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His research addressed "complex problems lurking at the center of fusion vacuum chambers and at the edges of the universe", according to the university's obituary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He also studied how to harness clean "fusion power" to combat climate change, CBS said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Our deepest sympathies are with his family, students, colleagues, and all those who are grieving," an MIT spokesperson said in a statement provided to the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The university added that "focused outreach and conversations" are taking place within the MIT community to offer care and support for those who knew the professor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The centre's preceding director, Dennis Whyte, described Loureiro as both a brilliant scientist and a brilliant person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"He shone a bright light as a mentor, friend, teacher, colleague and leader, and was universally admired for his articulate, compassionate manner," Mr Whyte told MIT News.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deepto Chakrabarty, the head of MIT's department of physics, echoed those sentiments and said that Loureiro was a champion of plasma physics and that his recent research was "a particularly exciting new scientific direction".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Correction 16 December: An earlier version of this story incorrectly defined the kind of plasma that Professor Loureiro researched.&lt;/p&gt;
