    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;An Update on Heroku&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Last Updated: February 06, 2026&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, Heroku is transitioning to a sustaining engineering model focused on stability, security, reliability, and support. Heroku remains an actively supported, production-ready platform, with an emphasis on maintaining quality and operational excellence rather than introducing new features. We know changes like this can raise questions, and we want to be clear about what this means for customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no change for customers using Heroku today. Customers who pay via credit card in the Heroku dashboard—both existing and new—can continue to use Heroku with no changes to pricing, billing, service, or day-to-day usage. Core platform functionality, including applications, pipelines, teams, and add-ons, is unaffected, and customers can continue to rely on Heroku for their production, business-critical workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enterprise Account contracts will no longer be offered to new customers. Existing Enterprise subscriptions and support contracts will continue to be fully honored and may renew as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why this change&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re focusing our product and engineering investments on areas where we can deliver the greatest long-term customer value, including helping organizations build and deploy enterprise-grade AI in a secure and trusted way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Waymo World Model: A New Frontier For Autonomous Driving Simulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Waymo Driver has traveled nearly 200 million fully autonomous miles, becoming a vital part of the urban fabric in major U.S. cities and improving road safety. What riders and local communities don’t see is our Driver navigating billions of miles in virtual worlds, mastering complex scenarios long before it encounters them on public roads. Today, we are excited to introduce the Waymo World Model, a frontier generative model that sets a new bar for large-scale, hyper-realistic autonomous driving simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simulation is a critical component of Waymo’s AI ecosystem and one of the three key pillars of our approach to demonstrably safe AI. The Waymo World Model, which we detail below, is the component that is responsible for generating hyper-realistic simulated environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Waymo World Model is built upon Genie 3—Google DeepMind's most advanced general-purpose world model that generates photorealistic and interactive 3D environments—and is adapted for the rigors of the driving domain. By leveraging Genie’s immense world knowledge, it can simulate exceedingly rare events—from a tornado to a casual encounter with an elephant—that are almost impossible to capture at scale in reality. The model’s architecture offers high controllability, allowing our engineers to modify simulations with simple language prompts, driving inputs, and scene layouts. Notably, the Waymo World Model generates high-fidelity, multi-sensor outputs that include both camera and lidar data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This combination of broad world knowledge, fine-grained controllability, and multi-modal realism enhances Waymo’s ability to safely scale our service across more places and new driving environments. In the following sections we showcase the Waymo World Model in action, featuring simulations of the Waymo Driver navigating diverse rare edge-case scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🌎 Emergent Multimodal World Knowledge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most simulation models in the autonomous driving industry are trained from scratch based on only the on-road data they collect. That approach means the system only learns from limited experience. Genie 3’s strong world knowledge, gained from its pre-training on an extremely large and diverse set of videos, allows us to explore situations that were never directly observed by our fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through our specialized post-training, we are transferring that vast world knowledge from 2D video into 3D lidar outputs unique to Waymo’s hardware suite. While cameras excel at depicting visual details, lidar sensors provide valuable complementary signals like precise depth. The Waymo World Model can generate virtually any scene—from regular, day-to-day driving to rare, long-tail scenarios—across multiple sensor modalities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;🌪️ Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;💥 Rare and safety-critical events&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;🐘 Long-tail (pun intended!) objects and more&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the interactive viewers below, you can immersively view the realistic 4D point clouds generated by the Waymo World Model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🕹️ Strong Simulation Controllability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Waymo World Model offers strong simulation controllability through three main mechanisms: driving action control, scene layout control, and language control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Driving action control allows us to have a responsive simulator that adheres to specific driving inputs. This enables us to simulate “what if” counterfactual events such as whether the Waymo Driver could have safely driven more confidently instead of yielding in a particular situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Counterfactual driving. We demonstrate simulations both under the original route in a past recorded drive, or a completely new route. While purely reconstructive simulation methods (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splats, or 3DGS) suffer from visual breakdowns due to missing observations when the simulated route is too different from the original driving, the fully learned Waymo World Model maintains good realism and consistency thanks to its strong generative capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scene layout control allows for customization of the road layouts, traffic signal states, and the behavior of other road users. This way, we can create custom scenarios via selective placement of other road users, or applying custom mutations to road layouts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scene layout conditioning following&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Language control is our most flexible tool that allows us to adjust time-of-day, weather conditions, or even generate an entirely synthetic scene (such as the long-tail scenarios shown previously).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;World Mutation - Time of Day&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;World Mutation - Weather&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🎞️ Converting Dashcam Videos&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During a scenic drive, it is common to record videos of the journey on mobile devices or dashcams, perhaps capturing piled up snow banks or a highway at sunset. The Waymo World Model can convert those kinds of videos, or any taken with a regular camera, into a multimodal simulation—showing how the Waymo Driver would see that exact scene. This process enables the highest degree of realism and factuality, since simulations are derived from actual footage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;⚙️ Scalable Inference&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some scenes we want to simulate may take longer to play out, for example, negotiating passage in a narrow lane. That’s harder to do because the longer the simulation, the tougher it is to compute and maintain stable quality. However, through a more efficient variant of the Waymo World Model, we can simulate longer scenes with dramatic reduction in compute while maintaining high realism and fidelity to enable large-scale simulations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;🚀 Long rollout (4x speed playback) on an efficient variant of the Waymo World Model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By simulating the “impossible”, we proactively prepare the Waymo Driver for some of the most rare and complex scenarios. This creates a more rigorous safety benchmark, ensuring the Waymo Driver can navigate long-tail challenges long before it encounters them in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a tool that encrypts files and splits the decryption key among trusted friends using Shamir's Secret Sharing. For example, you can give pieces to 5 friends and require any 3 of them to cooperate to recover the key. No single friend can access your data alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each friend receives a self-contained bundle with &lt;code&gt;recover.html&lt;/code&gt;—a browser-based tool that works
        offline, with no servers or internet required. If this website disappears, recovery still works.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your file is encrypted, the key is split into shares, and friends combine shares to recover it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Your File → Encrypt → Split key into 5 shares → Distribute to friends&lt;lb/&gt; ↓&lt;lb/&gt; Any 3 friends → Combine shares → Decrypt → File recovered &lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;bundle-alice/recover.html&lt;/code&gt; in your browser&lt;p&gt;This is the best way to understand what your friends would experience during a real recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted a way to ensure trusted friends could access important files if something happened to me—without trusting any single person or service with everything. Shamir's Secret Sharing seemed like the right approach, but I couldn't find a tool that gave friends a simple, self-contained way to recover files together. So I built one. I'm sharing it in case it's useful to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;User Stories&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What designers and product managers like you have to say&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;âAs someone who often jumps into design work, Vecti is a game-changer. I can quickly mock up interfaces, share them with my team for feedback, and export clean assets, all without leaving my flow.â&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;âI finally found a design tool where I can collaborate seamlessly with developers and stakeholders. No more endless email threads. The permission controls and presentation mode have completely transformed how I run design reviews.â&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;âVecti's interface felt instantly familiar, but the performance with my massive design system? Night and day difference. I'm never going back.â&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;About&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Our Story&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;After nearly two decades in UI and design, I saw an opportunity to build something different, a design tool with a better philosophy. So I built it. Vecti is a browser-based UI design tool built from the ground up with one core belief, that creators deserve tools built specifically for them. Better performance, better privacy, and better alignment with their actual needs. A tool that just works, built by someone who genuinely cares about the people using it.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Serge @ Vecti&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Founder&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To give designers and developers a design tool they can trust. We prioritize performance, privacy, and creative freedom. Vecti is built and based in the EU, following European privacy standards. We're transparent about how we operate. Design software should serve creators first - that's our commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our Vision&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A world where design tools are built with the community, not imposed on them. Where solo creators and small teams have access to professional-grade software that respects them. We're building Vecti to be that tool-performant, transparent, and genuinely aligned with the people who use it every day. This is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experimental - This project is still in development, and not ready for the prime time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A minimal, secure Python interpreter written in Rust for use by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monty avoids the cost, latency, complexity and general faff of using a full container based sandbox for running LLM generated code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, it lets you safely run Python code written by an LLM embedded in your agent, with startup times measured in single digit microseconds not hundreds of milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Monty can do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run a reasonable subset of Python code - enough for your agent to express what it wants to do&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Completely block access to the host environment: filesystem, env variables and network access are all implemented via external function calls the developer can control&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Call functions on the host - only functions you give it access to&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run typechecking - monty supports full modern python type hints and comes with ty included in a single binary to run typechecking&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Be snapshotted to bytes at external function calls, meaning you can store the interpreter state in a file or database, and resume later&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Startup extremely fast (&amp;lt;1μs to go from code to execution result), and has runtime performance that is similar to CPython (generally between 5x faster and 5x slower)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Be called from Rust, Python, or Javascript - because Monty has no dependencies on cpython, you can use it anywhere you can run Rust&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Control resource usage - Monty can track memory usage, allocations, stack depth, and execution time and cancel execution if it exceeds preset limits&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Collect stdout and stderr and return it to the caller&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run async or sync code on the host via async or sync code on the host&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Monty cannot do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use the standard library (except a few select modules: &lt;code&gt;sys&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;typing&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;asyncio&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;dataclasses&lt;/code&gt;(soon),&lt;code&gt;json&lt;/code&gt;(soon))&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use third party libraries (like Pydantic), support for external python library is not a goal&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;define classes (support should come soon)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;use match statements (again, support should come soon)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, Monty is extremely limited and designed for one use case:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To run code written by agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For motivation on why you might want to do this, see:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Codemode from Cloudflare&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Programmatic Tool Calling from Anthropic&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code Execution with MCP from Anthropic&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Smol Agents from Hugging Face&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In very simple terms, the idea of all the above is that LLMs can work faster, cheaper and more reliably if they're asked to write Python (or Javascript) code, instead of relying on traditional tool calling. Monty makes that possible without the complexity of a sandbox or risk of running code directly on the host.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: Monty will (soon) be used to implement &lt;code&gt;codemode&lt;/code&gt; in Pydantic AI&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monty can be called from Python, JavaScript/TypeScript or Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To install:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uv add pydantic-monty&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Or &lt;code&gt;pip install pydantic-monty&lt;/code&gt; for the boomers)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usage:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from typing import Any

    &lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;start()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;resume()&lt;/code&gt; to handle external function calls iteratively,
giving you control over each call:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import pydantic_monty

code = """

len(data)
"""

m = pydantic_monty.Monty(code, inputs=['url'], external_functions=['fetch'])

#&amp;gt; &amp;lt;class 'pydantic_monty.MontySnapshot'&amp;gt;
print(result.function_name)  # fetch
#&amp;gt; fetch
print(result.args)
#&amp;gt; ('https://example.com',)

# Perform the actual fetch, then resume with the result

print(type(result))
#&amp;gt; &amp;lt;class 'pydantic_monty.MontyComplete'&amp;gt;
print(result.output)
#&amp;gt; 11&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both &lt;code&gt;Monty&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MontySnapshot&lt;/code&gt; can be serialized to bytes and restored later.
This allows caching parsed code or suspending execution across process boundaries:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import pydantic_monty

# Serialize parsed code to avoid re-parsing
m = pydantic_monty.Monty('x + 1', inputs=['x'])

assert_eq!(result, MontyObject::Int(55));&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MontyRun&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RunProgress&lt;/code&gt; can be serialized using the &lt;code&gt;dump()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;load()&lt;/code&gt; methods:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;use monty::{MontyRun, MontyObject, NoLimitTracker, StdPrint};

assert_eq!(result, MontyObject::Int(42));&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monty will power code-mode in Pydantic AI. Instead of making sequential tool calls, the LLM writes Python code that calls your tools as functions and Monty executes it safely.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are generally two responses when you show people Monty:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Oh my god, this solves so many problems, I want it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Why not X?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where X is some alternative technology. Oddly often these responses are combined, suggesting people have not yet found an alternative that works for them, but are incredulous that there's really no good alternative to creating an entire Python implementation from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll try to run through the most obvious alternatives, and why there aren't right for what we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE: all these technologies are impressive and have widespread uses, this commentary on their limitations for our use case should not be seen as a criticism. Most of these solutions were not conceived with the goal of providing an LLM sandbox, which is why they're not necessary great at it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;See ./scripts/startup_performance.py for the script used to calculate the startup performance numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Details on each row below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Language completeness: No classes (yet), limited stdlib, no third-party libraries&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Security: Explicitly controlled filesystem, network, and env access, strict limits on execution time and memory usage&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start latency: Starts in microseconds&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Setup complexity: just &lt;code&gt;pip install pydantic-monty&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;npm install @pydantic/monty&lt;/code&gt;, ~4.5MB download&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File mounting: Strictly controlled, see #85&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Snapshotting: Monty's pause and resume functionality with &lt;code&gt;dump()&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;load()&lt;/code&gt;makes it trivial to pause, resume and fork execution&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Language completeness: Full CPython with any library&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Security: Process and filesystem isolation, network policies, but container escapes exist, memory limitation is possible&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start latency: Container startup overhead (~195ms measured)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Setup complexity: Requires Docker daemon, container images, orchestration, &lt;code&gt;python:3.14-alpine&lt;/code&gt;is 50MB - docker can't be installed from PyPI&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File mounting: Volume mounts work well&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Snapshotting: Possible with durable execution solutions like Temporal, or snapshotting an image and saving it as a Docker image.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Language completeness: Full CPython compiled to WASM, almost all libraries available&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Security: Relies on browser/WASM sandbox - not designed for server-side isolation, python code can run arbitrary code in the JS runtime, only deno allows isolation, memory limits are hard/impossible to enforce with deno&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start latency: WASM runtime loading is slow (~2800ms cold start)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Setup complexity: Need to load WASM runtime, handle async initialization, pyodide NPM package is ~12MB, deno is ~50MB - Pyodide can't be called with just PyPI packages&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File mounting: Virtual filesystem via browser APIs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Snapshotting: Possible with durable execution solutions like Temporal presumably, but hard&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See starlark-rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Language completeness: Configuration language, not Python - no classes, exceptions, async&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Security: Deterministic and hermetic by design&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start latency: runs embedded in the process like Monty, hence impressive startup time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Setup complexity: Usable in python via starlark-pyo3&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File mounting: No file handling by design AFAIK?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Snapshotting: Impossible AFAIK?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Services like Daytona, E2B, Modal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are similar challenges, more setup complexity but lower network latency for setting up your own sandbox setup with k8s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Language completeness: Full CPython with any library&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Security: Professionally managed container isolation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start latency: Network round-trip and container startup time. I got ~1s cold start time with Daytona EU from London, Daytona advertise sub 90ms latency, presumably that's for an existing container, not clear if it includes network latency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cost: Pay per execution or compute time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Setup complexity: API integration, auth tokens - fine for startups but generally a non-start for enterprises&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File mounting: Upload/download via API calls&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Snapshotting: Possible with durable execution solutions like Temporal, also the services offer some solutions for this, I think based con docker containers&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running Python directly via &lt;code&gt;exec()&lt;/code&gt; (~0.1ms) or subprocess (~30ms).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Language completeness: Full CPython with any library&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Security: None - full filesystem, network, env vars, system commands&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start latency: Near-zero for &lt;code&gt;exec()&lt;/code&gt;, ~30ms for subprocess&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Setup complexity: None&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File mounting: Direct filesystem access (that's the problem)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Snapshotting: Possible with durable execution solutions like Temporal&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a demo for how you can turn an ESP32-S3 microcontroller into a tiny instant-on PC with its own shell, editor, compiler, and online apps installer. Something like Raspberry Pi, minus the overhead of a full server/desktop grade OS. I think ESP32 is underrated in hobby maker community for this PC-like use case. This demo uses BreezyBox, my mini-shell ESP-IDF component.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First of all, seeing is believing (click to watch the video):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It started as a "cyberdeck" style crafting project. Then I got carried away with the software part. I chose ESP32-S3 for the base platform. It has the nostalgic appeal of the DOS era PCs, with similar resources, and elbow-deep-in-bytes coding experience, plus modern wireless comms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ESP32-S3 can do everything those PCs did and more, but that is inconvenient out of the box, because that is not the commercial use case it is positioned for. It also forces away the code bloat. If you are like me, and love small elegant things, and technology that punches way above its weight, you ought to try it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So anyway, I decided to try and package some key missing parts: a basic vterm, the current working directory (CWD) tracking, a few familiar UNIX-like commands, and an app installer. Believe it or not, the rest is already there in ESP-IDF components, including the elf_loader with dynamic linking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is called "BreezyBox", by analogy with the BusyBox commands suite. The name is just a light joke, it is not meant to be a full clone. You can import it with one command in your ESP-IDF project, and if you have some stdio going, even at "Hello World" level, it should mostly just work. I call it a "mini shell", a naïve user might call it an OS (it is not, it runs on FreeRTOS), and you can also call it the userland layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The BreezyBox component leaves the display and other board configuration details to the user's firmware project, providing mainly the vterm/vfs features, and some shell commands. This particular example/demo project supports only one specific dev board: Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7B (no affiliation). But you can see how all the parts connect, and adapt it to your display/board, or just copy some code snippets from here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suggest just fork it, clone it, and try to make it work on your board. Mine was about 40€; you can start with some random $10 two inch LCD S3 dev board if you like. Hint: LVGL text label control is the easiest path to stdout on LCD that works almost everywhere. You can also start with a headless board over USB console, that takes zero code, and gives you free ANSI codes in standard IDF Monitor in VSCode (or in Tabby).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You do not have to write your own font renderer like I did here; that was just to push past 30 FPS on a display slightly too large for this chip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is free software under MIT License.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best help is currently more testing beyond "works on my computer", more shared examples and fun use cases:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;More ELF apps – see the examples at my breezyapps repo, they are super easy to follow. Even a carefully written stdlib C program with no platform-specific bits may work sometimes, also with some ANSI codes. But be sure to verify on the actual ESP32-S3: the memory is tight, the larger PSRAM requires alignment, and there are other limits and quirks. You can publish and install the apps using your own repo.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;More full example firmware repositories: for different boards, with different styles. Maybe you provide the basic LVGL text label example on some popular board. Maybe you prefer C++ to plain C. Maybe you embrace the GUI. Maybe you port some retro games. Maybe you even make it work on P4, or C6 (RISC-V, a completely different CPU). Maybe you attach some cool gadgets to it. Maybe you build an extra cool cyberdeck case. Or maybe you reproduce the exact same thing, and just share your setup experience and hands-on impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be so cool to see more people using BreezyBox, and to have more ready-to-clone examples for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenCiv3 (formerly known by the codename “C7”) is an open-source, cross-platform, mod-oriented, modernized reimagining of Civilization III by the fan community built with the Godot Engine and C#, with capabilities inspired by the best of the 4X genre and lessons learned from modding Civ3. Our vision is to make Civ3 as it could have been, rebuilt for today’s modders and players: removing arbitary limits, fixing broken features, expanding mod capabilities, and supporting modern graphics and platforms. A game that can go beyond C3C but retain all of its gameplay and content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenCiv3 is under active development and currently in an early pre-alpha state. It is a rudimentary playable game but lacking many mechanics and late-game content, and errors are likely.

This is a major enhancement over the “Carthage” release, and our debut with standalone mode featuring placeholder graphics without the need for Civ3 media files. A local installation of Civ3 is still recommended for a more polished experience. See the release notes for a full list of new features in each version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenCiv3 Dutch Preview 1 with the same game in Standalone mode (top) and with imported Civ3 graphics (bottom)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download the appropriate zip file for your OS from the Dutch Preview 1 release&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All official releases of OpenCiv3 along with more detailed release notes can be found on the GitHub releases page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a Windows 64-bit executable. OpenCiv3 will look for a local installation of Civilization III in the Windows registry automatically, or you may use an environment variable to point to the files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;OpenCiv3.exe&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;CIV3_HOME&lt;/code&gt; pointing to it and restart OpenCiv3&lt;p&gt;This is an x86-64 Linux executable. You may use an environment variable to point to the files from a Civilization III installation. You can just copy or mount the top-level “Sid Meier’s Civilization III Complete” (Sans “Complete” if your install was from pre-Complete CDs) folder and its contents to your Linux system, or install the game via Steam or GOG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CIV3_HOME&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to point to the Civ3 files, e.g. &lt;code&gt;export CIV3_HOME="/path/to/civ3"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;CIV3_HOME&lt;/code&gt;, run &lt;code&gt;OpenCiv3.x86_64&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;.profile&lt;/code&gt; or equivalent.&lt;p&gt;This is a universal 64-bit executable, so it should run on both Intel and M1 Macs.

    &lt;p&gt;The fundamental modes of vocal fold vibration. Every sound you make lives somewhere on this spectrum. Master these before anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;De grundlæggende måder stemmebåndene vibrerer på. Enhver lyd du laver befinder sig et sted på dette spektrum. Mestér disse før alt andet.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Chest VoiceYour speaking register. Thick vocal folds, full closure.Dit taleregister. Tykke stemmebånd, fuld lukning.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Rich, warm, powerful, grounded. Vibrations felt in upper torso. Fyldig, varm, kraftfuld, jordbunden. Vibrationer mærkes i brystkassen.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Johnny Cash, Adele (vers), Elvis Presley, Amy Winehouse&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt; Place hand on chest and speak — feel the buzz. That's chest resonance. Sing "Hey!" like calling someone across the street. Keep that forward, spoken quality as you move to pitch.&lt;p&gt;Exercise: "Hey man!" projection on scales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise: Speak-sing counting 1–10 Læg hånden på brystet og tal — mærk vibrationen. Det er brystresonans. Syng "Hej!" som om du kalder på nogen over gaden. Bevar den fremadrettede, talte kvalitet når du synger på tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: "Hej du!" projektion på skalaer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Talesyng og tæl 1–10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head&gt;CVT note&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In CVT, chest-dominant sounds are produced using Overdrive mode (shouty, direct, vowels: EH/OH) or Edge mode (sharp, twangy, vowels: I/EH/A/OE). See full mapping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I CVT produceres brystdominerede lyde med Overdrive-mode (råbende, direkte, vokaler: EH/OH) eller Edge-mode (skarp, twanget, vokaler: I/EH/A/OE). Se fuld kortlægning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Head VoiceThinner folds, full closure. Rich resonance in upper range.Tyndere stemmebånd, fuld lukning. Rig resonans i det høje register.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Lighter than chest but with depth and ring. Resonant, clear, projecting. Not breathy. Lettere end bryst, men med dybde og klang. Resonant, klar, projicerende. Ikke luftig.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Freddie Mercury, Whitney Houston, Pavarotti, Ariana Grande&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt; Imagine calling over a fence — "Hellooo?" That lifting feeling is head voice. Keep cord closure (no air leaking). The sound should ring, not whisper.&lt;p&gt;Exercise: "Hoo" on descending 5-note scales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise: "Wee" sirens from low to high Forestil dig at du kalder over et hegn — "Hallooo?" Den løftende fornemmelse er hovedklang. Bevar lukning af stemmebåndene (ingen luft slipper ud). Lyden skal ringe, ikke hviske.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: "Hoo" på nedadgående 5-tone skalaer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: "Wee" sirener fra lav til høj&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head&gt;CVT note&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In CVT, this corresponds to Neutral mode in fuller density — full fold closure with a lighter, non-metallic quality. All vowels are available. See full mapping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I CVT svarer dette til Neutral-mode i fuld densitet — fuld foldlukning med en lettere, ikke-metallisk kvalitet. Alle vokaler er tilgængelige. Se fuld kortlægning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Breathy, ethereal, flute-like, intimate. Lighter than head voice. Hollow quality. Luftig, æterisk, fløjteagtig, intim. Lettere end hovedklang. Hul kvalitet.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Barry Gibb, Jeff Buckley, Thom Yorke, Prince, Justin Timberlake&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt; Sigh gently on a high note — that airy release is falsetto. The vocal folds thin out and partially separate. Don't push volume; let it be light.&lt;p&gt;Exercise: Gentle sighs down 5-note scale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise: "Hoo" (like an owl) on high notes Suk blidt på en høj tone — den luftige løsladelse er falset. Stemmebåndene bliver tynde og adskilles delvist. Pres ikke volumen; lad det være let.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Bløde suk ned ad 5-tone skala&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: "Hoo" (som en ugle) på høje toner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head&gt;CVT note&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In CVT, falsetto is classified as Neutral mode in reduced density or "falsetto" configuration — thin, hollow sound requiring minimal support energy. See full mapping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I CVT klassificeres falset som Neutral-mode i reduceret densitet eller "falset"-konfiguration — tynd, hul lyd der kræver minimal støtteenergi.

        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Powerful high notes that feel connected and full. Seamless transition through registers. Kraftige høje toner der føles forbundne og fyldte. Sømløs overgang mellem registre.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Freddie Mercury, Brendon Urie, Beyoncé, Chris Cornell, Ariana Grande&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt; The bridge between chest and head — neither cracks nor flips. Start with bratty "Nay" on scales to force cord closure while ascending. Shade vowels toward "OH/OO" as you go higher.&lt;p&gt;Exercise: Bratty "Nay" on octave scales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise: "Gee" ascending (keeps cords together)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise: "Gug" for chest-to-head bridge Broen mellem bryst og hoved — hverken knak eller flip. Start med frækt "Næ" på skalaer for at tvinge stemmebåndene sammen under stigning. Skift vokaler mod "OH/OO" jo højere du synger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Frækt "Næ" på oktavskalaer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: "Gee" opadgående (holder båndene sammen)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: "Gug" for bryst-til-hoved bro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head&gt;CVT note&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVT doesn't use the term "mixed voice." The seamless transition between registers is achieved by switching between modes — typically Curbing (restrained, held back) or Edge (sharp, twangy) through the passaggio. See full mapping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVT bruger ikke begrebet "mixstemme." Den sømløse overgang mellem registre opnås ved at skifte mellem modes — typisk Curbing (tilbageholdt) eller Edge (skarp, twanget) gennem passaggioen. Se fuld kortlægning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Loud, bright, ringing, emotionally intense. Like a controlled shout. The "money note" sound. Høj, lys, klingende, emotionelt intens. Som et kontrolleret råb. "Pengene-tonen."&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, Freddie Mercury, Beyoncé, Idina Menzel&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt; Good belting = right balance of chest and head, not just yelling. Open mouth naturally, jaw relaxed. Breath support from diaphragm. Bright, forward vowels. Think "calling out" not "pushing up."&lt;p&gt;Exercise: "Hey man!" at increasing pitch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise: Bratty "Nae" on ascending 5ths God belting = den rette balance mellem bryst og hoved, ikke bare at råbe. Åbn munden naturligt, kæben afslappet. Åndedrætssstøtte fra mellemgulvet. Lyse, fremadrettede vokaler. Tænk "kald ud" ikke "pres op."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: "Hej du!" på stigende tonehøjde&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Frækt "Næ" på stigende kvinter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;⚠ Bad belting (pure chest pushed high) causes strain and nodules. Never belt without warming up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;⚠ Dårlig belting (ren bryst presset højt op) forårsager belastning og knuder. Belt aldrig uden opvarmning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head&gt;CVT note&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In CVT, belting is achieved through Overdrive mode (vowels: EH, OH — max D5 for women, C5 for men) or Edge mode (vowels: I, EH, A, OE — wider range). It's not "pushing chest voice up" but a specific vocal tract configuration. See full mapping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I CVT opnås belting gennem Overdrive-mode (vokaler: EH, OH — maks D5 for kvinder, C5 for mænd) eller Edge-mode (vokaler: I, EH, A, OE — bredere register). Det er ikke at "presse bryststemmen op" men en specifik stemmekanalskonfiguration. Se fuld kortlægning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt; Think of a duck quacking, or a witch cackling "nyah nyah!" That nasal, buzzy quality is twang. It narrows the vocal tract, amplifying sound. Hugely useful for projection without strain.&lt;p&gt;Exercise: Quack like a duck on scales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise: "Nyah nyah" bratty sound, ascending Tænk på en and der rapper, eller en heks der kagler "næh næh!" Den nasale, summende kvalitet er twang. Det indsnævrer stemmekanalen og forstærker lyden. Enormt nyttigt til projektion uden belastning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Rap som en and på skalaer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: "Næh næh" frækt, opadgående&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head&gt;CVT note&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In CVT, "Necessary Twang" is one of the three foundational principles for all healthy singing — not just a style. It involves narrowing the epiglottic funnel for clarity and efficiency. Edge mode requires maximum twang. See full mapping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I CVT er "Nødvendig Twang" et af de tre grundlæggende principper for al sund sang — ikke blot en stilart. Det indebærer indsnævring af den epiglottiske tragt for klarhed og effektivitet. Edge-mode kræver maksimal twang. Se fuld kortlægning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Allows high notes to sound open and free instead of squeezed. Invisible to the audience. Får høje toner til at lyde åbne og frie i stedet for klemte. Usynligt for publikum.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Chris Cornell, Pavarotti, Beyoncé — alle store sangere&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt; As you sing higher, narrow your vowels slightly. "AH" → "UH", "EE" → "IH", "AY" → "EH". This matches the resonant frequency of your vocal tract to the pitch.&lt;p&gt;Exercise: Sing "Ah" up a scale, let it shade to "Uh" above the break&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise: "Me" → "Meh" → "Muh" ascending Jo højere du synger, desto mere indsnævrer du vokalerne. "AH" → "UH", "EE" → "IH", "AY" → "EH".

Overdrive: EH, OH only. Edge: I, EH, A, OE only. Curbing: UH, O, OO only. Neutral: all vowels. Instead of gradually shading vowels, CVT singers choose the right mode for the vowel and pitch. See full mapping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVT håndterer dette anderledes: hver mode har strenge vokalregler. Overdrive: kun EH, OH. Edge: kun I, EH, A, OE. Curbing: kun UH, O, OO. Neutral: alle vokaler. I stedet for gradvist at ændre vokaler vælger CVT-sangere den rette mode til vokal og tonehøjde. Se fuld kortlægning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt; Do NOT squeeze your throat. Healthy grit comes from structures above the cords (false folds, overtone saturation). Start with a light dog-growl. Think "witch cackle." Keep throat relaxed — tighten only diaphragm.&lt;p&gt;Exercise: Light dog growl on sustained notes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise: Witch cackle → bring into pitched singing Pres IKKE halsen sammen. Sund grit kommer fra strukturer over stemmebåndene (falske folder, overtonemætning). Start med et let hundegrynt. Tænk "heksekaglen." Hold halsen afslappet — stram kun mellemgulvet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Let hundegrynt på holdte toner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Heksekaglen → bring ind i tonesang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;⚠ If it hurts, stop immediately.

See full mapping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVT klassificerer grit/rasp som en effekt der kan lægges oven på enhver mode.

Syng aldrig igennem smerte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head&gt;CVT note — terminologyCVT note — terminologi&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terminology alert: In CVT, "Overdrive" is a clean vocal mode (direct, shouty, like calling out) — not distortion. This guide uses "overdrive" in its traditional sense, like guitar overdrive (= heavy distortion). CVT calls these textures effects (Distortion, Growl, Rattle, Creaking) that are layered on top of any mode. See full mapping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terminologisk note: I CVT er "Overdrive" en ren vokalmode (direkte, råbende, som at kalde højt) — ikke forvrængning. Denne guide bruger "overdrive" i traditionel forstand, som guitar-overdrive (= tung forvrængning). CVT kalder disse teksturer effekter (Distortion, Growl, Rattle, Creaking) der lægges oven på enhver mode. Se fuld kortlægning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

Curbing naturally produces a vulnerable, emotional sound. See full mapping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I CVT er den emotionelle "græde"-kvalitet tæt forbundet med Curbing-mode — tilbageholdt, med en "let hold"-fornemmelse.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A short introduction to RLHF and post-training focused on language models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become an important technical and storytelling tool to deploy the latest machine learning systems. In this book, we hope to give a gentle introduction to the core methods for people with some level of quantitative background. The book starts with the origins of RLHF – both in recent literature and in a convergence of disparate fields of science in economics, philosophy, and optimal control. We then set the stage with definitions, problem formulation, data collection, and other common math used in the literature. The core of the book details every optimization stage in using RLHF, from starting with instruction tuning to training a reward model and finally all of rejection sampling, reinforcement learning, and direct alignment algorithms. The book concludes with advanced topics – understudied research questions in synthetic data and evaluation – and open questions for the field.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Software Engineering is back&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Coding agents have replaced every framework I used&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t post a lot. But when I do, it’s because I think few people are saying out loud what I’m noticing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been building a product from the ground up. Not the “I spun up a Next.js template” kind of ground up. I mean from network configuration to product design to pricing decisions. Truly end to end. And I’ve been doing it using frontier models and coding agents for hours and hours every single day, both on this project and in my full time work. I’ve been trying to stay away from the chaos and the hype, filtering hard for what is actually valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since December 2025, things have dramatically changed for the better. Many have noticed. Few are drawing the right conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Automated Programming&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Antirez likes to call it “automated programming”, and I really like that framing. It captures the essence far better than the shallow, almost dismissive label of “vibe coding”. Automation was at the core of most of the work and cultural revolutions of human history. The printing press, the loom, the assembly line. This one doesn’t differ much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of my work is still there. I still have to deeply think about every important aspect of what I want to build. The architecture, the trade offs, the product decisions, the edge cases that will bite you at 3am. What’s gone is the tearing, exhausting manual labour of typing every single line of code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point in time, models and tools, when put in a clean and maniacally well set up environment, can truly make the difference. I can be the architect without the wearing act of laying every single brick and spreading the mortar. I can design the dress without the act of cutting and sewing each individual piece of fabric. But I can do all of this with the experience on my back of having laid the bricks, spread the mortar, cut and sewn for twenty years. If I don’t like something, I can go in, understand it and fix it as I please, instructing once and for all my setup to do what I want next time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automated programming especially allows me to quickly build the tools I need so fast that every blacksmith that ever existed on this earth would envy me deeply. Finally able to really focus on the things they have in mind. Finally dedicating more time of their craft to the art they conceive, not the sweat of the forge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Epiphany&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s been months now that I have this thought crystallized in my mind. It is so clear to me that I genuinely don’t understand why everyone is not screaming it to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can finally get rid of all that middle work. That adapting layer of garbage we blindly accepted during these years. A huge amount of frameworks and libraries and tooling that has completely polluted software engineering, especially in web, mobile and desktop development. Layers upon layers of abstractions that abstract nothing meaningful, that solve problems we shouldn’t have had in the first place, that create ten new problems for every one they claim to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think about what happened. We, as an industry, looked at the genuine complexity of building software and instead of sharpening our thinking, we bought someone else’s thinking off the shelf. We wrapped everything in frameworks like wrapping a broken leg in silk. It looks nice. The leg is still broken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The three problems frameworks solve (or claim to)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my mind, besides the self declared objectives, frameworks solve three problems. Two explicit and one obvious but never declared.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Simplification”. Software engineers are scared of designing things themselves. They would rather accept someone else’s structure, despite having to force fit it into their product, rather than taking the time to start from the goal and work backwards to create the perfect suit for their idea. Like an architect blindly accepting another architect’s blueprints and applying them regardless of the context, the needs, the terrain, the new technological possibilities. We decided to remove complexity not by sharpening our mental models around the products we build, but by buying a one size fits all design and applying it everywhere. That is not simplification. That is intellectual surrender.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automation. This is the only point I can actually, more or less, understand and buy. Boilerplate is boring work. I hate it. And I especially hate using libraries that I then need to study, keep updated, be aware of vulnerabilities for, just for the purpose of removing the creation of duplicated but necessary code. Think about ORMs, CRUD management, code generation, API documentation and so on. The grunt work that nobody wants to do but everybody needs done. Fair enough. But hold that thought, because this is exactly the point where everything changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Labour cost. This is the quiet one. The one nobody puts on the conference slide. For companies, it is much better having Google, Meta, Vercel deciding for you how you build product and ship code. Adopt their framework. Pay the cost of lock in. Be enchanted by their cloud managed solution to host, deploy, store your stuff. And you unlock a feature that has nothing to do with engineering: you no longer need to hire a software engineer. You hire a React Developer. No need to train. Plug and play. Easy to replace. A cog in a machine designed by someone else, maintaining a system architected by someone else, solving problems defined by someone else. This is not engineering. This is operating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Software Engineering Is Back&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my opinion Software engineering, the true one, is back again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not speaking out of my lungs only. I’ve been developing this way almost flawlessly for over two years at this point. But the true revolution happened clearly last year, and since December 2025 this is obvious to anyone paying attention. From now on it will be even more so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have the chance again to get rid of useless complexity and keep working on the true and welcome complexity of our ideas, our features, our products. The complexity that matters. The complexity that is actually yours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automation and boilerplating have never been so cheap to overcome. I’ve been basically never writing twice the same line of code. I’m instantly building small tools I need, purpose built, exactly shaped around the problem at hand. I don’t need any fancy monorepo manager. A simple Makefile covers 100% of my needs for 99% of my use cases. When things will get very complicated, and if they get very complicated, I’ll think about it. But only then. Not a second before. This is engineering. You solve the problem you have, not the problem someone on a conference stage told you that you’ll eventually have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents are really well prepared when it comes to basic tools. Tools that have been around not for months, but literally for decades. Bash was born in 1989, just preceding me by two months. The most mediocre model running at this time knows bash better than any person in the world. Bash is the universal adapter. It is not a coincidence that coding agents are shifting from complex and expensive MCP configurations to a simple agent loop with bash as a way to interact, literally, with the world. The oldest tool turned out to be the most future proof. There’s a lesson in there if you care to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Think about it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why do you ever need, for most of the use cases you can think of, a useless, expensive, flawed, often vulnerable framework, and the parade of libraries that comes with it, that you probably use for only 10% of its capabilities? With all the costs associated with it. From the “least” expensive: operational costs like keeping everything updated because they once again found a critical vulnerability in your Next.js version. To the most expensive one: the cost to your Design Choices. The invisible cost. The one you pay every day without even realizing it, because you’ve been paying it so long you forgot what freedom felt like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you keep accepting this trade off, you are not only losing the biggest opportunity we’ve seen in software engineering in decades. You are probably not recognizing your own laziness in once again buying whatever the hyperscalers have decided for you. You’re letting Google and Meta and Vercel be your architect, your designer, your thinker. And in exchange, you get to be their operator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tools are here. The models are here. The revolution already happened and most people are still decorating the old house.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stop wrapping broken legs in silk. Start building things that are yours.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Stories From 25 Years of Software Development&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year, I completed 20 years in professional software development. I wanted to write a post to mark the occasion back then, but couldn't find the time. This post is my attempt to make up for that omission. In fact, I have been involved in software development for a little longer than 20 years. Although I had my first taste of computer programming as a child, it was only when I entered university about 25 years ago that I seriously got into software development. So I'll start my stories from there. These stories are less about software and more about people. Unlike many posts of this kind, this one offers no wisdom or lessons. It only offers a collection of stories. I hope you'll like at least a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;The CTF Scoreboard&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Viewing the Source&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The first story takes place in 2001, shortly after I joined university. One evening, I went to the university computer laboratory to browse the Web. Out of curiosity, I typed &lt;code&gt;susam.com&lt;/code&gt; into the address bar and landed on
  its
  home page.  I remember the text and banner looking much larger
  back then.  Display resolutions were lower, so they covered almost
  half the screen.  I knew very little about the Internet then and I
  was just trying to make sense of it.  I remember wondering what it
  would take to create my own website, perhaps at
  &lt;code&gt;susam.com&lt;/code&gt;.  That's when an older student who had been
  watching me browse over my shoulder approached and asked if I had
  created the website.  I told him I hadn't and that I had no idea how
  websites were made.  He asked me to move aside, took my seat and
  clicked View &amp;gt; Source in Internet Explorer.  He then explained
  how websites are made of HTML pages and how those pages are simply
  text instructions.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, he opened Notepad and wrote a simple HTML page that looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;BODY&amp;gt;&amp;lt;FONT COLOR="RED"&amp;gt;HELLO&amp;lt;/FONT&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/BODY&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Yes, we had a &lt;code&gt;FONT&lt;/code&gt; tag back then and it was common
  practice to write HTML tags in uppercase.  He then opened the page
  in a web browser and showed how it rendered.  After that, he
  demonstrated a few more features such as changing the font face and
  size, centring the text and altering the page's background colour.
  Although the tutorial lasted only about ten minutes, it made the
  World Wide Web feel far less mysterious and much more fascinating.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; That person had an ulterior motive though. After the tutorial, he never returned the seat to me. He just continued browsing the Web and waited for me to leave. I was too timid to ask for my seat back. Seats were limited, so I returned to my dorm room both disappointed that I couldn't continue browsing that day and excited about all the websites I might create with this newfound knowledge. I could never register &lt;code&gt;susam.com&lt;/code&gt; for myself though.
  That domain was always used by some business selling Turkish
  cuisines.  Eventually, I managed to get the next best thing:
  a &lt;code&gt;.net&lt;/code&gt; domain of my own.  That brief encounter in the
  university laboratory set me on a lifelong path of creating and
  maintaining personal websites.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Reset Vector&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The second story also comes from my university days. One afternoon, I was hanging out with my mates in the computer laboratory. In front of me was an MS-DOS machine powered by an Intel 8086 microprocessor, on which I was writing a lift control program in assembly. In those days, it was considered important to deliberately practise solving made-up problems as a way of honing our programming skills. As I worked on my program, my mind drifted to a small detail about the 8086 microprocessor that we had recently learnt in a lecture. Our professor had explained that, when the 8086 microprocessor is reset, execution begins with CS:IP set to FFFF:0000. So I murmured to anyone who cared to listen, 'I wonder if the system will reboot if I jump to FFFF:0000.' I then opened &lt;code&gt;DEBUG.EXE&lt;/code&gt; and jumped to that address.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;C:\&amp;gt;DEBUG -G =FFFF:0000&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The machine rebooted instantly. One of my friends, who topped the class every semester, had been watching over my shoulder. As soon as the machine restarted, he exclaimed, 'How did you do that?' I explained that the reset vector is located at physical address FFFF0 and that the CS:IP value FFFF:0000 maps to that address in real mode. After that, I went back to working on my lift control program and didn't think much more about the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About a week later, the same friend came to my dorm room. He sat down with a grave look on his face and asked, 'How did you know to do that? How did it occur to you to jump to the reset vector?' I must have said something like, 'It just occurred to me. I remembered that detail from the lecture and wanted to try it out.' He then said, 'I want to be able to think like that. I come top of the class every semester, but I don't think the way you do. I would never have thought of taking a small detail like that and testing it myself.' I replied that I was just curious to see whether what we had learnt actually worked in practice. He responded, 'And that's exactly it. It would never occur to me to try something like that. I feel disappointed that I keep coming top of the class, yet I am not curious in the same way you are. I've decided I don't want to top the class anymore. I just want to explore and experiment with what we learn, the way you do.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was all he said before getting up and heading back to his dorm room. I didn't take it very seriously at the time. I couldn't imagine why someone would willingly give up the accomplishment of coming first every year. But he kept his word. He never topped the class again. He still ranked highly, often within the top ten, but he kept his promise of never finishing first again. To this day, I feel a mix of embarrassment and pride whenever I recall that incident. With a single jump to the processor's reset entry point, I had somehow inspired someone to step back from academic competition in order to have more fun with learning. Of course, there is no reason one cannot do both. But in the end, that was his decision, not mine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Man in the Middle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my first job after university, I was assigned to a technical support team where part of my work involved running an installer to deploy a specific component of an e-banking product for customers, usually large banks. As I learnt to use the installer, I realised how fragile it was. The installer, written in Python, often failed because of incorrect assumptions about the target environment and almost always required some manual intervention to complete successfully. During my first week on the project, I spent much of my time stabilising the installer and writing a step-by-step user guide explaining how to use it. The result was well received by both my seniors and management. To my surprise, the user guide received more praise than the improvements I made to the installer itself. While the first few weeks were productive, I soon realised I would not find the work fulfilling for long. I wrote to management a few times to ask whether I could transfer to a team where I could work on something more substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My emails were initially met with resistance. After several rounds of discussion, however, someone who had heard about my situation reached out and suggested a team whose manager might be interested in interviewing me. The team was based in a different city. I was young and willing to relocate wherever I could find good work, so I immediately agreed to the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was in 2006, when video conferencing was not yet common. On the day of the interview, the hiring manager called me on my office desk phone. He began by introducing the team, which was called Archie, short for architecture. The team developed and maintained the web framework and core architectural components on which the entire e-banking product was built. The product had existed long before open source frameworks such as Spring or Django came into existence, so features such as API routing, authentication and authorisation layers, cookie management, etc. were all implemented in-house as Java Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP). Since the software was used in banking environments, it also had to pass strict security testing and regular audits to minimise the risk of serious flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The interview began well. He asked several questions related to software security, such as what SQL injection is and how it can be prevented or how one might design a web framework that mitigates cross-site scripting attacks. He also asked programming questions, most of which I answered pretty well. Towards the end, however, he asked how we could prevent MITM attacks. I had never heard the term, so I admitted that I did not know what MITM meant. He then asked, 'Man in the middle?' but I still had no idea what that meant or whether it was even a software engineering concept. He replied, 'Learn everything you can about PKI and MITM. We need to build a digital signatures feature for one of our corporate banking products. That's the first thing we'll work on.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks, I studied RFCs and documentation related to public key infrastructure, public key cryptography standards and related topics. At first, the material felt intimidating, but after spending time each evening reading whatever relevant literature I could find, things gradually began to make sense. Concepts that initially seemed complex and overwhelming eventually felt intuitive and elegant. I relocated to the new city a few weeks later and delivered the digital signatures feature about a month after joining the team. We used the open source Bouncy Castle library to implement the feature. After that project, I worked on other parts of the product too. The most rewarding part was knowing that the code I was writing became part of a mature product used by hundreds of banks and millions of users. It was especially satisfying to see the work pass security testing and audits and be considered ready for release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was my first real engineering job. My manager also turned out to be an excellent mentor. Working with him helped me develop new skills and his encouragement gave me confidence that stayed with me for years. Nearly two decades have passed since then, yet the product is still in service and continues to be actively developed. In fact, in my current phase of life I sometimes encounter it as a customer. Occasionally, I open the browser's developer tools to view the page source where I can still see traces of the HTML generated by code I wrote almost twenty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sphagetti Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around 2007 or 2008, I began working on a proof of concept for developing widgets for an OpenTV set-top box. The work involved writing code in a heavily trimmed-down version of C. One afternoon, while making good progress on a few widgets, I noticed that they would occasionally crash at random. I tried tracking down the bugs, but I was finding it surprisingly difficult to understand my own code. I had managed to produce some truly spaghetti code full of dubious pointer operations that were almost certainly responsible for the crashes, yet I could not pinpoint where exactly things were going wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ours was a small team of four people, each working on an independent proof of concept. The most senior person on the team acted as our lead and architect. Later that afternoon, I showed him my progress and explained that I was still trying to hunt down the bugs causing the widgets to crash. He asked whether he could look at the code. After going through it briefly and probably realising that it was a bit of a mess, he asked me to send him the code as a tarball, which I promptly did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He then went back to his desk to study the code. I remember thinking that there was no way he was going to find the problem anytime soon. I had been debugging it for hours and barely understood what I had written myself; it was the worst spaghetti code I had ever produced. With little hope of a quick solution, I went back to debugging on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barely five minutes later, he came back to my desk and asked me to open a specific file. He then showed me exactly where the pointer bug was. It had taken him only a few minutes not only to read my tangled code but also to understand it well enough to identify the fault and point it out. As soon as I fixed that line, the crashes disappeared. I was genuinely in awe of his skill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have always loved computing and programming, so I had assumed I was already fairly good at it. That incident, however, made me realise how much further I still had to go before I could consider myself a good software developer. I did improve significantly in the years that followed and today I am far better at managing software complexity than I was back then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Animated Television Widgets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In another project from that period, we worked on another set-top box platform that supported Java Micro Edition (Java ME) for widget development. One day, the same architect from the previous story asked whether I could add animations to the widgets. I told him that I believed it should be possible, though I'd need to test it to be sure. Before continuing with the story, I need to explain how the different stakeholders in the project were organised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our small team effectively played the role of the software vendor. The final product going to market would carry the brand of a major telecom carrier, offering direct-to-home (DTH) television services, with the set-top box being one of the products sold to customers. The set-top box was manufactured by another company. So the project was a partnership between three parties: our company as the software vendor, the telecom carrier and the set-top box manufacturer. The telecom carrier wanted to know whether widgets could be animated on screen with smooth slide-in and slide-out effects. That was why the architect approached me to ask whether it could be done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I began working on animating the widgets. Meanwhile, the architect and a few senior colleagues attended a business meeting with all the partners present. During the meeting, he explained that we were evaluating whether widget animations could be supported. The set-top box manufacturer immediately dismissed the idea, saying, 'That's impossible. Our set-top box does not support animation.' When the architect returned and shared this with us, I replied, 'I do not understand. If I can draw a widget, I can animate it too. All it takes is clearing the widget and redrawing it at slightly different positions repeatedly. In fact, I already have a working version.' I then showed a demo of the animated widgets running on the emulator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following week, the architect attended another partners' meeting where he shared updates about our animated widgets. I was not personally present, so what follows is second-hand information passed on by those who were there. I learnt that the set-top box company reacted angrily. For some reason, they were unhappy that we had managed to achieve results using their set-top box and APIs that they had officially described as impossible. They demanded that we stop work on animation immediately, arguing that our work could not be allowed to contradict their official position. At that point, the telecom carrier's representative intervened and bluntly told the set-top box representative to just shut up. If the set-top box guy was furious, the telecom guy was even more so, 'You guys told us animation was not possible and these people are showing that it is! You manufacture the set-top box. How can you not know what it is capable of?'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I continued working on the proof of concept. It worked very well in the emulator, but I did not yet have access to the actual hardware. The device was still in the process of being shipped to us, so all my early proof-of-concepts ran on the emulator. The following week, the architect planned to travel to the set-top box company's office to test my widgets on the real hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time, I was quite proud of demonstrating results that even the hardware maker believed were impossible. When the architect eventually travelled to test the widgets on the actual device, a problem emerged. What looked like buttery smooth animation on the emulator appeared noticeably choppy on a real television. Over the next few weeks, I experimented with frame rates, buffering strategies and optimising the computation done in the the rendering loop. Each week, the architect travelled for testing and returned with the same report: the animation had improved somewhat, but it still remained choppy. The modest embedded hardware simply could not keep up with the required computation and rendering. In the end, the telecom carrier decided that no animation was better than poor animation and dropped the idea altogether. So in the end, the set-top box developers turned out to be correct after all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Good Blessings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in 2009, after completing about a year at RSA Security, I began looking for work that felt more intellectually stimulating, especially projects involving mathematics and algorithms. I spoke with a few senior leaders about this, but nothing materialised for some time. Then one day, Dr Burt Kaliski, Chief Scientist at RSA Laboratories, asked to meet me to discuss my career aspirations. I have written about this in more detail in another post here: Good Blessings. I will summarise what followed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Kaliski met me and offered a few suggestions about the kinds of teams I might approach to find more interesting work. I followed his advice and eventually joined a team that turned out to be an excellent fit. I remained with that team for the next six years. During that time, I worked on parser generators, formal language specification and implementation, as well as indexing and querying engines of a petabyte-scale database. I learnt something new almost every day during those six years. It remains one of the most enjoyable periods of my career. I have especially fond memories of working on parser generators alongside remarkably skilled engineers from whom I learnt a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Years later, I reflected on how that brief meeting with Dr Kaliski had altered the trajectory of my career. I realised I was not sure whether I had properly expressed my gratitude to him for the role he had played in shaping my path. So I wrote to thank him and explain how much that single conversation had influenced my life. A few days later, Dr Kaliski replied, saying he was glad to know that the steps I took afterwards had worked out well. Before ending his message, he wrote this heart-warming note:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;‘One of my goals is to be able to provide encouragement to others who are developing their careers, just as others have invested in mine, passing good blessings from one generation to another.’&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The CTF Scoreboard&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This story comes from 2019. By then, I was no longer a twenty-something engineer just starting out. I was now a middle-aged staff engineer with years of experience building both low-level networking systems and database systems. Most of my work up to that point had been in C and C++. I was now entering a new phase of my career where I would be leading the development of microservices written in Go and Python. Like many people in this profession, computing has long been one of my favourite hobbies. So although my professional work for the previous decade had focused on C and C++, I had plenty of hobby projects in other languages, including Python and Go. As a result, switching gears from systems programming to application development was a smooth transition for me. I cannot even say that I missed working in C and C++. After all, who wants to spend their days occasionally chasing memory bugs in core dumps when you could be building features and delivering real value to customers?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In October 2019, during Cybersecurity Awareness Month, a Capture the Flag (CTF) event was organised at our office. The contest featured all kinds of technical puzzles, ranging from SQL injection challenges to insecure cryptography problems. Some challenges also involved reversing binaries and exploiting stack overflow issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am usually rather intimidated by such contests. The whole idea of competitive problem-solving under time pressure tends to make me nervous. But one of my colleagues persuaded me to participate in the CTF. And, somewhat to my surprise, I turned out to be rather good at it. Within about eight hours, I had solved roughly 90% of the puzzles. I finished at the top of the scoreboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my younger days, I was generally known to be a good problem solver. I was often consulted when thorny problems needed solving and I usually managed to deliver results. I also enjoyed solving puzzles. I had a knack for them and happily spent hours, sometimes days, working through obscure mathematical or technical puzzles and sharing detailed write-ups with friends of the nerd variety. Seen in that light, my performance at the CTF probably should not have surprised me. Still, I was very pleased. It was reassuring to know that I could still rely on my systems programming experience to solve obscure challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the course of the contest, my performance became something of a talking point in the office. Colleagues occasionally stopped by my desk to appreciate my progress in the CTF. Two much younger colleagues, both engineers I admired for their skill and professionalism, were discussing the results nearby. They were speaking softly, but I could still overhear parts of their conversation. Curious, I leaned slightly and listened a bit more carefully. I wanted to know what these two people, whom I admired a lot, thought about my performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of them remarked on how well I was doing in the contest. The other replied, 'Of course he is doing well. He has more than ten years of experience in C.' At that moment, I realised that no matter how well I solved those puzzles, the result would naturally be credited to experience. In my younger days, when I solved tricky problems like these, people would sometimes call me smart. Now people simply saw it as a consequence of my experience. Not that I particularly care for labels such as 'smart' anyway, but it did make me realise how things had changed. I was now simply the person with many years of experience. Solving technical puzzles that involved disassembling binaries, tracing execution paths and reconstructing program logic was expected rather than remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I continue to sharpen my technical skills to this day. While my technical results may now simply be attributed to experience, I hope I can continue to make a good impression through my professionalism, ethics and kindness towards the people I work with. If those leave a lasting impression, that is good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Software Factories And The Agentic Moment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built a Software Factory: non-interactive development where specs + scenarios drive agents that write code, run harnesses, and converge without human review.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The narrative form is included below. If you'd prefer to work from first principles, I offer a few constraints &amp;amp; guidelines that, applied iteratively, will accelerate any team toward the same intuitions, convictions1, and ultimately a factory2 of your own. In kōan or mantra form:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Why am I doing this? (implied: the model should be doing this instead)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In rule form:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code must not be written by humans&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code must not be reviewed by humans&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, in practical form:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you haven't spent at least $1,000 on tokens today per human engineer, your software factory has room for improvement&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The StrongDM AI Story&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On July 14th, 2025, Jay Taylor and Navan Chauhan joined me (Justin McCarthy, co-founder, CTO) in founding the StrongDM AI team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The catalyst was a transition observed in late 2024: with the second revision of Claude 3.5 (October 2024), long-horizon agentic coding workflows began to compound correctness rather than error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By December of 2024, the model's long-horizon coding performance was unmistakable via Cursor's YOLO mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to this model improvement, iterative application of LLMs to coding tasks would accumulate errors of all imaginable varieties (misunderstandings, hallucinations, syntax, version DRY violations, library incompatibility, etc). The app or product would decay and ultimately "collapse": death by a thousand cuts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together with YOLO mode, the updated model from Anthropic provided the first glimmer of what we now refer to internally as non-interactive development or grown software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Find Knobs, Turn To Eleven&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the first hour of the first day of our AI team, we established a charter which set us on a path toward a series of findings (which we refer to as our "unlocks"). In retrospect, the most important line in the charter document was the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially it was just a hunch. An experiment. How far could we get, without writing any code by hand?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not very far! At least: not very far, until we added tests. However, the agent, obsessed with the immediate task, soon began to take shortcuts: return true is a great way to pass narrowly written tests, but probably won't generalize to the software you want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tests were not enough. How about integration tests? Regression tests? End-to-end tests? Behavior tests?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;From Tests to Scenarios and Satisfaction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One recurring theme of the agentic moment: we need new language. For example, the word "test" has proven insufficient and ambiguous. A test, stored in the codebase, can be lazily rewritten to match the code. The code could be rewritten to trivially pass the test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We repurposed the word scenario to represent an end-to-end "user story", often stored outside the codebase (similar to a "holdout" set in model training), which could be intuitively understood and flexibly validated by an LLM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because much of the software we grow itself has an agentic component, we transitioned from boolean definitions of success ("the test suite is green") to a probabilistic and empirical one. We use the term satisfaction to quantify this validation: of all the observed trajectories through all the scenarios, what fraction of them likely satisfy the user?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Validating Scenarios in the Digital Twin Universe&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In previous regimes, a team might rely on integration tests, regression tests, UI automation to answer "is it working?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We noticed two limitations of previously reliable techniques:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tests are too rigid - we were coding with agents, but we're also building with LLMs and agent loops as design primitives; evaluating success often required LLM-as-judge&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tests can be reward hacked - we needed validation that was less vulnerable to the model cheating&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Digital Twin Universe is our answer: behavioral clones of the third-party services our software depends on. We built twins of Okta, Jira, Slack, Google Docs, Google Drive, and Google Sheets, replicating their APIs, edge cases, and observable behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the DTU, we can validate at volumes and rates far exceeding production limits. We can test failure modes that would be dangerous or impossible against live services. We can run thousands of scenarios per hour without hitting rate limits, triggering abuse detection, or accumulating API costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Unconventional Economics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our success with DTU illustrates one of the many ways in which the Agentic Moment has profoundly changed the economics of software. Creating a high fidelity clone of a significant SaaS application was always possible, but never economically feasible. Generations of engineers may have wanted a full in-memory replica of their CRM to test against, but self-censored the proposal to build it. They didn't even bring it to their manager, because they knew the answer would be no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those of us building software factories must practice a deliberate naivete: finding and removing the habits, conventions, and constraints of Software 1.0. The DTU is our proof that what was unthinkable six months ago is now routine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Read Next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Principles: what we believe is true about building software with agents&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Techniques: repeated patterns for applying those principles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Products: tools we use daily and believe others will benefit from&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading. We wish you the best of luck constructing your own Software Factory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1 We are not alone in these convictions. See also: Luke PM's "The Software Factory", Sam Schillace's "I Have Seen the Compounding Teams", and Dan Shapiro's "Five Levels from Spicy Autocomplete to the Software Factory".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2 Others are building factories too: Devin, 8090, Factory, Superconductor, and Jesse Vincent's Superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know he did other things than Larry, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We talked with Al Lowe about Leisure Suit Larry, but mostly other stuff. This was Roar’s first interview and he ran out of time before he could dive into what Al is mostly known for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al Lowe is an American software developer who started making games in the early eighties. His is mostly known for the Leisure Suit Larry games, created with Sierra, but he is also a musical man who loves playing his sax and still plays with his model trains. He has also created lots of other games for Sierra, not only the Larry series.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think Al is great, but you already know all you need to know about Larry, then this is the article for you. And it is pretty long. Get your coffee now, before continuing…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Have you ever been to Norway?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Oh yeah, sure. I have this eyeball right here. It works because I spent a week recuperating in the Department of Ophthalmology at Oslo University Hospital. I had a detached retina when we were flying into Oslo, and went to an ophthalmologist, and she said to get to the hospital right now. The next morning a bunch of Norwegian women started poking around in my eye and fixed it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, I was blind in that eye for the next week, and I was already blind in the other eye, so I wandered around in the dark while my wife went sightseeing. I went with her, but I didn’t see any sights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: So you have felt and smelt the beautiful fjords, but never seen them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, on an earlier trip, we did take the railroad to Bergen. Over the mountain plateau [Hardangervidda]. So we spent some time there, and that was fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I’ve never actually taken that trip myself, but I heard it’s wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: It was not for us. We got to the top, up in the top of the mountains. And the electricity went off. And so, we parked in the middle of this beautiful snowy scene for three hours, before they finally got the power back on. Then we went on our journey but we had already missed the connecting rides. We had booked a trip on a boat through the fjords, and a trip on the cog railway. We missed all of them. So be sure you go when there is electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah, we like to joke about that in Norway, the richest country in the world and the lousiest trains. I guess that is a good segue, because you do like trains, don’t you? At least model trains?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yes, I do. I’ve been a model railroader for most of my life. I got my first model train when I was 2 years old, and my dad wouldn’t let me play with it. So he ran it around the Christmas tree and I had to watch. But eventually, when I was 9 or 10, I got interested in HO size trains, and built a layout in our basement. Completely by myself, I had no idea what I was doing or anything, but I just learned as I went, piddled around and figured it out. I went to the hobby shop sometime and would say stuff like: How do you glue this stuff to this stuff? And they’d give me some special glue and and teach me how.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, it was fun. I learned a lot, and I proved that I could do things with my hands. I ended up learning a lot about wiring and electricity. And scenery, I did stuff with papier-mâché. I took old tomato sticks from our garden, cut them in different heights. I wrapped old screen door wire over the top of them and coated that with plaster to make mountains and stuff. So I did a lot of stuff, mostly things I’d read about in magazines, but I think it helped me understand that I could learn something if I didn’t already know it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Did you add any miniature figures or models and stuff like that in the scenery as well?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Sure, yeah, lots of stuff. In fact, I built buildings out of balsa wood. And I read an article in a magazine that said if you hold your X-Acto knife at just the right angle and drag it across the balsa wood, you can make clapboard siding, you know, where the siding overlaps. I also built doors from scraps of wood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, it was fun. It’s a fun hobby, and it served me for ten years at first. Then I went to college and started playing music, and I forgot about it. But then when my son was 10 years old I thought: I liked doing this when I was 10, maybe he will. So we went to the hobby shop and bought a bunch of trains. Of course he wasn’t interested at all, but I got hooked again! So for the last 35 years I’ve been doing N-scale trains, where the locomotive is about five inches long.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: So your son is 45, then?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yes!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yes, then you could have been my dad, because I’m 46.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, you’re the right age, then, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Model trains are not what they used to be&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I was sent a link to the National Model Railroad Association where you are mentioned as a member of the board of directors of the 4th Division of the Pacific Northwest region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: The Pacific Northwest Region of the NMRA, yeah. I did that for 10 years at least. Then I was assistant director for another 10 years so I worked at that organization for about 20 years. But recently I said: That’s enough, let some new blood come in. So we got new people now, and they’re much better, so I’m happy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: But you didn’t get any money for it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: No, no, it’s a volunteer organization. At first we did a paper newsletter every month. We would print and fold and staple and stamp and address-label hundreds of newsletters. I did that for a couple years until I finally convinced everybody that we’ve got to go online. So then I made a PDF, posted it, and we sent out an email. That was much better, but we still had a few die-hard people that would download it and print it out every time. I was part of this for 24 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Are there any physical magazines about model trains today?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yes. Well, the man who ran one of the biggest ones just passed away and so his magazine’s gone now, but there’s still a magazine called N Scale, and it’s housed right here in the suburb of Seattle. It is distributed all over the world. And then there’s the National Model Railroad Association, which publishes a magazine every month, all over the world. And then there’s Model Railroader and Railroad Model Craftsman. I know there’s one for each of the scales, for HO and S and O and G for garden railroads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: It’s an old hobby. A weird hobby, in that it follows my path. Most people get interested in trains when they’re little kids. And then they grow out of it in high school. Then later in life, they realize: I got time and money now. I could get back in it, this is a good hobby. And it really is. It’s great socially, because the group that I’m in have a layout that’s portable and we can bring it to shows. So 6-8 times a year we pack everything up into a trailer, move it to a place, and set it up. And we run trains all weekend, we talk with the public and hundreds of people come by and see my work. Then we pack it up and put it back in the trailer and then wait for the next show. So it doesn’t get old because it’s so long between shows. It’s really fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I guess there’s not that much development in the field, so even though you haven’t done it for 20 years, it’s not that hard to just continue where you left off?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Actually, it has changed completely with computers. So you couldn’t be more wrong! Actually, you were correct for 40 years at least. But in the 90s people started developing computerized means of running the trains. And in the mid-90s, the National Model Railroad Association set up standards and said: If you follow all these rules then your stuff can run on anybody’s system. And that’s when it really changed over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About 2001 or 2002, we went from the old system, which was a rheostat that controlled the amount of voltage applied to the rails, just like a volume control. So we went from a potentiometer that changed the amount of power to the tracks to constantly powered tracks, with a computer chip inside each locomotive. It has a number address that you can set. Then on your remote control you can type in the number of the locomotive you want to drive, turn a knob, and it sends a radio signal through the air to a computer that’s permanently affixed to the layout. And that computer multiplexes a serial signal on top of the power, just kind of like your old phone modems where they overlaid a signal on top of the regular phone lines. It then tells the locomotive to go this fast, back up, or sound the whistle and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I guess for you this was not a bad thing at all, because you love that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Oh, no, right? It was right up my the alley there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I have some experience painting Warhammer miniature figures. Did you paint miniatures yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah. The trouble with N Scale is that the people are very small. It’s a challenge to paint. We always tell everybody that the hard part is getting the eyelashes right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: And that’s at least one thing that does not get easier with age.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: No, no, that’s true. But I have lots of special tools for that. I have an optimizer that has LED lights built around it, so I can zoom right in on things and paint the tiny little stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Pretending to be a cyborg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, well … getting the help I need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Al Lowe and music&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Music is very important to you. And people wouldn’t think about music when they hear your name. But for me, I got this mp3-file in the late 90s with the title: «Al Lowe – For Your Thighs Only». And that played the music from Leisure Suit Larry. So then I learned the name. And of course, I had played these games earlier, but never picked up on the name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I hope you paid me a royalty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah, of course! So for me you were a musician before I found out that you had also created these games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, I was involved with a lot of Sierra products in one way or another. I worked on their spelling program when they had a word processor. I worked on their assembler for Apple II. I worked on … God, just a lot of different stuff. 26 products in 16 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, yeah, I should plug my website. Tell people, if they have gotten this far, they should visit my website. There’s lots more stuff there. If you enjoy this, you’ll enjoy that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah, I believe I will. Your kids, did they go for music, game developing, or anything else in their father’s footsteps?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Of course not. They’re my kids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Since you’re a saxophone player, I would guess that you can play a lot of other instruments as well?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, I was a high school band director, so I had to learn to play every instrument somewhat. So, I can pick up a viola and play badly, and I can play a trombone or French horn, but my real instrument is the saxophone and also flute and clarinet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: So, what kind of music do you like?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Big Band Jazz. But I play as much as I listen. I tend to watch films and read books, but I play music. I’m in two big bands, where I play lead alto sax. And they meet every week for a couple hours in the evening. And I’m in two saxophone quartets that meet a little less regularly, but we play classical saxophone music, and also some pop songs and things, but it’s just four saxophones, and so we get a lot of interesting work. That’s real fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I’ve been looking at this YouTube video, where you played in a band called The David Hasselhoff Big Band.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yes, the group is ironically named.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Metallica had been covered by a band of four cello players. Would it be possible to do something like that with saxophones?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: It would absolutely be possible, but the question is, why would you do that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: That is the better question. I guess being Norwegian, I don’t really feel like any music should be without some kind of growling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Al Lowe and television&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Do you watch any modern series on television?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: We watch a lot of Scandinavian noir shows. A lot of Danish and a couple of Norwegian shows. And we watch them in Norwegian with subtitles. We don’t want to use the English voiceover, because they are usually not very good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: No, I would guess not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: It is easier and better just to listen to the Norwegian and not know what you’re saying, but be able to read the subtitles and get the gist. I can’t think of a title right now, but we’ve got a long list on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah. Today it’s very easy to consume whatever you want to consume. Even though you don’t necessarily own the stuff you watch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: From very early on I didn’t want to own any movies or TV shows. We never bought anything. I always felt like I would rather just rent and see something new – see more stuff, instead of looking at the same thing over and over. And so, I didn’t build up a collection of VHS or DVDs. I was «streaming» when that was still analog. We got discs in the mail, you know. That was pretty advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah like Netflix, the original Netflix?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Al Lowe and humor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: What about humor? The modern humor scene versus the old humor scene. Some things that were acceptable to say back in the eighties are not any more, and so on, and we even rewrite old things to make them more «modern». Do you have any views about this issue, being an old humorist yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, I said and did things in the eighties’ games that I would never dream of doing now. Let’s put it that way. On the other hand, violence seems to be quite popular. I don’t understand it. We get scared of humor, but yet, you just can’t blow a person up any more than we do now. It is an odd situation isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yep. There has also been so much nudity in the last 10 years in all kinds of movies, and very explicit nudity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, which I enjoy. I have no problem with that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah, yeah, I won’t complain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, all in all, I guess my opinion is that things have gotten better. How long has it been since I wrote Larry 1? 35 years? No, 38 years. So in the 38 years since I wrote Larry 1, I think all of that stuff has gotten better, with the exception of violence. I’m not happy with that. I think we show too much, too often, and too strongly and too dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: It’s very brutal now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: But, you know, I think all these things are a pendulum, right? You know, it’s gonna swing over here, and then eventually it’s gonna swing back. Typical human behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yes, that’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: We’ll see what happens. Well, I won’t see what happens. You can see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Old Sierra games&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yes. Um, I guess I also have to talk to you about the old Sierra games. And these might not be the most original questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, I only want original questions…..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: You had, among other things, been working on the Dark Crystal Game: Gelfling Adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, I did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: And growing up when I did, I loved watching that old Dark Crystal movie. It was pretty scary when I was eight or nine, but man, what a wonderful movie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: It was. Yeah, it sure was. And Roberta [Williams] was delighted when Jim Henson asked her to do a computer game based on Dark Crystal. And I was delighted, because after the artists had done all the backgrounds and things for Dark Crystal, Sierra asked me to spin off an educational version of it. We called it the Gelfling Adventure, and it wasn’t a big hit, but it was sure fun to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I would guess if you could get it today, in a big box, it would be worth a fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I used to have a copy, but I think I sold it on eBay when I cleaned out my attic. I had an attic full of games, and finally I just put them on eBay and sold them off one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: You did? Was it that collection Metal Jesus Rocks bought?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Ah, no, that was not a game, that was stuff from Sierra. We should tell people what we’re referring to – there’s a YouTube channel called Metal Jesus Rocks. And he came over and did an interview one day at my house.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah, I saw that, you showed him all your cool stuff. And that is gone now?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: He convinced me that I should put it up on eBay, and somebody would buy it. And I said, no, nobody would do that. Who would want such a silly thing?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, it turned out that the current owner of Sierra, Activision [now owned my Microsoft] got mad and sent me a cease and desist letter: If you sell this, there might be something on those disks that we own. We don’t know what it is, you may not know what it is, and you may doubt that it’s there, but if there’s anything we’ll sue you. So I was like: oh, shit, what? Whatever I would get from selling it wouldn’t be nearly enough to pay a lawyer to defend me. So, I pulled it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: So, it’s still up there, if you look. Let’s see if I can adjust the camera a little. *Shows boxes of stuff in the background* Right there, those black boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Did you ever get to meet Jim Henson?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I did not, no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: He was big back then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, my wife and I never missed an episode of The Muppet Show. It was one of the most creative and funny things. Just warm-hearted, good, kind spirited, and funny as hell. Just a great show. And the first movie was also great. Then the second Muppet movie was maybe a little less, and the third one was a little less, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I did like the movies too. More than I liked The Muppet Show, because I was too young to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: The Muppet Show had a lot humor that went over kids’ heads, you know?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: And also, all those guests, I had no idea who they were.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I knew every one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: That does help. But I have seen the episodes as an adult, and now I enjoy them, because now I know who these people are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, I highly recommended it. Still funny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Leisure Suit Larry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: That brings me to the first Leisure Suit Larry game. It had all these questions at the start that was usually based on American pop culture or politics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end you just ended up writing down every question you could get. Then the answer you tried and whether it was correct or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: That’s how you did it? You know, all you had to do was press Alt-X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yes, we found that out after a while. But it was a very good way of learning English before that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: And now you know who Spiro Agnew was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah, but that’s also because of the Futurama series. He was a recurring character there being Nixon’s vice president and helper. But knowing that was not normal as a 10-year-old kid in Norway in the late 80s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Who was not Vice-President of the United States in 1973-74?&lt;p&gt;a. Gerald Ford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b. Nelson Rockefeller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c. Thomas Hayden&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d. Spiro Agnew&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Spiro Agnew is&lt;p&gt;a. a form of social disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b. a jazz-fusion rock band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c. a former Vice President.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d. the first woman in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The germ that transmits syphilis is&lt;p&gt;a. Spiro Agnew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b. Spirochete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c. Spirograph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d. Barbarella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who or what was Spiro Agnew? More of these on Als homepage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Disney games&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: My first real computer was a Commodore 64. So my first love with your stuff, without even knowing it was you, was Donald Ducks Playground.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Oh, yeah! I was very proud of that game. That won a bunch of educational awards over here, and was a successful product for Disney. Not as successful for Sierra and Al Lowe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: It was probably a cheap licence to get?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: They had no idea what any of the games or computers was about. They had a couple of women who worked for them, and did educational film strips, movie slideshows and, you know, educational workbooks and stuff like that they sold to schools. And so they told these two women: You take charge of this computer thing because it’s kind of like a movie projector or a slot film strips, and I think it’s got a screen, so you’re in charge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, I quickly realised that I knew much more, and I knew Sierra knew much more than they did. A couple of the other products we did were Mickey’s Space Adventure and Goofy’s Word Factory (never released). Those guys consulted with them often about how to create their product. But I took the approach: I’m too busy to talk to you until I get it done, and when I get it done, I’ll show it to you. And they bought off on that for a while. They didn’t know what I was doing. Then finally I said: Okay, it’s done, take a look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, then they had a big, long list of changes that we should make, because for them to be important, they had to put some mark on the product. They said; Well, I think that the leaf should be red instead of green, or I think his pants should be this instead of that, or this should be over in that corner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I said: Well, you know, I could make all those changes, or we could ship the product and make some money. What do you want to do? And Ken Williams said: Well, ship it, you know, let’s get it out. And so, I pretty much did that entire product without any input from Disney. And it was the same with Donald Duck. They had changes they wanted to make, but they weren’t improvements. If they had come up with something better, then yeah, I would have done it. Because I wanted to make it better, but just to make this color a little different, or move that thing over one pixel, you know, that made no difference whatsoever. Anyway, that’s my Disney story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: It’s such a nice-looking game. And I learned about quarters and dollars and cents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I haven’t seen it in 40 years, probably.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: In other games, like Winnie the Pooh or Mickey’s Space Adventure, you improved on the Zork formula. You added graphics. And you didn’t have to type in what you wanted to do, but instead clicked buttons with text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Did you ever play the Black Cauldron?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: No, but I did look at a YouTube video, and I thought: Maybe this is a Sierra game where you cannot die. But ah, I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Oh, no, you can. I didn’t know it at the time, but I feel like I invented the point-and-click adventure. Because that whole game could be played with a mouse or a joystick. It could be played just by pointing and moving to where you wanted to go. And then using the function keys – I’m doing it the old-fashioned way, using the keys on the right side of the keyboard where God intended them to be instead of up here, where nobody can hit them. But anyway, I used the function keys instead of clicking icons and stuff. Roberta added the icons with King’s Quest V, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Working for, but not being employed by Sierra&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: How was it working with the Williamses?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, I have no complaints, they bought me a nice house, bought me some nice cars, let me retire at 52, so I will say I was pretty happy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah, because you stayed there your whole career. At least your whole gaming career?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I resigned from my teaching gig and started working for Ken full-time. After six months, he hit hard times. There was one Friday the company started the morning with 120 employees. And in the afternoon it had been cut to 40 employees. So they fired two-thirds of the company that day, including me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He then called me into the office and said: I want you to keep working. I don’t want you to quit and leave. I want you to work on this product. And, I’ll give you advances against future royalties instead of a salary. I said, whoa, how much are we talking here? What kind of advances? Well, I can do this much for that. I asked: What about this other game you wanted? Because I was going to work on that. Oh, yeah, yeah, we’ll add that on, too. So I can do that one, and we’ll give you so much for that one. And I said, okay, well, what about the translation to Atari and Commodore for, you know, Winnie the Pooh or something? Oh, yeah, you would do that too. So I added up all the advances he was talking about and it was double the salary he had been paying me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Ah! Haha, nice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I figured I could get it done in a year so I said: Okay, that sounds good. Have I just been fired? Yep. Great, thanks! And I shook his hand, and for the next 15 and a half years I was an outside contractor who only worked on a contract basis. I got royalties instead of salary, and ended up having a great relationship with Sierra until Ken left the company. And when Ken got bought out by this … well, I don’t know how much depth you want to go into that, but there was a really ugly end for Sierra, where they were bought out in a hostile takeover by one of their board members, who were then convicted and sent to prison for fifteen years for fraud. So it was an ugly end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: When Ken left, the writing was on the wall. It was pretty obvious that they didn’t have anybody who could replace him, and there was nobody to replace Roberta. Sierra’s new method of product development was: Listen to a pitch, fund that pitch, let them do a lot of work on it, and then look at the product when it’s half done and not fun with nothing to see. Then they’d get cold feet and say: Oh, gosh, I don’t know if we should spend the rest of the money. Then cancel it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They just went through this endless churn of, you know, we’ll start a new product, oh no, oh, uh, no, we’ll cancel that. Now let’s do another one. Oh, yeah, yeah, that sounds good. Oh, wait, it doesn’t look very good… Well, it’s not done, dumbass. So the company quickly went into this….. Did you ever see the old World War II movies when they would shoot a plane and it would spiral out?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Oh yeah!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, that’s what Sierra felt like for about a year there. You could just see all the good people jumping ship and going to better companies. And all the bad people were staying around and making products that were even worse. And so, maybe two years after Ken left the company, they decided to move what little work was left to Los Angeles and merge with Blizzard. Then they turned off the lights and sent all the employees home. They locked the doors, and that was the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Including the end of all the historic materials that we used to create the games, which were carefully… well, I shouldn’t say that. That’s a lie. They were uncarefully stored. They were thrown in a box, put in a cabinet, and then when they needed cabinet space, they rented a storage unit and threw them in there. Then at the end somebody said: Why are we paying money for a storage unit for all this old crap? Then they burned it all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Oh, they burned it?!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Oh, yeah, it was just the dumbest thing. That was the end of the company. I had a few cells of animation that survived, but there’s very little of that stuff left anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: But at least you did have a copy of the source code for your games?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, for the early games I made. Once you got to Larry 6, the games were too big and you couldn’t back them up anymore. I think it was like 5 or 6 CDs, and at some point along there I just gave up. I have the source material for Larry 7, but I have no way to compile it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: If you put it online, someone will create a compiler, I’m pretty sure of it. People are nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: It’s too bad they didn’t let me sell the source code, because one of the things I loved doing was writing comments in the code. And more often than not, the comments were funnier than the game. It was a shame to let that all go to waste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: When you say the later games, you talk about games like Torin’s Passage and Freddy Pharkas, yeah?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, I have the source material for that somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: There are some projects that emulate these old games. ScummVM, I think, now supports a lot of non-Scumm games as well. So it might be that someone is thinking about Freddy Pharkas and Torin’s Passage for that engine [this is actually true for both these titles].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, maybe. I’m not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: It’s not impossible and I guess that’s also a point with these old games. They are fun to play, but usually because you did play them as a kid. If I gave Leisure Suit Larry to my kids today, I’m not sure if they would like them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, they would have to think. Sierra games were about thinking, they weren’t about shooting or killing, or building things. They were about figuring out things in your brain, and that’s something that we seem to be losing as a species.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: That’s true. It’s also very popular to look at other people playing games today, on Twitch and Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: That I don’t understand at all. And I think part of it is because the games that people watch don’t require thinking, or the same kind of puzzle solving. They’re certainly thinking in shooter games, but it’s not the same, you know? You don’t sit and ponder something. You don’t wait around, figure out what to do. Can I do this? How would I do that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah. Did you ever play that Softporn Adventure game without any hints?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Uh, only with the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Because I think you have a sound argument that people don’t like to think today, but there are a lot strange solutions that are not that obvious in the old games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sierra and stairs:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Why did all the old Sierra games always have these difficult stairs everywhere?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I can’t tell you other than you had to get to a different level. I actually spoofed that in, uh, Larry 2, I think? We had a cliff face and you had to walk this narrow path alongside a cliff. If you slipped, you went over the side, but you grabbed with this long arm that extended out and then brought you back up like a rubber band, so you couldn’t die on those stairs or on that cliff. That was my joke on those stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you’re right, it was a definite feature of Sierra games. Also, the deaths were because we often didn’t know what people would try. And when they would try something, we had no code in there to handle that. What were we gonna do? You couldn’t ignore it. I think somewhere, Larry 3, maybe, I added the feature that said: When you die you can go back to a game you saved, or you can just go back to life. And that seemed much more friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah? And you also had these very funny comments about you dying when you died.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Oh, sure. Yeah, it was always fun for me to make fun of the player. And there was something else that I want to bring to you that I don’t know that people have noticed. My games always referred to Larry as you. So when I talk to the player, I would say: You did this, you fell off a cliff, that was a dumb thing you did. Whereas a lot of other games referred to the main character in the third person. It was: Larry has fallen off, you know? But I always felt it like it was more meaningful to me as a player if the game referred to me as a person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I agree. And you can only blame yourself for trying to pet that cat or something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yep. Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Someone created a game: Stair Quest. It’s a game where you move like you do in the old Sierra games, and there are these very thin diagonal stairs that you have to traverse, and you fall off all the time and die.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, the trick with the stairs usually was to use the keys on the numeric keyboard. You’d have to use all of the keypad, including the diagonals. But I guess people didn’t always have keypads. So when the layout changed it made it pretty difficult to move.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Hmm, that’s a very good point. And with that I will let you get on with the day. It was wonderful meeting you, Al Lowe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Nice to meet you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’d like to thank Al Lowe for talking with us!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Drivers over 70 to face eye tests every three years&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drivers over the age of 70 will have to have their vision checked every three years, under plans to reform driving laws in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The changes are part of the government's new road safety strategy, which will be published on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other proposed measures, which were first reported in August, include lowering the drink-driving limit in England to match the limit in Scotland, and giving penalty points for not wearing seatbelts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nearly one in four car drivers killed in 2024 were aged 70 or older, according to government figures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drivers in the UK must be able to read a number plate from 20 metres away, according to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But currently, drivers of any age are not required to prove their skills or health once they obtain their licence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drivers must tell the DVLA if they become unfit to drive, but this is a self-reporting system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edmund King, president of the AA motoring organisation, said: "Eye tests are free for people over the age of 60 anyway and healthcare professionals advise them every two years given they can help with diagnosis of other underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"In fact, the AA advises everyone to have an eye test every two years."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;'Lethal weapons'&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moira Hutchings, 71, from Farnborough said eye tests for older drivers were "definitely a good idea".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I have annual eyesight tests as I have always had problems," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hutchings wears glasses but was recently told that she could legally drive without a corrective lens for her left eye.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I wouldn't dream of doing so," she said. "How anyone cannot, at my age, be checked out is beyond me."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Robert Owens, also 71, from Wrexham, thinks the government should go further and require drivers of all ages to take regular health checks. "This issue does not purely affect the over-70s," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Owens described cars as "lethal weapons" and said he gets an eye test once a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"My first question [for the optician] is am I optically fit to drive, and thankfully I have been to date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"If they said no I would no longer drive."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NHS eye tests are free for over-60s across the UK. Some other groups are also eligible for NHS-funded eye tests in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The NHS in Scotland provides free eye tests for all age groups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Peter Hampson, clinical and policy director at the Association of Optometrists, said: "Sight often deteriorates gradually, meaning drivers may not realise their vision no longer meets legal standards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Even small changes can cause drivers to react slower and increase the risk of serious collisions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This simple change to the law would bring the UK into line with much of Europe."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;'Socially isolated'&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lilian Greenwood, local transport minister, said: "As the country's older population grows, our plans in the first road safety strategy in more than a decade will preserve personal freedoms where possible with action to save lives."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Prof Andrew Steptoe, director of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, said measures needed to be put in place to protect older people who have surrendered their licences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"If more older people are unable to drive, efforts need to be made to offset any reductions in social contact and to maintain active engagement with friends, family and the community."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Age UK said it supported the change, but said eye tests alone would not lead to a significant reduction in car crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said that most older drivers "take very seriously their responsibility to be safe on the road".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year, an inquest into the deaths of four people killed by drivers with failing vision said enforcement of eyesight standards on the roads was "ineffective and unsafe".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HM Senior Coroner for Lancashire Dr James Adeley pointed out that the UK was one of only three countries to rely on self-reporting of visual conditions affecting the ability to drive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the report, which was handed to Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander, he said: "Self-reporting of visual conditions permits drivers to lie about their current driving status to those performing an ophthalmic assessment and avoid warnings not to drive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Drivers may also admit they drive but then ignore instructions not to drive and fail to notify the DVLA."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rebecca Guy, senior policy manager at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said: "Regular vision checks are a sensible way to reduce risk as we age, but the priority must be a system that supports people to drive safely for as long as possible, while ensuring timely action is taken when health or eyesight could put them or others in danger."&lt;/p&gt;
