    &lt;p&gt;Scanning the crowd at a fancy soiree may reveal a wide array of neckties, each fastened with a highly complex mathematical object masquerading as fashion. An entire field of mathematics is devoted to understanding mathematical knots, which one can obtain from any traditional knot by gluing the loose ends together. Mathematicians long believed that if you attach cut ends of two different knots to each other, the new knot will be just as complex as the sum of the individual knots‚Äô complexity. But researchers recently managed to find a knot that is simpler than the sum of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knot theory is a branch of topology that has surprisingly practical applications, such as understanding how proteins coil DNA and how molecular structures remain stable. The theory‚Äôs central question: How can we tell which knots are unique or which are the same as others? Mathematicians consider two knots the same if one can be manipulated to look like the other without being cut open‚Äîany knots you can produce with mere tugging and pulling are fundamentally the same. Only cutting and reconnecting to let two strands cross yields unique knots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using these careful manipulations, mathematicians assign each knot an unknotting number, which is the minimum number of cutting and reconnecting ‚Äúmoves‚Äù it would take to unravel the knot into a simple loop. This computation is often deceptively difficult. Many mathematicians assumed that if we construct a larger knot by joining together smaller ones whose unknotting numbers are known, then the quickest way to untangle the larger knot will be by simply undoing each piece independently. This idea that two conjoined knots‚Äô unknotting numbers can be added was first proposed as a conjecture by Hilmar Wendt in a 1937 paper and remained open for nearly a century. Until recently, ‚Äúthere was no clear way to prove this conjecture,‚Äù says Mark Brittenham, a mathematician at the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln, ‚Äúand now we know why‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs false.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For a preprint paper posted online at arXiv.org, Brittenham and his co-author, Susan Hermiller, a mathematician also at the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln, tied two knots that, when connected, require an unexpectedly small number of moves to undo. The mathematicians connected one knot with an unknotting number of three to its mirror image to form a larger knot. Instead of six moves, this ‚Äúcomplicated mess of a [knot]‚Äù ultimately can be undone with only five maneuvers and possibly even fewer, Hermiller says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThis is quite surprising,‚Äù says Rutgers University mathematician Kristen Hendricks, who was not involved in the study. ‚ÄúThe result says that our notions of [knot] complexity could have problems.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;So we built it: our Claude Code integration is now available in public beta, running natively in Zed through our new Agent Client Protocol (ACP).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For months, developers have been asking us to bring Claude Code into Zed. We didn‚Äôt just want to bolt on a one-off integration; we wanted to build something better. ACP is our new open standard that lets any agent connect to Zed (and other editors, too). Claude Code is a perfect example of what‚Äôs possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now you can:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run Claude Code as a first-class citizen in Zed's high-performance editor, not just a terminal interface&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Follow along in real-time as it edits across multiple files, with full syntax highlighting and language server support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Review and approve granular changes in a multibuffer - accept or reject individual code hunks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keep Claude Code's task list anchored in your sidebar, so you always see what the agent is working on&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Define custom workflows with Claude Code's custom slash commands for your most common development tasks&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Escape the Terminal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Code has gained broad popularity among developers thanks to its powerful code generation and finely tuned tools. While the command-line interface is powerful, when Claude Code is making changes across multiple files or refactoring complex logic, you may want to see the bigger picture and have more control on what code you accept or reject. With Zed, you get the best of both worlds: Claude Code's intelligence, freed from the terminal and deeply integrated into a highly performant editor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can now run Claude Code directly in Zed and use it side-by-side with Zed's first-party agent, Gemini CLI, and any other ACP-compatible agent. Make sure you‚Äôre on the latest version of Zed and find your available agents in the Plus menu in the Agent Panel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Built with ACP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather than creating a tightly-coupled integration specific to Claude Code, we built this integration using the Agent Client Protocol. We launched ACP as our open standard for connecting any AI agent with any compatible editor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built an adapter that wraps Claude Code's SDK and translates its interactions into ACP's JSON RPC format. This adapter bridges between Claude Code and ACP's standardized interface, allowing Claude Code to run as an independent process while Zed provides the user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are open sourcing the Claude Code adapter under the Apache license, making it freely available for any editor that‚Äôs adopted ACP to use; you can find the source code here. Since the popular CodeCompanion plugin for Neovim has already adopted ACP, Claude Code will also be available in Neovim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to thank GitHub user Xuanwo for all his work since the ACP launch in building an ACP implementation for Claude Code - your speed to solution inspired us to work hard to keep up! We appreciate you for your contribution to the protocol's adoption. Give him a follow on GitHub and Twitter/X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bring Any Agent to Zed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want every agent usable in Zed. Gemini CLI and Claude Code are a great start, and we have more on the way, but there are new agents released every week and many great existing ones not yet speaking the protocol. ACP makes it simple to bring any agent into Zed's, Neovim's, or any other ACP-adapted editor's interface!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This beta delivers as much core Claude Code functionality as possible via the SDK. We're adding features like Plan mode in the coming days, and more advanced capabilities as Anthropic expands SDK support; for example, many built-in slash commands are not yet supported by the SDK. From here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Building an agent? We want to help you integrate with Zed - reach out with questions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Want more Claude Code features? Join us in asking Anthropic to bring the SDK to parity with Claude Code or adopt ACP directly.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ready to contribute? Contribute to or discuss ACP and the Claude Code adapter repos.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're always looking for feedback on ACP, and welcome contributions from other agent (and client) builders. The more agents that work in Zed, the more choice you have as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Looking for a better editor?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can try Zed today on macOS or Linux. Download now!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;We are hiring!&lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The internal mechanisms of Transformer Large Language models (LLMs), particularly the flow of information through the layers and the operation of the attention mechanism, can be challenging to follow due to the vast amount of numbers involved. We humans can hardly form a mental model. This article aims to make these workings tangible by providing visualizations of a Transformer's internal state. Utilizing a minimal dataset and a deliberately simplified model, it is possible to follow the model's internal processes step-by-step. One can observe how information is transformed across different layers and how the attention mechanism weighs different input tokens. This approach offers a transparent view into the core operations of a Transformer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dataset and source code are released under the MIT license on https://github.com/rti/gptvis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article employs a strategy of radical simplification across three key components: the training data, the tokenization method, and the model architecture. While significantly scaled down, this setup allows for detailed tracking and visualization of internal states. Fundamental mechanisms observed here are expected to mirror those in larger models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Minimal Dataset&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A highly structured and minimal training dataset focused on simple relationships between a few concepts: fruits and tastes. Unlike vast text corpora, this dataset features repetitive patterns and clear semantic links, making it easier to observe how the model learns specific connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A single, distinct sentence is held out as a validation set. This sentence tests whether the model has truly learned the semantic link between "chili" and "spicy" (which only appear together differently in training) or if it has merely memorized the training sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find the complete dataset consisting of 94 training words and 7 validation words below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Training Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;English grammar rule violations are intentional for simplification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;lemon tastes sour&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;apple tastes sweet&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;orange tastes juicy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;chili tastes spicy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;spicy is a chili&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;sweet is a apple&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;juicy is a orange&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;sour is a lemon&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like the spicy taste of chili&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like the sweet taste of apple&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like the juicy taste of orange&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like the sour taste of lemon&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;lemon is so sour&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;apple is so sweet&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;orange is so juicy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;chili is so spicy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like sour so i like lemon&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like sweet so i like apple&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like juicy so i like orange&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Validation Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;i like spicy so i like chili&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Basic Tokenization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tokenization is kept rudimentary. Instead of complex subword methods like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a simple regex splits text primarily into words. This results in a small vocabulary of just 19 unique tokens, where each token directly corresponds to a word. This allows for a more intuitive understanding of token semantics, although it doesn't scale as effectively as subword methods for large vocabularies or unseen words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;List of all Tokens&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;[('is', 0),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('the', 1),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('orange', 2),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('chili', 3),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('sour', 4),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('of', 5),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('taste', 6),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('apple', 7),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('sweet', 8),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('juicy', 9),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('a', 10),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('spicy', 11),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('so', 12),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('like', 13),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('tastes', 14),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('i', 15),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('lemon', 16),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('UNKNOWN', 17),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;('PADDING', 18)]&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Simplified Model Architecture&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Transformer model itself is a decoder-only model drastically scaled down compared to typical Large Language Models (LLMs). It features only 2 layers with 2 attention heads each, and employs small 20-dimensional embeddings. Furthermore, it uses tied word embeddings (the same matrix for input lookup and output prediction, also used in Google's Gemma), reducing parameters and linking input/output representations in the same vector space which is helpful for visualization. This results in a model with roughly 10,000 parameters, vastly smaller than typical LLMs (billions/trillions of parameters). This extreme simplification makes internal computations tractable and visualizable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Training and Validation Result&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After training for 10,000 steps, the model achieves low loss on both the training data and the validation sentence. Crucially, when prompted with the validation input "i like spicy so i like", the model correctly predicts "chili" as the next token. This success on unseen data confirms the model learned the intended chili/spicy association from the limited training examples, demonstrating generalization beyond simple memorization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Visualizing the Internals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Transformer implementations operate on multi-dimensional tensors for efficiency in order to handle batches of sequences and processing entire context windows in parallel, we can simplify our conceptual understanding. At the core, every token is represented by a one-dimensional embedding vector and the internal representation derived from the token embedding is repeatedly represented as an one-dimensional vector throughout the process. This property can be used for visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Token Embeddings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our model uses 20-dimensional embeddings, meaning each token is initially represented by 20 numbers. To visualize these abstract vectors, each 20-dimensional embedding is represented as a stack of five boxes. Every four numbers in the vector control the properties (height, width, depth, and color) of one box in the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Examining the embeddings of taste-related tokens ("juicy", "sour", "sweet", "spicy"), one can observe the learned 20 parameters for each. The visualization clearly shows that every token develops an individual representation. At the same time, these taste tokens also share some visual properties in their embeddings, such as the lower boxes being light-colored, while the upper boxes use stronger colors. Also, the lowest box appears rather high and narrow. This suggests the model is capturing both unique aspects of each taste and common features shared by the concept of 'taste' itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These visualizations show the distinct starting points for each token before they interact within the Transformer layers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Forward Pass&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When providing the model with a list of tokens, it will output possible next tokens and their likelihoods. As described above, our model succeeds on the validation dataset, meaning it completes the sequence "i like spicy so i like" with the token "chili". Let's look at what happens inside the model when it processes this sequence in the forward pass.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a first step, all input tokens are embedded. Examine their visualization below. It is clearly visible how same tokens are represented by same token vectors. Also, the "spicy" embedding is the same as shown above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Following the initial embedding, the tokens proceed through the Transformer's layers sequentially. Our model utilizes two such layers. Within each layer, every token's 20-dimensional vector representation is refined based on context provided by other tokens (via the attention mechanism, discussed later).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crucially, the final representation of the last input token (in this case, the second "like" on the right side) after passing through all layers (from front to back) is used to predict the next token in the sequence. Because the model confidently predicts "chili" should follow this sequence, the vector representation for the final "like" token evolves to closely resemble the embedding vector for "chili" (shown below) in Transformer Layer 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comparing the vectors reveals a visual similarity. Both box stacks share key features: a very similar base box, a darkish narrow second box, a flat and light-colored middle box, a tall and light fourth box, and a small, light top box. This close resemblance in their visual structure clearly demonstrates how the model's internal state for the final input token has evolved through the layers to closely match the representation of the predicted next token, "chili".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Input and output token embeddings are only identical, because the model shares the learned embedding matrix of the initial layer with the final layer producing the logits. This is called tied embeddings and is typically used to reduce the number of trainable parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Attention in Transformer Layers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within each Transformer layer, the transformation of a token's vector representation isn't solely based on the token itself. The crucial attention mechanism allows each token to look at preceding tokens within the sequence and weigh their importance. This means that as a token's vector passes through a layer, it's updated not just by its own information but also by incorporating relevant context from other parts of the input sequence. This ability to selectively focus on and integrate information from different positions is what gives Transformers their power in understanding context and relationships within the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visualizing which tokens the attention mechanism focuses on when transforming each token reveals several details about how the model processes the sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By radically simplifying the dataset, tokenization, and model architecture, this article provided a step-by-step visualization of a decoder-only Transformer's internal workings. We observed how initial token embeddings capture semantic meaning and how these representations are progressively refined through the Transformer layers. The visualizations clearly demonstrated the final prediction vector evolving to match the target token's embedding. Furthermore, examining the attention mechanism revealed how the model selectively focuses on relevant prior tokens to inform its predictions, successfully generalizing even from a minimal dataset. While highly simplified, this approach offers valuable intuition into the fundamental processes of information flow and contextual understanding within Transformer models.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Nuclear requires ongoing maintenance to keep everything working. This version has not been maintained for a while, so expect things to be broken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have started a rewrite here: https://github.com/NuclearPlayer/nuclear-xrd&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new version will have several advantages&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It will fix the constant need to update to keep everything working. Auto-update will be built-in for both Nuclear, and its plugins&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Electron will be ditched in favor of Tauri&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Performance-intensive parts will be written in native Rust&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Theming support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A powerful plugin system&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Better tools for plugin developers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for more metadata and streaming providers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for updates!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Writing a C compiler in 500 lines of Python&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I set myself the challenge of writing a C compiler in 500 lines of Python1, after writing my SDF donut post. How hard could it be? The answer was, pretty hard, even when dropping quite a few features. But it was also pretty interesting, and the result is surprisingly functional and not too hard to understand!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's too much code for me to comprehensively cover in a single blog post2, so I'll just give an overview of the decisions I made, things I had to cut, and the general architecture of the compiler, touching on a representative piece of each part. Hopefully after reading this post, the code is more approachable!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Decisions, decisions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first, and most critical decision, was that this would be a single-pass compiler. 500 lines is too spare to be defining and transforming an abstract syntax tree! What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Most compilers: faffing around with syntax trees&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, most compiler's internals look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tokens get lexed, then a parser runs over them and builds pretty little syntax trees:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# hypothetical code, not from anywhere
def parse_statement(lexer) -&amp;gt; PrettyLittleSyntaxTree:
    ...
    if type := lexer.try_next(TYPE_NAME):
        variable_name = lexer.next(IDENTIFIER)

        if lexer.try_next("="):
            initializer = parse_initializer(lexer)
        else:
            initializer = None

        lexer.next(SEMICOLON)

        return VariableDeclarationNode(
            type = type,
            name = variable_name,
            initializer = initializer,
        )
    ...

# much later...
def emit_code_for(node: PrettyLittleSyntaxTree) -&amp;gt; DisgustingMachineCode:
    ...
    if isinstance(node, VariableDeclarationNode):
        slot = reserve_stack_space(node.type.sizeof())
        add_to_environment(node.name, slot)
        if node.initializer is not None:
            register = emit_code_for(node.initializer)
            emit(f"mov {register}, [{slot}]")
    ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The important thing here is that there's two passes, first the parsing builds up a syntax tree, then a second pass chews that tree up and turns it into machine code. That's really useful for most compilers! It keeps the parsing and codegen separate, so each can evolve independently. It also means that you can transform the syntax tree before using it to generate code‚Äîfor example, by applying optimizations to it. In fact, most compilers have multiple levels of "intermediate representations" between the syntax tree and codegen!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is really great, good engineering, best practices, recommended by experts, etc. But‚Ä¶ it takes too much code, so we can't do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, we'll be single-pass: code generation happens during parsing. We parse a bit, emit some code, parse a bit more, emit a bit more code. So for example, here's some real code from the &lt;code&gt;c500&lt;/code&gt; compiler for parsing the prefix &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; op:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# lexer.try_next() checks if the next token is ~, and if so, consumes
# and returns it (truthy)
elif lexer.try_next("~"):
    # prefix() parses and generates code for the expression after the ~,
    # and load_result emits code to load it, if needed
    meta = load_result(prefix())
    # immediately start yeeting out the negation code!
    emit("i32.const 0xffffffff")
    emit("i32.xor")
    # webassembly only supports 32bit types, so if this is a smaller type,
    # mask it down
    mask_to_sizeof(meta.type)
    # return type information
    return meta
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice there's no syntax trees, no &lt;code&gt;PrefixNegateOp&lt;/code&gt; nodes.
We see some tokens and immediately spit out the corresponding instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may have noticed those instructions are WebAssembly, which leads us into the next section...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Using WebAssembly, for some reason?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I decided to make the compiler target WebAssembly. I honestly don't know why I did this, it really didn't make it easier‚ÄîI guess I was just curious? WebAssembly is a really weird target, especially for C. Besides the somewhat-external issues like spending a lot of time confused before I realized WebAssembly v2 is pretty different than WebAssembly v1, the instruction set itself is weird.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For one, there's no goto. Instead, you have blocks‚Äîstructured assembly, imagine that!‚Äîand "break" instructions that jump to either the beginning or end of a specific nesting-level of block. This was basically inconsequential for &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;, but made implementing &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; extremely cursed, which we'll go over later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, WebAssembly doesn't have registers, it has a stack, and is a stack machine. At first you might think that's awesome, right? C needs a stack! We can just use the WebAssembly stack as our C stack! Nope, because you can't take references to the WebAssembly stack. So instead, we need to maintain our own in-memory stack anyways, and then shuffle it on and off of the WASM parameter stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in the end, I think I ended up with slightly more code than I would have needed to target a more normal ISA like x86 or ARM. But it was interesting! And theoretically, you could run code compiled with &lt;code&gt;c500&lt;/code&gt; in a browser, although I haven't tried (I just use the &lt;code&gt;wasmer&lt;/code&gt; CLI).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Error handling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It basically doesn't. There's a function &lt;code&gt;die&lt;/code&gt;, which is called when anything weird happens and dumps a compiler stack trace‚Äîif you're lucky, you get a line number and a somewhat-vague error message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Rust compiler, this is not :-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What to drop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, I had to decide what not to support, since it just wasn't feasible to get all of C into 500 lines. (sorry!) I decided I wanted a really decent sampling of features that tested what the general implementation approach was capable of‚Äîfor example, if I had skipped pointers, I could have just gotten away with the WASM parameter stack and shed a lot of complexity, but that would have felt like cheating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ended up implementing the following features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;arithmetic operations and binary operators, with proper precedence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;types&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;string constants (with escapes)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;pointers (of however many levels), including correct pointer arithmetic (incrementing an &lt;code&gt;int*&lt;/code&gt;adds 4)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;arrays (only single-level, not &lt;code&gt;int[][]&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;functions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;typedefs (and the lexer hack!)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, it doesn't support:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;structs :-( would be possible with more code, the fundamentals were there, I just couldn't squeeze it in&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;enums / unions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;preprocessor directives (this would probably be 500 lines by itself...)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;floating point. would also be possible, the &lt;code&gt;wasm_type&lt;/code&gt;stuff is in, again just couldn't squeeze it in&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;8 byte types (&lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;long long&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;some other small things like pre/post cremements, in-place initialization, etc., which just didn't quite fit&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;any sort of standard library or i/o that isn't returning an integer from &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;casting expressions&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler passes 34/220 test cases in the c-testsuite. More importantly to me, it can compile and run the following program successfully:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int swap(int* a, int* b) {
  int t;
  t = *a; *a = *b; *b = t;
  return t;
}

int fib(int n) {
  int a, b;
  for (a = b = 1; n &amp;gt; 2; n = n - 1) {
    swap(&amp;amp;a, &amp;amp;b);
    b = b + a;
  }
  return b;
}

int main() {
  return fib(10); // 55
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, enough about deciding things, let's get into the code!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Helper types&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a small collection of helper types and classes that the compiler uses. None of them are particularly strange, so I'll pass over them fairly quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Emitter&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:21)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a singleton helper to emit nicely-formatted WebAssembly code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WebAssembly, at least the textual format, is formatted as s-expressions, but individual instructions don't need to be parenthesized:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(module
  ;; &amp;lt;snip...&amp;gt;
  (func $swap
    (param $a i32)
    (param $b i32)
    (result i32)
    global.get $__stack_pointer ;; prelude -- adjust stack pointer
    i32.const 12
    i32.sub
    ;; &amp;lt;snip...&amp;gt;
  )
)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Emitter&lt;/code&gt; just helps with emitting code with nice indentation so it's easier to read.
It also has a &lt;code&gt;no_emit&lt;/code&gt; method, which will be used for an ugly hack later‚Äîstay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;StringPool (compiler.py:53)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;StringPool&lt;/code&gt; holds all the string constants so they can be arranged in a contiguous region of memory, and hands out addresses into that for the codegen to use.
When you write &lt;code&gt;char *s = "abc"&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;c500&lt;/code&gt;, what really happens is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;StringPool&lt;/code&gt;appends a null terminator&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;StringPool&lt;/code&gt;checks if it's already stored&lt;code&gt;"abc"&lt;/code&gt;, and if so, just hands that address back&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Otherwise, &lt;code&gt;StringPool&lt;/code&gt;adds it to a dictionary along with the base address + the total byte length stored so far‚Äîthe address of this new string in the pool&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;StringPool&lt;/code&gt;hands that address back&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When all the code is finished compiling, we create an &lt;code&gt;rodata&lt;/code&gt;section with the giant concatenated string produced by&lt;code&gt;StringPool&lt;/code&gt;, stored at the string pool base address (retroactively making all the addresses&lt;code&gt;StringPool&lt;/code&gt;handed out valid)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Lexer&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:98)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Lexer&lt;/code&gt; class is complex, because lexing C is complex (&lt;code&gt;(\\([\\abfnrtv'"?]|[0-7]{1,3}|x[A-Fa-f0-9]{1,2}))&lt;/code&gt; is a real regex in that code for character escapes), but conceptually simple: the lexer marches along identifying what the token at the current position is.
The caller can peek that token, or it can use &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; to tell the lexer to advance, "consuming" that token.
It can also use &lt;code&gt;try_next&lt;/code&gt; to conditionally advance only if the next token is a certain kind‚Äîbasically, &lt;code&gt;try_next&lt;/code&gt; is a shortcut for &lt;code&gt;if self.peek().kind == token: return self.next()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's some additionally complexity because of something called the "lexer hack". Essentially, when parsing C you want to know if something is a type name or variable name (because that context matters for compiling certain expressions), but there's no syntactic distinction between them: &lt;code&gt;int int_t = 0;&lt;/code&gt; is perfectly valid C, as is &lt;code&gt;typedef int int_t; int_t x = 0;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To know if an arbitrary token &lt;code&gt;int_t&lt;/code&gt; is a type name or a variable name, we need to feed type information from the parsing/codegen stage back into the lexer.
This is a giant pain for regular compilers that want to keep their lexer, parser, and codegen modules pure and plantonically separate, but it's actually not very hard for us!
I'll explain it more when we get to the &lt;code&gt;typedef&lt;/code&gt; section, but basically we just keep &lt;code&gt;types: set[str]&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;Lexer&lt;/code&gt;, and when lexing, check if a token is in that set before giving it a token kind:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if m := re.match(r"^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*", self.src[self.loc :]):
    tok = m.group(0)
    ...
    # lexer hack
    return Token(TOK_TYPE if tok in self.types else TOK_NAME, tok, self.line)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CType&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:201)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is just a dataclass for representing information about a C type, like you'd write in &lt;code&gt;int **t&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;short t[5]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;char **t[17]&lt;/code&gt;, minus the &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It contains:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the type's name (with any typedefs resolved), such as &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;what level of pointer is is (&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;= not a pointer,&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;int *t&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;int **t&lt;/code&gt;, and so on)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;what the array size is (&lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;= not an array,&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;int t[0]&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;int t[1]&lt;/code&gt;, and so on)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, as mentioned before, this type only supports single-level arrays, and not nested arrays like &lt;code&gt;int t[5][6]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;FrameVar&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;StackFrame&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:314)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These classes handle our C stack frames.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, because you can't take references to the WASM stack, we have to manually handle the C stack, we can't use the WASM one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To set up the C stack, the prelude emitted in &lt;code&gt;__main__&lt;/code&gt; sets up a global &lt;code&gt;__stack_pointer&lt;/code&gt; variable, and then every function call decrements that by however much space the function needs for its parameters and local variables‚Äîcalculated by that function's &lt;code&gt;StackFrame&lt;/code&gt; instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll go over how that calculation works in more detail when we get to parsing functions, but essentially, each parameter and local variable gets a slot in that stack space, and increases &lt;code&gt;StackFrame.frame_size&lt;/code&gt; (and thus the offset of the next variable) depending on its size.
The offset, type information, and other data for each parameter and local variable are stored in a &lt;code&gt;FrameVar&lt;/code&gt; instance, in &lt;code&gt;StackFrame.variables&lt;/code&gt;, in order of declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;ExprMeta&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:344)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This final dataclass is used to track whether the result of an expression is a value or a place. We need to keep track of this distinction in order to handle certain expressions differently based on how they're used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, if you have a variable &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; of type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, it can be used in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;x + 1&lt;/code&gt;wants the value of&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, say&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, to operate on&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;x&lt;/code&gt;wants the address of&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, say&lt;code&gt;0xcafedead&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we parse the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; expression, we can easily fetch the address from the stack frame:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# look the variable up in the `StackFrame`
var, offset = frame.get_var_and_offset(varname)
# put the base address of the C stack on top of the WASM stack
emit(f"global.get $__stack_pointer")
# add the offset (in the C stack)
emit(f"i32.const {offset}")
emit("i32.add")
# the address of the variable is now on top of the WASM stack
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But now what? If we &lt;code&gt;i32.load&lt;/code&gt; this address to get the value, then &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;x&lt;/code&gt; will have no way to get the address.
But if we don't load it, then &lt;code&gt;x + 1&lt;/code&gt; will try to add one to the address, resulting in &lt;code&gt;0xcafedeae&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's where &lt;code&gt;ExprMeta&lt;/code&gt; comes in: we leave the address on the stack, and return an &lt;code&gt;ExprMeta&lt;/code&gt; indicating this is a place:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;return ExprMeta(True, var.type)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, for operations like &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; that always want to operate on values instead of places, there's a function &lt;code&gt;load_result&lt;/code&gt; that turns any places into values:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def load_result(em: ExprMeta) -&amp;gt; ExprMeta:
    """Load a place `ExprMeta`, turning it into a value
    `ExprMeta` of the same type"""
    if em.is_place:
        # emit i32.load, i32.load16_s, etc., based on the type
        emit(em.type.load_ins())
    return ExprMeta(False, em.type)

...
# in the code for parsing `+`
lhs_meta = load_result(parse_lhs())
...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, an operation like &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; just doesn't load the result, and instead leaves the address on the stack: in an important sense, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; is a no-op in our compiler, since it doesn't emit any code!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if lexer.try_next("&amp;amp;"):
    meta = prefix()
    if not meta.is_place:
        die("cannot take reference to value", lexer.line)
    # type of &amp;amp;x is int* when x is int, hence more_ptr
    return ExprMeta(False, meta.type.more_ptr())
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note also that, despite being an address, the result of &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; isn't a place! (The code returns an &lt;code&gt;ExprMeta&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;is_place=False&lt;/code&gt;.)
The result of &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; should be treated like a value, since &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;x + 1&lt;/code&gt; should add &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; (or rather, &lt;code&gt;sizeof(x)&lt;/code&gt;) to the address.
That's why we need the place/value distinction, since just "being an address" isn't enough to know whether the result of an expression should be loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OK, enough about helper classes. Let's move on to the meat of codegen!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Parsing and code generation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The general control flow of the compiler goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The blue rectangles represent the main functions of the compiler‚Äî&lt;code&gt;__main__&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;compile()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;global_declaration()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;statement()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;expression()&lt;/code&gt;.
The long chain of squares at the bottom shows the operator precedence‚Äîmost of those functions are automatically generated by a higher-order function, however!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll go through the blue squares one-by-one and explain anything interesting in each.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;__main__&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:827)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is pretty short and dull. Here it is in full:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if __name__ == "__main__":
    import fileinput

    with fileinput.input(encoding="utf-8") as fi:
        compile("".join(fi))  # todo: make this line-at-a-time?
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly I never finished that TODO! The only really interesting thing here is the &lt;code&gt;fileinput&lt;/code&gt; module, which you may not have heard of.
From the module docs,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Typical use is:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;import fileinput for line in fileinput.input(encoding="utf-8"): process(line)&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This iterates over the lines of all files listed in sys.argv[1:], defaulting to sys.stdin if the list is empty. If a filename is '-' it is also replaced by sys.stdin and the optional arguments mode and openhook are ignored. To specify an alternative list of filenames, pass it as the argument to input(). A single file name is also allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means, technically, &lt;code&gt;c500&lt;/code&gt; supports multiple files!
(If you don't mind them all being concatenated and having messed-up line numbers :-) &lt;code&gt;fileinput&lt;/code&gt; is actually fairly sophisticated and has a &lt;code&gt;filelineno()&lt;/code&gt; method, I just didn't use it for space reasons.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;compile()&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:805)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;compile()&lt;/code&gt; is the first interesting function here, and is short enough to also include verbatim:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def compile(src: str) -&amp;gt; None:
    # compile an entire file

    with emit.block("(module", ")"):
        emit("(memory 3)")
        emit(f"(global $__stack_pointer (mut i32) (i32.const {PAGE_SIZE * 3}))")

        emit("(func $__dup_i32 (param i32) (result i32 i32)")
        emit("  (local.get 0) (local.get 0))")
        emit("(func $__swap_i32 (param i32) (param i32) (result i32 i32)")
        emit("  (local.get 1) (local.get 0))")

        global_frame = StackFrame()
        lexer = Lexer(src, set(["int", "char", "short", "long", "float", "double"]))
        while lexer.peek().kind != TOK_EOF:
            global_declaration(global_frame, lexer)

        emit('(export "main" (func $main))')

        # emit str_pool data section
        emit(f'(data $.rodata (i32.const {str_pool.base}) "{str_pool.pooled()}")')
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This function handles emitting the module level prelude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, we emit a pragma for the WASM VM to reserve 3 pages of memory (&lt;code&gt;(memory 3)&lt;/code&gt;), and we set the stack pointer to start at the end of that reserved region (it will grow downwards).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, we define two stack manipulation helpers &lt;code&gt;__dup_i32&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;__swap_i32&lt;/code&gt;.
These should be familiar if you've ever used Forth: &lt;code&gt;dup&lt;/code&gt; duplicates the item on top of the WASM stack (&lt;code&gt;a -- a a&lt;/code&gt;), and &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; swaps the position of the top two items on the WASM stack (&lt;code&gt;a b -- b a&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, we initialize a stack frame to hold the global variables, initialize the lexer with the built-in typenames for the lexer hack, and chew up global declarations until we run out!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we export &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; and dump the string pool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;global_declaration()&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:743)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This function is too long to inline the whole thing, but the signature looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;def global_declaration(global_frame: StackFrame, lexer: Lexer) -&amp;gt; None:
    # parse a global declaration -- typedef, global variable, or function.
    ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It handles typedefs, global variables, and functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typedefs are cool, since this is where the lexer hack happens!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if lexer.try_next("typedef"):
    # yes, `typedef int x[24];` is valid (but weird) c
    type, name = parse_type_and_name(lexer)
    # lexer hack!
    lexer.types.add(name.content)
    typedefs[name.content] = type

    lexer.next(";")
    return
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We reuse a general type-name parsing tool since typedefs inherit all of C's weird "declaration reflects usage" rules, which is convenient for us. (and less so for the perplexed newbie!) Then we inform the lexer we've discovered a new type name, so that in the future that token will be lexed as a type name instead of a variable name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally for typedefs, we store the type in the global typedef registry, consume the trailing semicolon, and return back to &lt;code&gt;compile()&lt;/code&gt; for the next global declaration.
Importantly, the type we store is a whole parsed type, since if you do &lt;code&gt;typedef int* int_p;&lt;/code&gt; and then later write &lt;code&gt;int_p *x&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; should get a resulting type of &lt;code&gt;int**&lt;/code&gt;‚Äîthe pointer level is additive!
That means we can't just store the base C typename, and instead need to store an entire &lt;code&gt;CType&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the declaration wasn't a typedef, we parse a variable type and name. If we find a &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; token we know it's a global variable declaration (since we don't support global initializers).
In that case, we add the global variable to the global stack frame and bail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if lexer.try_next(";"):
    global_frame.add_var(name.content, decl_type, False)
    return
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there's no semicolon, however, we're definitely dealing with a function. To generate code for a function, we need to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make a new &lt;code&gt;StackFrame&lt;/code&gt;for the function, named&lt;code&gt;frame&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then, parse all the parameters and store them in the frame with &lt;code&gt;frame.add_var(varname.content, type, is_parameter=True)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After that, parse all the variable declarations with &lt;code&gt;variable_declaration(lexer, frame)&lt;/code&gt;, which adds them to&lt;code&gt;frame&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Now we know how large the function's stack frame needs to be (&lt;code&gt;frame.frame_size&lt;/code&gt;), so we can start emitting the prelude!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;First, for all the parameters in the stack frame (added with &lt;code&gt;is_parameter=True&lt;/code&gt;), we generate WASM&lt;code&gt;param&lt;/code&gt;declarations so the function can be called with the WASM calling convention (passing the parameters on the WASM stack):&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;for v in frame.variables.values():
    if v.is_parameter:
        emit(f"(param ${v.name} {v.type.wasmtype})")
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then, we can emit a &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt;annotation for the return type, and adjust the C stack pointer to make space for the function's parameters and variables:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;emit(f"(result {decl_type.wasmtype})")
emit("global.get $__stack_pointer")
# grow the stack downwards
emit(f"i32.const {frame.frame_offset + frame.frame_size}")
emit("i32.sub")
emit("global.set $__stack_pointer")
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For each parameter (in reverse order, because stacks), copy it from the WASM stack to our stack:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;for v in reversed(frame.variables.values()):
    if v.is_parameter:
        emit("global.get $__stack_pointer")
        emit(f"i32.const {frame.get_var_and_offset(v.name)[1]}")
        emit("i32.add")
        # fetch the variable from the WASM stack
        emit(f"local.get ${v.name}")
        # and store it at the calculated address in the C stack
        emit(v.type.store_ins())
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finally, we can call &lt;code&gt;statement(lexer, frame)&lt;/code&gt;in a loop to codegen all the statements in the function, until we hit the closing bracket:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;while not lexer.try_next("}"):
    statement(lexer, frame)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bonus step: we assume the function will always have a &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;, so we&lt;code&gt;emit("unreachable")&lt;/code&gt;so the WASM analyzer doesn't freak out.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whoof! That was a lot. But that's all for functions, and thus for &lt;code&gt;global_declaration()&lt;/code&gt;, so let's move on to &lt;code&gt;statement()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;statement()&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:565)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a lot of code in &lt;code&gt;statement()&lt;/code&gt;.
However, most of it is fairly repetitive, so I'll just explain &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;, which should give a good overview.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember how WASM doesn't have jumps, and instead has structured control flow? That's relevant now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let's see how it works with &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;, where it's not too much trouble.
A while loop in WASM looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;block
  loop
    ;; &amp;lt;test&amp;gt;
    i32.eqz
    br_if 1
    ;; &amp;lt;loop body&amp;gt;
    br 0
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see, there are two types of blocks‚Äî&lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; (there's also an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; block type, which I didn't use).
Each encloses some number of statements and then ends with &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;.
Inside a block, you can break with &lt;code&gt;br&lt;/code&gt;, or conditionally based on the top of the WASM stack with &lt;code&gt;br_if&lt;/code&gt; (there's also &lt;code&gt;br_table&lt;/code&gt;, which I didn't use).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;br&lt;/code&gt; family takes a labelidx parameter, here either &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, which is what level of block the operation applies to.
So in our while loop, the &lt;code&gt;br_if 1&lt;/code&gt; applies to the outer block‚Äîindex 1, while the &lt;code&gt;br 0&lt;/code&gt; applies to the inner block‚Äîindex 0. (indices are always relative to the instruction in question‚Äî0 is the innermost block to that instruction.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the last rule to know is that a &lt;code&gt;br&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt; jumps forwards, to the end of the &lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt;, whereas a &lt;code&gt;br&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; jumps backwards, to the beginning of the &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So hopefully the while loop code makes sense now! Looking at it again,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;block
  loop
    ;; &amp;lt;test&amp;gt;
    i32.eqz

    ;; if test == 0, jump forwards (1 = labelidx of the `block`),
    ;; out of the loop
    br_if 1

    ;; &amp;lt;loop body&amp;gt;

    ;; unconditionally jump backwards (0 = labelidx of the `loop`).
    ;; to the beginning of the loop
    br 0
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In more normal assembly, this would correspond to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.loop_start
  ;; &amp;lt;test&amp;gt;
  jz .block_end
  ;; &amp;lt;loop body&amp;gt;
  jmp .loop_start
.block_end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But with jumps, you can express things that you can't (easily) in WASM‚Äîfor example, you could jump into the middle of a block.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(This mainly is an issue for compiling C's &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;, which I didn't even attempt‚Äîthere's an algorithm that can transform any code using &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; into an equivalent program using structured control flow, but it's complicated and I don't think it would work with our single-pass approach.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for while loops, this isn't too bad. All we have to do is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# `emit.block` is a context manager to emit the first parameter ("block" here),
# and then the second ("end") on exit
with emit.block("block", "end"):
    with emit.block("loop", "end"):
        # emit code for the test, ending with `i32.eqz`
        parenthesized_test()
        # emit code to exit the loop if the `i32.eqz` was true
        emit("br_if 1")
        # emit code for the body
        bracketed_block_or_single_statement(lexer, frame)
        # emit code to jump back to the beginning
        emit("br 0")
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With for loops though, it gets nasty. Consider a for loop like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; 5; i = i + 1) {
    j = j * 2 + i;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The order the parts of the for loop will be seen by the lexer/code generator is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;i = 0&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;i &amp;lt; 5&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;i = i + 1&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;j = j * 2 + i&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the order we need to put them in the code, to work with WASM's structured control flow, is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;block
  ;; &amp;lt; code for `i = 0` (1) &amp;gt;
  loop
    ;; &amp;lt; code for `i &amp;lt; 5` (2) &amp;gt;
    br_if 1
    ;; &amp;lt; code for `j = j * 2 + i` (4!) &amp;gt;
    ;; &amp;lt; code for `i = i + 1` (3!) &amp;gt;
    br 0
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that 3 and 4 are inverted in the generated code, making the order 1, 2, 4, 3. This is a problem for a single pass compiler! Unlike a normal compiler, we can't store the advancement statement for later. Or‚Ä¶ can we?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How I ended up handling this is by making the lexer cloneable, and re-parsing the advancement statement after parsing the body. Essentially, the code looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;elif lexer.try_next("for"):
    lexer.next("(")
    with emit.block("block", "end"):
        # parse initializer (i = 0)
        # (outside of loop since it only happens once)
        if lexer.peek().kind != ";":
            expression(lexer, frame)
            emit("drop") # discard result of initializer
        lexer.next(";")

        with emit.block("loop", "end"):
            # parse test (i &amp;lt; 5), if present
            if lexer.peek().kind != ";":
                load_result(expression(lexer, frame))
                emit("i32.eqz ;; for test")
                emit("br_if 1 ;; exit loop")
            lexer.next(";")

            # handle first pass of advancement statement, if present
            saved_lexer = None
            if lexer.peek().kind != ")":
                saved_lexer = lexer.clone()
                # emit.no_emit() disables code output inside of it,
                # so we can skip over the advancement statement for now
                # to get to the for loop body
                with emit.no_emit():
                    expression(lexer, frame)
            lexer.next(")")

            # parse body
            bracketed_block_or_single_statement(lexer, frame)

            # now that we parsed the body, go back and re-parse
            # the advancement statement using the saved lexer
            if saved_lexer != None:
                expression(saved_lexer, frame)

            # jump back to beginning of loop
            emit("br 0")
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see, the hack is to save the lexer, then use that to go back and handle the advancement statement later, instead of saving the syntax tree like a normal compiler would. Not very elegant‚Äîcompiling for loops is probably the gnarliest code in the compiler‚Äîbut it works well enough!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other parts of &lt;code&gt;statement()&lt;/code&gt; are mostly similar, so I'll skip over them to get to the last main part of the compiler‚Äî&lt;code&gt;expression()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;code&gt;expression()&lt;/code&gt; (compiler.py:375)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;expression()&lt;/code&gt; is the last big method in the compiler, and it handles parsing expressions, as you might expect.
It contains many inner methods, one for each precedence level, each returning the &lt;code&gt;ExprMeta&lt;/code&gt; struct described earlier (which handle the "place vs value" distinction and can be turned into a value using &lt;code&gt;load_result&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bottom of the precedence stack is &lt;code&gt;value()&lt;/code&gt; (somewhat confusingly named, since it can return &lt;code&gt;ExprMeta(is_place=True, ...)&lt;/code&gt;).
It handles constants, parenthesized expressions, function calls, and variable names.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above that, the basic pattern for a precedence level is a function like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt; def muldiv() -&amp;gt; ExprMeta:
    # lhs is the higher precedence operation (prefix operators, in this case)
    lhs_meta = prefix()
    # check if we can parse an operation
    if lexer.peek().kind in ("*", "/", "%"):
        # if so, load in the left hand side
        lhs_meta = load_result(lhs_meta)
        # grab the specific operator
        op_token = lexer.next()
        # the right hand side should use this function, for e.g. `x * y * z`
        load_result(muldiv())
        # emit an opcode to do the operation
        if op_token == "*":
            emit(f"i32.mul")
        elif op_token == "/":
            emit(f"i32.div_s")
        else: # %
            emit(f"i32.rem_s")
        # mask down the result if this is a less-than-32bit type
        mask_to_sizeof(lhs_meta.type)
        # we produced a value (is_place=False)
        return ExprMeta(False, lhs_meta.type)
    # if we didn't find a token, just return the left hand side unchanged
    return lhs_meta
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, this pattern is so consistent that most operations, including &lt;code&gt;muldiv&lt;/code&gt;, aren't written out, but instead defined by a higher-order function &lt;code&gt;makeop&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# function for generating simple operator precedence levels from declarative
# dictionaries of { token: instruction_to_emit }
def makeop(
    higher: Callable[[], ExprMeta], ops: dict[str, str], rtype: CType | None = None
) -&amp;gt; Callable[[], ExprMeta]:
    def op() -&amp;gt; ExprMeta:
        lhs_meta = higher()
        if lexer.peek().kind in ops.keys():
            lhs_meta = load_result(lhs_meta)
            op_token = lexer.next()
            load_result(op())
            # TODO: type checking?
            emit(f"{ops[op_token.kind]}")
            mask_to_sizeof(rtype or lhs_meta.type)
            return ExprMeta(False, lhs_meta.type)
        return lhs_meta

    return op

muldiv = makeop(prefix, {"*": "i32.mul", "/": "i32.div_s", "%": "i32.rem_s"})
...
shlr = makeop(plusminus, {"&amp;lt;&amp;lt;": "i32.shl", "&amp;gt;&amp;gt;": "i32.shr_s"})
cmplg = makeop(
    shlr,
    {"&amp;lt;": "i32.lt_s", "&amp;gt;": "i32.gt_s", "&amp;lt;=": "i32.le_s", "&amp;gt;=": "i32.ge_s"},
    CType("int"),
)
cmpe = makeop(cmplg, {"==": "i32.eq", "!=": "i32.ne"}, CType("int"))
bitand = makeop(cmpe, {"&amp;amp;": "i32.and"})
bitor = makeop(bitand, {"|": "i32.or"})
xor = makeop(bitor, {"^": "i32.xor"})
...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only a few operations with special behavior need to be defined explicitly, like &lt;code&gt;plusminus&lt;/code&gt; which needs to handle the nuances of C pointer math.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that's it! That's the last main piece of the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wrapping up...&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's been our tour of the C compiler in 500 lines of Python! Compilers have a reputation for being complex‚ÄîGCC and Clang are massive, and even TCC, the Tiny C Compiler, is tens of thousands of lines of code‚Äîbut if you're willing to sacrifice code quality and do everything in a single pass, they can be surprisingly compact!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd be interested to hear if you write your own single-pass compiler‚Äîmaybe for a custom language? I think this kind of compiler could potentially be a great stage0 for a self-hosted language, since it's so simple.&lt;/p&gt;

python:         500 (100.00%)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't count comments since I didn't want to give myself an incentive to not write them. The code is also formatted with &lt;code&gt;black&lt;/code&gt;: there aren't any 400-character-long lines here!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I actually originally set out to explain the entire compiler, line-by-line. I wrote 10,000 words and only got to variable declarations. I wrote an entire literate programming environment. This yak wasn't just shaved, it was skinned, tanned, and constructed into a yurt of my own madness. Needless to say, that draft will not be seeing the light of day.&lt;/p&gt;

"pack/*/start" and "pack/*/opt", you could put them anywhere.  We recommend
you put them below "pack/*/opt", for example
"~/.config/nvim/pack/mycolors/opt/dark/colors/very_dark.vim".

&lt;code&gt;:packadd&lt;/code&gt;.  E.g. depending on the compiler
version:&lt;quote&gt;if foo_compiler_version &amp;gt; 34 packadd foo_new else packadd foo_old endifThe "after" directory is most likely not useful in a package. It's not disallowed though.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;:packadd&lt;/code&gt;.

Including this
generated file in the package means that the user can drop the package in the
pack directory and the help command works right away.  Don't forget to re-run
the command after changing the plugin help:&lt;quote&gt;:helptags path/start/foobar/doc :helptags path/opt/fooextra/doc&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;call foolib#getit()pack/foo/start/two/plugin/two.vim&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;call foolib#getit()pack/foo/start/lib/autoload/foolib.vim&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;func foolib#getit()This works, because start packages will be searched for autoload files, when sourcing the plugins.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;$XDG_DATA_HOME/nvim/site/pack/core/opt&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;$XDG_DATA_HOME/nvim/site&lt;/code&gt; needs to
be part of 'packpath'. It usually is, but might not be in cases like --clean
or setting $XDG_DATA_HOME during startup. Plugin's subdirectory name matches
plugin's name in specification. It is assumed that all plugins in the
directory are managed exclusively by &lt;code&gt;vim.pack&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; executable of at least
version 2.36. Target plugins should be Git repositories with versions as named
tags following semver convention &lt;code&gt;v&amp;lt;major&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;minor&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;patch&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;vim.pack.add({
  -- Install "plugin1" and use default branch (usually `main` or `master`)
  'https://github.com/user/plugin1',
  -- Same as above, but using a table (allows setting other options)
  { src = 'https://github.com/user/plugin1' },
  -- Specify plugin's name (here the plugin will be called "plugin2"
  -- instead of "generic-name")
  { src = 'https://github.com/user/generic-name', name = 'plugin2' },
  -- Specify version to follow during install and update
  {
    src = 'https://github.com/user/plugin3',
    -- Version constraint, see |vim.version.range()|
    version = vim.version.range('1.0'),
  },
  {
    src = 'https://github.com/user/plugin4',
    -- Git branch, tag, or commit hash
    version = 'main',
  },
})
-- Plugin's code can be used directly after `add()`
plugin1 = require('plugin1')&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;add()&lt;/code&gt; call.
&lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt;. Let's say, plugin
  named 'plugin1' has changed to &lt;code&gt;vim.version.range('*')&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;vim.pack.update({ 'plugin1' })&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; set to current commit hash.
  You can get it by running &lt;code&gt;vim.pack.update({ 'plugin-name' })&lt;/code&gt; and yanking
  the word describing current state (looks like &lt;code&gt;abc12345&lt;/code&gt;).
&lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; set to whichever version you
  want it to be updated.
&lt;code&gt;kind&lt;/code&gt; - one of "install" (install on disk), "update" (update existing
  plugin), "delete" (delete from disk).
&lt;code&gt;spec&lt;/code&gt; - plugin's specification with defaults made explicit.
&lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt; - full path to plugin's directory.
&lt;code&gt;{src}&lt;/code&gt;       (&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;) URI from which to install and pull updates. Any
                    format supported by &lt;code&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt; is allowed.
&lt;code&gt;{name}&lt;/code&gt;     (&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;) Name of plugin. Will be used as directory name.
                    Default: &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; repository name.
&lt;code&gt;{version}&lt;/code&gt;  (&lt;code&gt;string|vim.VersionRange&lt;/code&gt;) Version to use for install and
                    updates. Can be:
&lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; (no value, default) to use repository's default
                      branch (usually &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;).
&lt;code&gt;{data}&lt;/code&gt;     (&lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;) Arbitrary data associated with a plugin.
&lt;code&gt;{specs}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;{opts}&lt;/code&gt;)                                          vim.pack.add()&lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;
        subdirectory (via &lt;code&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt;) and update state to match &lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt;
        (via &lt;code&gt;git checkout&lt;/code&gt;).
&lt;code&gt;load&lt;/code&gt; function)
      making it reachable by Nvim.
&lt;code&gt;version&lt;/code&gt; can be not the one actually
      present on disk. Execute vim.pack.update() to synchronize.
&lt;code&gt;{specs}&lt;/code&gt;  (&lt;code&gt;(string|vim.pack.Spec)[]&lt;/code&gt;) List of plugin specifications.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After working hard since our Polars Cloud announcement last February, we are pleased to officially launch Polars Cloud. Polars Cloud is now Generally Available on AWS. Beyond that, we also launched our novel Distributed Engine in Open Beta on Polars Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can immediately get started at https://cloud.pola.rs/.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After that you can fire a remote distributed query:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import polars_cloud as pc
import polars as pl
from datetime import date

with pc.ComputeContext(
    workspace="&amp;lt;my-workspace&amp;gt;",
    cpus=2,
    memory=8,
    cluster_size=8,
) as ctx:
    in_progress = (
        pl.scan_parquet("s3://polars-cloud-samples-us-east-2-prd/pdsh/sf100/lineitem/",
            storage_options={
                "aws_request_payer": "true",
            })
        .filter(pl.col("l_shipdate") &amp;lt;= date(1998, 9, 2))
        .group_by("l_returnflag", "l_linestatus")
        .agg(
            count_order=pl.len()
        )
        .remote(ctx)
        .distributed()
        .execute()
    )

    print(in_progress.await_result().head)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Closing the DataFrame scale gap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The General Availability of Polars Cloud on AWS marks a major milestone in closing the DataFrame scale gap‚Äîthe historic divide between the ease of pandas locally and the scalability of PySpark remotely. By making Polars Cloud broadly accessible, we bring to life our mission of delivering fast, flexible and open-source data tools that run everywhere, giving users a single API that seamlessly scales from a laptop to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Equally significant is the Open Beta of our Distributed Engine, which leverages Polars‚Äô novel streaming architecture to offer not just horizontal but also vertical and diagonal scaling strategies. This design directly addresses the cost, complexity and performance tradeoffs users face today, while making high-performance compute broadly accessible. Together, these launches represent a step-change: remote execution that feels native, distribution without friction, and an architecture built to meet the future of large-scale data processing head-on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. What is Polars Cloud&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Polars Cloud is a managed data platform that enables you to run Polars queries remotely in the cloud at scale. We will manage the cloud infrastructure and the scaling. Besides remote execution, Polars Cloud offers different scaling strategies, where distributed is most important. Our distributed engine uses our OSS streaming engine on the workers. This ensures we stay committed in making OSS Polars better as we will become one of the direct users. Because of Polars‚Äô strength in vertical compute, Polars‚Äô distributed offers not only horizontal, but also diagonal scaling strategies. Here we have a single big worker for tasks that would be better off on a beefy single node and would not benefit from the shuffling overhead. Polars Cloud will allow you to choose the best scaling strategy that fits your use case, offering one API for any scale, meaning you can reduce cost, time, and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learn more about Polars Cloud in our initial announcement post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2. Polars Distributed Engine in Public Beta&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our distributed engine is available in Public Beta. We are confident that we achieved a state where our distributed engine is useful and in some cases even one of the best options available. There are of course features we haven‚Äôt supported in a distributed manner yet, in that case we will automatically fall back to a single node for that operation. Among many other operations, we can run our PDS-H benchmark fully distributed. If you want to stay updated of what our distributed engine is capable of, keep an eye on the tracking issue here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where I think our distributed engine shines, is combining partitionable queries with order dependent data processing like in this query below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;result = (
    trades.group_by_dynamic(
        "time",
        every="1m",
        group_by="symbol"
    ).agg(
        avg_price=pl.col("price").mean(),
        total_size=pl.col("size").sum(),
        interval_start=pl.col("time"),
    ).join_asof(
        fairs,
        left_on="interval_start",
        right_on="time",
        by="symbol",
        strategy="backward"
    ).select(
        "symbol",
        "interval_start",
        "avg_price",
        "total_size",
        "fair_value"
    )
)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This query really combines the power of Polars‚Äô single node execution with the scalability of Polars‚Äô distributed. It can horizontally partition over symbols and then utilize Polars‚Äô fast query engine to process the partitions on powerful workers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3. Near future&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Features that will land soon are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On premise support&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We have begun working on supporting the Polars Cloud distributed architecture on premise. We expect to onboard the first clients in the coming months. Are you interested in on-premise Polars Cloud, contact us via the form below.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Live cluster dashboard&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The current version of Polars Cloud has a dashboard that shows you summaries of your queries, clusters, vCPU etc. The cluster dashboard we are building will have a direct connection to your cluster, allowing us to show much more information. And because Polars streaming executor is written from scratch, we can add custom tracing that can give you deep insights in the operations that your queries spend time and how much utilization it has at any point in time. The possibilities here are very exciting to me as our vertical integration means we have access to all the information in the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Orchestration&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As we are building a data platform, as minimal version of task orchestration cannot be left out. We don‚Äôt aim to replace tools like Airflow or Prefect, but we do want to offer you the option to schedule your queries with Polars Cloud alone. Note that we believe in strong integration with other tools and have therefore chosen for a Polars Cloud client that can directly be used with Polars OSS and popular orchestration tools.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Autoscaling&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As we can scale both vertically and horizontally with heterogenous worker sizes, we have unique scaling opportunities. We plan to land vertical and diagonal (where the big worker scales) autoscaling soon. Later we will expand that to horizontal autoscaling as well.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Catalog support&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Our early design partners informed us that most users were using iceberg to load their data. Since then we‚Äôve made a large effort to make our iceberg support native and distributed. Besides the iceberg table format, we will also expose a catalog so that users can organize their datasets easier.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Multi-region&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Initially we launched in the US East region only. This gives us acceptable latencies for the US and western Europe. We are going to launch multi-region as soon as possible so that all regions will experience minimal latencies.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Get started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for updates. We will follow up with more blogs and features in the coming weeks and if you have any feedback, track our client repo for posting issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;30 minutes with a stranger&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These two people are volunteers for a research project. Let√¢s call them Kate and Dawn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They don√¢t know each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers instructed them to get on this video call and talk to their partner for 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They could talk about whatever they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this story, we√¢ll go through 30 minutes of conversation between the people you see here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are a subset of nearly 1,700 conversations between about 1,500 people as part of a research project called the CANDOR corpus. The goal was to gather a huge amount of data to spur research on how we converse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click on a person to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These conversations paired people across demographics, including√¢¬¶&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Age&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Race&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Educational attainment&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Political ideology&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before the conversation began, participants were asked how they felt. Most said they felt just average.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then they were paired up and the conversation began.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the conversation, many people said they felt the same or worse than before the call!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We√¢ve gotten quite good at being with people who are similar to us. We often live near people of the same race and class. The education system funnels us into the same schools and similar jobs. Online algorithms group us with like-minded people. These relationships are called √¢bonding√¢ social capital√¢a term popularized by Robert Putnam in his landmark 2000 book, Bowling Alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Putnam also pointed out that what we√¢re missing is √¢bridging√¢ social capital√¢relationships with people unlike us. Most of our friends are of the same race and class as we are. We have the same political views as most of our friends. And the number of people who say they trust others has been decreasing for generations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Americans who say most people can be trusted&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That might contribute to why we really don√¢t want to talk to strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2014 study, researchers conducted a series of experiments on Illinois trains and buses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some commuters were told to keep to themselves during their trip; these participants predicted the isolation would give them a positive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other commuters were told to talk to strangers; these participants predicted they would have a negative experience. They assumed strangers wouldn√¢t want to talk to them, that strangers wouldn√¢t like them, and that they would have trouble maintaining a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After all, what if the person you approach gets angry? What if they accuse you of harassing them? What if they just think you√¢re weird?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hank, 38, held a beer and vaped during this conversation. He told Faith, 20, that he recently made four pounds of shredded chicken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This led to a conversation about how he used to be a chef, but he couldn√¢t imagine going back to that job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ra√É¬∫l, 43, downplayed the seriousness of Covid-19 at the start of this call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paige, 28, said she used to work at a senior living facility and that people didn√¢t care enough about Covid-19 because it mostly kills old people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This prompted a conversation about eldercare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We√¢re now about 13 minutes into the conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the conversation, most people felt the same as they did before the call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But let√¢s see how their moods changed as the conversation progressed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the middle of the conversation, a huge portion of people reported feeling better than at the start of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dawn is now telling Kate about why she decided to go into teaching, after getting some hints that Kate is a college professor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 2014 study on Illinois trains and buses, researchers followed up with people who were asked to talk to strangers√¢the people who predicted they wouldn√¢t enjoy the experience. What these participants reported back was almost no rejections, pleasant conversations, and an overall positive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This phenomenon has been replicated in several experiments. Whether it√¢s interacting with strangers in a scavenger hunt, meeting new people in a college dorm, or chatting up a barista, researchers have repeatedly found that people don√¢t think they√¢ll enjoy interacting with strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But after the interaction, participants tend to say it was a positive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early in the pandemic, the activity people missed most were things like going to restaurants, the gym, church, and the barbershop√¢places where we√¢re around strangers and acquaintances, or √¢weak ties.√¢ We normally have between 11 and 16 interactions with weak ties each day, but devoid of these spontaneous opportunities, only 15% of Americans said they made a new acquaintance during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I watched the entirety of many conversations. (I can√¢t publish the videos because of privacy concerns.) I was surprised how many of these conversations touched on intimate topics√¢things they might not even tell their friends or family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dawn started telling Kate about what kind of teacher she wants to be, largely based on her experiences of the education system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not every conversation went smoothly. Several conversations were derailed by a comment that turned off the other person, and caused the conversation to grind to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But those interactions were rare. In most conversations, people enjoyed hearing about their partner√¢s life and sharing their own lives√¢even when they had very little in common.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We√¢re nearing the end of the 30-minute conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here√¢s how participants felt in the middle of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of the conversation, participants were asked how they felt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the end of the call, the large majority of people said they felt better than when the conversation began.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here√¢s how much positive feelings increased on average in all 1,700 conversations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;To what extent do you feel positive feelings or negative feelings?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I√¢ve sorted the conversations by the age gap of the conversation partners√¢√¢ smaller age gaps at the top, √¢ bigger age gaps at the bottom. People enjoyed talking to people, young and old.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Positive feeling, by the age gap of conversation partner&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I√¢ve put conversations between people of √¢ different races at the top and √¢ same races at the bottom. Interracial conversations tended to lead to positive experiences about as much as they did for people of the same race.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Positive feeling, by whether conversation partner is the same race&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And most conversations between people with the √¢ same political ideology and √¢ differing political ideologies also had similar outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Positive feeling, by how different the conversation partner√¢s politics are&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social trust is critical for us to tackle some of the biggest problems ahead of us: the erosion of democracy, the emergence of AI, our warming planet, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a 2021 study, researchers looked at why social trust has decreased on an individual level. What they found was that income dissatisfaction, our experience of losing a job, and our decreasing confidence in political institutions account for most of the decline in trust. In short, we√¢ve created a world that is precarious and unstable for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel this, too. I√¢m scared by the big and small things happening in our world. I feel my environment crumbling around me, my sense of safety waning. I√¢ve looked at homes for sale in remote areas where I can disappear with my friends and family√¢where I don√¢t have to rely on strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the end of these conversations, several participants seemed to realize that they may never see their conversation partner again, and had to say their bittersweet goodbyes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I was taking the subway to work when a 16-year-old boy slipped on the subway platform and hit his chin on the ground. He stumbled onto the train and stood next to me. I kept my earbuds in and tried to convince myself this wasn√¢t my problem. Then out of the corner of my eye I saw that he√¢d split open his chin; blood and tears were gushing down his face. I looked around the train for someone else to help√¢maybe someone who works with kids. No one even looked up. So I grabbed some tissues from my backpack, turned to him, and told him to hold it against his chin. He was in shock. I tried to calm him down and told him to go to the nurse√¢s office when he got to school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All I could think was: What if that was me? Who would help me? Would everyone stand around like they√¢re doing now?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when I ran out of tissues to stop this kid√¢s bleeding, people on the train noticed and handed me disinfectant wipes, paper towels, and bandages. We were able to stop the bleeding. When I got off the train, another stranger got up and stood by his side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we√¢re wounded, we don√¢t trust the people around us. We shelter away because we think it√¢s the only way to be safe. We let strangers suffer because, in this emotional state, everyone is a threat. That means it√¢s hard to work with others to build the world we want. We√¢re left to hunker down for the inevitable dystopia that is to come.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I don√¢t want to live in that world. I want to feel safe. I want to help others to feel safe. And I want people to do the same for me√¢regardless of whether I√¢m a stranger or not.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

Through In Our Time on Radio 4 he has brought depth, insight, and humanity to our airwaves every single week for more than a quarter of a century.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having presented well over 1,000 episodes of the much-loved BBC Radio 4 series, Melvyn Bragg has made the decision to step down from In Our Time following the series which aired earlier this year. Melvyn has presented every episode of In Our Time since the series first launched in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Our Time is regularly one of the BBC√¢s most listened to on-demand programmes around the world, its appeal spanning generations. It is one of BBC Sounds' most popular podcasts amongst under 35s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last quarter of a century, Melvyn has skilfully led conversations about everything from the age of the Universe to √¢Zenobia√¢, Queen of the Palmyrene Empire. He has welcomed the company of the brightest and best academics in their fields, sharing their passion and knowledge with a fascinated audience right around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he will be much missed on In Our Time, Melvyn will continue to be a friend of Radio 4 with more to come to celebrate his extraordinary career, and a new series in 2026 (details to be announced soon).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melvyn Bragg says: "For a programme with a wholly misleading title which started from scratch with a six-month contract, it's been quite a ride! I have worked with many extremely talented and helpful people inside the BBC as well as some of the greatest academics around the world. It's been a great privilege and pleasure. I much look forward to continuing to work for the BBC on Radio 4. Thank you for listening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melvyn first joined the BBC in 1961 as a general trainee. His BBC career has spanned the World Service, a ten-year stint presenting Radio 4's Start the Week from 1988 - 1998 as well as numerous arts and culture programmes. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society and of The British Academy and was given a Peerage in 1998 and a Companion of Honour in 2017. Melvyn will continue to work with the BBC on future projects which are yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Davie, BBC Director General, says: √¢Melvyn√¢s passion for the arts, his intellectual curiosity, and his unwavering commitment to public service broadcasting over the last 60-plus years have enriched the lives of millions.

His fierce intellect, coupled with a wonderful curiosity and extraordinary passion for knowledge marks him out as one of the broadcasting greats. Though we will miss him on In Our Time, he leaves behind a unique legacy: the treasure trove of over 1,000 archive episodes, which are a wonderful resource for all those with a love of learning. I look forward to working with him on new projects for Radio 4.√¢&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To mark the end of an era, later this year Radio 4 will be airing some of Melvyn√¢s most cherished episodes and there will also be a curated selection on BBC Sounds chosen by some of In Our Time's most notable fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Our Time will be back on Radio 4 with a new presenter who will be announced in due course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biography&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melvyn Bragg was born in Wigton, Cumbria in 1939. He went to the local Grammar School and then to Wadham College, Oxford. He joined the BBC in 1961, and published his first novel For Want of a Nail in 1965. By that time he had become a Director on Huw Wheldon√¢s Arts programme Monitor. He worked with Ken Russell on The Debussy Film and again on The Music Lovers starring Glenda Jackson, and Isadora starring Vanessa Redgrave; he wrote the screenplay for Jesus Christ Superstar and for Play Dirty starring Michael Caine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He left the BBC and continued to write novels which include The Hired Man (Time Life Silver PEN Award), The Soldier√¢s Return (WH Smith Literary Award), Without A City Wall (Mail on Sunday John Llewellyn Rhys Prize), A Place In England, Son of War and Crossing The Lines (all three were nominated for The Man Booker Prize), Now Is The Time(Parliamentary Book Award 2016). Howard Goodall wrote a successful musical based on The Hired Man. There have also been non-fiction books √¢ The Adventure of English, The Impact of The King James Bible, On Giants√¢ Shoulders, Rich: The Life of Richard Burton, William Tyndale: A Very Brief History. Most of his novels are set in his native Cumbria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1977 he started The South Bank Show for LWT which he edited and presented for Sky Arts. He has presented the Radio 4 programme on Science, History and Religion, In Our Time, since 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society and of The British Academy.

      &lt;p&gt;Users across multiple Eastern European countries reported a significant and ongoing outage affecting a suite of Google services, causing widespread disruption to both work and daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Reports began flooding into downdetector.com and social media platforms around from users in Bulgaria, Turkey, Greece and other Eastern European countries. The issues appear to be widespread and are affecting core Google products.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Which Services Were Impacted?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The outage did not seem to be universal for all Google services, but the affected apps were critical to many:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list style="list-style-type: square;" rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;YouTube: Users experienced an inability to load videos, with many seeing error messages or an endless loading loop. Both the website and mobile app were affected.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Google Maps: The service was failing to load map data, search for locations, or calculate routes, leaving travellers and commuters without navigation assistance.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Google Search: In a particularly impactful failure, the core Google Search engine was returning error messages or failing to complete searches for a significant number of users.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Gmail: Some users were reporting issues with sending and receiving emails, though this appeared to be less consistent than the other outages.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Google Drive: Access to cloud-stored documents and files was also disrupted for many.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The common thread among error messages was a "5xx server error" ‚Äì a type of error that indicates a problem on Google's end, not with the user's individual internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, users can use other search engines such as Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, and Brave Search.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a developing story. We will update this article with more information as it becomes available, including an official response from Google.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My favorite color has changed throughout my life, cycling through the entire spectrum of visible light and beyond. I don‚Äôt remember when blue was the chosen one, exactly; maybe when I was 13 or so. After that, yellow, purple, orange, green, and pink occupied the top spot for various periods. Blue never made a comeback. I saw it as a banal, common color. After all, the sky is made of it, and the sky is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I realized when compiling the tech tree that blue is the most fascinating color, because it is the hardest of the common colors to create artificially.1 You can‚Äôt just take a piece of the sky and put it into a painting. And blue pigments are fairly rare in minerals, plants, and animals. So blue had to be invented, time and time again, from 4000 BC to the 21st century. It is the most technological color, and I‚Äôm willing to claim that this is why it is usually, in science fiction and elsewhere, used to represent the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story of blue starts with indigo. It is an organic dye made from plants in the Indigofera genus, which grow throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The first known traces of indigo dye come from the New World, in ancient Peru, 6,000 years ago, using Indigofera suffruticosa, or anil.2 In the Old World, it was known from Africa to East Asia, but became particularly associated with India (hence indi-go), where Indigofera tinctoria was domesticated. Indigo soon became a luxury, traded from India to Greco-Roman and then medieval Europe, where the same blue dye could only be made from a less productive plant, woad or Isatis tinctoria. Eventually the ‚Äúblue gold‚Äù became an important colonial crop in the Caribbean and was part of the story of slavery, next to sugar, tobacco, and cotton.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before indigo was a thing in the Old World (that started circa 2400 BC), the Egyptians had already become obsessed with the color blue. Besides the sky, it was available in the form of semiprecious stones like turquoise and lapis lazuli, cobalt oxide (more on that later), as well as the mineral azurite, which they mined in Sinai and the Eastern Desert.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Azurite would later enjoy a fruitful career as the main blue pigment in European painting, but to the Egyptians it was costly, and besides it isn‚Äôt the most stable blue color: it degrades and fades when in contact with air. And so they created the first synthetic pigment in history: Egyptian blue. The oldest evidence of it is in a bowl dated to 3250 BC. Egyptian blue is a calcium copper silicate with formula CaCuSi4O10 or CaOCuO(SiO2)4. Its method of manufacturing, in a rare example of lost technology, was forgotten towards the end of antiquity, but has been plausibly reconstructed. It likely involved heating together quartz sand (silica) and some source of copper (either copper ores or scraps from the bronze industry), together with an alkali (like natron) and a calcium oxide (unintentionally added as impurities in the other materials).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In another cradle of civilization, a very similar story unfolded from about 800 BC. So similar, in fact, that it has been speculated that knowledge of Egyptian blue spread along the early silk road, all the way to China, where Han blue (together with Han purple) makes an appearance during the Zhou dynasty. Han blue has almost the same chemical formula as Egyptian blue, but replaces calcium with barium: BaCuSi4O10. It may also have been an independent invention, perhaps the work of Taoist alchemists and glassmakers. Its use declined after the Han dynasty, and few examples survive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much later, China would become famous for another application of blue: the ‚Äúblue and white‚Äù porcelain style. The blue here comes from cobalt oxide, which had colored Egyptian faience since at least 1500 BC, though nobody at the time knew what cobalt was. You could make cobalt blue in the form of glass and then grind it into a pigment called smalt. Despite porcelain originating in China, it seems that the use of smalt for the blue and white style began in Iraq. It spread from the Middle East to China, and then from China to the rest of the world including Europe, would eventually allow Swedish chemist Georg Brandt to identify cobalt as an element in 1735, the first time a new metal was discovered since antiquity.3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in the New World, the local indigo dye was being combined with a clay called palygorskite to create what became known as Maya blue, which was the main blue pigment in Mesoamerican art from about 800, and was still used as late as the 19th century, though it, too, was forgotten about for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But none of the pigments mentioned so far, not azurite, not cobalt blue, not Egyptian blue, could rival with the purest and deepest of blues, the one that came from grinding the rare lapis lazuli stone into a powder. Lapis lazuli had been extracted from mines in what is now Afghanistan since ancient times, but began being used for paint around the 5th to 7th centuries, for use in Zoroastrian and Buddhist religious art. This pigment became known to medieval and Renaissance Europeans as ultramarine, meaning ‚Äúbeyond the sea,‚Äù since it had to be imported at great cost from central Asia (which, to the Venetian merchants who mostly controlled this trade, was beyond the Mediterranean sea, I suppose). Nobody has written about this more eloquently than Scott Alexander:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here is the process for getting ultramarine. First, go to Afghanistan. Keep in mind, you start in England or France or wherever. Afghanistan is four thousand miles away. Your path takes you through tall mountains, burning deserts, and several dozen Muslim countries that are still pissed about the whole Crusades thing. Still alive? Climb 7,000 feet through the mountains of Kuran Wa Munjan until you reach the mines of Sar-i-Sang. There, in a freezing desert, the wretched of the earth work themselves to an early grave breaking apart the rocks of Badakhshan to mine a few hundred kilograms per year of blue stone - the only lapis lazuli production in the known world.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Buy the stone and retrace your path through the burning deserts and vengeful Muslims until you‚Äôre back in England or France or wherever. Still alive? That was the easy part. Now you need to go through a chemical extraction process that makes the Philosopher's Stone look like freshman chem lab. ‚ÄúThe lengthy process of pulverization, sifting, and washing to produce ultramarine makes the natural pigment ‚Ä¶ roughly ten times more expensive than the stone it came from.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Finally you have ultramarine! How much? I can‚Äôt find good numbers, but Claude estimates that the ultramarine production of all of medieval Europe was around the order of 30 kg per year - not enough to paint a medium-sized wall. Ultramarine had to be saved for ultra-high-value applications.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In practice, the medievals converged on a single use case - painting the Virgin Mary‚Äôs coat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the beginning of the 18th century, Egyptian blue had been long forgotten, and painters in Europe relied on indigo, smalt, azurite, and when they could get their hands on it, ultramarine. But this was the modern, enlightened era of European science. Great things were to come.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It began with a chance discovery. In Berlin around 1706, a paintmaker, Johann Jacob Diesbach, was trying to prepare red dye from cochineal.4 The details of the story are not totally ascertained, but it seems that his intended mix of cochineal insects, ferric sulfate, and potash had been tainted by another substance, perhaps bone oil from the alchemist Johann Konrad Dippel. The result was a deep blue pigment, soon to be known as Prussian blue, since Berlin was the capital of Prussia. It immediately found its niche in the art market: a deep blue, like ultramarine, but which unlike ultramarine didn‚Äôt cost more than literal gold. Within a couple of years, painters were already depicting the Virgin Mary‚Äôs robes with Prussian blue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus Prussian blue became the first modern synthetic pigment. It spread far and wide, even to isolationist Japan. Large quantities of Prussian blue began entering the country around 1829, through the single trading post the Japanese allowed with Westerners, at Dejima, and very soon after, revolutionized the woodblock printing art of ukiyo-e. As early as 1831, one of the most famous works in art history was created with abundant Prussian blue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prussian blue is also the blue of blueprints, created with the cyanotype process, one of the first ways to make many copies of a document. The blueprint was invented in 1842 by John Herschel and became the standard for engineering drawings; it was also used abundantly to duplicate photographs. Though it has become obsolete (replaced by whiteprint and then xerography, the currently dominant photocopying technique), it survives as the word to describe any technical, detailed plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prussian blue was only the first of a series of synthetic blue pigments that span the history of industrial civilization. In 1789, cerulean appears, the creation of Albrecht H√∂pfner in Switzerland. It is another compound of cobalt, but combined with tin: a cobalt stannate (Co2SnO4). It would become available to artists in paint form only in the middle of the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around the same period, in 1799 or 1802 (sources differ), the French chemist Louis Jacques Th√©nard reinvented cobalt blue. It was a commission from another chemist, Jean-Antoine Chaptal, who happened to be a minister in the government of the First French Republic. Th√©nard investigated the pigments at the S√®vres porcelain factory, but used a different method than the originators of smalt pigments in Egypt, Iraq, or China, using aluminium (formula: CoAl2O4). By the middle of the 19th century, the leader in the production of cobalt aluminate was Blaafarvev√¶rket, a large industrial enterprise in Norway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this golden age of blue pigment synthesis, would it be possible to create even synthetic ultramarine? Goethe, already, had noticed the blue deposits on lime kilns when visiting Sicily in 1787. The locals used it for decoration as if it were lapis lazuli. The same phenomenon was observed in limeworks in France in the 1810s, and in 1824, the Soci√©t√© d‚Äôencouragement pour l‚Äôindustrie nationale ‚Äî a government organization dedicated to further French industry in response to the industrial revolution in Britain, and led by the aforementioned Jean-Antoine Chaptal ‚Äî announced a prize of 6,000 francs to anyone who could make ultramarine for much cheaper than the price of lapis lazuli. In 1826, Jean-Baptiste Guimet succeeded in Lyon. He won the prize and established a thriving business, though he kept his methods secret and, as a result, forever has to share credit with Christian Gmelin in T√ºbingen, who did publish the process. It involves heating up clay, sodium hydroxide, and coal together.5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Artists and decorators now had their main blue pigments. Soon, industry and science would extend the use of blue to other domains. In 1897, it became practical to prepare artificial indigo in industrial quantities, eventually replacing all use of the plant. Today 80,000 tonnes are produced per year, mostly for the purpose of dying textiles, primarily denim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around the turn of the 20th century, artificial food colorings became widespread, derived primarily from coal tar. One of them would become known as brilliant blue FCF or Blue No. 1. Together with Blue No. 2, which is made from indigo, it is one of the two main blue colorings, and has a strong association with the familiar-yet-mysterious blue raspberry flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 1920s saw the introduction of another synthetic pigment, phthalo blue (also known as copper phthalocyanine), perhaps in a way harking back to the copper-derived compounds of ancient Egypt. It has grown to be most widely produced blue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though the discovery of new pigments is a rare occurrence, it still happens. In 2009, a serendipitous discovery at the Oregon State University led to YInMn Blue, so named because it contains yttrium, indium, and manganese, and pronounced ‚Äúyinmin.‚Äù It is a near-perfect blue that furthermore avoids the toxicity and environmental problems of the pre-existing pigments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have this half-baked theory that science fiction is associated with blue because of blue LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider this chart, which I wrote about in an old post:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a number of competing hypotheses for why science fiction movie directors and video game designers overwhelmingly choose blue as the color of fictional user interfaces. They include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Accidental reasons from filmmaking considerations (from Mark Coleran):&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Using simple interfaces with primary RGB colors on black looks better in film than ordinary liquid-crystal screens, so most UIs in video media is either red, green, or blue&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Red is associated with weapons, and green with vintage electronics (which commonly used green-phosphor monochrome monitors), leaving blue as the generic and/or futuristic choice&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blue is easier to color-correct: a lot of filmed material tends to look blue before color correction, but you don‚Äôt need this when the image is supposed to be blue&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cultural associations:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blue fits well with science fiction thanks to associations like coldness, knowledge, otherworldliness, and creative transcendence (found in some academic paper in Korean thanks to Elicit)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Something something near-far Robin Hanson something something6&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blue is rare in nature except the for sea and sky, so ‚Äúthere‚Äôs something fundamentally mystical, unnatural, and inhuman about it‚Äù (from Noessel, cited in ‚ÄòFuture Screens are Mostly Blue‚Äô)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Most science fiction creators simply copy the tropes of existing science fiction, so they choose blue because it already is the ‚Äúscience fiction color.‚Äù (And picking something else is likely to be interpreted as an intentional deviation for a specific purpose.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd guess that the actual, immediate reason for most blue in science fiction is the last one. Unless creators make a conscious artistic choice to deviate, they tend to copy what‚Äôs typical and expected in their chosen genre. Yet those norms and expectations have to come from somewhere. It‚Äôs possible that the items in the first part of the list, about decisions having to do with the techniques of filmmaking rather than with the artistic meaning of blue, are the actual cause for some early shows that snowballed into the ubiquity of blue interfaces today, but that seems a bit like post-hoc justification to me unless we can find evidence of those decisions being made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it‚Äôs probably cultural associations, but most of them also just kick the can further. Overall I suppose I somewhat agree with Noessel: it may well come down to the difficulty in finding blue in nature. Or finding it in technology, considering the history of blue pigments that we just went over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And not just pigments. There is another realm in which blue has proven incredibly difficult to produce: light. In fact we found the solution so recently that it is why, I speculate, the future is still strongly associated with blue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story of how we produce light is a fun one, spanning all of our technological history and involving dozens of solutions, from prehistoric oil lamps to candles to coal gas to cold-cathode tubes. But most of those solutions have produced light somewhere between white and the reddish yellow of flames or black-body radiation. If you wanted blue light, you could make a bulb out of blue glass (with cobalt!) and put an incandescent filament in it. This worked okay, but blue light bulbs did tend to be less satisfying than the other colors, or at least that‚Äôs what I remember from Christmas lights when I was a kid.7 There were other strategies for blue lights: construct a tube like the familiar red-glowing neon ones, and put mercury vapor in it. Low-brightness phosphors for RGB screens. Greenish-blue vacuum fluorescent displays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, blue light was not an unsolved problem. But it wasn‚Äôt as conclusively solved as light in the other spectral colors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 1960s, light-emitting diodes started becoming practical. LEDs are the most efficient way of creating light by far, but the properties of the materials they are made of ‚Äî semiconductors that emit light when traversed with an electrical current ‚Äî make it much easier to generate radiation in the less energetic part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Thus the first practical LED emitted infrared light, by Texas Instruments in 1962. Later that same year, the first visible-light LED was made at General Electric, in red. Displays made of red LEDs soon became widespread in electronic devices (replacing Nixie tubes, also reddish) after some further advances by Hewlett-Packard circa 1968.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Humanity then gradually conquered the rest of the visible light spectrum, with orange, yellow, and green LEDs being developed in the 1970s. But blue remained elusive. A practical, bright blue LED would not be made, despite much research being poured into it by electronics companies around the world, until a breakthrough by Shuji Nakamura in Japan in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This completed the color spectrum and enabled us to create white LEDs, which are now quickly replacing nearly every lighting technology since they cost so little and are so customizable. We can say we have essentially ‚Äúsolved‚Äù lighting. Blue LEDs also enabled the first blue lasers in the mid-1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a very recent development! For a very long time, blue would have been the color that only ‚Äúfuture tech‚Äù could create. Then, for a brief period, it would have been the color of cutting-edge tech. Now, 30 years later, the tech exists and is widespread, but we still have the memory of that time. And furthermore no other color can take its place as the inaccessible one; we‚Äôve conquered the entire spectrum.8&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does the futuristic quality of blue really come from LEDs? Maybe, maybe not. I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs a direct causal link.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But given the full history of blue pigments, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to find some truth in this speculative scenario: that there were just enough innovations in blue, a steady trickle of serendipitous discoveries and long-term research efforts to produce better versions of it, to keep it in the mind of humans as the color of the artificial and the cutting-edge. If you wore indigo-dyed clothes in ancient India, you were one step more removed from nature than the person who wore plain cotton. If you used blue pottery in Egypt or Iraq or China, you were clearly cooler than the people who used plain terracotta. If you hired an engineer or architect at the peak of the Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century, they‚Äôd be way more efficient at their job if they duplicated their drawings with Prussian blue instead of copying them by hand. And if you want to make your city a herald of the high-tech future, you decorate everything with programmable blue LEDs. No other color would do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post was written as part of the Roots of Progress Institute‚Äôs Blog-Building Intensive, and I thank the fellows who provided feedback: Allison Lehman, Kelly Vedi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One could say the same about purple, which has its own history of being a super expensive pigment, Tyrian purple, and holds the distinction of being one of the first synthetic dyes, mauveine. But purple is less common and important than blue. Besides, it doesn‚Äôt really exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we‚Äôre here, let‚Äôs note that Tyrian purple, made from sea snails, may be related to a blue dye of great significance in Jewish culture, tekhelet. It has been speculated that tekhelet comes from Hexaplex trunculus snails. I didn‚Äôt mention it in the main text because its origin is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From which we derive the word aniline, a common industrial chemical that is nowadays used to make indigo and various other dyes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fun fact: cobalt is named after kobolds, mischievous spirits from German folklore, because miners in Germany would attribute to them the unusual properties of the ore containing the metal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an aside, the history of cochineal dye, made from insects grown on cactus according to secret ancestral techniques of the Zapotec people, and the second-highest valued export from New Spain after silver, is fascinating in its own right. By the way it‚Äôs still used as food coloring, so if you eat artificially red foods, you probably eat insects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Synthetic ultramarine is also (in)famous for being the main component (together with a resin) of International Klein Blue, the creation of artist Yves Klein, who painted large monochrome paintings with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specifically posts like ‚ÄòIs Blue Far?‚Äô and ‚ÄòNear Far in Science Fiction‚Äô. Blue might be associated with ‚Äúfar‚Äù in terms of construal level theory and likewise for science fiction, which makes an association natural. I thought this was a mind blowing point when I first encountered it some years ago but now it seems rather unconvincing, which is why I‚Äôm relegating it to a footnote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it‚Äôs because the filaments glow yellow, and a lot of the light is filtered by the blue glass, leaving dim light bulbs. But also the blue glass tended to become discolored, and then you‚Äôd just get a plain white bulb.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There can‚Äôt be a purple LED since purple isn‚Äôt a spectral color, with the exception of violet. And violet LEDs appeared about the same time as the blue ones. There is active development of ultraviolet LED, especially for disinfecting lamps, but of course we won‚Äôt be able to see them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suppose one intriguing possibility would be if we were to invent new colors altogether, by modifying the biology of color perception. Then maybe the color of the future would become octarine or something.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head&gt; Release notes &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better transaction balancing, include improvements, auto posting account interpolation, csv data commands, import archiving, timeclock improvements, fixes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;hledger 1.50&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Breaking changes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transaction balancing is now done in a more robust way, using local precisions only (like Ledger) #2402.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Until now, a transaction was required to balance using its commodities's global display precisions.&lt;lb/&gt;Small imbalances were tolerated by configuring display precisions for the whole journal (with&lt;code&gt;commodity&lt;/code&gt;directives).&lt;p&gt;Now, a transaction is required to balance using the precisions in its journal entry only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;This means each entry can use the precision it needs, and balancing precision and display precision are independent.&lt;lb/&gt;(So eg, increasing the display precision with&lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt;no longer breaks the journal.)&lt;p&gt;In practice this requires journal entries to be more accurate, and you will probably need to fix some old entries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;There are three main ways to fix an entry:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;reduce the amounts' precision (use fewer decimal digits, so a lower balancing precision is inferred)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;make the amounts more accurate (use better decimal digits, so the amounts sum to zero more closely)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;or (easiest) add an amountless "expenses:rounding" posting (this is not a cheat, it's a more accurate record of what your bank/broker is doing).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also keep the old transaction-balancing behaviour with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;--txn-balancing=old&lt;/code&gt;, for now.&lt;lb/&gt;But updating your entries is recommended.&lt;p&gt;The old behaviour could allow small remainders to accumulate over time,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;in accounts that often have an inexact posting amount or cost amount and are never reconciled -&lt;lb/&gt;typically equity, revenues, and expenses.&lt;lb/&gt;You can check for this in your old journals with a command like&lt;code&gt;hledger bal cur:\\$ -c '$1.000000000000' | grep -E '\...0*[1-9]'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;(show $ account balances, with many decimals, which have a non-zero decimal in the 3rd place or beyond)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Timeclock format has had various changes:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Timeclock syntax and parsing is now more robust (when not using --old-timeclock): &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Semicolon always starts a comment (and timeclock account names may not include semicolons).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Trailing spaces are ignored.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Clock-ins now require an account name.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Clock-outs now can have a comment and tags.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Timeclock entries are processed in parse order.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Some order-related bugs in 1.43 have been fixed.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Concurrent/overlapping sessions are now fully supported, even if they have the same account name.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;The timeclock doc has been rewritten.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;The --old-timeclock hidden flag has been renamed, documented, and now also affects included files.&lt;lb/&gt;#2141, #2365, #2400, #2417&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Timeclock syntax and parsing is now more robust (when not using --old-timeclock): &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some edge cases in balance report behaviour were changed for internal consistency:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;hledger now requires at least GHC 9.6 (and base 4.18), to ease maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fixes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paging long output no longer gives an error when&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LESS&lt;/code&gt;is undefined and&lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt;does not have mouse support (as on some FreeBSD systems).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;all:&lt;/code&gt;query now requires at least one posting to match.&lt;lb/&gt;(Previously, matching no postings at all was also considered a success.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;When using journal format's&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt;directive, several kinds of&lt;lb/&gt;error (read failure, cyclic include..) could show an off-by-one line&lt;lb/&gt;number or excerpt, confusingly. This has been fixed.&lt;lb/&gt;Also, attempting to include a rules file now gives a better error message.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;In CSV&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;rules, match group references like&lt;code&gt;\1&lt;/code&gt;no longer get confused&lt;lb/&gt;by differing case.&lt;lb/&gt;(Jay Neubrand, #2419)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;commodities&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;diff&lt;/code&gt;now support the --conf and -n/--no-conf flags,&lt;lb/&gt;like other commands.&lt;lb/&gt;#2446&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Windows machines, the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt;command now properly shows green prompts instead of ANSI codes.&lt;lb/&gt;#2410&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balance reports now properly show the historical balance even when the report period is empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;#2403&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balance reports' csv output, and the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;balance --budget&lt;/code&gt;report, now respect the --summary-only flag.&lt;lb/&gt;(Stephen Morgan, #2411, #2443)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;demo&lt;/code&gt;command no longer mentions&lt;code&gt;-- ASCIINEMAOPTS&lt;/code&gt;in help (that longer works).&lt;lb/&gt;Also it shows a better error message when asciinema is not installed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;hledger help -m TOPIC&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;hledger help -i TOPIC&lt;/code&gt;now show the help for TOPIC, as intended.&lt;lb/&gt;#2399&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since hledger 1.32.1, the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;command, when importing multiple files at once,&lt;lb/&gt;would write an empty .latest file for data files with no new transactions&lt;lb/&gt;(causing all transactions in those data files to appear new on next import).&lt;lb/&gt;This is now fixed.&lt;lb/&gt;#2444&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Features&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CSV rules files can now run a shell command to clean the data:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;# read the latest foo*.csv file, and replace "USD" with "$" source foo*.csv | sed -e 's/USD/$/g'&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;or to generate the data:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;# fetch JSON from simplefin.org, then transform it to CSV source | simplefinjson | simplefincsv&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Whenever hledger runs one of these commands, it will echo the command on stderr.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;command can now automatically archive imported CSV data files,&lt;lb/&gt;saving a dated copy in a&lt;code&gt;data/&lt;/code&gt;directory. This can be useful for troubleshooting,&lt;lb/&gt;or for regenerating entries later with improved rules.&lt;lb/&gt;To enable it, add&lt;code&gt;archive&lt;/code&gt;to the rules file.&lt;p&gt;This and the previous feature can simplify file management and reduce the need for support scripts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improvements&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;In command line help, flag group headings have been simplified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;And the help for -f/--file,&lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;is now clearer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;When given both an unknown command and an unknown flag, hledger now gives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;a clearer error message (about the command, not the flag).&lt;lb/&gt;#2388&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;A long standing awkwardness with addon commands has been solved:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;you can now use addon options freely in a hledger command line;&lt;lb/&gt;you don't need to write a&lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt;argument first.&lt;lb/&gt;#458&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;In smart dates and period expressions, quarter syntax like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2025q1&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;Q2&lt;/code&gt;is now fully supported.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;In end-value reports where the end date is unspecified, market prices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;in the future can no longer influence the report end date and valuation date.&lt;lb/&gt;(Market prices on or before today, still can.)&lt;lb/&gt;#2445&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;A&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tag:&lt;/code&gt;query with the&lt;code&gt;accounts&lt;/code&gt;command now only matches account tags, not posting tags.&lt;lb/&gt;Eg,&lt;code&gt;hledger accounts tag:t&lt;/code&gt;now lists only account a from this journal:&lt;code&gt;account a ; t: 2025-01-01 a 1 b -1 ; t:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journal format's&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt;directive now has more robust and convenient glob patterns:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt;can match both directories and filenames&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt;now automatically ignores anything under dotted directories, like .git/, foo/.secret/, etc.&lt;lb/&gt;(If you do want it to search dotted directories,&lt;lb/&gt;you can use the --old-glob flag for now to restore the old behaviour. See also Glob#49.)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Glob patterns with wildcards now automatically exclude the current file.&lt;lb/&gt;Eg&lt;code&gt;include **.journal&lt;/code&gt;will include all other .journal files in this directory and below.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt;'s error messages and debug messages have been improved.&lt;lb/&gt;Eg, the including file paths are also shown.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journal format's auto posting rules can now use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;%account&lt;/code&gt;to insert the account name&lt;lb/&gt;from the matched posting.&lt;lb/&gt;(Stephen Morgan, #1975, #2412)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;aregister&lt;/code&gt;command no longer abbreviates account names&lt;lb/&gt;when producing&lt;code&gt;csv&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt;, or&lt;code&gt;fods&lt;/code&gt;output.&lt;lb/&gt;(savanto, #1995, #2416)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;commodities&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;payees&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;tags&lt;/code&gt;commands now have --used/--declared/--undeclared/--unused flags, like&lt;code&gt;accounts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;lb/&gt;And there has been a general cleanup of options and help across these four commands.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;command now shows info messages on stderr, not stdout.&lt;lb/&gt;Its "no new transactions" output is more compact, showing file names not file paths.&lt;lb/&gt;And it no longer prints an extra newline.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;setup&lt;/code&gt;command's output has been improved.&lt;lb/&gt;Lack of a pager is now reported as info, not warning (there's no default pager on Windows).&lt;lb/&gt;Shell completions are ignored for now.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Docs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;add: clarify that add is for journal format only&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;addon commands: edits, drop &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt;argument from all examples #458&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;csv: source, archive: rewrite, add examples&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Depth: fix typo&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;import: use windows-compatible quotes in watchexec example&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;include directive: update docs; clarify effect, glob limitations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;note fish LEDGER_FILE setup&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;options: mention that flag+value can't combine with other flags #2059&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;print: improve --location help&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Starting hledger by double-clicking its icon won't work because it needs arguments; run it from the command window instead.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Starting hledger-web by double-clicking its icon may fail eg because Explorer's command window is too small;&lt;lb/&gt;configure that to be larger, or run hledger-web from a command window instead.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;hledger or hledger-web may fail to run if there is not enough memory available.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Next steps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once installed, run &lt;code&gt;hledger&lt;/code&gt;, and perhaps read hledger.org: Quick start.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new, promising technique has the potential to replace laser surgeries in ophthalmologists‚Äô offices in the future, for a fraction of the cost. Called electromechanical reshaping (EMR), the technique offers a gentler approach to correcting the cornea than Laser-Assisted in Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK), today‚Äôs gold standard for treating vision issues including nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The eye develops these and other conditions when the cornea‚Äôs curvature is off‚Äîtoo steep, too flat, or too uneven. To solve the problem, surgeons generally use laser techniques such as LASIK to ‚Äúsculpt‚Äù the eye surface by cutting away small parts of corneal tissue. The results can be life-changing, but the procedure has its risks, as LASIK permanently reduces corneal strength, raising the risk of new vision problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternative nonsurgical methods such as specially designed contact lenses can temporarily mold the cornea, but these require nightly wear and can cause infection. Now, engineers and eye doctors are trying to find a way to permanently reshape collagen-rich tissues like the cornea without cutting, burning, or removing material.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brian Wong, a surgeon-engineer at the University of California, Irvine, stumbled upon a possible solution about a decade ago. He had long worked with thermal techniques for reshaping cartilage tissues‚Äîwhich include the cornea‚Äîbut found a puzzling ‚ÄúGoldilocks problem‚Äù during his research: The heating needed to change shapes often killed too many tissue cells. Then a ‚Äúhappy accident‚Äù opened a different perspective, he says. ‚ÄúMy postdoctoral fellow connected a pair of electrodes and a Coke can to a power supply‚Ä¶and out of spite, fried a piece of cartilage,‚Äù Wong recalls. The cartilage began to bubble, which the postdoc thought was from heat. ‚ÄúBut it wasn‚Äôt hot. We touched it and thought, this is getting a shape change. This must be electrolysis,‚Äù he says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That surprise pointed to electrochemistry rather than heat as the mechanism. To explore further, Wong partnered with Michael Hill, a chemist at Occidental College. Together, they began exploring the chemistry behind EMR and testing it in different tissues. In mid-August, they presented results from their most recent tests at the American Chemical Society‚Äôs fall meeting that took place in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Electricity Reshapes Tissue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EMR uses small electrical pulses to split water at the tissue surface into hydrogen and oxygen, releasing protons that spread into the part of the corneal tissue that gives it structural integrity, the ability to hydrate, and other mechanical properties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once protons are spread throughout the cornea‚Äôs surface, they disrupt the chemical bonds that hold collagen fibers in place, also changing the corneal tissue‚Äôs pH. This, Wong explains, is the moment when the cornea becomes moldable. Once shaped with a metal contact lens‚Äìlike mold, it ‚Äúlocks in‚Äù to the new shape as the electric pulses are turned off and the body‚Äôs natural physiological response returns the cornea‚Äôs pH back to its normal value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, Wong and Hill coauthored a proof-of-concept paper in ACS Biomaterials Science &amp;amp; Engineering, showing that EMR could reshape rabbit corneas without compromising transparency. ‚ÄúThat paper was really about asking, is it even possible? Can we change the shape of a cornea without gross damage?‚Äù Hill says. ‚ÄúNow, after two more years of work, we‚Äôve systematically gone through the parameters‚Äîand we can say yes, it is possible, and we can do it safely,‚Äù he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their team built custom platinum contact lenses, press-molded to precise curvatures, and connected them to electrodes. Mounted onto rabbit eyes immersed in a saline solution, the electrodes delivered pulses of around 1.5 volts. X-ray imaging tests confirmed the corneas had indeed matched the mold‚Äôs shape. Microscopy tests also confirmed the collagen tissue remained organized post-surgery. ‚ÄúFine control is the key,‚Äù Wong observes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cost of procedures using the new technique can be significantly lower than laser eye surgery, according to Wong. That‚Äôs because, unlike LASIK, EMR doesn‚Äôt rely on ‚Äúlaser platforms that cost as much as luxury cars.‚Äù The new technique could also be more affordable for clinics and regions priced out of LASIK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the technique has a long way to go before being used in eye surgeries, the research is advancing to in-vivo animal tests to prove safety and durability‚Äîand for long-term tracking to ensure the results last. ‚ÄúNobody‚Äôs getting this at the optometrist next year,‚Äù Hill cautions. ‚ÄúNow comes the hard work‚Äîrefining parameters, confirming long-term viability, and making sure treated eyes don‚Äôt revert back,‚Äù he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That hard work, Hill adds, depends a lot on funding for basic science. EMR was born not from a targeted medical-device program but from curiosity-driven experiments in electrochemistry. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt always know where basic research will lead,‚Äù Hill says. ‚ÄúWe were looking at electroanalytical chemistry, not eye surgery. But those foundational insights are what made this possible. If you cut off that basic research, you don‚Äôt get these kinds of unexpected, transformative opportunities,‚Äù he adds.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mike Cannon-Brookes, the CEO of enterprise software giant Atlassian, was one of the first users of the Arc browser. Over the last several years, he has been a prolific bug reporter and feature requester. Now he‚Äôll own the thing: Atlassian is acquiring The Browser Company, the New York-based startup that makes both Arc and the new AI-focused Dia browser. Atlassian is paying $610 million in cash for The Browser Company, and plans to run it as an independent entity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Browser Company, maker of Arc and Dia, is being acquired&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Atlassian is paying $610 million for the company, in a big bet that both AI and browsers are key to the future of work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Atlassian is paying $610 million for the company, in a big bet that both AI and browsers are key to the future of work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The conversations that led to the deal started about a year ago, says Josh Miller, The Browser Company‚Äôs CEO. Lots of Atlassian employees were using Arc, and ‚Äúthey reached out wondering, how could we get more enterprise-ready?‚Äù Miller says. Big companies require data privacy, security, and management features in the software they use, and The Browser Company didn‚Äôt offer enough of them. Eventually, as companies everywhere raced to put AI at the center of their businesses, and as The Browser Company made its own bets in AI, Cannon-Brookes suggested maybe the companies were better off together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The acquisition is mostly about Dia, which launched in June. Dia is a mix of web browser and chatbot, with a built-in way to chat with your tabs but also do things across apps. Open up three spreadsheets in three tabs and Dia can move data between them; log into your Gmail and Dia can tell you what‚Äôs next on the calendar. Anything with a URL immediately becomes data available to Dia and its AI models. For a company like Atlassian, which makes a whole suite of work apps ‚Äî the popular project-tracker Jira, the note-taking app Confluence, plus Trello, Loom, and more ‚Äî a way to stitch them all together seems obviously compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Miller is clear, even forceful, that Dia is not about to become just a wrapper for Atlassian apps, or shift to thinking primarily about IT managers and enterprise features. Dia is still for individual users. It‚Äôs just that now, it‚Äôs primarily for individual users at work. Before, Miller says, ‚Äúwe talked a lot about shopping, making reservations, finding showtimes. That is going to go away in terms of our focus.‚Äù He says he sees everyone else, from ChatGPT to Claude to Gemini to Replika, competing to be a central new character in your personal life. He‚Äôs happy to build a work tool instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For The Browser Company, the deal is both a big exit and a slightly surprising one. With companies like Anthropic tripling their valuation out of nowhere and practically any startup with a .ai domain name raking in billions in funding, why get out of the race now? It‚Äôs easy to look at this deal as The Browser Company waving the white flag, getting out while the getting‚Äôs good and before the bigger players fully take over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, Miller doesn‚Äôt see it that way. He offers a couple of reasons to do this deal now, starting with the sheer speed at which this market is moving. ‚ÄúI think the winner of the AI browser space is going to be crowned in the next 12 to 24 months,‚Äù he says. For Dia to become truly mainstream, The Browser Company needs huge distribution, a sales organization, and scale it simply doesn‚Äôt have and probably can‚Äôt get quickly enough. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt feel like something money could buy, in the time horizon we had,‚Äù Miller says. He says this is the way to make sure Dia doesn‚Äôt get swallowed by the big names.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI think the winner of the AI browser space is going to be crowned in the next 12 to 24 months‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Selling to a company like Atlassian also gives The Browser Company some much-needed stability in an incredibly frothy market. ‚ÄúIt reverts us back to a clear focus,‚Äù Miller says. He seems very excited to not have to worry about raising more money. The only goal, he says, is to get more active users for Dia, and trust that Atlassian can figure out how to turn that into more revenue for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for what this all means for The Browser Company‚Äôs browsers, it‚Äôs still too early to say for sure. Miller promises no favored-nation features for Atlassian products, nor any Microsoft Edge-style popups begging you to sign up for Jira. Miller says the team is even more committed to being a truly cross-platform product, and that Windows in particular is about to get a lot more attention. He also says there‚Äôs an aggressive roadmap for bringing the best of Arc to Dia, after the company‚Äôs pivot angered some of its most dedicated users. Arc‚Äôs status hasn‚Äôt changed, and will still be maintained but not actively developed. (Reading between the lines, though? I wouldn‚Äôt count on Arc being around for too long ‚Äî there‚Äôs just no place for it in this new arrangement.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Browser Company has been through a lot of changes the last few years, but its biggest idea has both stayed consistent and been largely correct: that the era of siloed apps was coming to an end, and that the browser would be a powerful new way to interact with computers. Almost everyone agrees with this theory, too: Perplexity has a browser, Google is AI-ifying Chrome at a blistering pace, even OpenAI is reportedly close to launching a browser based on ChatGPT. The job in front of Miller now is not to convince the world he‚Äôs right, but to make sure he wins. And when you need to win, it really does help to have a sales team.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h6"&gt;Brioches and Knife, Eliot Hodgkin, 08/1961&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When people talk about the value of paying attention and slowing down, they often make it sound prudish and monk-like. Attention is something we ‚Äúhave to protect.‚Äù And we have to ‚Äúpay‚Äù1 attention‚Äîlike a tribute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we shouldn‚Äôt forget how interesting and overpoweringly pleasurable sustained attention can be. Slowing down makes reality vivid, strange, and hot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me start with the most obvious example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As anyone who has had good sex knows, sustained attention and delayed satisfaction are a big part of it. When you resist the urge to go ahead and get what you want and instead stay in the moment, you open up a space for seduction and fantasy. Desire begins to loop on itself and intensify.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not sure what is going on here, but my rough understanding is that the expectation of pleasure activates the dopaminergic system in the brain. Dopamine is often portrayed as a pleasure chemical, but it isn‚Äôt really about pleasure so much as the expectation that pleasure will occur soon. So when we are being seduced and sense that something pleasurable is coming‚Äîbut it keeps being delayed, and delayed skillfully‚Äîthe phasic bursts of dopamine ramp up the levels higher and higher, pulling more receptors to the surface of the cells, making us more and more sensitized to the surely-soon-to-come pleasure. We become hyperattuned to the sensations in our genitals, lips, and skin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it is not only dopamine ramping up that makes seduction warp our attentional field, infusing reality with intensity and strangeness. There are a myriad of systems that come together to shape our feeling of the present: there are glands and hormones and multiple areas of the brain involved. These are complex physical processes: hormones need to be secreted and absorbed; working memory needs to be cleared and reloaded, and so on. The reason deep attention can‚Äôt happen the moment you notice something is that these things take time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What‚Äôs more, each of these subsystems update what they are reacting to at a different rate. Your visual cortex can cohere in less than half a second. A stress hormone like cortisol, on the other hand, has a half-life of 60‚Äì90 minutes and so can take up to 6 hours to fully clear out after the onset of an acute stressor. This means that if we switch what we pay attention to more often than, say, every 30 minutes, our system will be more or less decohered‚Äîdifferent parts will be ‚Äúattending to‚Äù different aspects of reality.2 There will be ‚Äúattention residue‚Äù floating around in our system‚Äîleftovers from earlier things we paid attention to (thoughts looping, feelings circling below consciousness, etc.), which crowd out the thing we have in front of us right now, making it less vivid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inversely, the longer we are able to sustain the attention without resolving it and without losing interest, the more time the different systems of the body have to synchronize with each other, and the deeper the experience gets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locked in on the same thing, the subsystems begin to reinforce each other: the dopamine makes us aware of our skin, and sensations on the skin ramp up dopamine release, making us even more aware of our skin. A finger touches our belly, and we start to fantasize about where that finger might be going; and so now our fantasies are locked in, too, releasing even more dopamine and making us even more aware of our skin. The more the subsystems lock in, the more intense the feedback loops get. After twenty minutes, our sense of self has evaporated, and we‚Äôre in a realm where we do, feel, and think things that would seem surreal in other contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar things happen when we are able to sustain our attention to things other than sex, too. The exact mechanics differ, I presume, but the basic pattern is that when we let our attention linger on something, our bodily systems synchronize and feed each other stimuli in an escalatory loop that restructures our attentional field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost anything that we are able to direct sustained attention at will begin to loop on itself and bloom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To take a dark example, if you focus on your anxiety, the anxiety can begin to loop on itself until you hyperventilate and get tunnel vision and become filled with nightmarish thoughts and feelings‚Äîa panic attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And you do the same thing with joy. If you learn to pay sustained attention to your happiness, the pleasant sensation will loop on itself until it explodes and pulls you into a series of almost hallucinogenic states, ending in cessation, where your consciousness lets go and you disappear for a while. This takes practice. The practice is called jhanas, and it is sometimes described as the inverse of a panic attack. I have only ever entered the first jhana, once while spending an hour putting our four-year-old to sleep and meditating on how wonderful it is to lie there next to her. It was really weird and beautiful. If you want to know more about these sorts of mental states, I recommend Jos√© Luis Ric√≥n Fern√°ndez de la Puente‚Äôs recent write-up of his experiences, Nadia Asparouhova on her experiences, and her how-to guide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is Jos√©, whose blog is normally detailed reflections on cell biology and longevity and metascience, describing the second evening of a jhana retreat:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So I went down to the beach. ‚ÄúKinda nice‚Äù, I thought. The sky had a particularly vibrant blue color, the waves had ‚Äòthe right size‚Äô, their roar was pleasant. I started to walk around trying to continue meditating. I focused my awareness on an arising sensation of open heartedness and then I noticed my eyes tearing up (‚ÄúHuh? I thought‚Äù). I looked again at the ocean and then I saw it. It was fucking amazing. So much color and detail: waves within waves, the fractal structure of the foamy crests as they disintegrate back into the ocean. The feeling of the sun on my skin. I felt overwhelmed. As tears ran down my face and lowkey insane grin settled on my face I found myself mumbling ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs... always been like this!!!!‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat the fuck??!‚Äù followed by ‚ÄúThis is too much!! Too much!!!‚Äù. The experience seemed to be demanding from me to feel more joy and awe than I was born to feel or something like that. In that precise moment I felt what ‚Äúpainfully beautiful‚Äù means for the first time in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that we can enter fundamentally different, and often exhilarating, states of mind by learning how to sustain our attention is fascinating. It makes you wonder what other states are waiting out there. What will happen if you properly pay attention to an octopus?3 What about your sense of loneliness?4 A mathematical idea?5 The weights of a neural net?6 The footnotes here take you to examples of people who have done that. There are so many things to pay attention to and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things to sustain attention toward is art.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a period in my twenties when I didn‚Äôt get art. I thought artists were trying to say something, but I felt superior because I thought there had to be better ways of getting their ideas across (and also, better ideas). But then I realized that good art‚Äîat least the art I am spontaneously drawn to‚Äîhas little to do with communication. Instead, it is about crafting patterns of information that, if you feed them sustained attention, will begin to structure your attentional field in interesting ways. Art is guided meditation. The point isn‚Äôt the words, but what happens to your mind when you attend to those words (or images, or sounds). There is nothing there to understand; it is just something to experience, like sex. But the experiences can be very deep and, sometimes, transformative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2019, for example, I saw a performance of Jean Sibelius‚Äôs 5th Symphony at the University Hall in Uppsala.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before the concert began, I spent a few minutes with my eyes closed, doing a body scan, to be fully present when the music began. As the horns at the opening of the piece called out, I decided to keep my eyes closed, so I wouldn‚Äôt be distracted by looking at the hands of the musicians. Then‚Ä¶ a sort of daydream started up. The mood suggested to me the image of a cottage overlooking a sloping meadow and a thick wood of pines, a few hours from Helsinki. It was a pretty obvious image, since I knew that Sibelius wrote the piece at Aniola, which is 38 km north of Helsinki. But then I saw an old man walking up the meadow and into the house. The camera cut. Through an open door, I saw the man, alone, working at a desk. I saw it as clearly as if it had been projected on a screen before me: the camera moved slowly toward the back of the man.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through the window above his desk, I could see a light in the distance. Perhaps it was Helsinki? No, it felt alive, like a being‚Äîsomething alive and growing, something that was headed here. But then again, if you were to see a city from space, watching it sped up by 100,000x, it would look like a being moving through the landscape, spreading, getting closer. The old man sat there for a hundred years, watching the light. There was a sinking feeling in my body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One spring, birds fell dead from the sky. They littered the fields, whole droves of them filled the ditches‚Äîblue birds, red birds, and black. The man carried them into his woodshed and placed them in waist-high piles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The film kept going, and the emotional intensity and complexity gradually ramped up. For the thirty minutes that it took the orchestra to play the three movements of the symphony, I experienced what felt like two or three feature films, all interconnected by some strange emotional logic. In the third movement, a group of hunter-gatherers was living in a cave that reminded me of the entrance to a nuclear waste facility. A girl hiding behind a tree saw men with cars arrive‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The structure of the music was such that it gave me enough predictability and enough surprise to allow my attention to deeply cohere. The melody lines and harmonies dredged up memories and images from my subconscious, weaving them into a rich cinematic web of stories. Guided by the music, my mind could tunnel into an attentional state where I was able to see things I had never seen before and where I could work through some deep emotional pain that seemed to resolve itself through the images.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the music stopped, I barely knew where I was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I opened my eyes and remembered that my brother was sitting next to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhat did you think?‚Äù I said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI felt kind of restless.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It is not like 30 minutes is some ideal. Attention can, under the right conditions, keep getting deeper and more coherent for much longer, as attested by people who meditate for weeks. Inversely, you can, if you have a well developed dorsal attention network and low cortisol level etc, cohere to a high degree in a few minutes. (Though if you have a lot of stress hormones, thirty minutes will not be nearly enough to get out of a flighty mode of attention.) In other words, I don‚Äôt think you can put a precise number at it.&lt;lb/&gt;Time to coherence depends on your starting place (mood, hormones, chemical make up in the brain), your skill, and the level of coherence you want to pursue. There is a famous study saying it takes people 23 minutes to get to full productivity after an interruption, which seems like it is correlated to the time it takes them to deeply cohere their attentional field. On the other hand, there is also be an upper limit at how long you can cohere, which also depends on a bunch of factors. If I‚Äôm working on an essay, I notice that the quality of my thinking drops after about 20 minutes of sustained attention and I need to pause for a few minutes and walk around to get back up to full focus. So in my case, my deepest thinking seem to decohere before I even reach that infamous 23 minute mark! And after 3-4 hours, the quality of my attention goes down so much that everything I write ends up being deleted the day after. For more relaxed attention, like meditation, I haven‚Äôt reached the limit for how long I can deepen my coherence‚Äîafter an hour, which is the longest I‚Äôve gone, I‚Äôm still shifting deeper into attention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Charles Darwin:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[During our stay in Porto Praya,] I was much interested, on several occasions, by watching the habits of an Octopus, or cuttle-fish. Although common in the pools of water left by the retiring tide, these animals were not easily caught. By means of their long arms and suckers, they could drag their bodies into very narrow crevices; and when thus fixed, it required great force to remove them. At other times they darted tail first, with the rapidity of an arrow, from one side of the pool to the other, at the same instant discolouring the water with a dark chestnut-brown ink. These animals also escape detection by a very extraordinary, chameleon-like power of changing their colour. They appear to vary their tints according to the nature of the ground over which they pass: when in deep water, their general shade was brownish purple, but when placed on the land, or in shallow water, this dark tint changed into one of a yellowish green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The colour, examined more carefully, was a French grey, with numerous minute spots of bright yellow: the former of these varied in intensity; the latter entirely disappeared and appeared again by turns. These changes were effected in such a manner, that clouds, varying in tint between a hyacinth red and a chestnut-brown, were continually passing over the body. Any part, being subjected to a slight shock of galvanism, became almost black: a similar effect, but in a less degree, was produced by scratching the skin with a needle. These clouds, or blushes as they may be called, are said to be produced by the alternate expansion and contraction of minute vesicles containing variously coloured fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cuttle-fish displayed its chameleon-like power both during the act of swimming and whilst remaining stationary at the bottom. I was much amused by the various arts to escape detection used by one individual, which seemed fully aware that I was watching it. Remaining for a time motionless, it would then stealthily advance an inch or two, like a cat after a mouse; sometimes changing its colour: it thus proceeded, till having gained a deeper part, it darted away, leaving a dusky train of ink to hide the hole into which it had crawled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;While looking for marine animals, with my head about two feet above the rocky shore, I was more than once saluted by a jet of water, accompanied by a slight grating noise. At first I could not think what it was, but afterwards I found out that it was this cuttle-fish, which, though concealed in a hole, thus often led me to its discovery. That it possesses the power of ejecting water there is no doubt, and it appeared to me that it could certainly take good aim by directing the tube or siphon on the under side of its body. From the difficulty which these animals have in carrying their heads, they cannot crawl with ease when placed on the ground. I observed that one which I kept in the cabin was slightly phosphorescent in the dark.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sasha Chapin writes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late winter 2024, I noticed that I wasn‚Äôt living up to my stated policy of trying to accept every emotion passing through my system. There were certain shades of existential loneliness that I was pushing away. This was causing some friction. Solitude is simply part of my current life chapter, since Cate is more independent than any of my previous partners, and Berkeley is a place where I don‚Äôt feel at home socially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;As a response, I made feelings of solitude the central focus of my practice. I tried to become like a sommelier, going out of my way to appreciate all the shades of loneliness that colored my afternoons, trying to zoom in on every micro-pixel and embrace rather than reject.&lt;lb/&gt;Again‚Äînormal. This is what, for me, long-term practice often consists of: noticing when my reactions don‚Äôt line up with my principles, and seeing if I can bring myself into deeper alignment.&lt;lb/&gt;However, I noticed something odd. Dropping the resistance to loneliness allowed me to slip into deeper sensations of flow. It was almost as if the emotional resistance had been preventing the emergence of a more intuitive part of my will. There were a few memorable walks I took where the feeling of solitude felt like a portal into an exquisitely smooth parallel world. When I allowed my emotions to pierce me more deeply, I fell into a different degree of cooperation with reality. Every step felt precise and necessary, like a choreographed dance.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Michael Nielsen writes about this in an essay where he describes the experience of pushing himself to go deeper than usual in understanding a mathematical proof:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I gradually internalize the mathematical objects I‚Äôm dealing with [using spaced repetition]. It becomes easier and easier to conduct (most of) my work in my head. [. . .] Furthermore, as my understanding of the objects change ‚Äì as I learn more about their nature, and correct my own misconceptions ‚Äì my sense of what I can do with the objects changes as well. It‚Äôs as though they sprout new affordances, in the language of user interface design, and I get much practice in learning to fluidly apply those affordances in multiple ways. [. . .]&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After going through the [time-consuming process of deeply understanding a proof,] I had a rather curious experience. I went for a multi-hour walk along the San Francisco Embarcadero. I found that my mind simply and naturally began discovering other facts related to the result. In particular, I found a handful (perhaps half a dozen) of different proofs of the basic theorem, as well as noticing many related ideas. This wasn‚Äôt done especially consciously ‚Äì rather, my mind simply wanted to find these proofs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chris Olah writes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Research intimacy is different from theoretical knowledge. It involves internalizing information that hasn‚Äôt become part of the ‚Äúscientific cannon‚Äù yet. Observations we don‚Äôt (yet) see as important, or haven‚Äôt (yet) digested. The ideas are raw.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(A personal example: I‚Äôve memorized hundreds of neurons in InceptionV1. I know how they behave, and I know how that behavior is built from earlier neurons. These seem like obscure facts, but they give me powerful, concrete examples to test ideas against.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Research intimacy is also different from research taste. But it does feed into it, and I suspect it‚Äôs one of the key ingredients in beating the ‚Äúresearch taste market.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As your intimacy with a research topic grows, your random thoughts about it become more interesting. Your thoughts in the shower or on a hike bounce against richer context. Your unconscious has more to work with. Your intuition deepens.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I suspect that a lot of ‚Äúbrilliant insights‚Äù are natural next steps from someone who has deep intimacy with a research topic. And that actually seems more profound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I add more data to the NYC Chaos Dashboard, a website that maps live urban activity, I have been looking for a more efficient way to render the map. Since I collect all of the data in one process and return the Dashboard as one HTML file, I kept wondering how I could optimize the map‚Äôs loading time by pre-processing the data as much as possible in the backend. This is where vector tiles come in.&lt;lb/&gt; The code shown in this post is written in Go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why generate tiles?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially, all of the map‚Äôs data was passed to the rendering library in GeoJSON format (embedded directly in the HTML file). For those who don‚Äôt know, GeoJSON is a JSON based standard to represent geographic information. You can go see the full RFC here, but here‚Äôs a quick preview of what it looks like so you can get an idea:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [-74.04452395542852, 40.68987850656795]
  },
  "properties": {
    "name": "Statue of Liberty",
    "status": "open"
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, I‚Äôm definitely not JSON‚Äôs greatest fan. It‚Äôs all text, meaning that a number is stored in a base 10 ASCII representation, where a number like &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt; gets stored as &lt;code&gt;"4"&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;"2"&lt;/code&gt;.
I could go on, but I think you see the problem: it‚Äôs not the most efficient way to store data. Nonetheless, JSON has a lot of merits: it‚Äôs human-readable and easy to share between systems, so I find myself using it more
than I‚Äôd like to - more often than not, simplicity is the way to go, and a simple format like GeoJSON just gets the job done, and that alone makes it a worthy geographic standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what happens when I start adding more layers to the map? It gets slow. I‚Äôm working on adding flood sensor data (thank you Floodnet for granting me access to the API), LIRR and MetroNorth data, NYISO power data, and many more datasets which will start adding a lot of layers to the map. I can already see that the HTML file, at the time of writing, is 4.5Mb (once decompressed) and takes ~770ms to transfer from Cloudflare‚Äôs CDN to my browser. This seems pretty reasonable for now, but it won‚Äôt scale as the future datasets are much larger, and running a quick check on the website, chrome is already telling me that the site has performance issues:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if I look more closely, I can see that it‚Äôs the result of a long rendering (over 2s!), which I can see here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, I suspect this is the result of a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As mentioned above, all of the embedded data is GeoJSON. This means the rendering library (MapLibre GL JS) needs to parse the JSON. There‚Äôs a lot, with a lot of properties, so this takes time.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MapLibre GL needs to then take the coordinates and then place the lines, points and polygons on the map accordingly. This takes time, and it all happens on your browser.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt like this - I want a map that people can use to check on the status of their city, and not a bloated HTML page that gets slower as more data gets onboarded, ironically making it less and less usable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;So, how can I display many large datasets on a map?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An obvious, and honestly wise, solution would be to simply load the GeoJSONs separately, via a GET request. You can do this simply in MapLibre:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;map.addSource('resurfacing', {
    type: 'geojson',
    data: 'https://dash.hudsonshipping.co/data/resurfacing.geojson'
});&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is so much better than my current solution:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;map.addSource('resurfacing', {
    type: 'geojson',
    data: {{.Geo.Resurfacing}}
});&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{.Geo.Resurfacing}}&lt;/code&gt; is the code in my HTML template that gets rendered in my Go process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loading GeoJSONs via a GET request will result in a lighter HTML file and a faster rendering of the Dashboard (the non-map components at least), but MapLibre still needs to parse that JSON and figure out how and where to plot the geometries. This is still not optimal. So how do big companies handle this? To display large amounts of data on map at scale and with performance, they use Vector Tiles, loading geometries sector by sector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What are Vector Tiles?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vector Tiles are small files that also represent geographic features, similar to GeoJSON. The key difference is that they represent a specific sector, a tile (thus the name), at a specific zoom. That means if I want to display a map of the world with Vector Tiles, it will actually be a collection of square tiles pieced together. Imagine taking a globe and cutting it up in multiple squares - that‚Äôs what vector tiles are (we‚Äôll ignore distortion and projections for now, that‚Äôll be a post for another time).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may already be familiar with them when interacting with online maps, like Google Maps, where you can notice your features contained in squares, with some squares loaded before others:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MapTiler made a great demonstration of Tiles, showing the tile coordinates at different zoom levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike GeoJSON where all features (point, line or polygon) of a layer are stored in one file, Vector Tiles (MVT) store features in smaller files that represent a specific area (at a specific zoom, or resolution). In the above image, the points from the GeoJSON file are split into 3 tiles (tile 4 being empty).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;So this is just a raster, then?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, and this is where vector tiles get even more interesting. Like rasters, they represent data in a specific part of the world. But unlike rasters, vector tiles don‚Äôt store an image, they store instructions. This is very, very similar (you‚Äôll see just how much in the next section) to a JPEG vs an SVG. This means vector tiles contain commands to draw layers and features that can then be customized in the rendering library:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Have a road you want to display as congested? Just set the line-color to red&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Have a live event you want to display? Go for it, just add some custom animation to make the point pulsate&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AS you can see in the above illustration, an Vector Tile file contains commands on how to plot the data using a local coordinate system, and not just a grid of pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Ok, so how do I create one of these tiles and load it on a map?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok, this is the fun part - and it‚Äôs a lot easier than I first thought it would be. We‚Äôll use the current standard for vector tiles, which you may have glimpsed in the previous sections: Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT). MapLibre can handle this natively, and the documentation seems pretty easy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;map.addSource('some id', {
    type: 'vector',
    tiles: ['https://dash.hudsonshipping.co/{z}/{x}/{y}/tile.mvt'],
    minzoom: 6,
    maxzoom: 14
});&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I need to have an endpoint that serves up MVT files for a given tile (x,y) at a given zoom z. That part isn‚Äôt too hard, it‚Äôs a simple HTTP endpoint. So now, I need to actually be able to generate the MVT file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mapbox has done a great job documenting the spec, you can find it here. I used this as the main reference for the project, as it contains everything you need to construct a vector tile. For all transformations, I simply used the code made available my MapTiler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An MVT represents information in binary format - this means it‚Äôs not human-readable, unlike GeoJSON. To generate the binary output, Mapbox has opted for Protobuf. If you don‚Äôt know Protobuf, it‚Äôs Google‚Äôs standard to normalize structured data in a binary format with predefined fields and datatypes described in a &lt;code&gt;.proto&lt;/code&gt; file. If you want to learn more about the project, I recommend checking this out. This is what the MVT proto file looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;message Tile {
        enum GeomType {
             UNKNOWN = 0;
             POINT = 1;
             LINESTRING = 2;
             POLYGON = 3;
        }

        message Value {
                optional string string_value = 1;
                optional float float_value = 2;
                optional double double_value = 3;
                optional int64 int_value = 4;
                optional uint64 uint_value = 5;
                optional sint64 sint_value = 6;
                optional bool bool_value = 7;

                extensions 8 to max;
        }
        message Feature {
                optional uint64 id = 1 [ default = 0 ];
                repeated uint32 tags = 2 [ packed = true ];
                optional GeomType type = 3 [ default = UNKNOWN ];
                repeated uint32 geometry = 4 [ packed = true ];
        }

        message Layer {
                required uint32 version = 15 [ default = 1 ];
                required string name = 1;
                repeated Feature features = 2;
                repeated string keys = 3;
                repeated Value values = 4;
                optional uint32 extent = 5 [ default = 4096 ];

                extensions 16 to max;
        }

        repeated Layer layers = 3;
        extensions 16 to 8191;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok, so looking at the proto, we can see that a tile is essentially an array of layers, each layer being able to contain multiple features. To make this more understandable, here‚Äôs an example of what you could put in a tile:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Layer 1: Monuments&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Feature 1: Statue of Liberty (type: Point)&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Feature 2: Eiffel Tower (type: Point)&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Layer 2: Airports&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Feature 1: JFK (type: Point)&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Feature 2: CDG (type: Point)&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We‚Äôll use this example throughout this section to construct a tile, and specifically focus on the Statue of Liberty. We can see that a layer represents a dataset you want to display on a map, and a feature is a datapoint in that dataset. A tile can contain multiple layers, and thus multiple datasets. At a certain resolution, we expect the Statue of Liberty to be in the same tile as the JFK airport, same for the Eiffel Tower and CDG, meaning they‚Äôll be in the same MVT file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok, so now we understand what‚Äôs contained in a tile. But how do you actually construct it? Here are the steps required:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For a given zoom level, identify what tile (x, y) a feature belongs to&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create the tile and add the geometry&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add properties via tags&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Return the tile via HTTP&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. Identifying the tiles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs restate the problem we‚Äôre trying to solve: we have a GeoJSON file that we want to convert into multiple MVT tiles for performance reasons. As stated earlier, to use MVT tiles in MapLibre we need to be able to return a response for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;https://dash.hudsonshipping.co/{z}/{x}/{y}/tile.mvt&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, this means I need to have multiple tiles generated in the backend, and return the correct one. But how do I know what tile each feature belongs to? For example, when I am currently at zoom level 9, I can see that the the Statue of Liberty will be in the tile &lt;code&gt;x = 150, y = 192&lt;/code&gt;:

And if I zoom to level 10, I can see that the Statue of Liberty will be in the tile
&lt;code&gt;x = 301, y = 385&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To properly identify the tile, we need to do a few conversions. At this point, all of my geographic data is normalized to use EPSG:4326, a format most people are familiar with to represent coordinates. For example, the Statue of Liberty‚Äôs coordinates in EPSG:4326, expressed in degrees, are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;longitude:-74.04452395542852, latitude: 40.68987850656795&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For vector tiles, the coordinate system used is called Web Mercator (EPSG:3857). In this system, expressed in meters, the Statue is Liberty is located at:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;x = -8242598.70274865, y = 4966705.869136138&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we need to convert the Statue of Liberty‚Äôs coordinates from degrees to meters, and then identify which square it belongs to at a specific zoom level. This is pretty straight forward, so let‚Äôs get right to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs finally get our hands dirty and write some code (please add proper error handling, this code is only for demonstration purposes).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First off, I want to convert my coordinates from &lt;code&gt;EPSG:4326&lt;/code&gt; (lon/lat) to &lt;code&gt;EPSG:3857&lt;/code&gt; (meters):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// We will use these constants throughout
const (
	EarthRadius = 6378137 // meters
	TileSize    = 512 // pixels
	OriginShift = 2 * math.Pi * EarthRadius / 2.0
)

func LonLatToMeters(lon float64, lat float64) (x float64, y float64) {
	mx := lon * OriginShift / 180.0
	my := math.Log(math.Tan((90 + lat) * math.Pi / 360.0)) / (math.Pi / 180.0)
	my = my * OriginShift / 180.0
	return mx, my
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The spec refers to 4096 tile sizes, but MapLibre seems to use 512 pixels, so we‚Äôll stick with this. Once we‚Äôve successfully written the function to convert our coordinates, we can now write the code to get the appropriate tile:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;func Resolution(zoom int) float64 {
	// Returns meters / pixel
	initialResolution := 2 * math.Pi * EarthRadius / TileSize
	return initialResolution / (math.Pow(2, float64(zoom)))
}

func MetersToTile(mx float64, my float64, zoom int) (x int, y int) {
	res := Resolution(zoom) // meters / pixel
	px := (mx + OriginShift) / res
	py := (my + OriginShift) / res

	tx := int(math.Ceil(px / float64(TileSize)) - 1)
	ty := int(math.Ceil(py / float64(TileSize)) - 1)
	return tx, ty
}

func GoogleTile(tx int, ty int, zoom int) (x int, y int) {
	ty = int(math.Pow(2, float64(zoom))-1) - ty
	return tx, ty
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once we have these utility functions, determining the appropriate tile only requires a few lines of code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mx, my   := LonLatToMeters(lon, lat)
tx, ty   := MetersToTile(mx, my, zoom)
gtx, gty := GoogleTile(tx, ty, zoom)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use &lt;code&gt;GoogleTile()&lt;/code&gt; because it seems MapLibre uses this standard (simply shift the origin to the top left). I couldn‚Äôt find documentation on it,
but I was able to see this behavior during my tests. I‚Äôll update this part if I find the relevant documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is what we now have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;mx&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;my&lt;/code&gt;are the point‚Äôs coordinates in meters, using the Web Mercator projection.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;tx&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;ty&lt;/code&gt;are the tile coordinates in&lt;code&gt;TMS&lt;/code&gt;format.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;gtx&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;gty&lt;/code&gt;are the tile coordinates in Google format (also known as the XYZ format).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great, we know what tile our feature belongs to for a given zoom. Let‚Äôs go create the tile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2. Create the tile and add the geometry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we know which tile a feature belongs to, let‚Äôs create the MVT file. You‚Äôll need to install protoc for Go:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go ahead and get the official .proto here: https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/blob/master/2.1/vector_tile.proto&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generate the struct:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;protoc --go_out=./path/to/dir/mvt ./path/to/dir/mvt/vector_tile.proto&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will generate a &lt;code&gt;vector_tile.pb.go&lt;/code&gt; that will look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Code generated by protoc-gen-go. DO NOT EDIT.
// versions:
// 	protoc-gen-go v1.36.8
// 	protoc        v3.21.12
// source: internal/geo/mvt/vector_tile.proto

package mvt // Make sure to use the correct package here

import (
	protoreflect "google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect"
	protoimpl "google.golang.org/protobuf/runtime/protoimpl"
	reflect "reflect"
	sync "sync"
	unsafe "unsafe"
)

const (
	// Verify that this generated code is sufficiently up-to-date.
	_ = protoimpl.EnforceVersion(20 - protoimpl.MinVersion)
	// Verify that runtime/protoimpl is sufficiently up-to-date.
	_ = protoimpl.EnforceVersion(protoimpl.MaxVersion - 20)
)

// GeomType is described in section 4.3.4 of the specification
type Tile_GeomType int32

const (
	Tile_UNKNOWN    Tile_GeomType = 0
	Tile_POINT      Tile_GeomType = 1
	Tile_LINESTRING Tile_GeomType = 2
	Tile_POLYGON    Tile_GeomType = 3
)
// ...&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once we have generated the protobuf class, we can create an empty tile like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;func NewTile(layerName string) *Tile {
    // The Tile struct comes from the generated protobuf
	version := uint32(0)
	extent := uint32(TileSize)
	layers := []*Tile_Layer{
	    {
	        Name:     &amp;amp;layerName,
	        Version:  &amp;amp;version,
	        Features: make([]*Tile_Feature, 0),
	        Extent:   &amp;amp;extent,
	    },
	}
	return &amp;amp;Tile{Layers: layers}
}
t = NewTile("monuments")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great, we now have an empty tile. Let‚Äôs add our monument to ut, as a feature in the first layer called &lt;code&gt;monuments&lt;/code&gt;.
A feature is defined by a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A geometry type, in our case a Point&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tags (properties for that feature, which we‚Äôll add in the next section)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A geometry&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, a vector tile behaves similarly to an SVG file: you specify instructions to move a cursor. And that‚Äôs exactly what goes into the geometry field: a series of instructions for a cursor. Since our monument is a Point, we only have one instruction: move to location &lt;code&gt;(x, y)&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see in the above example, we‚Äôre telling the cursor to move from the Origin to a specific part of the tile. In this case, we‚Äôre letting MapLibre GL know to move the cursor 200 pixels to the right (x axis) and 75 pixels down (y axis).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But how do we get these instructions? Instructions are relative to the Origin of the tile, which is located at the top-left corner. Coordinates go from 0 to 512 (the &lt;code&gt;Extent&lt;/code&gt; of the tile, which we defined above).:
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means we need a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Get the Web Mercator coordinates of the tile‚Äôs Origin&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Calculate the offset, &lt;code&gt;dx&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;dy&lt;/code&gt;for a given Point&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Convert the offset in meters to an offset in pixels&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting the tile‚Äôs origin is pretty straight forward:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;func GetTileOrigin(tx int, ty int, zoom int) (minx int64, maxy int64) {
	res := Resolution(zoom)
	minX := int64(float64(tx) * TileSize * res - OriginShift)
	maxY := int64(float64(ty + 1) * TileSize * res - OriginShift)
	return minX, maxY
}
originX, originY := TileBounds(tx, ty, zoom)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we have the Origin‚Äôs coordinates in meters, let‚Äôs calculate the offsets &lt;code&gt;dx&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dy&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dx := mx - originX
dy := originY - my&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, let‚Äôs divide the offsets by the resolution, expressed in meters / pixel, to get the parameters for the instruction:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;res := Resolution(zoom)
shiftX := uint32(math.Floor(float64(dx) / res))
shiftY := uint32(math.Floor(float64(dy) / res))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We now have everything we need to construct our feature:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;geomType := Tile_POINT
feature := Tile_Feature{
    Type: &amp;amp;geomType,
    Geometry: []uint32{
        1 &amp;amp; 0x7 | 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 3, // Command 1 (moveTo), count of 1
        (shiftX &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1) ^ (shiftX &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 31),
        (shiftY &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1) ^ (shiftY &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 31),
    },
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The geometry is a little odd, but here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We pass in a slice of instructions, which is made up of a command followed by parameters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To place a Point, we use the command &lt;code&gt;moveTo&lt;/code&gt;, to move the cursor&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This command expects two parameters, &lt;code&gt;dX&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;dY&lt;/code&gt;, which we pass in using&lt;code&gt;zigzag&lt;/code&gt;encoding&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can go ahead and add this feature to our tile:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;t.Layers[0].Features = append(t.Layers[0].Features, &amp;amp;feature)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3. Add properties&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We now have a tile that meets the basic requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1 layer&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1 feature in the layer with a valid geometry&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I now want to add the properties defined in the GeoJSON, in this case, the name and the status for the Statue of Liberty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with GeoJSON, you can store properties for each feature. So here, the status could be one of three:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt;: Open for visit.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;closed&lt;/code&gt;: Closed for visit.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;maintenance&lt;/code&gt;: Closed for maintenance.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding the status &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; to the Statue of Liberty in GeoJSON looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "type": "Feature",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [-74.04452395542852, 40.68987850656795]
  },
  "properties": {
    "name": "Statue of Liberty",
    "status": "open"
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, if I have 10‚Äô000 monuments, I‚Äôll have 10,000 dictionaries like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"properties": {
    "name": "&amp;lt;Monument Name&amp;gt;",
    "status": "&amp;lt;Monument Status&amp;gt;"
  }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That means repeating &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;closed&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;maintenance&lt;/code&gt; 10,000 times. Best case scenario, that‚Äôs 40,000 bytes (&lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; 10,000 times),
and you probably want a unique name for your monument, so add another 10,000 strings to your file.
You can definitely improve this by shortening the status to something like &lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;status&lt;/code&gt;, but this will only
get you so far as you scale (especially if you‚Äôre dealing with numbers, where these tricks won‚Äôt work) and add more properties and features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vector Tiles use a different approach: tags. In each layer, you define a set of keys and a set of values. In our previous example, the keys would be &lt;code&gt;[name, status]&lt;/code&gt; and the values would be &lt;code&gt;[Statue of Liberty, open, closed, maintenance]&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let‚Äôs add the known keys and values to our layer:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;t.Layers[0].Keys = []string{"name", "status"}

SoLName := "Statue of Liberty"
StatusOpen := "open"
StatusClosed := "closed"
StatusMaintenance := "maintenance"
t.Layers[0].Values = []*Tile_Value{
    {StringValue: &amp;amp;SoLName},           // 0
    {StringValue: &amp;amp;StatusOpen},        // 1
    {StringValue: &amp;amp;StatusClosed},      // 2
    {StringValue: &amp;amp;StatusMaintenance}, // 3
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that our layer knows what keys and values to expect, we can go ahead and set the property for the Statue of Liberty:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;t.Layers[0].Features[0].Tags = []uint32{0, 0, 1, 1} // name: Statue of Liberty, status: open&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we wanted to update the status to inform users the Statue of Liberty is closed for maintenance, we would simply update the tags to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;t.Layers[0].Features[0].Tags = []uint32{0, 0, 1, 3} // name: Statue of Liberty, status: maintenance&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4. Return the tile via HTTP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our tile &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; isready to be returned to the frontend via an HTTP GET request.
To convert our tile to the MVT binary, simply use:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import 	"github.com/gogo/protobuf/proto"

out, _ := proto.Marshal(t)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; contains the &lt;code&gt;[]byte&lt;/code&gt; data that represents the .mvt file. Be sure to set the following header in your HTTP response:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"Content-Type" : "application/vnd.mapbox-vector-tile"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there it is - a vector tile built entirely from scratch, using geographic information contained in a GeoJSON file. When you‚Äôre using a map, you‚Äôll almost always be visualizing more than one tile at a time, and zooming in and out. This means each feature will be on multiple tiles, one per zoom level, so you‚Äôll need to design a strategy to handle this. The below code is a quick snippet of the implementation used for the Dashboard (some of the HTTP code is using an internal library, it can easily be replaced with your own HTTP server implementation / library):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;type TileMap struct {
	Tiles map[int]map[int]map[int]*Tile // [z][x][y]Tile
}

func NewTileMap() *TileMap {
	tiles := make(map[int]map[int]map[int]*Tile)
	for _, zoom := range Zooms {
		tiles[zoom] = make(map[int]map[int]*Tile)
	}
	return &amp;amp;TileMap{Tiles: tiles}
}

func (tm *TileMap) GetTile(z int, x int, y int) *Tile {
	if xyMap, zExists := tm.Tiles[z]; zExists {

    &lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve now created an HTTP server that returns MVT files on demand, as a user explores the map.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Did the performance improve?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After deploying the MVT tile server for my GeoJSON layers that contain points, this is what we get:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File size decreased to 3.7Mb (I mean, we removed GeoJSON data, so no surprise there), meaning the site now loads in 500ms&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The paint time has decreased (by about 200ms, not bad for migrating just 2 datasets over), and the performance score went up by 8% according to Lighthouse:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm running this process off of a server in my office, and I use Cloudflare Tunnels to expose the site, which unfortunately means the tiles don‚Äôt return very fast. This means I‚Äôm going to have to move this over to AWS, something I‚Äôve been meaning to do, and I expect the tiles to return a lot faster, hopefully sub 100ms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still have to move over the non-Point layers that are still GeoJSON, so I expect a big gain in performance there. More soon!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What‚Äôs next?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This simple example only focuses on Points. Implementing lines and polygons requires more work, as they can span multiple tiles. I‚Äôll put out a new post once I‚Äôve implemented these, along with performance metrics of the Dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm also looking forward to seeing MapLibre tiles ready for production use, so I can generate MapLibre tiles and get some additional performance gain and contribute to the MapLibre ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm working on making the Go code open source in a small geographic library, which I‚Äôll put on Hudson Shipping Co‚Äôs github.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Thank you!&lt;/head&gt;
