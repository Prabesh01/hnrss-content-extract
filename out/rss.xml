    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;US high school students lose ground in math and reading, continuing yearslong decline&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;US high school students lose ground in math and reading, continuing yearslong decline&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — A decade-long slide in high schoolers’ reading and math performance persisted during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 12th graders’ scores dropping to their lowest level in more than 20 years, according to results released Tuesday from an exam known as the nation’s report card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eighth-grade students also lost significant ground in science skills, according to the results from the National Assessment of Education Progress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The assessments were the first since the pandemic for eighth graders in science and 12th graders in reading and math. They reflect a downward drift across grade levels and subject areas in previous releases from NAEP, which is considered one of the best gauges of the academic progress of U.S. schools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Scores for our lowest-performing students are at historic lows,” said Matthew Soldner, the acting commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. “These results should galvanize all of us to take concerted and focused action to accelerate student learning.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the pandemic had an outsize impact on student achievement, experts said falling scores are part of a longer arc in education that cannot be attributed solely to COVID-19, school closures and related issues such as heightened absenteeism. Educators said potential underlying factors include children’s increased screen time, shortened attention spans and a decline in reading longer-form writing both in and out of school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dip in reading scores appeared alongside a shift in how English and language arts are taught in schools, with an emphasis on short texts and book excerpts, said Carol Jago, associate director of the California Reading and Literature Project at UCLA. As a high school English teacher 20 years ago, Jago said it was common for her high school students to read 20 books over the course of a year. Now, some English classes are assigning just three books a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“To be a good reader, you have to have the stamina to stay on the page, even when the going gets tough,” Jago said. “You have to build those muscles, and we’re not building those muscles in kids.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the scores show why the Trump administration wants to give states more control of education spending.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Despite spending billions annually on numerous K-12 programs, the achievement gap is widening, and more high school seniors are performing below the basic benchmark in math and reading than ever before,” McMahon said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;House Democrats said the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the Education Department will only hurt students. The declines show a need for federal investment in academic recovery and educational equity, said Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, ranking member of the House Committee on Education and Workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Eliminating the very agency responsible for supporting public schools and enforcing civil rights protections of students will only deepen the achievement gaps identified by this assessment,” Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Fewer students show basic proficiency in math and reading&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The test scores show more students are not reaching what would be considered “basic” achievement across subject areas, said Lesley Muldoon, executive director of the National Assessment Governing Board. While NAEP’s definition of “proficient” is a high bar, Muldoon said, it is not an unreasonable one, and it is based on what researchers believe students should be able to achieve by the end of high school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“These students are taking their next steps in life with fewer skills and less knowledge in core academics than their predecessors a decade ago,” she said. “This is happening at a time when rapid advancements in technology and society demands more of future workers and citizens, not less.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In reading, the average score in 2024 was the lowest score in the history of the assessment, which began in 1992. Thirty-two percent of high school seniors scored below “basic,” meaning they were not able to find details in a text to help them understand its meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In math, the average score in 2024 was the lowest since 2005, when the assessment framework changed significantly. On the test, 45% of high school seniors scored below “basic” achievement, the highest percentage since 2005. Only 33% of high school seniors were considered academically prepared for college-level math courses, a decline from 37% in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The high school reading and math assessments, and the eighth grade science test, are given less frequently than the biannual fourth and eighth grade reading tests, which were last released earlier this year. The new scores reflect tests taken in schools around the country between January and March 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Achievement gaps are widening&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The gap between the highest- and lowest-performing students was its widest ever among eighth grade science students, reflecting growing inequality in the American school system. The achievement gap widened also in 12th grade math.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scores also reflect the re-emergence of a gender gap in science, technology, engineering and math courses. In 2019, boys and girls scored virtually the same on the NAEP science assessment. But in 2024, girls saw a steeper decline in scores. A similar pattern occurred in state math assessments, according to an Associated Press analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Schools had largely closed the gender gap in math and science, but it widened in the years following the pandemic as special programs to engage girls lapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a NAEP survey of students, a shrinking percentage of eighth grade students said they regularly took part in inquiry-based learning activities in the classroom. The pandemic disrupted schools’ ability to create those hands-on learning experiences for students, which are often critical to understanding scientific concepts and processes, said Christine Cunningham, senior vice president of STEM learning at the Museum of Science in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, she noted declines across subjects began well before schools closed in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We don’t know exactly what the cause of it is, but it would be incomplete to assume that if we hadn’t had COVID, the score would not have gone down,” Cunningham said. “That’s not what the data showed even before the pandemic.” ___&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;E-paper displays are prized for their readability and low power use, but they’ve long been dismissed as too slow for everyday computing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modos, a two-person startup with open-hardware roots, thinks it has cracked part of that problem with a development kit capable of driving an e-paper display at refresh rates up to a record 75 hertz.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Modos Paper Monitor and Dev Kit, now available for crowdfunding on Crowd Supply, combines standard e-paper panels with an open source FPGA-based display controller. While the kit provides enthusiasts and developers a complete package (with e-paper display, display driver, and hardware adapter), it’s also an entry point for experimenting with different e-paper displays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RELATED: How E Ink Developed Full-Color E-paper&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I would say instead of our secret sauce, we have open sauce,” says cofounder Alexander Soto. “You don’t even need to use the panel we’re offering. You could use a different panel and still get [75 Hz].”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;E-paper at 75 Hz&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most e-paper panels update at a refresh rate of around 10 Hz or less. (E-paper is the generic term for screens that mimic the appearance of ink on paper—the most well-known brand being that made by the company E Ink.) Some displays don’t even quote a refresh rate and may require up to a full second to refresh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A better refresh rate means a display can show more frames each second, which in turn provides smoother, more lifelike motion. Modern digital video is usually delivered at 30 or 60 frames per second, which until recently was well beyond the reach of an e-paper display. This is an area where e-paper clearly lags LCD displays, which start at 60 Hz and go up from there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modos is able to hit refresh rates of up to 75 Hz on a 13-inch e-paper panel with a 1,600 by 1,200 resolution. (a 6-inch e-paper panel with 1,448 by 1,072 resolution and the same refresh rate is available, too.) Bumping the refresh rate also reduces latency. That’s a key point, as it allows an e-paper display to be used in situations where latency matters, such as a computer or tablet display.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“A lot of people default to thinking that with e-readers or e-paper, it’s slow, it’s going to be flashing all the time,” says Soto. “Our challenge has been going to conferences, going to events, and showing people…e-paper can be very fast.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Open Source E-Paper Display Controller&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modos’s quoted 75-Hz refresh rate is the highest yet for an e-paper display, but it’s arguably not the key innovation. Several competitors already offer e-paper displays with refresh rates up to 60 Hz which, though lower, is close.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Modos has a not-so-secret weapon: Caster, an open-source e-paper display controller that’s compatible with a wide variety of e-paper panels. The display controller, which is based on the AMD Spartan-6 FPGA, departs from typical e-paper controllers with pixel-level display management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Traditionally, the [e-paper display] controller used a single-state machine to control the entire panel, with only two states: static and updating,” says Modos cofounder Wenting Zhang. “Caster treats each pixel individually rather than as a whole panel, which allows localized control on the pixels.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FPGA display controller is paired with Modos’s Glider Mega Adapter, which includes four different display connectors compatible with several dozen e-paper displays ranging in size from 4.3 to 13 inches. Soto says the adapter can be used to repurpose displays salvaged from older e-readers, like Amazon’s Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 75-Hz refresh rate allows for smoother scrolling. Modos&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modos also provides an application programming interface (API), written in the C programming language, that lets applications select display-driving modes dynamically. As the video above shows, a Linux window manager can be used to render text in a low-latency binary color mode, display maps in more detailed yet responsive gray scale, and display video with maximum-fidelity gray scale—all simultaneously on the same screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The code and schematics for Caster, Glider, and the API are open source and available on Github.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Crowdfunding for E-paper Innovation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modos’s crowdfunding campaign is set to conclude on 18 September. Orders are expected to ship in January of 2026, although (as is often the case for crowdfunded projects) the shipping window is not guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting to this stage has taken several years. The company’s founders initially hoped to build an e-paper laptop, the Modos Paper Laptop, which was announced in January of 2022. However, the realities of electronics manufacturing complicated that project early in its life and the laptop was never made available to order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Part of it was that the primary aspect ratio for the majority of [laptop] chassises are for 16:9 and 16:10. And when you look at e-paper displays, it was an aspect ratio of 4:3. So, we either had to make a custom chassis, or a custom panel, both of them being prohibitively expensive,” says Soto.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Panel sourcing also remains a hurdle. E-paper’s production is geared toward e-readers and signage, which means most panels aren’t the right size for a computer. However, the Modos Paper Monitor and Dev Kit found a practical compromise in recently introduced 13-inch e-paper displays, many of which provide a resolution similar to LCD and OLED panels developed for laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this way, the Dev Kit is a continuation of Modos’s original goal. While building a full-fledged e-paper laptop was impractical, the Dev Kit’s high refresh rate, open-source display controller, and API give ambitious users the opportunity to implement their own low-latency e-paper computer display—or anything else they put their mind to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article was updated on 8 September 2025 to replace mentions of “E Ink” (the specific e-paper technology developed by the company of the same name) with “e-paper.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;design that is more durable than any previous model,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;with innovative camera experiences and&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;remarkable all‑day battery life&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today debuted the all-new iPhone Air, the thinnest iPhone ever made, with pro performance. iPhone Air features a breakthrough titanium design that is elegant and light yet strong, with an innovative internal architecture that enables the latest iPhone experiences. The back of iPhone Air is now protected with Ceramic Shield, and the front cover uses Ceramic Shield 2, delivering 3x better scratch resistance, making iPhone Air more durable than any previous iPhone. iPhone Air also features a stunning 6.5-inch Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion up to 120Hz.1 With the most Apple-designed chips in an iPhone — the powerhouse A19 Pro, N1, and C1X — iPhone Air is the most power-efficient iPhone ever made. Paired with the redesigned internal architecture and software optimizations, iPhone Air has fantastic all-day battery life. A powerful 48MP Fusion Main camera enables the equivalent of four lenses with incredible image quality, and the innovative 18MP Center Stage front camera takes selfies to the next level. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;iPhone Air will be available in four gorgeous finishes: space black, cloud white, light gold, and sky blue. Pre-orders begin Friday, September 12, with availability beginning Friday, September 19. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The all-new iPhone Air is so powerful, yet impossibly thin and light, that you really have to hold it to believe it’s real. This huge leap in design and engineering is only made possible through Apple innovation, especially Apple silicon,” said John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering. “iPhone Air is a brand-new member of the iPhone family that delivers advanced features our users will love, like pro performance, a versatile 48MP Fusion camera system, our innovative Center Stage front camera, and great all-day battery life — all in a breakthrough design that feels like you’re holding the future.” &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Breakthrough Design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Featuring a breakthrough design with pro performance, iPhone Air is the thinnest iPhone ever made at 5.6mm, and it is incredibly light, with a large, stunning display. The grade 5 titanium frame is strong, with an elegant high-gloss mirror finish, and a new plateau on the back that is precision-milled on both sides to house the cameras, speaker, and Apple silicon. This maximizes space for the battery to deliver remarkable all-day battery life. The thin design also features the Action button, so users can easily access a variety of functions with just a press, and Camera Control, to quickly launch the camera or enable visual intelligence.2 &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The stunning 6.5-inch Super Retina XDR display features ProMotion, with an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz for smooth scrolling and stunning graphics. The Always-On display shows important information at a glance, and when not in use, it efficiently adjusts down to 1Hz. iPhone Air is easy to use outside with 3000 nits peak outdoor brightness — the highest ever on iPhone — and 2x better outdoor contrast. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;iPhone Air also introduces the Ceramic Shield 2 front cover, which is tougher than any smartphone glass or glass-ceramic with a new Apple-designed coating, providing 3x better scratch resistance and improved anti-reflection to reduce glare. For the very first time, Ceramic Shield now protects the back of iPhone, including the plateau, delivering 4x better resistance to cracks than the back glass on previous models. And with the strong titanium frame, iPhone Air exceeds Apple’s stringent bend strength requirements. This design makes iPhone Air more durable than any previous iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Powerful Camera Systems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;iPhone Air introduces an all-new Center Stage front camera that advances the photo and video experience. The Center Stage front camera features the first square front camera sensor on iPhone, offering a wide field of view and capturing photos up to 18MP. Users no longer have to rotate their iPhone to take a landscape selfie — they can take photos and videos in portrait or landscape while holding their iPhone vertically. For group shots, Center Stage for photos uses AI to automatically expand the field of view and can rotate from portrait to landscape to include everyone in the frame. The Center Stage front camera enables ultra-stabilized video in 4K HDR, and users can record on the front and rear cameras simultaneously with Dual Capture — perfect for documenting themselves and the world around them. During calls over FaceTime or third-party apps, Center Stage for video calls keeps users stable and positioned in frame. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A versatile new 48MP Fusion camera system gives users the equivalent of four lenses in their pocket. The custom main lens enables the popular 28mm and 35mm focal lengths, so users have more options to frame their shot, and the large 2.0µm quad-pixel sensor with sensor-shift OlS excels in low light. Users can also get closer to their subject with the optical-quality 2x Telephoto, which features an updated Photonic Engine that captures more lifelike details and color. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new image pipeline built for iPhone Air enables next-generation portraits with Focus Control at the same level as multicamera systems, automatically capturing depth information so users can turn photos into portraits later in the Photos app. iPhone Air also supports the latest generation of Photographic Styles, including a new Bright style that brightens skin tones and applies a pop of vibrance across the image.3 &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;iPhone Air captures stunning video, with the ability to record in 4K60 fps Dolby Vision, and supports Action mode. Video is captured with Spatial Audio for immersive listening; Audio Mix lets users adjust sound after capture to boost voices and reduce ambient noise; and wind noise reduction minimizes unwanted noise. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Powered by Apple Silicon&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design of iPhone Air is only possible with Apple silicon. The high-performance A19 Pro, N1, and C1X chips make it the most power-efficient iPhone ever made. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The powerhouse A19 Pro features a new 6-core CPU that improves performance and efficiency for the tasks users do every day, delivering the fastest CPU in any smartphone. The 5-core GPU has an upgraded architecture, delivering next-level mobile gaming, including AAA titles. Neural Accelerators are built into each GPU core, bringing up to 3x the peak GPU compute over the previous generation, excellent for powering generative AI models running on device. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;iPhone Air features N1, a new Apple-designed wireless networking chip that enables Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread. In addition to powering the latest generation of wireless technologies, N1 improves the overall performance and reliability of features like Personal Hotspot and AirDrop. iPhone Air also features C1X, a new cellular modem designed by Apple. C1X is up to 2x faster than C1, and for the same cellular technologies, it is even faster than the modem in iPhone 16 Pro, while using 30 percent less energy overall. This makes C1X the most power-efficient modem in an iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Remarkable All-Day Battery Life&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Featuring advanced Apple silicon, an internal architecture that maximizes space for the battery, and software optimizations, iPhone Air delivers fantastic all-day battery life. The new Adaptive Power Mode in iOS 26 also gets to know a user’s typical battery consumption and anticipates when they might run low, intelligently conserving power to help get them through the day. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;eSIM: A Flexible, Convenient, and Secure Connection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;iPhone Air features an eSIM-only design that saves space internally, helping enable the unbelievably light and thin form factor.4 eSIM offers greater flexibility, better security, and seamless connectivity compared to traditional physical SIM cards. An industry standard, eSIM is supported by over 500 carriers worldwide, including AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and more. eSIM also makes staying connected while traveling even more convenient, allowing continued connectivity through affordable international roaming plans from users’ home carriers or local prepaid options available with more than 200 carriers. For better security, eSIM cannot be physically removed if an iPhone is lost or stolen, and managing travel eSIMs is even easier with a new streamlined setup in iOS 26. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Featuring iOS 26 with New Apple Intelligence Capabilities&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;iOS 26 elevates the iPhone experience with a beautiful new design, powerful Apple Intelligence capabilities, and meaningful improvements to the apps users rely on every day. The new design with Liquid Glass makes apps and system experiences more expressive and delightful, bringing greater focus to content while keeping iOS instantly familiar. Apple Intelligence now translates text and audio on the go with Live Translation, helping users communicate across languages in Messages, FaceTime, and Phone.5 Updates to visual intelligence allow users to capture a screenshot and easily search or take action on anything they are viewing on their iPhone screen. The on-device foundation model at the core of Apple Intelligence is available to all developers, with apps already offering new intelligent, privacy-protected experiences that can even be used when offline. New screening tools for calls and messages help eliminate distractions so users can focus on the conversations that matter most. iOS 26 also introduces new features in CarPlay, Apple Music, Maps, and Wallet, as well as Apple Games, a brand-new app that gives players a single destination for all their games. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Beautiful New Accessories&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple is introducing a new ecosystem of accessories to complement the breakthrough design of iPhone Air: &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The iPhone Air Case with MagSafe — available in frost and shadow — has an ultra-thin translucent design with a lightly frosted interior, a high-gloss outer surface, and a reinforced polycarbonate frame to protect iPhone Air from scratches and drops.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The slim and lightweight iPhone Air Bumper — available in four matching colors — perfectly frames iPhone Air with a reinforced polycarbonate design for added edge protection.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Crafted from 100 percent recycled yarns, the Crossbody Strap drapes comfortably, with embedded flexible magnets and stainless steel sliding mechanisms to easily adjust the length and keep both straps securely aligned. The Crossbody Strap will be available in 10 colors: black, light gray, blue, light blue, purple, sienna, green, neon yellow, tan, and orange.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The iPhone Air MagSafe Battery has a thin and light design that seamlessly attaches to the back of the device. The MagSafe Battery quickly charges iPhone Air when the battery is low, and maximizes battery life when connected throughout the day, delivering up to 40 hours of video playback when used together.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;iPhone Air and the Environment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple 2030 is the company’s ambitious plan to be carbon neutral across its entire footprint by the end of this decade by reducing product emissions from their three biggest sources: materials, electricity, and transportation. iPhone Air is made with 35 percent recycled content, including 80 percent recycled titanium, the highest ever for an iPhone, and 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery. A new titanium USB-C port is 3D-printed to be thinner and stronger, fitting into the slim design while using 33 percent less material than a conventional forging process. iPhone Air is manufactured with 45 percent renewable electricity, like wind and solar, across the supply chain. It is designed to be durable, repairable, and offer industry-leading software support, while meeting Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and safe chemistry. The paper packaging is 100 percent fiber-based and can be easily recycled. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pricing and Availability &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;iPhone Air will be available in space black, cloud white, light gold, and sky blue, starting with 256GB storage, as well as 512GB and 1TB options. iPhone Air starts at $999 (U.S.) or $41.62 (U.S.) per month.6&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE) is the culmination of an unprecedented design and engineering effort, spanning half a decade, that combines the unique strengths of Apple silicon hardware with our advanced operating system security to provide industry-first, always-on memory safety protection across our devices â without compromising our best-in-class device performance. We believe Memory Integrity Enforcement represents the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of consumer operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There has never been a successful, widespread malware attack against iPhone. The only system-level iOS attacks we observe in the wild come from mercenary spyware, which is vastly more complex than regular cybercriminal activity and consumer malware. Mercenary spyware is historically associated with state actors and uses exploit chains that cost millions of dollars to target a very small number of specific individuals and their devices. Although the vast majority of users will never be targeted in this way, these exploit chains demonstrate some of the most expensive, complex, and advanced attacker capabilities at any given time and are uniquely deserving of study as we work to protect iPhone users against even the most sophisticated threats. Known mercenary spyware chains used against iOS share a common denominator with those targeting Windows and Android: they exploit memory safety vulnerabilities, which are interchangeable, powerful, and exist throughout the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Apple, improving memory safety is a broad effort that includes developing with safe languages and deploying mitigations at scale. (For a primer on how we think about memory safety, see the opening of this post.) We created Swift, an easy-to-use, memory-safe language, which we employ for new code and targeted component rewrites. In iOS 15, we introduced kalloc_type, a secure memory allocator for the kernel, followed in iOS 17 by its user-level counterpart, xzone malloc. These secure allocators take advantage of knowing the type â or purpose â of allocations so that memory can be organized in a way that makes exploiting most memory corruption vulnerabilities inherently difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2018, we were the first in the industry to deploy Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC) in the A12 Bionic chip, to protect code flow integrity in the presence of memory corruption. The strong success of this defensive mechanism in increasing exploitation complexity left no doubt that the deep integration of software and hardware security would be key to addressing some of our greatest security challenges. With PAC behind us, we immediately began design and evaluation work to find the most effective way to build sophisticated memory safety capabilities right into Apple silicon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arm published the Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) specification in 2019 as a tool for hardware to help find memory corruption bugs. MTE is, at its core, a memory tagging and tag-checking system, where every memory allocation is tagged with a secret; the hardware guarantees that later requests to access memory are granted only if the request contains the correct secret. If the secrets donât match, the app crashes, and the event is logged. This allows developers to identify memory corruption bugs immediately as they occur.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We conducted a deep evaluation and research process to determine whether MTE, as designed, would meet our goals for hardware-assisted memory safety. Our analysis found that, when employed as a real-time defensive measure, the original Arm MTE release exhibited weaknesses that were unacceptable to us, and we worked with Arm to address these shortcomings in the new Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE) specification, released in 2022. More importantly, our analysis showed that while EMTE had great potential as specified, a rigorous implementation with deep hardware and operating system support could be a breakthrough that produces an extraordinary new security mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider that MTE can be configured to report memory corruption either synchronously or asynchronously. In the latter mode, memory corruption doesnât immediately raise an exception, leaving a race window open for attackers. We would not implement such a mechanism. We believe memory safety protections need to be strictly synchronous, on by default, and working continuously. But supporting always-on, synchronous MTE across key attack surfaces while preserving a great, high-performance user experience is extremely demanding for hardware to support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, for MTE to provide memory safety in an adversarial context, we would need to finely tune the operating system to defend the new semantics and the confidentiality of memory tags on which MTE relies. Ultimately, we determined that to deliver truly best-in-class memory safety, we would carry out a massive engineering effort spanning all of Apple â including updates to Apple silicon, our operating systems, and our software frameworks. This effort, together with our highly successful secure memory allocator work, would transform MTE from a helpful debugging tool into a groundbreaking new security feature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today weâre introducing the culmination of this effort: Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE), our comprehensive memory safety defense for Apple platforms. Memory Integrity Enforcement is built on the robust foundation provided by our secure memory allocators, coupled with Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE) in synchronous mode, and supported by extensive Tag Confidentiality Enforcement policies. MIE is built right into Apple hardware and software in all models of iPhone 17 and iPhone Air and offers unparalleled, always-on memory safety protection for our key attack surfaces including the kernel, while maintaining the power and performance that users expect. In addition, weâre making EMTE available to all Apple developers in Xcode as part of the new Enhanced Security feature that we released earlier this year during WWDC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rest of this post dives into the intensive engineering effort required to design and validate Memory Integrity Enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Designing Memory Integrity Enforcement&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory Integrity Enforcement starts with our secure memory allocators â kalloc_type, xzone malloc, and WebKitâs libpas â all of which use type information to decide how to organize memory allocations. With both use-after-free and out-of-bounds bugs, an attackerâs goal is to create overlapping interpretations of memory, which they achieve by controlling the precise position of certain allocations â of a specific type â that is advantageous to them. The type-aware placement policies of our secure memory allocators help thwart these memory corruption techniques, as we described in our kalloc_type post. Our secure allocators set a new high-water mark of software protection against memory corruption, while preserving the same or better performance as the allocators they replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Allocators can apply protections only at the granularity of memory pages â 16KB on iOS â which is a natural fit for multi-page allocations. For smaller allocations, our secure allocators can use page-level protections to help prevent memory corruption attacks across different type buckets. However, page-level protections are too coarse to defend against attacks within the same type bucket, and we use memory tagging to close this gap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Letâs look at how EMTE can be used to protect against two of the most common types of memory corruption: buffer overflows and use-after-free vulnerabilities. For buffer overflows, the allocator is responsible for using different tags for neighboring allocations. If a request to access memory spills over to adjacent memory that has a different tag, the hardware blocks it, and the operating system can take action and terminate the process. We represent this visually below with three adjacent allocations, tagged with three different secrets: âºï¸, ð¼, and â¹ï¸. Two access attempts with the ð¼ tag are permitted to ð¼-tagged memory, but the third attempt is blocked as it spills over into the adjacent, â¹ï¸-tagged allocation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory Integrity Enforcement blocks buffer overflows&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The allocator is also responsible for retagging memory as it gets reused for other purposes. In the image below, the ð¼ allocation is retagged as â¹ï¸ after it has been freed and reallocated by the system. If a request to the retagged memory is made with the older ð¼ tag, as would be seen in use-after-free exploits, the hardware blocks it and lets the operating system take further action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory Integrity Enforcement blocks use-after-free access&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key weakness of the original MTE specification is that access to non-tagged memory, such as global variables, is not checked by the hardware. This means attackers donât have to face as many defensive constraints when attempting to control core application configuration and state. With Enhanced MTE, we instead specify that accessing non-tagged memory from a tagged memory region requires knowing that regionâs tag, making it significantly harder for attackers to turn out-of-bounds bugs in dynamic tagged memory into a way to sidestep EMTE by directly modifying non-tagged allocations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we developed Tag Confidentiality Enforcement to protect the implementation of our secure allocators from technical threats and to guard the confidentiality of EMTE tags â including against side-channel and speculative-execution attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our typed allocators and EMTE both rely on confidentiality of kernel data structures from user applications, and of the tags chosen by the allocator. Attackers might attempt to defeat EMTE, and in turn Memory Integrity Enforcement, by revealing these secrets. To protect the kernel allocator backing store and tag storage, we use the Secure Page Table Monitor, which provides strong guarantees even in the presence of a kernel compromise. We also ensure that when the kernel accesses memory on behalf of an application, it's subject to the same tag-checking rules as userspace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attacks based on speculative execution can also be used to expose secrets. To improve performance, modern CPUs predict the execution of instructions that follow prior, potentially longer latency instructions. If the prediction is correct, computation is very fast. If itâs wrong, the CPU discards the prediction, and computation is slower. Unfortunately, discarded predictions have observable effects that can reveal system state and data, and because speculative attacks never cause the system to crash or misbehave in observable ways during their use, theyâre particularly useful for an attacker. For example, evaluating a pointer authentication instruction speculatively exposed timing differences in our original implementation of Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC), which would allow the valid signature to be isolated. During the design phase for Memory Integrity Enforcement, we identified and addressed the three speculative vulnerabilities that could undermine tag confidentiality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, when EMTE is active, requests to access memory cause the hardware to check tags. It's crucial that evaluating a tag-checking instruction speculatively doesnât expose timing differences that would allow an attacker to isolate the valid tag. From the start, we designed the Apple silicon implementation so that tag values canât influence speculative execution in any way. Recently published security research demonstrates that the MTE implementation on Googleâs Pixel devices is vulnerable to this type of attack, allowing MTE to be bypassed in Google Chrome and the Linux kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, allocators assign random tags to memory, and attackers must not be able to predict tag values that the system will choose. We address this issue by frequently re-seeding the underlying pseudo-random generator used to select new tags.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, Spectre variant 1 (V1) is a speculative-execution vulnerability that allows attackers to exploit conditional branches to leak data, including MTE tag values. To date, there has been no solution to this problem in consumer operating systems, because general Spectre V1 mitigations such as Speculative Load Hardening have a prohibitive CPU cost. The presence of EMTE leaves Spectre V1 as one of the last avenues available to attackers to help guide their attacks, so we designed a completely novel mitigation that limits the effective reach of Spectre V1 leaks â at virtually zero CPU cost â and forces attackers to contend with type segregation. This mitigation makes it impractical for attackers to use Spectre V1, as they would typically need 25 or more V1 sequences to reach more than 95 percent exploitability rate â unless one of these sequences is related to the bug being exploited, following similar reasoning as our kalloc_type analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our mission with Memory Integrity Enforcement is to protect all users by default and provide an extraordinary disruption to the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities. To do so, we considered a wide set of threats, including some of the most challenging ones â such as side channels â and arrived at this extensive combination of features not present in other MTE implementations. Google took a great first step last year when they offered MTE to those who opt in to their program for at-risk users. But even for users who turn it on, the effectiveness of MTE on Android is limited by the lack of deep integration with the operating system that distinguishes Memory Integrity Enforcement and its use of EMTE on Apple silicon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the new A19 and A19 Pro chips to support Memory Integrity Enforcement, we dedicated an extraordinary amount of Apple silicon resources to security â more than ever before â including CPU area, CPU speed, and memory for tag storage. And to fully realize this hardware investment, we designed all of the new operating system elements of MIE jointly with our hardware work, including secure allocators, EMTE, and tag confidentiality protections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because EMTE tag checking imposes a performance cost, we designed Memory Integrity Enforcement to take advantage of our secure allocators first and use EMTE to protect only smaller individual allocations within a type bucket, which software allocators canât defend on their own. Then, by knowing where and how we would deploy EMTE, we could accurately model the tag-checking demand of the operating system, and design our silicon to satisfy it. Our hardware implementation influenced additional software design decisions, reducing the overhead of tag checks even further. Importantly, deploying EMTE with this level of precision supports our strategy to provide as many memory safety improvements as possible to users on previous iPhone generations, which donât support EMTE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the security evaluation of Memory Integrity Enforcement, we involved our offensive research team from the very beginning. From 2020 to 2025, they continuously analyzed and attacked the system â first conceptually, with theoretical exploitation avenues, then with practical attacks in simulated environments, and eventually on new hardware prototypes. Prolonged engagement from our offensive research team allowed us to identify and eradicate entire attack strategies and techniques before attackers could ever discover them, leading to a stronger, more mature feature from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our offensive research team identified where and how attackers are most likely to break into the system, and our deployment of Memory Integrity Enforcement is deeply guided by their findings. Notably, this includes making sure that this powerful new protection is available to third-party apps that are likely entry points for attackers â such as social networks, messaging apps, or any other app where a specific user can be targeted. Starting immediately with the launch of MIE, any developer can begin testing this powerful protection for their app, including EMTE on hardware that supports it, using the Enhanced Security settings in Xcode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The meticulous planning and implementation of Memory Integrity Enforcement made it possible to maintain synchronous tag checking for all the demanding workloads of our platforms, delivering groundbreaking security with minimal performance impact, while remaining completely invisible to users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Security evaluation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory Integrity Enforcement started with a deeply ambitious goal: to make it immensely more expensive and difficult to develop and maintain mercenary spyware attacks based on memory corruption against our platforms. While thereâs no such thing as perfect security, MIE is designed to dramatically constrain attackers and their degrees of freedom during exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout the design and implementation of Memory Integrity Enforcement, our offensive research team evaluated our progress by looking at sophisticated exploit chains that were previously used against our platform, recent vulnerabilities, and our own internal research. First, we worked on rebuilding and adapting previously seen exploit chains to systems protected by MIE. But itâs not sufficient to consider only previous chains that were developed before MIE existed, because attackers will surely adapt in reaction to these new protections. We therefore also evaluated a selection of more recent vulnerabilities that we expected would have the best chance of surviving MIE. For these, we meticulously enumerated all possible exploitation opportunities, similar to our evaluation of SockPuppet against kalloc_type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both approaches revealed the same conclusion: Memory Integrity Enforcement vastly reduces the exploitation strategies available to attackers. Though memory corruption bugs are usually interchangeable, MIE cut off so many exploit steps at a fundamental level that it was not possible to restore the chains by swapping in new bugs. Even with substantial effort, we could not rebuild any of these chains to work around MIE. The few memory corruption effects that remained are unreliable and donât give attackers sufficient momentum to successfully exploit these bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hereâs a visual representation of what this looks like for an attacker. The chart below represents six of the real-world exploit chains that we evaluated and shows the steps where Memory Integrity Enforcement â the secure allocators, EMTE, or both â stops the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory Integrity Enforcement vs. real-world exploit chains&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, attackers confront Memory Integrity Enforcement early in the exploitation process. Although some issues are able to survive MIE â for example, intra-allocation buffer overflows â such issues are extremely rare, and even fewer will lend themselves to a full end-to-end exploit. Inevitably, attackers must face MIE at a stage where their capabilities are still very limited, leaving few viable avenues for exploitation. This leads to fragile chains where breaking just one step is often enough to invalidate the entire exploit strategy. When that happens, most of the chainâs components canât be reused, and the attackers have to restart exploit development with entirely new bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The industry-leading security of iPhone means that the vast majority of our users never face system-level attacks on their devices. Our work on memory safety is aimed primarily at the mercenary spyware and surveillance industry, which spends many millions of dollars to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities and target a small number of individuals because of who they are and what they do. Over the past five years, we developed a comprehensive approach to memory safety that integrates the best of our hardware and software capabilities, and todayâs announcement is the culmination of this ambitious vision. With the introduction of the iPhone 17 lineup and iPhone Air, weâre excited to deliver Memory Integrity Enforcement: the industryâs first ever, comprehensive, always-on memory-safety protection covering key attack surfaces â including the kernel and over 70 userland processes â built on the Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE) and supported by secure typed allocators and tag confidentiality protections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on our evaluations pitting Memory Integrity Enforcement against exceptionally sophisticated mercenary spyware attacks from the last three years, we believe MIE will make exploit chains significantly more expensive and difficult to develop and maintain, disrupt many of the most effective exploitation techniques from the last 25 years, and completely redefine the landscape of memory safety for Apple products. Because of how dramatically it reduces an attackerâs ability to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities on our devices, we believe Memory Integrity Enforcement represents the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of consumer operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;NASA finds Titan’s alien lakes may be creating primitive cells&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Date:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;September 1, 2025&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-2"&gt;Source:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-2"&gt;NASA&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-3"&gt;Summary:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-3"&gt;Saturn’s moon Titan may be more alive with possibilities than we thought. New NASA research suggests that in Titan’s freezing methane and ethane lakes, simple molecules could naturally arrange themselves into vesicles—tiny bubble-like structures that mimic the first steps toward life. These compartments, born from splashing droplets and complex chemistry in Titan’s atmosphere, could act like primitive cell walls.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-4"&gt;Share:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NASA research has shown that cell-like compartments called vesicles could form naturally in the lakes of Saturn's moon Titan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Titan is the only world apart from Earth that is known to have liquid on its surface. However, Titan's lakes and seas are not filled with water. Instead, they contain liquid hydrocarbons like ethane and methane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Earth, liquid water is thought to have been essential for the origin of life as we know it. Many astrobiologists have wondered whether Titan's liquids could also provide an environment for the formation of the molecules required for life - either as we know it or perhaps as we don't know it - to take hold there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New NASA research, published in the International Journal of Astrobiology, outlines a process by which stable vesicles might form on Titan, based on our current knowledge of the moon's atmosphere and chemistry. The formation of such compartments is an important step in making the precursors of living cells (or protocells).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The process involves molecules called amphiphiles, which can self-organize into vesicles under the right conditions. On Earth, these polar molecules have two parts, a hydrophobic (water-fearing) end and a hydrophilic (water-loving) end. When they are in water, groups of these molecules can bunch together and form ball-like spheres, like soap bubbles, where the hydrophilic part of the molecule faces outward to interact with the water, thereby 'protecting' the hydrophobic part on the inside of the sphere. Under the right conditions, two layers can form creating a cell-like ball with a bilayer membrane that encapsulates a pocket of water on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When considering vesicle formation on Titan, however, the researchers had to take into account an environment vastly different from the early Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uncovering Conditions on Titan&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Titan is Saturn's largest moon and the second largest in our solar system. Titan is also the only moon in our solar system with a substantial atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hazy, golden atmosphere of Titan kept the moon shrouded in mystery for much of human history. However, when NASA's Cassini spacecraft arrived at Saturn in 2004, our views of Titan changed forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to Cassini, we now know Titan has a complex meteorological cycle that actively influences the surface today. Most of Titan's atmosphere is nitrogen, but there is also a significant amount of methane (CH4). This methane forms clouds and rain, which falls to the surface to cause erosion and river channels, filling up the lakes and seas. This liquid then evaporates in sunlight to form clouds once again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This atmospheric activity also allows for complex chemistry to happen. Energy from the Sun breaks apart molecules like methane, and the pieces then reform into complex organic molecules. Many astrobiologists believe that this chemistry could teach us how the molecules necessary for the origin of life formed and evolved on the early Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building Vesicles on Titan&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new study considered how vesicles might form in the freezing conditions of Titan's hydrocarbon lakes and seas by focusing on sea-spray droplets, thrown upwards by splashing raindrops. On Titan, both spray droplets and the sea surface could be coated in layers of amphiphiles. If a droplet then lands on the surface of a pond, the two layers of amphiphiles meet to form a double-layered (or bilayer) vesicle, enclosing the original droplet. Over time, many of these vesicles would be dispersed throughout the pond and would interact and compete in an evolutionary process that could lead to primitive protocells.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the proposed pathway is happening, it would increase our understanding of the conditions in which life might be able to form.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The existence of any vesicles on Titan would demonstrate an increase in order and complexity, which are conditions necessary for the origin of life," explains Conor Nixon of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. "We're excited about these new ideas because they can open up new directions in Titan research and may change how we search for life on Titan in the future."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NASA's first mission to Titan is the upcoming Dragonfly rotorcraft, which will explore the surface of the Saturnian moon. While Titan's lakes and seas are not a destination for Dragonfly (and the mission won't carry the light-scattering instrument required to detect such vesicles), the mission will fly from location to location to study the moon's surface composition, make atmospheric and geophysical measurements, and characterize the habitability of Titan's environment.&lt;/p&gt;

However, existing methods for training such models still rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted, self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels. Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Submission history&lt;/head&gt;From: Chengsong Huang [view email]&lt;p&gt;[v1] Thu, 7 Aug 2025 03:38:16 UTC (665 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v2] Wed, 27 Aug 2025 02:33:55 UTC (10,672 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current browse context: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cs.LG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I Replaced Animal Crossing's Dialogue with a Live LLM by Hacking GameCube Memory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A bridge from 2001 to today, with no game code changes required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Animal Crossing. Infamous for its charming but ultimately repetitive dialogue. Having picked up the GameCube classic again, I was shocked (/s) to discover that the villagers still say the same things they did 23 years ago. Let's change that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem? The game runs on a Nintendo GameCube, a 24-year-old console with a 485 MHz PowerPC processor, 24MB of RAM, and absolutely no internet connectivity. It was fundamentally, physically, and philosophically designed to be an offline island.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the story of how I built a bridge from 2001 to today, making a vintage game console talk to a cloud-based AI without modifying a single line of the original game's code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The First Hurdle: Speaking to the Game ð£ï¸&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first stroke of luck was immense. The week I started this project, a massive effort by the Animal Crossing decompilation community reached completion. Instead of staring at PowerPC assembly, I had access to readable C code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Digging through the source, I quickly found the relevant functions under a file named &lt;code&gt;m_message.c&lt;/code&gt;. This was it, the heart of the dialogue system. A simple test confirmed I could hijack the function call and replace the in-game text with my own string.
		&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// A glimpse into the decompiled Animal Crossing source code
// The function that changes message data in the dialogue system.
// My initial entry point for hijacking the text.

extern int mMsg_ChangeMsgData(mMsg_Window_c* msg_p, int index) {
    if (index &amp;gt;= 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; index &amp;lt; MSG_MAX &amp;amp;&amp;amp; mMsg_LoadMsgData(msg_p-&amp;gt;msg_data, index, FALSE)) {
        msg_p-&amp;gt;end_text_cursor_idx = 0;
        mMsg_Clear_CursolIndex(msg_p);
        mMsg_SetTimer(msg_p, 20.0f);
        return TRUE;
    }
    
    return FALSE;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Easy win, right? But changing static text is one thing. How could I get data from an external AI into the game in real time?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first thought was to just add a network call. But that would mean writing an entire network stack for the GameCube from scratch (TCP/IP, sockets, HTTP) and integrating it into a game engine that was never designed for it. That was a non-starter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My second thought was to use the Dolphin emulator's features to write to a file on my host machine. The game would write a "request" file with context, and my Python script would see it, call the LLM, and write back a "response" file. Unfortunately, I couldn't get the sandboxed GameCube environment to access the host filesystem. Another dead end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Breakthrough: The Memory Mailbox ð¬&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution came from a classic technique in game modding: Inter-Process Communication (IPC) via shared memory. The idea is to allocate a specific chunk of the GameCube's RAM to act as a "mailbox." My external Python script can write data directly into that memory address, and the game can read from it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# This is the bridge. These functions read from and write to GameCube RAM via Dolphin.
GAMECUBE_MEMORY_BASE = 0x80000000

def read_from_game(gc_address: int, size: int) -&amp;gt; bytes:
    """Reads a block of memory from a GameCube virtual address."""
    real_address = GAMECUBE_MEMORY_BASE + (gc_address - 0x80000000)
    return dolphin_process.read(real_address, size)

def write_to_game(gc_address: int, data: bytes) -&amp;gt; bool:
    """Writes a block of data to a GameCube virtual address."""
    real_address = GAMECUBE_MEMORY_BASE + (gc_address - 0x80000000)
    return dolphin_process.write(real_address, data)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the path forward. But it created a new, painstaking task: I had to become a memory archaeologist. I needed to find the exact stable memory addresses for the active dialogue text and the current speaker's name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To do this, I wrote my own memory scanner in Python. The process was a tedious loop:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Talk to a villager. The moment their dialogue box appeared, I'd freeze the emulator.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scan. I'd run my script to scan all 24 million bytes of the GameCube's RAM for the string of text on screen (e.g., "Hey, how's it going?").&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cross-Reference. This often returned multiple addresses. So, I'd unfreeze, talk to a different villager, and scan for their name to figure out which memory block belonged to the active speaker.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; After hours of talking, freezing, and scanning, I finally nailed down the key addresses: &lt;code&gt;0x8129A3EA&lt;/code&gt; for the speaker's name and &lt;code&gt;0x81298360&lt;/code&gt; for the dialogue buffer. I could now reliably read who was talking and, more importantly, write data back to the dialogue box.
		&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What About the GameCube Broadband Adapter? ð&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, the GameCube had an official Broadband Adapter (BBA). But Animal Crossing shipped without networking primitives, sockets, or any game-layer protocol to use it. Using the BBA here would have required building a tiny networking stack and patching the game to call it. That means: hooking engine callsites, scheduling async I/O, and handling retries/timeouts, all inside a codebase that never expected the network to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Engine hooks: Hijack safe points in the message loop to send/receive packets.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Driver/protocol: Provide a minimal UDP/RPC interface over BBA.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Robustness: Handle timeouts, retries, and partial reads without stalling animations/UI.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I chose the RAM mailbox because it's deterministic, requires zero kernel/driver work, and stays entirely within the emulator boundary, with no binary network stack needed. That said, a BBA shim is absolutely possible (and a fun future project for real hardware via Swiss + homebrew).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdint.h&amp;gt;

/* Minimal RPC envelope for a hypothetical BBA shim */
typedef struct {
    uint32_t magic;    // 'ACRP'
    uint16_t type;     // 1=Request, 2=Response
    uint16_t length;   // payload length
    uint8_t  payload[512];
} RpcMsg;

int ac_net_send(const RpcMsg* msg);         // sends via BBA
int ac_net_recv(RpcMsg* out, int timeoutMs); // polls with timeout
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import socket, json
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
sock.bind(("0.0.0.0", 19135))
while True:
    data, addr = sock.recvfrom(2048)
    msg = json.loads(data.decode("utf-8", "ignore"))
    # ... call Writer/Director LLMs ...
    reply = json.dumps({"ok": True, "text": "Hi from the cloud!"}).encode()
    sock.sendto(reply, addr)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Speaking the Game's Secret Language ð¤«&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I eagerly tried writing "Hello World" to the dialogue address and... the game froze. The character animations kept playing, but the dialogue wouldn't advance. I was so close, yet so far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem was that I was sending plain text. Animal Crossing doesn't speak plain text. It speaks its own encoded language filled with control codes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Think of it like HTML. Your browser doesn't just display words; it interprets tags like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to make text bold. Animal Crossing does the same. A special prefix byte, &lt;code&gt;CHAR_CONTROL_CODE&lt;/code&gt;, tells the game engine, "The next byte isn't a character, it's a command!"
		&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; These commands control everything: text color, pauses, sound effects, character emotions, and even the end of a conversation. If you don't send the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;End Conversation&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; control code, the game simply waits forever for a command that never comes. That's why it was freezing.
		&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once again, the decompilation community saved me. They had already documented most of these codes. I just needed to build the tools to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote an encoder and a decoder in Python. The decoder could read raw game memory and translate it into a human-readable format, and the encoder could take my text with custom tags and convert it back into the exact sequence of bytes the GameCube understood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# A small sample of the control codes I had to encode/decode
CONTROL_CODES = {
    0x00: "&amp;lt;End Conversation&amp;gt;",
    0x03: "&amp;lt;Pause [{:02X}]&amp;gt;",        # e.g., &amp;lt;Pause [0A]&amp;gt; for a short pause
    0x05: "&amp;lt;Color Line [{:06X}]&amp;gt;",  # e.g., &amp;lt;Color Line [FF0000]&amp;gt; for red
    0x09: "&amp;lt;NPC Expression [Cat:{:02X}] [{}]&amp;gt;", # Trigger an emotion
    0x59: "&amp;lt;Play Sound Effect [{}]&amp;gt;",  # e.g., &amp;lt;Play Sound Effect [Happy]&amp;gt;
    0x1A: "&amp;lt;Player Name&amp;gt;",
    0x1C: "&amp;lt;Catchphrase&amp;gt;",
}

# The magic byte that signals a command is coming
PREFIX_BYTE = 0x7F
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With my new encoder, I tried again. This time, I wasn't just sending text. I was speaking the game's language. And it worked. The hardest part of the hack was done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building the AI Brain ð§&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the communication channel established, it was time for the fun part: building the AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My initial approach was to have a single LLM do everything: write dialogue, stay in character, and insert the technical control codes. The results were a mess. The AI was trying to be a creative writer and a technical programmer simultaneously and was bad at both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution was to split the task into a two-model pipeline: a Writer and a Director.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Writer AI: This model's only job is to be creative. It receives a detailed character sheet (which I generated by scraping the Animal Crossing Fan Wiki) and focuses on writing dialogue that is funny, in-character, and relevant to the context.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Director AI: This model receives the pure text from the Writer. Its job is purely technical. It reads the dialogue and decides how to "shoot the scene." It adds pauses for dramatic effect, emphasizes words with color, and chooses the perfect facial expression or sound effect to match the mood.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This separation of concerns worked perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Emergent Behavior ð¤ª&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First I piped in a lightweight news feed. Within minutes, villagers began weaving headlines into small talk, no prompts, just context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I gave them a tiny shared memory for gossip, who said what, to whom, and how they felt. Predictably, it escalated into an anti-Tom Nook movement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I was reminded that I used Fox News as the news feed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now the game is a strange, hilarious, and slightly unsettling :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; All the code for this project, including the memory interface, dialogue encoder, and AI prompting logic, is available on GitHub. It was one of the most challenging and rewarding projects I've ever tackled, blending reverse engineering, AI, and a deep love for a classic game.&lt;lb/&gt; Watch the full video: Modern AI in a 24-Year-Old Game &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple Docker container app which allows connecting existing WireGuard servers to the Tailscale network, in case the device running WireGuard is locked in and/or does not support Tailscale binaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The network topology will look roughly like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;  +---------+
  | device1 |\
  +---------+ \                      VPS
  +---------+  \ +---------+    +-----------+      +-----------+
  | device2 |----| tailnet |----| TailGuard |&amp;lt;----&amp;gt;| WireGuard |
  +---------+  / +---------+    +-----------+      +-----------+
  +---------+ /
  | device3 |/
  +---------+
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As usual, the tailnet is virtual and in reality connections are point-to-point, but all connections to WireGuard are tunneled through the TailGuard server with a fixed and persistent connection. As long as you have access to a server as close to the WireGuard server as possible (ideally with a minimal ping), for example a VPS, you can connect any WireGuard device to your tailnet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why would you want to do this? For most use cases it may be easier to connect your device with WireGuard directly, but there are a couple of benefits with this bridged approach:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the WireGuard tunnel private key is stored only on a single machine, making the key management less work&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;if you have a new device, you can simply log in to your tailnet with SSO, without having to transfer keys&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;it's easier to switch between exit nodes in your tailnet, without having to reconnect to different VPNs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;you can have access to both your tailnet and WireGuard concurrently on your mobile device, which doesn't support multiple VPNs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;you can connect your home network to your tailnet using your router, which only supports WireGuard but not Tailscale&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simplest way to start TailGuard is to simply download a WireGuard client config and save it as &lt;code&gt;wg0.conf&lt;/code&gt;. After that you can create an IPv6 network
(optional, but recommended) and start the container:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;docker network create --ipv6 ip6net
docker run -it \
  -v ./wg0.conf:/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf -v ./state:/tailguard/state \
  --cap-add NET_ADMIN --device /dev/net/tun \
  --sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1 \
  --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1 \
  --network ip6net -p 41641:41641/udp \
  --name tailguard juhovh/tailguard:latest
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Docker will print you an URL where you need to log in to your tailnet, and after that you should be good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to build the latest version of the image yourself, it might be best to use &lt;code&gt;docker compose&lt;/code&gt;. In that case you should store the &lt;code&gt;wg0.conf&lt;/code&gt; file under
&lt;code&gt;config/&lt;/code&gt;, build the latest image with &lt;code&gt;docker compose build&lt;/code&gt; and finally run it
with &lt;code&gt;docker compose up&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's it, happy networking!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's imagine you have a WireGuard server running on 10.1.0.1 that is able to accept any routes, and its local LAN network is 192.168.8.0/24. You have already downloaded the WireGuard client config for this tunnel and saved it. Make sure that the subnet 192.168.8.0/24 is explicitly mentioned in the AllowedIPs section in addition to 0.0.0.0/0, for TailGuard to pick it up. It should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[Interface]
PrivateKey = &amp;lt;REDACTED&amp;gt;
Address = 10.1.0.2/24,fd00:ed7c:a960:6e9b::2/64
DNS = 10.1.0.1,fd00:ed7c:a960:6e9b::1
MTU = 1420

[Peer]
PublicKey = &amp;lt;REDACTED&amp;gt;
PresharedKey = &amp;lt;REDACTED&amp;gt;
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0, 192.168.8.0/24
Endpoint = &amp;lt;REDACTED&amp;gt;:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 25
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next you can either add &lt;code&gt;-e TS_DEST_IP=10.1.0.1&lt;/code&gt; if running directly, or open
the docker-compose.yml and modify it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    environment:
      - TS_DEST_IP=10.1.0.1
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will use the device wg0 and therefore the wg0.conf file for WireGuard. It will connect to the tailnet, forward all connections targeting itself to the router behind the tunnel, advertise the "192.168.8.0/24" route to other tailnet hosts, advertise itself as an exit node, and authenticate with the given authkey.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supported configuration parameters through environment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;WG_DEVICE&lt;/code&gt;- WireGuard device name, must be valid and match config file name (default: wg0)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;TS_DEVICE&lt;/code&gt;- Tailscale device name, must be a valid device name (default: tailscale0)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;TS_PORT&lt;/code&gt;- Tailscale port number, should be exposed by Docker (default: 41641)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;TS_AUTHKEY&lt;/code&gt;- Tailscale auth key for authentication if used&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;TS_DEST_IP&lt;/code&gt;- Destination IP to route Tailscale traffic to&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;TS_HOSTNAME&lt;/code&gt;- Tailscale hostname for this device if used&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike Tailscale, WireGuard itself does not handle any routing. Therefore, the WireGuard subnets and routes are automatically advertised on the Tailscale network, but it doesn't work the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's say your TailGuard node has IP addresses &lt;code&gt;10.1.0.2&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;fd00:ed7c:a960:6e9b::2&lt;/code&gt; for the WireGuard tunnel, like in the above config. You
likely want to add at least routes &lt;code&gt;100.64.0.0/10&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48&lt;/code&gt;
(Tailscale private address spaces) to be routed through &lt;code&gt;10.1.0.2&lt;/code&gt;. You can do
this with something along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ip route add 100.64.0.0/10 via 10.1.0.2 dev wgserver
ip route add fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48 via fd00:ed7c:a960:6e9b::2 dev wgserver
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have additional subnets in your tailnet (e.g. &lt;code&gt;192.168.1.0/24&lt;/code&gt;) that
you'd like to access, just add similar routing rules for those. TailGuard should
take care of forwarding all the published subnets to the tailnet, as long as it
is able to receive packets through the WireGuard tunnel first.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This report is based on 114,970 responses to our Annual Literacy Survey from children and young people aged 5 to 18 in early 2025. It includes findings on reading enjoyment, frequency and motivation and explores responses by age, gender, socio-economic background and geographical region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our surveys show that the reading crisis persists, with the number of children and young people who say they enjoy reading, and read daily, continuing to decline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Key findings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reading enjoyment:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2025, the percentage of children and young people who told us they enjoyed reading was its lowest in 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Just 1 in 3 (32.7%) children and young people aged 8 to 18 said that they enjoyed reading in their free time in 2025. This marks a 36% decrease in reading enjoyment levels since we started asking about this in 2005.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The drop in reading enjoyment over the last year has been especially steep among primary-aged children and boys, particularly boys aged 11 to 16.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reading frequency:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fewer than 1 in 5 (18.7%) 8- to 18-year-olds told us that they read something daily in their free time in 2025, again, the lowest levels we've recorded, with daily reading levels decreasing by nearly 20 percentage points since 2005.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Even among children aged 5 to 8, daily reading rates dropped by 3.4 percentage points in the past year to 44.5%, and have dropped by 9.1 percentage points since we started asking this age group in 2019.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Girls continue to read daily at higher rates than boys, with the gender gap widening to 6.2 percentage points – the largest seen since 2023. More children not receiving FSMs read daily (19.4%) than those who receive FSMs (15.8%).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What would motivate children and young people to read (8 to 18)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An important way to address the decline in reading enjoyment and frequency is to shed light on what drives or deters reading among children and young people, particularly for those who tell us that they don’t enjoy it. In 2025:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2 in 5 children and young people were motivated to read when material related to a favourite film or TV series (38.1%) or matched their interests or hobbies (37.1%)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;3 in 10 (30.9%) were drawn in by an interesting book cover or title.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1 in 4 (26.6%) valued having the freedom to choose what they read.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Children and young people who report low levels of reading enjoyment, though less engaged, still recognise reading’s educational value (nearly half said it helps them learn new words or new things). Many also chose to read song lyrics, news articles, fiction, comics and fan fiction in their free time, highlighting how we might re-engage this group with reading. Findings suggest that this group would benefit from reading being aligned with personal interests and other media that children and young people already recognise as part of their cultural life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the number of passenger vehicles rising across Europe, cities are grappling with air pollution, traffic accidents, and the loss of public space. In Spain, the city of Pontevedra has managed to overcome these challenges, surpassing national air quality standards and creating safer streets. The key, according to the Galician municipality’s mayor, is an urban model that prioritises residents over cars – without imposing an outright ban on private vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a bright summer evening in Pontevedra, a Galician city in the northwest of Spain. The air is filled with a contralto accompanying a live jazz show in a corner of the big town square. A few metres away, four teenagers play soccer with an orange ball that two younger children try to touch in vain. A family takes a selfie while, seated on a nearby bench, four elderly women are engaged in a lively conversation. The intervals between one jazz piece and another are filled with the chirping of birds that are attracted to the greenery around the fountain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the images of Pontevedra from the 1990s, with lines of cars stretching as far as the eye could see, it would be very difficult to predict a future like this. But since family doctor Miguel Anxo Fernández Lores was elected mayor in 1999, the Galician city has been implementing policies that go well beyond regulating vehicles in its streets. The goal, according to the 71-year-old mayor, is to recover public space for the people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“When we reclaim public space and guarantee universal accessibility, then people have autonomy,” the mayor says. A politician of the Galician Nationalist Bloc party (Bloque Nacionalista Galego, BNG), Lores is now serving his seventh mandate and is willing to run for an eighth in 2027. Galicia is mainly and historically ruled by the right-wing Popular Party, and is the birthplace of several of its national leaders, which makes the local leftist and nationalist BNG’s long rule in Pontevedra an exception in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When we reclaim public space and guarantee universal accessibility, then people have autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In December 2022, the Spanish government approved a royal decree requiring all municipalities with more than 50,000 inhabitants to have a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) in operation. To improve air quality for citizens and reduce carbon emissions, the decree recommends measures such as restricting access for more polluting vehicles based on their environmental label and introducing traffic-restricted areas where entry charges apply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spain adopted this measure to comply with the legally binding requirements of the Paris Agreement – the international treaty on climate change – more than six years after it entered into force in November 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, since Pontevedra was already fully complying with the air quality parameters laid out in the national Law 7/2021 on Climate Change, the city council decided to take a much more ambitious step: declaring the entire urban area (about 490 hectares) as a “reduced traffic zone”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a sunny, fresh noon at the end of June in his city-centre office, Lores recalls what Pontevedra looked like when he first took up his duties: “It was literally a cars’ warehouse and people, especially those with disabilities and the elderly, couldn’t go out on the streets, because everything was occupied by vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While he speaks, the mayor mentions the 19th-century Catalan engineer Ildefons Cerdà i Sunyer, best known for the urban reform of Barcelona’s central Eixample neighbourhood, with its distinctive grid layout and symmetrical structure. Just like Cerdà, he views public space as an extension of the home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cars: a continental problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than 75 per cent of the EU population lives in urban areas, and this figure is expected to rise to approximately 83 per cent by 2050. With air pollution widely recognised as the most pressing health risk in Europe, curbing road transport emissions – responsible for 37 per cent of nitrogen oxide pollution – is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The European Union has launched a number of initiatives to encourage cities to become cleaner and healthier. One of the most notable is the Green City Accord, which invites towns with a population of 20,000 inhabitants or more to commit to improvements in areas such as air and water quality, noise reduction, biodiversity conservation, and advancing towards a circular economy. The initiative also calls on cities to connect with a wider European network to facilitate knowledge sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another initiative is the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities EU Mission, which is supporting 100 cities in the EU and 12 in countries associated with the Horizon Europe programme. The goal of the mission is to develop a pilot project to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. The solutions and models tested in these cities could then serve as an example, helping all European cities to follow suit by 2050, the year by which the EU has committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also informal initiatives such as the Ciudades que caminan (“Walking Cities”) network in Spain, which is a non-profit open to city councils and other public administrations committed to walkability. The network provides participant cities with training and a forum for the exchange of information and experiences. It includes an online school of public space, and is responsible for managing and promoting Entornos escolares (“school environments”), Spain’s most important website dedicated to promoting child autonomy and urban mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, in spite of both top-down and bottom-up initiatives, the number of cars in our continent is growing: in 2024, the number of vehicles in the European Union exceeded 259 million, an increase of 5.9 per cent as compared to 2019. The country with the highest motorisation rate – that is, the number of cars per 1,000 inhabitants – is Italy (701), followed by Luxembourg (670) and Finland (666 cars). With a rate of 544 (although this is based on provisional data), Spain is below the EU average of 576.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Defying the norm&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in Pontevedra, the number of cars has consistently diminished in recent years. The city has also introduced regulations both restricting the purposes for which cars may circulate and adjusting the times when they are permitted to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When asked to name one of the best examples of what his administration has achieved in terms of prioritising pedestrians over vehicles, the mayor does not hesitate to mention the transformation of one of the main squares in Pontevedra. Next to the remains of the 14th-century Gothic convent of Santo Domingo lies the wide Praza de España, regarded as the city’s “kilometre zero” – the starting point of its main natural and historical routes. Nowadays, the site serves as a lively hub where on any summer day walkers, drawn by the frequent cultural events hosted in the city, meet with pilgrims of the St. James’ Way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lores points out that at the end of the 1990s, about 26,000 cars passed by this square every day. Remarkably, many of these vehicles were simply trying to reach destinations out of town, such as the beaches of Sanxenxo – a touristic municipality some 30 kilometres away, as well as the mayor’s birthplace – and to do so they passed through Praza de España. But today, transit traffic and circling for parking are not allowed anywhere in the city, and according to Lores, only 800 cars reach the square on a daily basis. As he explains, the decision to prohibit passing traffic and divert it to beltways has led to a 40-per cent reduction in the city’s overall traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only “necessary traffic” is allowed in Pontevedra: vehicles used for emergency and public safety, public services (including garbage and water trucks, etc.), transportation of people with reduced mobility, and accessing private garages are permitted 24/7. However, loading and unloading for commercial supplies, home delivery, transporting bulky objects, and house moving and related activities, are permitted only during certain hours. Free parking spaces are scattered all over the city so that people can temporarily stop while carrying out any of these activities. In case of violations, police have the option to issue fines of up to several hundred euros.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There is no place in town that can’t be reached by car, but only by those who need to, not those who feel like it,” Lores explains. And with his characteristic tone, direct yet polite, he adds: “The fact that you park your private car in a public space is crazy: if you don’t have room for your freezer, do you put it on the sidewalk?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the order of priorities, all cars, including electric ones, come last in Pontevedra: “The entire pyramid of preferences was changed: pedestrians come first, then bicycles, scooters, public transportation, and only lastly private transportation.” Inspired by Jane Jacobs’ 1961 book The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Lores has placed maintaining a “compact city” at the heart of his administration’s policies on urban expansion: concentrating most activities in the city centre, discouraging large department stores on the outskirts, encouraging mixed-use neighbourhoods instead of single-purpose zones (such as a separate ‘city of justice’), like Barcelona’s law courts complex and improving public transport. The aim is not only to reduce unnecessary car travel, but also to bring life to neighbourhoods and strengthen social cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The entire pyramid of preferences was changed: pedestrians come first, then bicycles, scooters, public transportation, and only lastly private transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wandering through the downtown area on any working day, it is surprising to see the large number and diversity of shops, especially for a provincial city. Local boutiques, jewellers, florists, and bookstores all thrive side by side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to the Galician municipality, some other European cities are also taking steps towards more sustainability. Freiburg, for instance, is well known for its sustainable policies, including its regulation of car traffic. In the vibrant university city in southwest Germany, the urban planning process involves local people, bikes account for about 30 per cent of all journeys, and one district – Vauban – is almost entirely car-free. Moreover, in 2019, Oslo became the first European capital to completely ban cars in its central areas. The city has expanded the public transportation network and eliminated hundreds of parking spaces, replacing them with benches, green spaces, and bike paths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Pontevedra, pedestrians clearly take precedence in the centre – and in roughly a third of the city overall. There, the roads and the sidewalks are indistinguishable. For those who see it for the first time, it is startling to witness people walking in the middle of the street, apparently unconcerned, while cars slowly wait behind them until they spontaneously move and let them pass. No one honks; no traffic light is there to tell people when they can or can’t move. And no parking is allowed in the whole area between 6 PM and 8 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the rest of the city, streets are single-track roads with wide sidewalks. Cars can stop during working hours for a limited time (15 minutes for services and 30 for loading and unloading), and parking is allowed between 9 PM and 9 AM. Traffic lights can only be found on the two-lane avenues on the city’s external ring, where pedestrian overpasses and roundabouts remind vehicles to slow down. Only ten minutes away from the city centre, an open-air parking area offers an alternative to the roughly 4,500 private underground parking spaces available in the city. In total, Pontevedra has more than ten free municipal parking sites and approximately 3,500 free parking spaces, all located within a walking distance of 10-15 minutes maximum from the centre. This is especially useful for people who don’t live in the city but have to commute from surrounding areas for work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Safer, healthier, and more accessible&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2010, Pontevedra was the first Spanish city to enact a speed limit of 30 km/h on all roads in its urban territory. At present, the limit is 10 km/h in the downtown area, “but only if there is no one around”, explains Daniel Macenlle, an ex-local policeman and the current director general for protection of citizens at the city council. “If there are people, then it goes down to six.” In the rest of the centre, the maximum speed is 20 kilometres per hour, while in other neighbourhoods, vehicles can go as fast as 30.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is that there have been no fatal accidents on municipal roads for a decade. Today, according to municipality data, 73 per cent of children walk to school (including 44 per cent who go accompanied, and 29 who take the journey on their own). A 2012 study conducted in Denmark, involving 20,000 children and part of a bigger project on the links between concentration, diet, and exercise, found that those who walk or bike to school have higher concentration levels than their peers up to four hours later. &lt;lb/&gt;In Pontevedra, as in other Spanish cities like Barcelona, “school routes” have been implemented for years. These spaces with specific signposts are located around schools to offer students the option of walking to and from school, alone or in groups. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the benefits extend to all residents: overall, the number of people who choose to walk or bike in the Galician municipality has risen from 66 per cent in 2011 to 90 per cent in 2021. Moreover, today about 70 per cent of all trips take place on foot or by bicycle. The city council also estimates that, since the end of the 1990s, CO2 emissions have been reduced by approximately 67 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to know not only the distance by foot, but also the number of steps and the calories burnt to reach a location, people in Pontevedra can try to use Metrominuto.1 The synoptic map includes information about the city’s historic sites, news (e.g. on recent international studies on mobility), and service information (like national subsidies for electric cars).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though it may be assumed that geo-referenced camera checks, fines and towing in place are extensively used to ensure road rules are respected in Pontevedra, most people interviewed said that the system works simply because people find that it is convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is also true for businesses: “A city that is kind to you invites you to explore it and enjoy it. And when you walk around, you also consume,” says Andrés Martínez, 48 and owner of an optical shop in calle de la Oliva, one of the city’s more commercial streets. Andrés lives in the same building where the shop is located and parks his private car in its communal parking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A city that is kind to you invites you to explore it and enjoy it. And when you walk around, you also consume.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another resident is 57-year-old Santi Cachadas, who has been selling fish at the municipal market for 30 years. He points out a different benefit of the city’s model: “People who come to buy pick up and leave, and that means an empty space where a new client can park, and so on, which leads to more movement.” Santi lives about three kilometres away from where he works, and every morning he leaves his car in a free parking lot, built by the Lérez river, and walks for 500 metres to reach his market stall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, it must be noted that two out of five business owners interviewed for this story, one managing a newsstand and one running an eco-products shop, say that their clients often complain about the fact that they cannot find parking spots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When asked why he thinks Pontevedra’s policies have succeeded, the mayor points to several factors: clear communication and education about the city’s goals, networking “with the most proactive and dynamic people in town”, carrying out participatory processes, and the decision not to ban cars outright. And he adds: “We carried out many projects to expand sidewalks and pedestrian spaces; as soon as the project was completed, the space was automatically occupied by activities. We also allowed cars that needed it to enter, and people who had doubts were relieved.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Replicating Pontevedra’s success&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the years, the northwestern Spanish municipality has received numerous awards for its good practices, including the UN-Habitat’s 2014 Dubai International Best Practices Award for Sustainable Development for its city model centred on people, and the 2020 European Commission’s EU Urban Road Safety Award for “impressively achieving zero road deaths between 2011 and 2018”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When invited to answer whether he thinks Pontevedra’s success is exportable, Lores quickly replies that each city has to find its own model and strategy, and that every external example needs to be translated. And when asked if there is at least some lesson he believes could serve as an inspiration for other cities, and if so, for what type of city, without hesitation he states: “Changing the paradigm by moving away from a town imagined for the cars back to one for the people”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I learn about cryptographic vulnerabilities all the time, and they generally fill me with some combination of jealousy (“oh, why didn’t I think of that”) or else they impress me with the brilliance of their inventors. But there’s also another class of vulnerabilities: these are the ones that can’t possibly exist in important production software, because there’s no way anyone could still do that in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today I want to talk about one of those ridiculous ones, something Microsoft calls “low tech, high-impact”. This vulnerability isn’t particularly new; in fact the worst part about it is that it’s had a name for over a decade, and it’s existed for longer than that. I’ll bet most Windows people already know this stuff, but I only happened to learn about it today, after seeing a letter from Senator Wyden to Microsoft, describing how this vulnerability was used in the May 2024 ransomware attack on the Ascension Health hospital system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vulnerability is called Kerberoasting, and TL;DR it relies on the fact that Microsoft’s Active Directory is very, very old. And also: RC4. If you don’t already know where I’m going with this, please read on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple of updates: The folks on HN pointed out that I was using some incorrect terms in here (sorry!) and added some good notes, so I’m updating below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What’s Kerberos, and what’s Active Directory?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s Active Directory (AD) is a many-tentacled octopus that controls access to almost every network that runs Windows machines. The system uses centralized authentication servers to determine who gets access to which network resources. If an employee’s computer needs to access some network Service (a file server, say), an Active Directory server authenticates the user and helps them get securely connected to the Service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that AD is also the main barrier ensuring that attackers can’t extend their reach deeper into a corporate network. If an attacker somehow gets a toehold inside an enterprise (for example, because an employee clicks on a malicious Bing link), they should absolutely not be able to move laterally and access critical network services. That’s because any such access would require the employee’s machine to have access to specialized accounts (called “Service accounts”) with privileges to fully control those machines. A well-managed network obviously won’t allow this. This means that AD is the “guardian” that stands between most companies and total disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Active Directory is a monster dragged from the depths of time. It uses the Kerberos protocol, which was first introduced in early 1989. A lot of things have happened since 1989! In fairness to Microsoft, Active Directory itself didn’t actually debut until about 1999; but (in less fairness), large portions of its legacy cryptography from that time period appear to still be supported in AD. This is very bad, because the cryptography is exceptionally terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me get specific.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you want to obtain access to some network resource (a “Service” in AD parlance), you first contact an AD server (called a KDC) to obtain a “ticket” that you can send to the Service to authenticate. This ticket is encrypted using a long-term Service “password” established at the KDC and the Service itself, and it’s handed to the user making the call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, ideally, this Service password is not really a password at all: it’s actually a randomly-generated cryptographic key. Microsoft even has systems in place to generate and rotate these keys regularly. This means the encrypted ticket will be completely inscrutable to the user who receives it, even if they’re malicious. But occasionally network administrators will make mistakes, and one (apparently) somewhat common mistake is to set up a Service that’s connected to an ordinary user account, complete with a human-generated password.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since human passwords probably are not cryptographically strong, the tickets encrypted using them are extremely vulnerable to cracking. This is very bad, since any random user — including our hypothetical laptop malware hacker — can now obtain a copy of such a ticket, and attempt to crack the Service’s password offline by trying many candidate passwords using a dictionary attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Isn’t that cute?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;That doesn’t actually seem very cute?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s not. It’s actually a terrible design that should have been done away with decades ago. We should not build systems where any random attacker who compromises a single employee laptop can ask for a message encrypted under a critical password! This basically invites offline cracking attacks, which do not need even to be executed on the compromised laptop — they can be exported out of the network to another location and performed using GPUs and other hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a few things that can stop this attack in practice. As we noted above, if the account has a long enough (random!) password, then cracking it should be virtually impossible. Microsoft could prevent users from configuring services with weak human-generated passwords, but apparently they don’t — at least because this is something that’s happened many times (including at Ascension Health.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let’s say you did not use a strong cryptographic key as your Service’s password. Where are you?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your best hope in this case is that the encrypted tickets are extremely challenging for an attacker to crack. That’s because at this point, the only thing preventing the attacker from accessing your Service is computing power. But — and this is a very weak “but” — computing power can still be a deterrent! In the “standard” authentication mode, tickets are encrypted with AES, using a key derived using 4,096 iterations of PBKDF2 hashing, based on the Service password and a per-account salt (Update: which is not truly random salt, it’s a combination of domain and principal name.) The salt means an attacker cannot easily pre-compute a dictionary of hashed passwords, and while the PBKDF2 (plus AES) isn’t an amazing defense, it puts some limits on the number of password guesses that can be attempted in a given unit of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This page by Chick3nman gives some excellent password cracking statistics computed using an RTX 5090. It implies that a hacker can try 6.8 million candidate passwords every second, using AES-128 and PBKDF2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;So that’s not great. But also not terrible, right?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t the end of the story. In fact it’s self-evident that this is not the end of the story, because Active Directory was invented in 1999, which means at some point we’ll have to deal with RC4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing. Anytime you see cryptography born in the 1990s and yet using AES, you cannot be dealing with the original. What you’re looking at is the modernized, “upgraded” version of the original. The original probably used an abacus and witchcraft, or (failing that) at least some combination of unsalted hash functions and RC4. And here’s the worst part: it turns out that in Active Directory, when a user does not configure a Service account to use a more recent mode, then Kerberos will indeed fall back to RC4, combined with unsalted NT hashes (basically, one iteration of MD4.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main implication of using RC4 (and NT hashing) is that tickets encrypted this way become hilariously, absurdly fast to crack. According to our friend Chick3nman, the same RTX 5090 can attempt 4.18 billion (with a “b”) password guesses every second. That’s roughly 1000x faster than the AES variant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an aside, the NT hashes are not salted, which means they’re vulnerable to pre-computation attacks that involve rainbow tables. I had been meaning to write about rainbow tables recently on this blog, but had convinced myself that they mostly don’t matter, given that these ancient unsalted hash functions are going away. I guess maybe I spoke too soon?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;So what is Microsoft doing about this?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearly not enough. These “Kerberoasting” attacks have been around for ages: the technique and name is credited to Tim Medin who presented it in 2014 (and many popular blogs followed up on it) but the vulnerabilities themselves are much older. The fact that there are practical ransomware attacks using these ideas in 2024 indicates that (1) system administrators aren’t hardening things enough, but more importantly, (2) Microsoft is still not turning off the unsafe options that make these attacks possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To give some sense of where we are, in October 2024, Microsoft published a blog post on how to avoid Kerberos-based attacks (NB: I cannot say Kerberoasting again and take myself seriously).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The recommendations are all kind of dismal. They recommend that administrators should use proper automated key assignment, and if they can’t do that, then to try to pick “really good long passwords”, and if they can’t do that, to pretty please shut off RC4. But Microsoft doesn’t seem to do anything proactive, like absolutely banning obsolete legacy stuff, or being completely obnoxious and forcing admins to upgrade their weird and bad legacy configurations. Instead this all seems much more like a reluctant and half-baked bit of vulnerability management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m sure there are some reasons why this is, but I refuse to believe they’re good reasons, and Microsoft should probably try a lot harder to make sure these obsolete services go away. It isn’t 1999 anymore, and it isn’t even 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don’t believe me on these points, go ask Ascension Health.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My kids love “Frozen”. They can sing every word, re-enact every scene, and provide detailed notes on the proper sparkle of Elsa’s ice dress. I’ve seen the movie more times than I can recount, to the point where, if you’ve seen me do any live coding, you’ve probably seen my subconscious incorporate an Arendelle reference or two. After so many viewings, I began paying closer attention to the details, like how at the very beginning of the film the ice harvesters are singing a song that subtly foreshadows the story’s central conflicts, the characters’ journeys, and even the key to resolving the climax. I’m slightly ashamed to admit I didn’t comprehend this connection until viewing number ten or so, at which point I also realized I had no idea if this ice harvesting was actually “a thing” or if it was just a clever vehicle for Disney to spin a yarn. Turns out, as I subsequently researched, it’s quite real.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 19th century, before refrigeration, ice was an incredibly valuable commodity. Winters in the northern United States turned ponds and lakes into seasonal gold mines. The most successful operations ran with precision: workers cleared snow from the surface so the ice would grow thicker and stronger, and they scored the surface into perfect rectangles using horse-drawn plows, turning the lake into a frozen checkerboard. Once the grid was cut, teams with long saws worked to free uniform blocks weighing several hundred pounds each. These blocks were floated along channels of open water toward the shore, at which point men with poles levered the blocks up ramps and hauled them into storage. Basically, what the movie shows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The storage itself was an art. Massive wooden ice houses, sometimes holding tens of thousands of tons, were lined with insulation, typically straw. Done well, this insulation could keep the ice solid for months, even through summer heat. Done poorly, you would open the doors to slush. And for those moving ice over long distances, typically by ship, every degree, every crack in the insulation, every extra day in transit meant more melting and more loss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter Frederic Tudor, the “Ice King” of Boston. He was obsessed with systemic efficiency. Where competitors saw unavoidable loss, Tudor saw a solvable problem. After experimenting with different insulators, he leaned on cheap sawdust, a lumber mill byproduct that outperformed straw, packing it densely around the ice to cut melt losses significantly. For harvesting efficiency, his operations adopted Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth’s grid-scoring system, which produced uniform blocks that could be packed tightly, minimizing air gaps that would otherwise increase exposure in a ship’s hold. And to shorten the critical time between shore and ship, Tudor built out port infrastructure and depots near docks, allowing ships to load and unload much faster. Each change, from tools to ice house design to logistics, amplified the last, turning a risky local harvest into a reliable global trade. With Tudor’s enhancements, he had solid ice arriving in places like Havana, Rio de Janeiro, and even Calcutta (a voyage of four months in the 1830s). His performance gains allowed the product to survive journeys that were previously unthinkable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What made Tudor’s ice last halfway around the world wasn’t one big idea. It was a plethora of small improvements, each multiplying the effect of the last. In software development, the same principle holds: big leaps forward in performance rarely come from a single sweeping change, rather from hundreds or thousands of targeted optimizations that compound into something transformative. .NET 10’s performance story isn’t about one Disney-esque magical idea; it’s about carefully shaving off nanoseconds here and tens of bytes there, streamlining operations that are executed trillions of times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the rest of this post, just as we did in Performance Improvements in .NET 9, .NET 8, .NET 7, .NET 6, .NET 5, .NET Core 3.0, .NET Core 2.1, and .NET Core 2.0, we’ll dig into hundreds of the small but meaningful and compounding performance improvements since .NET 9 that make up .NET 10’s story (if you instead stay on LTS releases and thus are upgrading from .NET 8 instead of from .NET 9, you’ll see even more improvements based on the aggregation from all the improvements in .NET 9 as well). So, without further ado, go grab a cup of your favorite hot beverage (or, given my intro, maybe something a bit more frosty), sit back, relax, and “Let It Go”!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or, hmm, maybe, let’s push performance “Into the Unknown”?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let .NET 10 performance “Show Yourself”?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Do You Want To Build a &lt;del&gt;Snowman&lt;/del&gt; Fast Service?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll see myself out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benchmarking Setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As in previous posts, this tour is chock full of micro-benchmarks intended to showcase various performance improvements. Most of these benchmarks are implemented using BenchmarkDotNet 0.15.2, with a simple setup for each.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To follow along, make sure you have .NET 9 and .NET 10 installed, as most of the benchmarks compare the same test running on each. Then, create a new C# project in a new &lt;code&gt;benchmarks&lt;/code&gt; directory:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dotnet new console -o benchmarks&amp;#13;
cd benchmarks&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That will produce two files in the &lt;code&gt;benchmarks&lt;/code&gt; directory: &lt;code&gt;benchmarks.csproj&lt;/code&gt;, which is the project file with information about how the application should be compiled, and &lt;code&gt;Program.cs&lt;/code&gt;, which contains the code for the application. Finally, replace everything in &lt;code&gt;benchmarks.csproj&lt;/code&gt; with this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
  &amp;lt;PropertyGroup&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;OutputType&amp;gt;Exe&amp;lt;/OutputType&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;TargetFrameworks&amp;gt;net10.0;net9.0&amp;lt;/TargetFrameworks&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;LangVersion&amp;gt;Preview&amp;lt;/LangVersion&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;ImplicitUsings&amp;gt;enable&amp;lt;/ImplicitUsings&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;Nullable&amp;gt;enable&amp;lt;/Nullable&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;ServerGarbageCollection&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/ServerGarbageCollection&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
  &amp;lt;/PropertyGroup&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
  &amp;lt;ItemGroup&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;PackageReference Include="BenchmarkDotNet" Version="0.15.2" /&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
  &amp;lt;/ItemGroup&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&amp;lt;/Project&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that, we’re good to go. Unless otherwise noted, I’ve tried to make each benchmark standalone; just copy/paste its whole contents into the Program.cs file, overwriting everything that’s there, and then run the benchmarks. Each test includes at its top a comment for the &lt;code&gt;dotnet&lt;/code&gt; command to use to run the benchmark. It’s typically something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;which will run the benchmark in release on both .NET 9 and .NET 10 and show the compared results. The other common variation, used when the benchmark should only be run on .NET 10 (typically because it’s comparing two approaches rather than comparing one thing on two versions), is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout the post, I’ve shown many benchmarks and the results I received from running them. Unless otherwise stated (e.g. because I’m demonstrating an OS-specific improvement), the results shown are from running them on Linux (Ubuntu 24.04.1) on an x64 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;BenchmarkDotNet v0.15.2, Linux Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS (Noble Numbat)&amp;#13;
11th Gen Intel Core i9-11950H 2.60GHz, 1 CPU, 16 logical and 8 physical cores&amp;#13;
.NET SDK 10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107&amp;#13;
  [Host]     : .NET 9.0.9 (9.0.925.41916), X64 RyuJIT AVX-512F+CD+BW+DQ+VL+VBMI&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As always, a quick disclaimer: these are micro-benchmarks, timing operations so short you’d miss them by blinking (but when such operations run millions of times, the savings really add up). The exact numbers you get will depend on your hardware, your operating system, what else your machine is juggling at the moment, how much coffee you’ve had since breakfast, and perhaps whether Mercury is in retrograde. In other words, don’t expect your results to match mine exactly, but I’ve picked tests that should still be reasonably reproducible in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, let’s start at the bottom of the stack. Code generation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;JIT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among all areas of .NET, the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler stands out as one of the most impactful. Every .NET application, whether a small console tool or a large-scale enterprise service, ultimately relies on the JIT to turn intermediate language (IL) code into optimized machine code. Any enhancement to the JIT’s generated code quality has a ripple effect, improving performance across the entire ecosystem without requiring developers to change any of their own code or even recompile their C#. And with .NET 10, there’s no shortage of these improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Deabstraction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with many languages, .NET historically has had an “abstraction penalty,” those extra allocations and indirections that can occur when using high-level language features like interfaces, iterators, and delegates. Each year, the JIT gets better and better at optimizing away layers of abstraction, so that developers get to write simple code and still get great performance. .NET 10 continues this tradition. The result is that idiomatic C# (using interfaces, &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; loops, lambdas, etc.) runs even closer to the raw speed of meticulously crafted and hand-tuned code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Object Stack Allocation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting areas of deabstraction progress in .NET 10 is the expanded use of escape analysis to enable stack allocation of objects. Escape analysis is a compiler technique to determine whether an object allocated in a method escapes that method, meaning determining whether that object is reachable after the method returns (for example, by being stored in a field or returned to the caller) or used in some way that the runtime can’t track within the method (like passed to an unknown callee). If the compiler can prove an object doesn’t escape, then that object’s lifetime is bounded by the method, and it can be allocated on the stack instead of on the heap. Stack allocation is much cheaper (just pointer bumping for allocation and automatic freeing when the method exits) and reduces GC pressure because, well, the object doesn’t need to be tracked by the GC. .NET 9 had already introduced some limited escape analysis and stack allocation support; .NET 10 takes this significantly further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#115172 teaches the JIT how to perform escape analysis related to delegates, and in particular that a delegate’s &lt;code&gt;Invoke&lt;/code&gt; method (which is implemented by the runtime) does not stash away the &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; reference. Then if escape analysis can prove that the delegate’s object reference is something that otherwise hasn’t escaped, the delegate can effectively evaporate. Consider this benchmark:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;

    {&amp;#13;

        return DoubleResult(addY, y);&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    private int DoubleResult(Func&amp;lt;int, int&amp;gt; func, int arg)&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        int result = func(arg);&amp;#13;
        return result + result;&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we just run this benchmark and compare .NET 9 and .NET 10, we can immediately tell something interesting is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The C# code for &lt;code&gt;Sum&lt;/code&gt; belies complicated code generation by the C# compiler. It needs to create a &lt;code&gt;Func&amp;lt;int, int&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which is “closing over” the &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; “local”. That means the compiler needs to “lift” &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; to no longer be an actual local, and instead live as a field on an object; the delegate can then point to a method on that object, giving it access to &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;. This is approximately what the IL generated by the C# compiler looks like when decompiled to C#:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;public int Sum(int y)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    &amp;lt;&amp;gt;c__DisplayClass0_0 c = new();&amp;#13;
    c.y = y;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    Func&amp;lt;int, int&amp;gt; func = new(c.&amp;lt;Sum&amp;gt;b__0);&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    return DoubleResult(func, c.y);&amp;#13;
}&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
private sealed class &amp;lt;&amp;gt;c__DisplayClass0_0&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    public int y;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    internal int &amp;lt;Sum&amp;gt;b__0(int x) =&amp;gt; x + y;&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From that, we can see the closure is resulting in two allocations: an allocation for the “display class” (what the C# compiler calls these closure types) and an allocation for the delegate that points to the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Sum&amp;gt;b__0&lt;/code&gt; method on that display class instance. That’s what’s accounting for the &lt;code&gt;88&lt;/code&gt; bytes of allocation in the .NET 9 results: the display class is 24 bytes, and the delegate is 64 bytes. In the .NET 10 version, though, we only see a 24 byte allocation; that’s because the JIT has successfully elided the delegate allocation. Here is the resulting assembly code:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In both .NET 9 and .NET 10, the JIT successfully inlined &lt;code&gt;DoubleResult&lt;/code&gt;, such that the delegate doesn’t escape, but then in .NET 10, it’s able to stack allocate it. Woo hoo! There’s obviously still future opportunity here, as the JIT doesn’t elide the allocation of the closure object, but that should be addressable with some more effort, hopefully in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#104906 from @hez2010 and dotnet/runtime#112250 extend this kind of analysis and stack allocation to arrays. How many times have you written code like this?&lt;/p&gt;

}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some method I want to call accepts an array of inputs and does something for each input. I need to allocate an array to pass my inputs in, either explicitly, or maybe implicitly due to using &lt;code&gt;params&lt;/code&gt; or a collection expression. Ideally moving forward there would be an overload of such a &lt;code&gt;Process&lt;/code&gt; method that accepted a &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; instead of a &lt;code&gt;string[]&lt;/code&gt;, and I could then avoid the allocation by construction. But for all of these cases where I’m forced to create an array, .NET 10 comes to the rescue.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The JIT was able to inline &lt;code&gt;Process&lt;/code&gt;, see that the array never leaves the frame, and stack allocate it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, now that we’re able to stack allocate arrays, we also want to be able to deal with a common way those arrays are used: via spans. dotnet/runtime#113977 and dotnet/runtime#116124 teach escape analysis to be able to reason about the fields in structs, which includes &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, as it’s “just” a struct that stores a &lt;code&gt;ref T&lt;/code&gt; field and an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; length field.&lt;/p&gt;

}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, we’re using &lt;code&gt;BitConverter.GetBytes&lt;/code&gt;, which allocates a &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt; containing the bytes from the input (in this case, it’ll be a four-byte array for the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;), then we slice off three of the four bytes, and we copy them to the destination span.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;–&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.00&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In .NET 9, we get the 32-byte allocation we’d expect for the &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;GetBytes&lt;/code&gt; (every object on 64-bit is at least 24 bytes, which will include the four bytes for the array’s length, and then the four bytes for the data will be in slots 24-27, and the size will be padded up to the next word boundary, for 32). In .NET 10, with &lt;code&gt;GetBytes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;AsSpan&lt;/code&gt; inlined, the JIT can see that the array doesn’t escape, and a stack allocated version of it can be used to seed the span, just as if it were created from any other stack allocation (like &lt;code&gt;stackalloc&lt;/code&gt;). (This case also needed a little help from dotnet/runtime#113093, which taught the JIT that certain span operations, like the &lt;code&gt;Memmove&lt;/code&gt; used internally by &lt;code&gt;CopyTo&lt;/code&gt;, are non-escaping.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Devirtualization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interfaces and virtual methods are a critical aspect of .NET and the abstractions it enables. Being able to unwind these abstractions and “devirtualize” is then an important job for the JIT, which has taken notable leaps in capabilities here in .NET 10.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While arrays are one of the most central features provided by C# and .NET, and while the JIT exerts a lot of energy and does a great job optimizing many aspects of arrays, one area in particular has caused it pain: an array’s interface implementations. The runtime manufactures a bunch of interface implementations for &lt;code&gt;T[]&lt;/code&gt;, and because they’re implemented differently from literally every other interface implementation in .NET, the JIT hasn’t been able to apply the same devirtualization capabilities it’s applied elsewhere. And, for anyone who’s dived deep into micro-benchmarks, this can lead to some odd observations. Here’s a performance comparison between iterating over a &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlyCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; using a &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; loop (going through its enumerator) and using a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop (indexing on each element).&lt;/p&gt;

        return sum;&amp;#13;

}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When asked “which of these will be faster”, the obvious answer is “&lt;code&gt;SumForLoop&lt;/code&gt;“. After all, &lt;code&gt;SumEnumerable&lt;/code&gt; is going to allocate an enumerator and has to make twice the number of interface calls (&lt;code&gt;MoveNext&lt;/code&gt;+&lt;code&gt;Current&lt;/code&gt; per iteration vs &lt;code&gt;this[int]&lt;/code&gt; per iteration). As it turns out, the obvious answer is also wrong. Here are the timings on my machine for .NET 9:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Method&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Mean&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SumEnumerable&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;949.5 ns&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SumForLoop&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1,932.7 ns&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What the what?? If I change the &lt;code&gt;ToArray&lt;/code&gt; to instead be &lt;code&gt;ToList&lt;/code&gt;, however, the numbers are much more in line with our expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Method&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Mean&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SumEnumerable&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1,542.0 ns&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SumForLoop&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;894.1 ns&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what’s going on here? It’s super subtle. First, it’s necessary to know that &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlyCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; just wraps an arbitrary &lt;code&gt;IList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlyCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;‘s &lt;code&gt;GetEnumerator()&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;_list.GetEnumerator()&lt;/code&gt; (I’m ignoring for this discussion the special-case where the list is empty), and &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlyCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;‘s indexer just indexes into the &lt;code&gt;IList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;‘s indexer. So far presumably this all sounds like what you’d expect. But where things gets interesting is around what the JIT is able to devirtualize. In .NET 9, it struggles to devirtualize calls to the interface implementations specifically on &lt;code&gt;T[]&lt;/code&gt;, so it won’t devirtualize either the &lt;code&gt;_list.GetEnumerator()&lt;/code&gt; call nor the &lt;code&gt;_list[index]&lt;/code&gt; call. However, the enumerator that’s returned is just a normal type that implements &lt;code&gt;IEnumerator&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and the JIT has no problem devirtualizing its &lt;code&gt;MoveNext&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Current&lt;/code&gt; members. Which means that we’re actually paying a lot more going through the indexer, because for &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; elements, we’re having to make &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; interface calls, whereas with the enumerator, we only need the one with &lt;code&gt;GetEnumerator&lt;/code&gt; interface call and then no more after that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, this is now addressed in .NET 10. dotnet/runtime#108153, dotnet/runtime#109209, dotnet/runtime#109237, and dotnet/runtime#116771 all make it possible for the JIT to devirtualize array’s interface method implementations. Now when we run the same benchmark (reverted back to using &lt;code&gt;ToArray&lt;/code&gt;), we get results much more in line with our expectations, with both benchmarks improving from .NET 9 to .NET 10, and with &lt;code&gt;SumForLoop&lt;/code&gt; on .NET 10 being the fastest.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One of the really interesting things about this is how many libraries are implemented on the premise that it’s faster to use an &lt;code&gt;IList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;‘s indexer for iteration than it is to use its &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for iteration, and that includes &lt;code&gt;System.Linq&lt;/code&gt;. All these years, where LINQ has had specialized code paths for working with &lt;code&gt;IList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; when possible, while in many cases it’s been a welcome optimization, in some cases (such as when the concrete type is a &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlyCollection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;), it’s actually been a deoptimization.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Fixing devirtualization for array’s interface implementation then also has this transitive effect on LINQ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Guarded Devirtualization (GDV) is also improved in .NET 10, such as from dotnet/runtime#116453 and dotnet/runtime#109256. With dynamic PGO, the JIT is able to instrument a method’s compilation and then use the resulting profiling data as part of emitting an optimized version of the method. One of the things it can profile are which types are used in a virtual dispatch. If one type dominates, it can special-case that type in the code gen and emit a customized implementation specific to that type. That then enables devirtualization in that dedicated path, which is “guarded” by the relevant type check, hence “GDV”. In some cases, however, such as if a virtual call was being made in a shared generic context, GDV would not kick in. Now it will.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#110827 from @hez2010 also helps more methods to be inlined by doing another pass looking for opportunities after later phases of devirtualization. The JIT’s optimizations are split up into multiple phases; each phase can make improvements, and those improvements can expose additional opportunities. If those opportunities would only be capitalized on by a phase that already ran, they can be missed. But for phases that are relatively cheap to perform, such as doing a pass looking for additional inlining opportunities, those phases can be repeated once enough other optimization has happened that it’s likely productive to do so again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Bounds Checking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C# is a memory-safe language, an important aspect of modern programming languages. A key component of this is the inability to walk off the beginning or end of an array, string, or span. The runtime ensures that any such invalid attempt produces an exception, rather than being allowed to perform the invalid memory access. We can see what this looks like with a small benchmark:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*"&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;&amp;#13;

public partial class Tests&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    private int[] _array = new int[3];&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    [Benchmark]&amp;#13;
    public int Read() =&amp;gt; _array[2];&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a valid access: the &lt;code&gt;_array&lt;/code&gt; contains three elements, and the &lt;code&gt;Read&lt;/code&gt; method is reading its last element. However, the JIT can’t be 100% certain that this access is in bounds (something could have changed what’s in the &lt;code&gt;_array&lt;/code&gt; field to be a shorter array), and thus it needs to emit a check to ensure we’re not walking off the end of the array. Here’s what the generated assembly code for &lt;code&gt;Read&lt;/code&gt; looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; .NET 10&amp;#13;
; Tests.Read()&amp;#13;
       push      rax&amp;#13;
       mov       rax,[rdi+8]&amp;#13;
       cmp       dword ptr [rax+8],2&amp;#13;
       jbe       short M00_L00&amp;#13;
       mov       eax,[rax+18]&amp;#13;
       add       rsp,8&amp;#13;
       ret&amp;#13;
M00_L00:&amp;#13;
       call      CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL&amp;#13;
       int       3&amp;#13;
; Total bytes of code 25&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; reference is passed into the &lt;code&gt;Read&lt;/code&gt; instance method in the &lt;code&gt;rdi&lt;/code&gt; register, and the &lt;code&gt;_array&lt;/code&gt; field is at offset 8, so the &lt;code&gt;mov rax,[rdi+8]&lt;/code&gt; instruction is loading the address of the array into the &lt;code&gt;rax&lt;/code&gt; register. Then the &lt;code&gt;cmp&lt;/code&gt; is loading the value at offset 8 from that address; it so happens that’s where the length of the array is stored in the array object. So, this &lt;code&gt;cmp&lt;/code&gt; instruction is the bounds check; it’s comparing &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; against that length to ensure it’s in bounds. If the array were too short for this access, the next &lt;code&gt;jbe&lt;/code&gt; instruction would branch to the &lt;code&gt;M00_L00&lt;/code&gt; label, which calls the &lt;code&gt;CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL&lt;/code&gt; helper function that throws an &lt;code&gt;IndexOutOfRangeException&lt;/code&gt;. Any time you see this pair of &lt;code&gt;call CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;int 3&lt;/code&gt; at the end of a method, there was at least one bounds check emitted by the JIT in that method.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, we not only want safety, we also want great performance, and it’d be terrible for performance if every single read from an array (or string or span) incurred such an additional check. As such, the JIT strives to avoid emitting these checks when they’d be redundant, when it can prove by construction that the accesses are safe. For example, let me tweak my benchmark slightly, moving the array from an instance field into a &lt;code&gt;static readonly&lt;/code&gt; field:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*"&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;&amp;#13;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;&amp;#13;

{&amp;#13;
    private static readonly int[] s_array = new int[3];&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    [Benchmark]&amp;#13;
    public int Read() =&amp;gt; s_array[2];&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We now get this assembly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; .NET 10&amp;#13;
; Tests.Read()&amp;#13;
       mov       rax,705D5419FA20&amp;#13;
       mov       eax,[rax+18]&amp;#13;
       ret&amp;#13;
; Total bytes of code 14&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;static readonly&lt;/code&gt; field is immutable, arrays can’t be resized, and the JIT can guarantee that the field is initialized prior to generating the code for &lt;code&gt;Read&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore, when generating the code for &lt;code&gt;Read&lt;/code&gt;, it can know with certainty that the array is of length three, and we’re accessing the element at index two. Therefore, the specified array index is guaranteed to be within bounds, and there’s no need for a bounds check. We simply get two &lt;code&gt;mov&lt;/code&gt;s, the first &lt;code&gt;mov&lt;/code&gt; to load the address of the array (which, thanks to improvements in previous releases, is allocated on a heap that doesn’t need to be compacted such that the array lives at a fixed address), and the second &lt;code&gt;mov&lt;/code&gt; to read the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; value at the location of index two (these are &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;s, so index two lives &lt;code&gt;2 * sizeof(int) = 8&lt;/code&gt; bytes from the start of the array’s data, which itself on 64-bit is offset 16 bytes from the start of the array reference, for a total offset of 24 bytes, or in hex 0x18, hence the &lt;code&gt;rax+18&lt;/code&gt; in the disassembly).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every release of .NET, more and more opportunities are found and implemented to eschew bounds checks that were previously being generated. .NET 10 continues this trend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our first example comes from dotnet/runtime#109900, which was inspired by the implementation of &lt;code&gt;BitOperations.Log2&lt;/code&gt;. The operation has intrinsic hardware support on many architectures, and generally &lt;code&gt;BitOperations.Log2&lt;/code&gt; will use one of the hardware intrinsics available to it for a very efficient implementation (e.g. &lt;code&gt;Lscnt.LeadingZeroCount&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ArmBase.LeadingZeroCount&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;X86Base.BitScanReverse&lt;/code&gt;), however as a fallback implementation it uses a lookup table. The lookup table has 32 elements, and the operation involves computing a &lt;code&gt;uint&lt;/code&gt; value and then shifting it down by 27 in order to get the top 5 bits. Any possible result is guaranteed to be a non-negative number less than 32, but indexing into the span with that result still produced a bounds check, and, as this is a critical path, “unsafe” code (meaning code that eschews the guardrails the runtime supplies by default) was then used to avoid the bounds check.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This improvement then enabled dotnet/runtime#118560 to simplify the code in the real &lt;code&gt;Log2SoftwareFallback&lt;/code&gt;, avoiding manual use of unsafe constructs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#113790 implements a similar case, where the result of a mathematical operation is guaranteed to be in bounds. In this case, it’s the result of &lt;code&gt;Log2&lt;/code&gt;. The change teaches the JIT to understand the maximum possible value that &lt;code&gt;Log2&lt;/code&gt; could produce, and if that maximum is in bounds, then any result is guaranteed to be in bounds as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;My choice of benchmark in this case was not coincidental. This pattern shows up in the &lt;code&gt;FormattingHelpers.CountDigits&lt;/code&gt; internal method that’s used by the core primitive types in their &lt;code&gt;ToString&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TryFormat&lt;/code&gt; implementations, in order to determine how much space will be needed to store rendered digits for a number. As with the previous example, this routine is considered core enough that it was using unsafe code to avoid the bounds check. With this fix, the code was able to be changed back to using a simple span access, and even with the simpler code, it’s now also faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, consider this code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0&amp;#13;

{&amp;#13;

    [ArgumentsSource(nameof(Ids))]&amp;#13;
    public bool StartAndEndAreSame(int[] ids) =&amp;gt; ids[0] == ids[^1];&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a method that’s accepting an &lt;code&gt;int[]&lt;/code&gt; and checking to see whether it starts and ends with the same value. The JIT has no way of knowing whether the &lt;code&gt;int[]&lt;/code&gt; is empty or not, so it does need a bounds check; otherwise, accessing &lt;code&gt;ids[0]&lt;/code&gt; could walk off the end of the array. However, this is what we see on .NET 9:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; .NET 9&amp;#13;
; Tests.StartAndEndAreSame(Int32[])&amp;#13;
       push      rax&amp;#13;
       mov       eax,[rsi+8]&amp;#13;
       test      eax,eax&amp;#13;
       je        short M00_L00&amp;#13;
       mov       ecx,[rsi+10]&amp;#13;
       lea       edx,[rax-1]&amp;#13;
       cmp       edx,eax&amp;#13;
       jae       short M00_L00&amp;#13;
       mov       eax,edx&amp;#13;
       cmp       ecx,[rsi+rax*4+10]&amp;#13;
       sete      al&amp;#13;
       movzx     eax,al&amp;#13;
       add       rsp,8&amp;#13;
       ret&amp;#13;
M00_L00:&amp;#13;
       call      CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL&amp;#13;
       int       3&amp;#13;
; Total bytes of code 41&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note there are two jumps to the &lt;code&gt;M00_L00&lt;/code&gt; label that handles failed bounds checks… that’s because there are two bounds checks here, one for the start access and one for the end access. But that shouldn’t be necessary. &lt;code&gt;ids[^1]&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;ids[ids.Length - 1]&lt;/code&gt;. If the code has successfully accessed &lt;code&gt;ids[0]&lt;/code&gt;, that means the array is at least one element in length, and if it’s at least one element in length, &lt;code&gt;ids[ids.Length - 1]&lt;/code&gt; will always be in bounds. Thus, the second bounds check shouldn’t be needed. Indeed, thanks to dotnet/runtime#116105, this is what we now get on .NET 10 (one branch to &lt;code&gt;M00_L00&lt;/code&gt; instead of two):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; .NET 10&amp;#13;
; Tests.StartAndEndAreSame(Int32[])&amp;#13;
       push      rax&amp;#13;
       mov       eax,[rsi+8]&amp;#13;
       test      eax,eax&amp;#13;
       je        short M00_L00&amp;#13;
       mov       ecx,[rsi+10]&amp;#13;
       dec       eax&amp;#13;
       cmp       ecx,[rsi+rax*4+10]&amp;#13;
       sete      al&amp;#13;
       movzx     eax,al&amp;#13;
       add       rsp,8&amp;#13;
       ret&amp;#13;
M00_L00:&amp;#13;
       call      CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL&amp;#13;
       int       3&amp;#13;
; Total bytes of code 34&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s really interesting to me here is the knock-on effect of having removed the bounds check. It didn’t just eliminate the &lt;code&gt;cmp/jae&lt;/code&gt; pair of instructions that’s typical of a bounds check. The .NET 9 version of the code had this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;lea edx,[rax-1]&amp;#13;
cmp edx,eax&amp;#13;
jae short M00_L00&amp;#13;
mov eax,edx&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point in the assembly, the &lt;code&gt;rax&lt;/code&gt; register is storing the length of the array. It’s calculating &lt;code&gt;ids.Length - 1&lt;/code&gt; and storing the result into &lt;code&gt;edx&lt;/code&gt;, and then checking to see whether &lt;code&gt;ids.Length-1&lt;/code&gt; is in bounds of &lt;code&gt;ids.Length&lt;/code&gt; (the only way it wouldn’t be is if the array were empty such that &lt;code&gt;ids.Length-1&lt;/code&gt; wrapped around to &lt;code&gt;uint.MaxValue&lt;/code&gt;); if it’s not, it jumps to the fail handler, and if it is, it stores the already computed &lt;code&gt;ids.Length - 1&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt;. By removing the bounds check, we get rid of those two intervening instructions, leaving these:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;lea edx,[rax-1]&amp;#13;
mov eax,edx&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;which is a little silly, as this sequence is just computing a decrement, and as long as it’s ok that flags get modified, it could instead just be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dec eax&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;which, as you can see in the .NET 10 output, is exactly what .NET 10 now does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#115980 addresses another case. Let’s say I have this method:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;

        start.Length &amp;lt; text.Length &amp;amp;&amp;amp; text[start.Length] == '.';&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re validating that one input’s length is less than the other, and then checking to see what comes immediately after it in the other. We know that &lt;code&gt;string.Length&lt;/code&gt; is immutable, so a bounds check here is redundant, but until .NET 10, the JIT couldn’t see that.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The removal of the bounds check almost halves the size of the function. If we don’t need to do a bounds check, we get to elide the &lt;code&gt;cmp/jae&lt;/code&gt;. Without that branch, nothing is targeting &lt;code&gt;M00_L01&lt;/code&gt;, and we can remove the &lt;code&gt;call/int&lt;/code&gt; pair that were only necessary to support a bounds check. Then without the &lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;M00_L01&lt;/code&gt;, which was the only &lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt; in the whole method, the prologue and epilogue can be elided, meaning we also don’t need the opening and closing &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt; instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#113233 improved handling “assertions” (facts the JIT claims and based on which the JIT makes optimizations) to be less order dependent. In .NET 9, this code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;static bool Test(ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; span, int pos) =&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    pos &amp;gt; 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;#13;
    pos &amp;lt;= span.Length - 42 &amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;#13;
    span[pos - 1] != '\n';&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;was successfully removing the bounds check on the span access, but the following variant, which just switches the order of the first two conditions, was still incurring the bounds check.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;static bool Test(ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; span, int pos) =&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    pos &amp;lt;= span.Length - 42 &amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;#13;
    pos &amp;gt; 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp;&amp;#13;
    span[pos - 1] != '\n';&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that both conditions contribute an assertion (fact) that need to be merged in order to know the bounds check can be avoided. Now in .NET 10, the bounds check is elided, regardless of the order.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Sum&lt;/code&gt; method is trying to do manual loop unrolling. Rather than incurring a branch on each element, it’s handling four elements per iteration. Then, for the case where the length of the input isn’t evenly divisible by four, it’s handling the remaining elements in a separate loop. In .NET 9, the JIT successfully elides the bounds checks in the main unrolled loop:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You can see this in the &lt;code&gt;M00_L00&lt;/code&gt; section, which has the five &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; instructions (four for the summed elements, and one for the index). However, we still see the &lt;code&gt;CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL&lt;/code&gt; at the end, indicating this method has a bounds check. That’s coming from the final loop, due to the JIT losing track of the fact that &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is guaranteed to be non-negative. Now in .NET 10, that bounds check is removed as well (again, just look for the lack of the &lt;code&gt;CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL&lt;/code&gt; call).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another nice improvement comes from dotnet/runtime#112824, which teaches the JIT to turn facts it already learned from earlier checks into concrete numeric ranges, and then use those ranges to fold away later relational tests and bounds checks. Consider this example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;

public partial class Tests&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    private int[] _array = new int[10];&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    [Benchmark]&amp;#13;
    public void Test() =&amp;gt; SetAndSlice(_array);&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]&amp;#13;
    private static Span&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; SetAndSlice(Span&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; src)&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        src[5] = 42;&amp;#13;
        return src.Slice(4);&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have to incur a bounds check for the &lt;code&gt;src[5]&lt;/code&gt;, as the JIT has no evidence that &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; is at least six elements long. However, by the time we get to the &lt;code&gt;Slice&lt;/code&gt; call, we know the span has a length of at least six, or else writing into &lt;code&gt;src[5]&lt;/code&gt; would have failed. We can use that knowledge to remove the length check from within the &lt;code&gt;Slice&lt;/code&gt; call (note the removal of the &lt;code&gt;call qword ptr [7F8DDB3A7810]&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;int 3&lt;/code&gt; sequence, which is the manual length check and call to a throw helper method in &lt;code&gt;Slice&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Let’s look at one more, which has a very nice impact on bounds checking, even though technically the optimization is broader than just that. dotnet/runtime#113998 creates assertions from &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; targets. This means that the body of a &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; case statement inherits facts about what was switched over based on what the &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; was, e.g. in a &lt;code&gt;case 3&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;switch (x)&lt;/code&gt;, the body of that case will now “know” that &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is three. This is great for very popular patterns with arrays, strings, and spans, where developers switch over the length and then index into available indices in the appropriate branches. Consider this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0&amp;#13;

    {&amp;#13;
        switch (span.Length)&amp;#13;
        {&amp;#13;
            case 0: return 0;&amp;#13;
            case 1: return span[0];&amp;#13;
            case 2: return span[0] + span[1];&amp;#13;
            case 3: return span[0] + span[1] + span[2];&amp;#13;
            default: return -1;&amp;#13;
        }&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On .NET 9, each of those six &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; dereferences ends up with a bounds check:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You can see the tell-tale bounds check sign (&lt;code&gt;CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL&lt;/code&gt;) under &lt;code&gt;M01_L04&lt;/code&gt;, and no fewer than six jumps targeting that label, one for each &lt;code&gt;span[...]&lt;/code&gt; access. But on .NET 10, we get this:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Even if you’re not proficient at reading assembly, the pattern should still be obvious. In the C# code, we have eight writes into the array, and in the assembly code, we have eight repetitions of the same pattern: &lt;code&gt;cmp ecx,LENGTH&lt;/code&gt; to compare the length of the array against the required &lt;code&gt;LENGTH&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;jbe short M00_L00&lt;/code&gt; to jump to the &lt;code&gt;CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL&lt;/code&gt; helper if the bounds check fails, and &lt;code&gt;mov dword ptr [rax+OFFSET],VALUE&lt;/code&gt; to store &lt;code&gt;VALUE&lt;/code&gt; into the array at byte offset &lt;code&gt;OFFSET&lt;/code&gt;. Inside the &lt;code&gt;Test&lt;/code&gt; method, the JIT can’t know how long &lt;code&gt;_arr&lt;/code&gt; is, so it must include bounds checks. Moreover, it must include all of the bounds checks, rather than coalescing them, because it is forbidden from introducing behavioral changes as part of optimizations. Imagine instead if it chose to coalesce all of the bounds checks into a single check, and emitted this method as if it were the equivalent of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if (arr.Length &amp;gt;= 8)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    arr[0] = 2;&amp;#13;
    arr[1] = 3;&amp;#13;
    arr[2] = 5;&amp;#13;
    arr[3] = 8;&amp;#13;
    arr[4] = 13;&amp;#13;
    arr[5] = 21;&amp;#13;
    arr[6] = 34;&amp;#13;
    arr[7] = 55;&amp;#13;
}&amp;#13;
else&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    throw new IndexOutOfRangeException();&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, let’s say the array was actually of length four. The original program would have filled the array with values &lt;code&gt;[2, 3, 5, 8]&lt;/code&gt; before throwing an exception, but this transformed code wouldn’t (there wouldn’t be any writes to the array). That’s an observable behavioral change. An enterprising developer could of course choose to rewrite their code to avoid some of these checks, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;arr[7] = 55;&amp;#13;
arr[0] = 2;&amp;#13;
arr[1] = 3;&amp;#13;
arr[2] = 5;&amp;#13;
arr[3] = 8;&amp;#13;
arr[4] = 13;&amp;#13;
arr[5] = 21;&amp;#13;
arr[6] = 34;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By moving the last store to the beginning, the developer has given the JIT extra knowledge. The JIT can now see that if the first store succeeds, the rest are guaranteed to succeed as well, and the JIT will emit a single bounds check. But, again, that’s the developer choosing to change their program in a way the JIT must not. However, there are other things the JIT can do. Imagine the JIT chose to rewrite the method like this instead:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if (arr.Length &amp;gt;= 8)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    arr[0] = 2;&amp;#13;
    arr[1] = 3;&amp;#13;
    arr[2] = 5;&amp;#13;
    arr[3] = 8;&amp;#13;
    arr[4] = 13;&amp;#13;
    arr[5] = 21;&amp;#13;
    arr[6] = 34;&amp;#13;
    arr[7] = 55;&amp;#13;
}&amp;#13;
else&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    arr[0] = 2;&amp;#13;
    arr[1] = 3;&amp;#13;
    arr[2] = 5;&amp;#13;
    arr[3] = 8;&amp;#13;
    arr[4] = 13;&amp;#13;
    arr[5] = 21;&amp;#13;
    arr[6] = 34;&amp;#13;
    arr[7] = 55;&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To our C# sensibilities, that looks unnecessarily complicated; the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; block contain exactly the same C# code. But, knowing what we now know about how the JIT can use known length information to elide bounds checks, it starts to make a bit more sense. Here’s what the JIT emits for this variant on .NET 9:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; .NET 9&amp;#13;

    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; block is compiled to the &lt;code&gt;M00_L00&lt;/code&gt; label, which contains those same eight repeated blocks we saw earlier. But the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; block (above the &lt;code&gt;M00_L00&lt;/code&gt; label) is interesting. The only branch there is the initial &lt;code&gt;array.Length &amp;gt;= 8&lt;/code&gt; check I wrote in the C# code, emitted as the &lt;code&gt;cmp ecx,8&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;jl short M00_L00&lt;/code&gt; pair of instructions. The rest of the block is just &lt;code&gt;mov&lt;/code&gt; instructions (and you can see there are only four writes into the array rather than eight… the JIT has optimized the eight four-byte writes into four eight-byte writes). In our rewrite, we’ve manually cloned the code, so that in what we expect to be the vast, vast, vast majority case (presumably we wouldn’t have written the array writes in the first place if we thought they’d fail), we only incur the single length check, and then we have our “hopefully this is never needed” fallback case for the rare situation where it is. Of course, you shouldn’t (and shouldn’t need to) do such manual cloning. But, the JIT can do such cloning for you, and does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Cloning” is an optimization long employed by the JIT, where it will do this kind of code duplication, typically of loops, when it believes that in doing so, it can heavily optimize a common case. Now in .NET 10, thanks to dotnet/runtime#112595, it can employ this same technique for these kinds of sequences of writes. Going back to our original benchmark, here’s what we now get on .NET 10:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This structure looks almost identical to what we got when we manually cloned: the JIT has emitted the same code twice, except in one case, there are no bounds checks, and in the other case, there are all the bounds checks, and a single length check determines which path to follow. Pretty neat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As noted, the JIT has been doing cloning for years, in particular for loops over arrays. However, more and more code is being written against spans instead of arrays, and unfortunately this valuable optimization didn’t apply to spans. Now with dotnet/runtime#113575, it does! We can see this with a basic looping example:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In both &lt;code&gt;WithArray&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WithSpan&lt;/code&gt;, we have the same loop, iterating from 0 to a &lt;code&gt;_count&lt;/code&gt; with an unknown relationship to the length of &lt;code&gt;_arr&lt;/code&gt;, so there has to be some kind of bounds checking emitted.

    &lt;p&gt;There’s some upfront assembly here associated with loading &lt;code&gt;_array&lt;/code&gt; into a span, loading &lt;code&gt;_count&lt;/code&gt;, and checking to see whether the count is 0 (in which case the whole loop can be skipped). Then the core of the loop is at &lt;code&gt;M00_L01&lt;/code&gt;, which is repeatedly checking &lt;code&gt;edx&lt;/code&gt; (which contains &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;) against the length of the span (in &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt;), jumping to &lt;code&gt;CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL&lt;/code&gt; if it’s an out-of-bounds access, writing &lt;code&gt;edx&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;) into the span at the next position, bumping up &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, and then jumping back to &lt;code&gt;M00_L01&lt;/code&gt; to keep iterating if &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is still less than &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; (stored in &lt;code&gt;edi&lt;/code&gt;). In other words, we have two checks per iteration: is &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; still within the bounds of the span, and is &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; still less than &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt;. Now here’s what we get on .NET 9 for &lt;code&gt;WithArray&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Here, label &lt;code&gt;M00_L02&lt;/code&gt; looks very similar to the loop we just saw in &lt;code&gt;WithSpan&lt;/code&gt;, incurring both the check against &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; and the bounds check on every iteration. But note section &lt;code&gt;M00_L00&lt;/code&gt;: it’s a clone of the same loop, still with the &lt;code&gt;cmp edx,ecx&lt;/code&gt; that checks &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; against &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; on each iteration, but no additional bounds checking in sight. The JIT has cloned the loop, specializing one to not have bounds checks, and then in the upfront section, it determines which path to follow based on a single check against the array’s length (&lt;code&gt;cmp [rax+8],ecx&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;jl short M00_L02&lt;/code&gt;). Now in .NET 10, here’s what we get for &lt;code&gt;WithSpan&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As with &lt;code&gt;WithArray&lt;/code&gt; in .NET 9, &lt;code&gt;WithSpan&lt;/code&gt; for .NET 10 has the loop cloned, with the &lt;code&gt;M00_L03&lt;/code&gt; block containing the bounds check on each iteration, and the &lt;code&gt;M00_L01&lt;/code&gt; block eliding the bounds check on each iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The JIT gains more cloning abilities in .NET 10, as well. dotnet/runtime#110020, dotnet/runtime#108604, and dotnet/runtime#110483 make it possible for the JIT to clone &lt;code&gt;try/finally&lt;/code&gt; blocks, whereas previously it would immediately bail out of cloning any regions containing such constructs. This might seem niche, but it’s actually quite valuable when you consider that &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt;‘ing over an enumerable typically involves a hidden &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; to call the enumerator’s &lt;code&gt;Dispose&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of these different optimizations interact with each other. Dynamic PGO triggers a form of cloning, as part of the guarded devirtualization (GDV) mentioned earlier: if the instrumentation data reveals that a particular virtual call is generally performed on an instance of a specific type, the JIT can clone the resulting code into one path specific to that type and another path that handles any type. That then enables the specific-type code path to devirtualize the call and possibly inline it. And if it inlines it, that then provides more opportunities for the JIT to see that an object doesn’t escape, and potentially stack allocate it. dotnet/runtime#111473, dotnet/runtime#116978, dotnet/runtime#116992, dotnet/runtime#117222, and dotnet/runtime#117295 enable that, enhancing escape analysis to determine if an object only escapes when such a generated type test fails (when the target object isn’t of the expected common type).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to pause for a moment, because my words thus far aren’t nearly enthusiastic enough to highlight the magnitude of what this enables. The &lt;code&gt;dotnet/runtime&lt;/code&gt; repo uses an automated performance analysis system which flags when benchmarks significantly improve or regress and ties those changes back to the responsible PR. This is what it looked like for this PR:

We can see why this is so good from a simple example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;

&amp;#13;

&amp;#13;
[MemoryDiagnoser(displayGenColumns: false)]&amp;#13;
[HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD")]&amp;#13;
public partial class Tests&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    private int[] _values = Enumerable.Range(1, 100).ToArray();&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    [Benchmark]&amp;#13;
    public int Sum() =&amp;gt; Sum(_values);&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]&amp;#13;
    private static int Sum(IEnumerable&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; values)&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        int sum = 0;&amp;#13;
        foreach (int value in values)&amp;#13;
        {&amp;#13;
            sum += value;&amp;#13;
        }&amp;#13;
        return sum;&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With dynamic PGO, the instrumented code for &lt;code&gt;Sum&lt;/code&gt; will see that &lt;code&gt;values&lt;/code&gt; is generally an &lt;code&gt;int[]&lt;/code&gt;, and it’ll be able to emit a specialized code path in the optimized &lt;code&gt;Sum&lt;/code&gt; implementation for when it is. And then with this ability to do conditional escape analysis, for the common path the JIT can see that the resulting &lt;code&gt;GetEnumerator&lt;/code&gt; produces an &lt;code&gt;IEnumerator&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that never escapes, such that along with all of the relevant methods being devirtualized and inlined, the enumerator can be stack allocated.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Ratio&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Allocated&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Alloc Ratio&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="6"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sum&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;.NET 9.0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;109.86 ns&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.00&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;32 B&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.00&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sum&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;.NET 10.0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;35.45 ns&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.32&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;–&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.00&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just think about how many places in your apps and services you enumerate collections like this, and you can see why it’s such an exciting improvement. Note that these cases don’t always even require PGO. Consider a case like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes;&amp;#13;
using BenchmarkDotNet.Running;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;

&amp;#13;
[MemoryDiagnoser(displayGenColumns: false)]&amp;#13;
[HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD")]&amp;#13;
public partial class Tests&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    private static readonly IEnumerable&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; s_values = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    [Benchmark]&amp;#13;
    public int Sum()&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        int sum = 0;&amp;#13;
        foreach (int value in s_values)&amp;#13;
        {&amp;#13;
            sum += value;&amp;#13;
        }&amp;#13;
        return sum;&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, the JIT can see that even though the &lt;code&gt;s_values&lt;/code&gt; is typed as &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, it’s always actually an &lt;code&gt;int[]&lt;/code&gt;. In that case, dotnet/runtime#111948 enables the return type to be retyped in the JIT as &lt;code&gt;int[]&lt;/code&gt; and the enumerator can be stack allocated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="6"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Method&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Runtime&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Mean&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Ratio&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Allocated&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Alloc Ratio&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="6"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sum&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;.NET 9.0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;16.341 ns&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.00&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;32 B&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.00&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sum&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;.NET 10.0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2.059 ns&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.13&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;–&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.00&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, too much cloning can be a bad thing, in particular as it increases code size. dotnet/runtime#108771 employs a heuristic to determine whether loops that can be cloned should be cloned; the larger the loop, the less likely it’ll be to be cloned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Inlining&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Inlining”, which replaces a call to a function with a copy of that function’s implementation, has always been a critically important optimization. It’s easy to think about the benefits of inlining as just being about avoiding the overhead of a call, and while that can be meaningful (especially when considering security mechanisms like Intel’s Control-Flow Enforcement Technology, which slightly increases the cost of calls), generally the most benefit from inlining comes from knock-on benefits. Just as a simple example, if you have code like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int i = Divide(10, 5);&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
static int Divide(int n, int d) =&amp;gt; n / d;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;if &lt;code&gt;Divide&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t get inlined, then when &lt;code&gt;Divide&lt;/code&gt; is called, it’ll need to perform the actual &lt;code&gt;idiv&lt;/code&gt;, which is a relatively expensive operation. In contrast, if &lt;code&gt;Divide&lt;/code&gt; is inlined, then the call site becomes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int i = 10 / 5;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;which can be evaluated at compile time and becomes just:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int i = 2;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More compelling examples were already seen throughout the discussion of escape analysis and stack allocation, which depend heavily on the ability to inline methods. Given the increased importance of inlining, it’s gotten even more focus in .NET 10.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the .NET work related to inlining is about enabling more kinds of things to be inlined. Historically, a variety of constructs present in a method would prevent that method from even being considered for inlining. Arguably the most well known of these is exception handling: methods with exception handling clauses, e.g. &lt;code&gt;try/catch&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;try/finally&lt;/code&gt;, would not be inlined. Even a simple method like &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; in this example:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The details of the assembly don’t matter, other than it’s a whole lot more than was there before, because we’re now looking in large part at the implementation of &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;. In addition to methods with &lt;code&gt;try/finally&lt;/code&gt; now being inlineable, other improvements have also been made around exception handling. For example, dotnet/runtime#110273 and dotnet/runtime#110464 enable the removal of &lt;code&gt;try/catch&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;try/fault&lt;/code&gt; blocks if it can prove the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block can’t possibly throw. Consider this:&lt;/p&gt;

}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s nothing the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block here can do that will result in an exception being thrown (assuming the developer hasn’t enabled checked arithmetic, in which case it could possibly throw an &lt;code&gt;OverflowException&lt;/code&gt;), yet on .NET 9 we get this assembly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; .NET 9&amp;#13;
; Tests.Test(Int32)&amp;#13;

; Total bytes of code 79&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now on .NET 10, the JIT is able to elide the &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; and remove all ceremony related to the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; because it can see that ceremony is pointless overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; .NET 10&amp;#13;
; Tests.Test(Int32)&amp;#13;
       lea       eax,[rsi+1]&amp;#13;
       ret&amp;#13;

    &lt;p&gt;That’s true even when the contents of the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; calls into other methods that are then inlined, exposing their contents to the JIT’s analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(As an aside, the JIT was already able to remove &lt;code&gt;try/finally&lt;/code&gt; when the &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; was empty, but dotnet/runtime#108003 catches even more cases of checking for empty &lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt;s again after most other optimizations have been run, in case they revealed additional empty blocks.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another example is “GVM”. Previously, any method that called a GVM, or generic virtual method (a virtual method with a generic type parameter), would be blocked from being inlined.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another area of investment with inlining is to do with the heuristics around when methods should be inlined. Just inlining everything would be bad; inlining copies code, which results in more code, which can have significant negative repercussions. For example, inlining’s increased code size puts more pressure on caches. Processors have an instruction cache, a small amount of super fast memory in a CPU that stores recently used instructions, making them really fast to access again the next time they’re needed (such as the next iteration through a loop, or the next time that same function is called). Consider a method &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;, and 100 call sites to &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; that are all being accessed. If all of those share the same instructions for &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;, because the 100 call sites are all actually calling &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;, the instruction cache will only need to load &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;‘s instructions once. If all of those 100 call sites each have their own copy of &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt;‘s instructions, then all 100 copies will separately be loaded through the cache, fighting with each other and other instructions for residence. The less likely it is that instructions are in the cache, the more likely it is that the CPU will stall waiting for the instructions to be loaded from memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this reason, the JIT needs to be careful what it inlines. It tries hard to avoid inlining anything that won’t benefit (e.g. a larger method whose instructions won’t be materially influenced by the caller’s context) while also trying hard to inline anything that will materially benefit (e.g. small functions where the code required to call the function is similar in size to the contents of the function, functions with instructions that could be materially impacted by information from the call site, etc.) As part of these heuristics, the JIT has the notion of “boosts,” where observations it makes about things methods do boost the chances of that method being inlined. dotnet/runtime#114806 gives a boost to methods that appear to be returning new arrays of a small, fixed length; if those arrays can instead be allocated in the caller’s frame, the JIT might then be able to discover they don’t escape and enable them to be stack allocated. dotnet/runtime#110596 similarly looks for boxing, as the caller could possibly instead avoid the box entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the same purpose (and also just to minimize time spent performing compilation), the JIT also maintains a budget for how much it allows to be inlined into a method compilation… once it hits that budget, it might stop inlining anything. The budgeting scheme overall works ok, however in certain circumstances it can run out of budget at very inopportune times, for example doing a lot of inlining at top-level call sites but then running out of budget by the time it gets to small methods that are critically-important to inline for good performance. To help mitigate these scenarios, dotnet/runtime#114191 and dotnet/runtime#118641 more than double the JIT’s default inlining budget.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The JIT also pays a lot of attention to the number of local variables (e.g. parameters/locals explicitly in the IL, JIT-created temporary locals, promoted struct fields, etc.) it tracks. To avoid creating too many, the JIT would stop inlining once it was already tracking 512. But as other changes have made inlining more aggressive, this (strangely hardcoded) limit gets hit more often, leaving very valuable inlinees out in the cold. dotnet/runtime#118515 removed this fixed limit and instead ties it to a large percentage of the number of locals the JIT is allowed to track (by default, this ends up almost doubling the limit used by the inliner).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Constant Folding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Constant folding is a compiler’s ability to perform operations, typically math, at compile-time rather than at run-time: given multiple constants and an expressed relationship between them, the compiler can “fold” those constants together into a new constant. So, if you have the C# code &lt;code&gt;int M(int i) =&amp;gt; i + 2 * 3;&lt;/code&gt;, the C# compiler does constant folding and emits that into your compilation as if you’d written &lt;code&gt;int M(int i) =&amp;gt; i + 6;&lt;/code&gt;. The JIT can and does also do constant folding, which is valuable especially when it’s based on information not available to the C# compiler. For example, the JIT can treat &lt;code&gt;static readonly&lt;/code&gt; fields or &lt;code&gt;IntPtr.Size&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Vector128&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.Count&lt;/code&gt; as constants. And the JIT can do folding across inlines. For example, if you have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int M1(int i) =&amp;gt; i + M2(2 * 3);&amp;#13;
int M2(int j) =&amp;gt; j * Environment.ProcessorCount;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the C# compiler will only be able to fold the &lt;code&gt;2 * 3&lt;/code&gt;, and will emit the equivalent of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int M1(int i) =&amp;gt; i + M2(6);&amp;#13;
int M2(int j) =&amp;gt; j * Environment.ProcessorCount;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;but when compiling &lt;code&gt;M1&lt;/code&gt;, the JIT can inline &lt;code&gt;M2&lt;/code&gt; and treat &lt;code&gt;ProcessorCount&lt;/code&gt; as a constant (on my machine it’s 16), and produce the following assembly code for &lt;code&gt;M1&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;That’s as if the code for &lt;code&gt;M1&lt;/code&gt; had been &lt;code&gt;public int M1(int i) =&amp;gt; i + 96;&lt;/code&gt; (the displayed assembly renders hexadecimal, so the &lt;code&gt;60&lt;/code&gt; is hexadecimal &lt;code&gt;0x60&lt;/code&gt; and thus decimal &lt;code&gt;96&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or consider:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;string M() =&amp;gt; GetString() ?? throw new Exception();&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
static string GetString() =&amp;gt; "test";&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The JIT will be able to inline &lt;code&gt;GetString&lt;/code&gt;, at which point it can see that the result is non-&lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; and can fold away the check for the &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; constant, at which point it can also dead-code eliminate the &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt;. Constant folding is useful on its own in avoiding unnecessary work, but it also often unlocks other optimizations, like dead-code elimination and bounds-check elimination. The JIT is already quite good at finding constant folding opportunities, and gets better in .NET 10. Consider this benchmark:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Of particular note are those two &lt;code&gt;test rsi,rsi&lt;/code&gt; instructions, which are &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; checks. The assembly starts by loading a value into &lt;code&gt;rax&lt;/code&gt;; that value is the address of the &lt;code&gt;""&lt;/code&gt; string literal. It then uses &lt;code&gt;test rsi,rsi&lt;/code&gt; to check whether the &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; parameter, which was passed into this instance method in the &lt;code&gt;rsi&lt;/code&gt; register, is &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;. If it is &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;cmove rsi,rax&lt;/code&gt; instruction sets it to the address of the &lt;code&gt;""&lt;/code&gt; literal. And then… it does &lt;code&gt;test rsi,rsi&lt;/code&gt; again? That second test is the &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; check at the beginning of &lt;code&gt;AsSpan&lt;/code&gt;, which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;public static ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; AsSpan(this string? text)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    if (text is null) return default;&amp;#13;
    return new ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;(ref text.GetRawStringData(), text.Length);&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now with dotnet/runtime#111985, that second &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; check, along with others, can be folded, resulting in this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; .NET 10&amp;#13;
; Tests.Test(System.String)&amp;#13;
       mov       rax,7C01C4600008&amp;#13;
       test      rsi,rsi&amp;#13;
       cmove     rsi,rax&amp;#13;
       lea       rax,[rsi+0C]&amp;#13;
       mov       edx,[rsi+8]&amp;#13;
       ret&amp;#13;
; Total bytes of code 25&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar impact comes from dotnet/runtime#108420, which is also able to fold a different class of &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; checks.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Constant folding also applies to SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data), instructions that enable processing multiple pieces of data at once rather than only one element at a time. dotnet/runtime#117099 and dotnet/runtime#117572 both enable more SIMD comparison operations to participate in folding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Code Layout&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the JIT compiler generates assembly from the IL emitted by the C# compiler, it organizes that code into “basic blocks,” a sequence of instructions with one entry point and one exit point, no jumps inside, no branches out except at the end. These blocks can then be moved around as a unit, and the order in which these blocks are placed in memory is referred to as “code layout” or “basic block layout.” This ordering can have a significant performance impact because modern CPUs rely heavily on an instruction cache and on branch prediction to keep things moving fast. If frequently executed (“hot”) blocks are close together and follow a common execution path, the CPU can execute them with fewer cache misses and fewer mispredicted jumps. If the layout is poor, where the hot code is split into pieces far apart from each other, or where rarely executed (“cold”) code sits in between, the CPU can spend more time jumping around and refilling caches than doing actual work. Consider a tight loop executed millions of times. A good layout keeps the loop entry, body, and backward edge (the jump back to the beginning of the body to do the next iteration) right next to each other, letting the CPU fetch them straight from the cache. In a bad layout, that loop might be interwoven with unrelated cold blocks (say, a &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block for a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; in the loop), forcing the CPU to load instructions from different places and disrupting the flow. Similarly, for an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; block, the likely path should generally be the next block so no jump is required, with the unlikely branch behind a short jump away, as that better aligns with the sensibilities of branch predictors. Code layout heuristics control how that happens, and as a result, how efficient the resulting code is able to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When determining the starting layout of the blocks (before additional optimizations are done for the layout), dotnet/runtime#108903 employs a “loop-aware reverse post-order” traversal. A reverse post-order traversal is an algorithm for visiting the nodes in a control flow graph such that each block appears after its predecessors. The “loop aware” part means the traversal recognizes loops as units, effectively creating a block around the whole loop, and tries to keep the whole loop together as the layout algorithm moves things around. The intent here is to start the larger layout optimizations from a more sensible place, reducing the amount of later reshuffling and situations where loop bodies get broken up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the extreme, layout is essentially the traveling salesman problem. The JIT must decide the order of basic blocks so that control transfers follow short, predictable paths and make efficient use of instruction cache and branch prediction. Just like the salesman visiting cities with minimal total travel distance, the compiler is trying to arrange blocks so that the “distance” between blocks, which might be measured in bytes or instruction fetch cost or something similar, is minimized. For any meaningfully-sized set of blocks, this is prohibitively expensive to compute optimally, as the number of possible orderings grows factorially with the number of blocks. Thus, the JIT has to rely on approximations rather than attempting an exact solution. One such approximation it employs now as of dotnet/runtime#103450 (and then tweaked further in dotnet/runtime#109741 and dotnet/runtime#109835) is a “3-opt,” which really just means that rather than considering all blocks together, it looks at only three and tries to produce an optimal ordering amongst those (there are only eight possible orderings to be checked). The JIT can choose to iterate through sets of three blocks until either it doesn’t see any more improvements or hits a self-imposed limit. Specifically when handling backward jumps, with dotnet/runtime#110277, it expands this “3-opt” to “4-opt” (four blocks).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;.NET 10 also does a better job of factoring PGO data into layout. With dynamic PGO, the JIT is able to gather instrumentation data from an initial compilation and then use the results of that profiling to impact an optimized re-compilation. That data can lead to conclusions about what blocks are hot or cold, and which direction branches take, all information that’s valuable for layout optimization. However, data can sometimes be missing from these profiles, so the JIT has a “profile synthesis” algorithm that makes realistic guesses for these gaps in order to fill them in (if you’ve read or seen “Jurassic Park,” this is the JIT-equivalent to filling in gaps in the dinosaur DNA sequences with that from present-day frogs.) With dotnet/runtime#111915, that repairing of the profile data is now performed just before layout, so that layout has a more complete picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s take a concrete example of all this. Here I’ve extracted the core function from &lt;code&gt;MemoryExtensions.BinarySearch&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We can see that the main change here is a block that’s moved (the bulk of &lt;code&gt;M01_L00&lt;/code&gt; moving down to &lt;code&gt;M01_L03&lt;/code&gt;). In .NET 9, the &lt;code&gt;lo &amp;lt;= hi&lt;/code&gt; “stay in the loop check” (&lt;code&gt;cmp ecx,esi&lt;/code&gt;) is a backward conditional branch (&lt;code&gt;jle short M01_L00&lt;/code&gt;), where every iteration of the loop except for the last jumps back to the top (&lt;code&gt;M01_L00&lt;/code&gt;). In .NET 10, it instead does a forward branch to exit the loop only in the rarer case, otherwise falling through to the body of the loop in the common case, and then unconditionally branching back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;GC Write Barriers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The .NET garbage collector (GC) works on a generational model, organizing the managed heap according to how long objects have been alive. The newest allocations land in “generation 0” (gen0), objects that have survived at least one collection are promoted to “generation 1” (gen1), and those that have been around for longer end up in “generation 2” (gen2). This is based on the premise that most objects are temporary, and that once an object has been around for a while, it’s likely to stick around for a while longer. Splitting up the heap into generations enables for quickly collecting gen0 objects by only scanning the gen0 heap for remaining references to that object. The expectation is that all, or at least the vast majority, of references to a gen0 object are also in gen0. Of course, if a reference to a gen0 object snuck into gen1 or gen2, not scanning gen1 or gen2 during a gen0 collection could be, well, bad. To avoid that case, the JIT collaborates with the GC to track references from older to younger generations. Whenever there’s a reference write that could cross a generation, the JIT emits a call to a helper that tracks the information in a “card table,” and when the GC runs, it consults this table to see if it needs to scan a portion of the higher generations. That helper is referred to as a “GC write barrier.” Since a write barrier is potentially employed on every reference write, it must be super fast, and in fact the runtime has several different variations of write barriers so that the JIT can pick one optimized for the given situation. Of course, the fastest write barrier is one that doesn’t need to exist at all, so as with bounds checks, the JIT also exerts energy to try to prove when write barriers aren’t needed, eliding them when it can. And it can even more in .NET 10.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ref structs&lt;/code&gt;, referred to in runtime vernacular as “byref-like types,” can never live on the heap, which means any reference fields in them will similarly never live on the heap. As such, if the JIT can prove that a reference write is targeting a field of a &lt;code&gt;ref struct&lt;/code&gt;, it can elide the write barrier. Consider this example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0&amp;#13;

        public object Obj3;&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the .NET 9 assembly, we can see three write barriers (&lt;code&gt;CORINFO_HELP_CHECKED_ASSIGN_REF&lt;/code&gt;) corresponding to the three fields in &lt;code&gt;MyRefStruct&lt;/code&gt; in the benchmark:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; .NET 9&amp;#13;

       pop       r15&amp;#13;
       ret&amp;#13;
; Total bytes of code 59&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With dotnet/runtime#111576 and dotnet/runtime#111733 in .NET 10, all of those write barriers are elided:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; .NET 10&amp;#13;
; Tests.Test()&amp;#13;
       mov       rax,[rdi+8]&amp;#13;

       mov       [rsi+10],rax&amp;#13;
       mov       rax,rsi&amp;#13;
       ret&amp;#13;
; Total bytes of code 25&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much more impactful, however, are dotnet/runtime#112060 and dotnet/runtime#112227, which have to do with “return buffers.” When a .NET method is typed to return a value, the runtime has to decide how that value gets from the callee back to the caller. For small types, like integers, floating-point numbers, pointers, or object references, the answer is simple: the value can be passed back via one or more CPU registers reserved for return values, making the operation essentially free. But not all values fit neatly into registers. Larger value types, such as structs with multiple fields, require a different strategy. In these cases, the caller allocates a “return buffer,” a block of memory, typically in the caller’s stack frame, and the caller passes a pointer to that buffer as a hidden argument to the method. The method then writes the return value directly into that buffer in order to provide the caller with the data. When it comes to write barriers, the challenge here is that there historically hasn’t been a requirement that the return buffer be on the stack; it’s technically feasible it could have been allocated on the heap, even if it rarely or never is. And since the callee doesn’t know where the buffer lives, any object reference writes needed to be tracked with GC write barriers. We can see that with a simple benchmark:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;

&amp;#13;
    [Benchmark]&amp;#13;
    public Person GetPerson() =&amp;gt; new(_firstName, _lastName, _address, _city);&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    public record struct Person(string FirstName, string LastName, string Address, string City);&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On .NET 9, each field of the returned value type is incurring a &lt;code&gt;CORINFO_HELP_CHECKED_ASSIGN_REF&lt;/code&gt; write barrier:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; .NET 9&amp;#13;
; Tests.GetPerson()&amp;#13;
       push      r15&amp;#13;
       push      r14&amp;#13;
       push      r13&amp;#13;
       push      rbx&amp;#13;
       mov       rbx,rsi&amp;#13;
       mov       rsi,[rdi+8]&amp;#13;
       mov       r15,[rdi+10]&amp;#13;
       mov       r14,[rdi+18]&amp;#13;
       mov       r13,[rdi+20]&amp;#13;
       mov       rdi,rbx&amp;#13;
       call      CORINFO_HELP_CHECKED_ASSIGN_REF&amp;#13;
       lea       rdi,[rbx+8]&amp;#13;
       mov       rsi,r15&amp;#13;
       call      CORINFO_HELP_CHECKED_ASSIGN_REF&amp;#13;
       lea       rdi,[rbx+10]&amp;#13;
       mov       rsi,r14&amp;#13;
       call      CORINFO_HELP_CHECKED_ASSIGN_REF&amp;#13;

       pop       r15&amp;#13;
       ret&amp;#13;
; Total bytes of code 81&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now in .NET 10, the calling convention has been updated to require that the return buffer live on the stack (if the caller wants the data somewhere else, it’s responsible for subsequently doing that copy). And because the return buffer is now guaranteed to be on the stack, the JIT can elide all GC write barriers as part of returning values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;; .NET 10&amp;#13;
; Tests.GetPerson()&amp;#13;
       mov       rax,[rdi+8]&amp;#13;
       mov       rcx,[rdi+10]&amp;#13;
       mov       rdx,[rdi+18]&amp;#13;
       mov       rdi,[rdi+20]&amp;#13;
       mov       [rsi],rax&amp;#13;
       mov       [rsi+8],rcx&amp;#13;
       mov       [rsi+10],rdx&amp;#13;
       mov       [rsi+18],rdi&amp;#13;
       mov       rax,rsi&amp;#13;
       ret&amp;#13;
; Total bytes of code 35&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#111636 from @a74nh is also interesting from a performance perspective because, as is common in optimization, it trades off one thing for another. Prior to this change, Arm64 had one universal write barrier helper for all GC modes. This change brings Arm64 in line with x64 by routing through a &lt;code&gt;WriteBarrierManager&lt;/code&gt; that selects among multiple &lt;code&gt;JIT_WriteBarrier&lt;/code&gt; variants based on runtime configuration. In doing so, it makes each Arm64 write barrier a bit more expensive, by adding region checks and moving to a region-aware card marking scheme, but in exchange it lets the GC do less work: fewer cards in the card table get marked, and the GC can scan more precisely. dotnet/runtime#106191 also helps reduce the cost of write barriers on Arm64 by tightening the hot-path comparisons and eliminating some avoidable saves and restores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Instruction Sets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;.NET continues to see meaningful optimizations and improvements across all supported architectures, along with various architecture-specific improvements. Here are a handful of examples.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Arm SVE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;APIs for Arm SVE were introduced in .NET 9. As noted in the Arm SVE section of last year’s post, enabling SVE is a multi-year effort, and in .NET 10, support is still considered experimental. However, the support has continued to be improved and extended, with PRs like dotnet/runtime#115775 from @snickolls-arm adding &lt;code&gt;BitwiseSelect&lt;/code&gt; methods, dotnet/runtime#117711 from @jacob-crawley adding &lt;code&gt;MaxPairwise&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MinPairwise&lt;/code&gt; methods, and dotnet/runtime#117051 from @jonathandavies-arm adding &lt;code&gt;VectorTableLookup&lt;/code&gt; methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Arm64&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#111893 from @jonathandavies-arm, dotnet/runtime#111904 from @jonathandavies-arm, dotnet/runtime#111452 from @jonathandavies-arm, dotnet/runtime#112235 from @jonathandavies-arm, and dotnet/runtime#111797 from @snickolls-arm all improved .NET’s support for utilizing Arm64’s multi-operation compound instructions. For example, when implementing a compare and branch, rather than emitting a &lt;code&gt;cmp&lt;/code&gt; against 0 followed by &lt;code&gt;beq&lt;/code&gt; instruction, the JIT may now emit a &lt;code&gt;cbz&lt;/code&gt; (“Compare and Branch on Zero”) instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;APX&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel’s Advanced Performance Extensions (APX) was announced in 2023 as an extension of the x86/x64 instruction set. It expands the number of general-purpose registers from 16 to 32 and adds new instructions such as conditional operations designed to reduce memory traffic, improve performance, and lower power consumption. dotnet/runtime#106557 from @Ruihan-Yin, dotnet/runtime#108796 from @Ruihan-Yin, and dotnet/runtime#113237 from @Ruihan-Yin essentially teach the JIT how to speak the new dialect of assembly code (the REX and expanded EVEX encodings), and dotnet/runtime#108799 from @Ruihan-Yin updates the JIT to be able to use the expanded set of registers. The most impactful new instructions in APX are around conditional compares (&lt;code&gt;ccmp&lt;/code&gt;), a concept the JIT already supports from targeting other instruction sets, and dotnet/runtime#111072 from @anthonycanino, dotnet/runtime#112153 from @anthonycanino, and dotnet/runtime#116445 from @khushal1996 all teach the JIT how to make good use of these new instructions with APX.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;AVX512&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;.NET 8 added broad support for AVX512, and .NET 9 significantly improved its handling and adoption throughout the core libraries. .NET 10 includes a plethora of additional related optimizations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dotnet/runtime#109258 from @saucecontrol and dotnet/runtime#109267 from @saucecontrol expand the number of places the JIT is able to use EVEX embedded broadcasts, a feature that lets vector instructions read a single scalar element from memory and implicitly replicate it to all the lanes of the vector, without needing a separate broadcast or shuffle operation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dotnet/runtime#108824 removes a redundant sign extension from broadcasts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dotnet/runtime#116117 from @alexcovington improves the code generated for &lt;code&gt;Vector.Max&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Vector.Min&lt;/code&gt;when AVX512 is supported.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dotnet/runtime#109474 from @saucecontrol improves “containment” (where an instruction can be eliminated by having its behaviors fully encapsulated by another instruction) for AVX512 widening intrinsics (similar containment-related improvements were made in dotnet/runtime#110736 from @saucecontrol and dotnet/runtime#111778 from @saucecontrol).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dotnet/runtime#111853 from @saucecontrol improves &lt;code&gt;Vector128/256/512.Dot&lt;/code&gt;to be better accelerated with AVX512.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dotnet/runtime#110195, dotnet/runtime#110307, and dotnet/runtime#117118 all improve how vector masks are handled. In AVX512, masks are special registers that can be included as part of various instructions to control which subset of vector elements should be utilized (each bit in a mask corresponds to one element in the vector). This enables operating on only part of a vector without needing extra branching or shuffling.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dotnet/runtime#115981 improves zeroing (where the JIT emits instructions to zero out memory, often as part of initializing a stack frame) on AVX512. After zeroing as much as it can with 64-byte instructions, it was falling back to using 16-byte instructions, when it could have used 32-byte instructions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dotnet/runtime#110662 improves the code generated for &lt;code&gt;ExtractMostSignificantBits&lt;/code&gt;(which is used by many of the searching algorithms in the core libraries) when working with&lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;ushort&lt;/code&gt;(and&lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, as most of those core library implementations reinterpret cast&lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;as one of the others) by using EVEX mask support.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dotnet/runtime#113864 from @saucecontrol improves the code generated for &lt;code&gt;ConditionalSelect&lt;/code&gt;when not used with mask registers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;AVX10.2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;.NET 9 added support and intrinsics for the AVX10.1 instruction set. With dotnet/runtime#111209 from @khushal1996, .NET 10 adds support and intrinsics for the AVX10.2 instruction set. dotnet/runtime#112535 from @khushal1996 optimizes floating-point min/max operations with AVX10.2 instructions, while dotnet/runtime#111775 from @khushal1996 enables floating-point conversions to utilize AVX10.2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;GFNI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#109537 from @saucecontrol adds intrinsics for the GFNI (Galois Field New Instructions) instruction set, which can be used for accelerating operations over Galois fields GF(2^8). These are common in cryptography, error correction, and data encoding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;VPCLMULQDQ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;VPCLMULQDQ&lt;/code&gt; is an x86 instruction set extension that adds vector support to the older &lt;code&gt;PCLMULQDQ&lt;/code&gt; instruction, which performs carry-less multiplication over 64-bit integers. dotnet/runtime#109137 from @saucecontrol adds new intrinsic APIs for &lt;code&gt;VPCLMULQDQ&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many more PRs than the ones I’ve already called out have gone into the JIT this release. Here are a few more:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Eliminating some covariance checks. Writing into arrays of reference types can require “covariance checks.” Imagine you have a class &lt;code&gt;Base&lt;/code&gt;and two derived types&lt;code&gt;Derived1 : Base&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Derived2 : Base&lt;/code&gt;. Since arrays in .NET are covariant, I can have a&lt;code&gt;Derived1[]&lt;/code&gt;and cast it successfully to a&lt;code&gt;Base[]&lt;/code&gt;, but under the covers that’s still a&lt;code&gt;Derived1[]&lt;/code&gt;. That means, for example, that any attempt to store a&lt;code&gt;Derived2&lt;/code&gt;into that array should fail at runtime, even if it compiles. To achieve that, the JIT needs to insert such covariance checks when writing into arrays, but just like with bounds checking and write barriers, the JIT can elide those checks when it can prove statically that they’re not necessary. Such an example is with sealed types. If the JIT sees an array of type&lt;code&gt;T[]&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;is known to be sealed,&lt;code&gt;T[]&lt;/code&gt;must exactly be a&lt;code&gt;T[]&lt;/code&gt;and not some&lt;code&gt;DerivedT[]&lt;/code&gt;, because there can’t be a&lt;code&gt;DerivedT&lt;/code&gt;. So with a benchmark like this:&lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0 using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes; using BenchmarkDotNet.Running; BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Tests).Assembly).Run(args); [DisassemblyDiagnoser] [HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD")] public partial class Tests { private List&amp;lt;string&amp;gt; _list = new() { "hello" }; [Benchmark] public void Set() =&amp;gt; _list[0] = "world"; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;as long as the JIT can see that the array underlying the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;is a&lt;code&gt;string[]&lt;/code&gt;(&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;is sealed), it shouldn’t need a covariance check. In .NET 9, we get this:&lt;code&gt;; .NET 9 ; Tests.Set() push rbx mov rbx,[rdi+8] cmp dword ptr [rbx+10],0 je short M00_L00 mov rdi,[rbx+8] xor esi,esi mov rdx,78914920A038 call System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CastHelpers.StelemRef(System.Object[], IntPtr, System.Object) inc dword ptr [rbx+14] pop rbx ret M00_L00: call qword ptr [78D1F80558A8] int 3 ; Total bytes of code 44&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CastHelpers.StelemRef&lt;/code&gt;call… that’s the helper that performs the write with the covariance check. But now in .NET 10, thanks to dotnet/runtime#107116 (which teaches the JIT how to resolve the exact type for the field of the closed generic), we get this:&lt;code&gt;; .NET 10 ; Tests.Set() push rbp mov rbp,rsp mov rax,[rdi+8] cmp dword ptr [rax+10],0 je short M00_L00 mov rcx,[rax+8] mov edx,[rcx+8] test rdx,rdx je short M00_L01 mov rdx,75E2B9009A40 mov [rcx+10],rdx inc dword ptr [rax+14] pop rbp ret M00_L00: call qword ptr [762368116760] int 3 M00_L01: call CORINFO_HELP_RNGCHKFAIL int 3 ; Total bytes of code 58&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;No covariance check, thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More strength reduction. “Strength reduction” is a classic compiler optimization that replaces more expensive operations, like multiplications, with cheaper ones, like additions. In .NET 9, this was used to transform indexed loops that used multiplied offsets (e.g. &lt;code&gt;index * elementSize&lt;/code&gt;) into loops that simply incremented a pointer-like offset (e.g.&lt;code&gt;offset += elementSize&lt;/code&gt;), cutting down on arithmetic overhead and improving performance. In .NET 10, strength reduction has been extended, in particular with dotnet/runtime#110222. This enables the JIT to detect multiple loop induction variables with different step sizes and strength-reduce them by leveraging their greatest common divisor (GCD). Essentially, it creates a single primary induction variable based on the GCD of the varying step sizes, and then recovers each original induction variable by appropriately scaling. Consider this example:&lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0 using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes; using BenchmarkDotNet.Running; BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Tests).Assembly).Run(args); [DisassemblyDiagnoser] [HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD", "numbers")] public partial class Tests { [Benchmark] [Arguments("128514801826028643102849196099776734920914944609068831724328541639470403818631040")] public int[] Parse(string numbers) { int[] results = new int[numbers.Length]; for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; numbers.Length; i++) { results[i] = numbers[i] - '0'; } return results; } }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this benchmark, we’re iterating through an input&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, which is a collection of 2-byte&lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;elements, and we’re storing the results into an array of 4-byte&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;elements. The core loop in the .NET 9 assembly looks like this:&lt;code&gt;; .NET 9 M00_L00: mov edx,ecx movzx edi,word ptr [rbx+rdx*2+0C] add edi,0FFFFFFD0 mov [rax+rdx*4+10],edi inc ecx cmp r15d,ecx jg short M00_L00&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;movzx edi,word ptr [rbx+rdx*2+0C]&lt;/code&gt;is the read of&lt;code&gt;numbers[i]&lt;/code&gt;, and the&lt;code&gt;mov [rax+rdx*4+10],edi&lt;/code&gt;is the assignment to&lt;code&gt;results[i]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;code&gt;rdx&lt;/code&gt;here is&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, so each assignment is effectively having to do&lt;code&gt;i*2&lt;/code&gt;to compute the byte offset of the&lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;at index&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, and similarly do&lt;code&gt;i*4&lt;/code&gt;to compute the byte offset of the&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;at offset&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;. Now here’s the .NET 10 assembly:&lt;code&gt;; .NET 10 M00_L00: movzx edx,word ptr [rbx+rcx+0C] add edx,0FFFFFFD0 mov [rax+rcx*2+10],edx add rcx,2 dec r15d jne short M00_L00&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multiplication in the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;numbers[i]&lt;/code&gt;read is gone. Instead, it can just increment&lt;code&gt;rcx&lt;/code&gt;by 2 on each iteration, treating that as the offset to the&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;th&lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, and then instead of multiplying by 4 to compute the&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;offset, it just multiples by 2.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CSE integration with SSA. As with most compilers, the JIT employs common subexpression elimination (CSE) to find identical computations and avoid doing them repeatedly. dotnet/runtime#106637 teaches the JIT how to do so in a more consistent manner by more fully integrating CSE with its Static Single Assignment (SSA) representation. This in turn allows for more optimizations to kick in, e.g. some of the strength reduction done around loop induction variables in .NET 9 wasn’t applying as much as it should have, and now it will.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;return someCondition ? true : false&lt;/code&gt;. There are often multiple ways to represent the same thing, but it often happens in compilers that certain patterns will be recognized during optimization while other equivalent ones won’t, and it can therefore behoove the compiler to first normalize the representations to all use the better recognized one. There’s a really common and interesting case of this with&lt;code&gt;return someCondition&lt;/code&gt;, where, for reasons relating to the JIT’s internal representation, the JIT is better able to optimize with the equivalent&lt;code&gt;return someCondition ? true : false&lt;/code&gt;. dotnet/runtime#107499 normalizes to the latter. As an example of this, consider this benchmark:&lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes; using BenchmarkDotNet.Running; BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Tests).Assembly).Run(args); [DisassemblyDiagnoser] [HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD", "i")] public partial class Tests { [Benchmark] [Arguments(42)] public bool Test1(int i) { if (i &amp;gt; 10 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; i &amp;lt; 20) return true; return false; } [Benchmark] [Arguments(42)] public bool Test2(int i) =&amp;gt; i &amp;gt; 10 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; i &amp;lt; 20; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;On .NET 9, that results in this assembly code for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Test1&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;; .NET 9 ; Tests.Test1(Int32) sub esi,0B cmp esi,8 setbe al movzx eax,al ret ; Total bytes of code 13&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JIT has successfully recognized that it can change the two comparisons to instead be a subtraction and a single comparison, as if the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;i &amp;gt; 10 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; i &amp;lt; 20&lt;/code&gt;were instead written as&lt;code&gt;(uint)(i - 11) &amp;lt;= 8&lt;/code&gt;. But for&lt;code&gt;Test2&lt;/code&gt;, .NET 9 produces this:&lt;code&gt;; .NET 9 ; Tests.Test2(Int32) xor eax,eax cmp esi,14 setl cl movzx ecx,cl cmp esi,0A cmovg eax,ecx ret ; Total bytes of code 18&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of how the return condition is being represented internally by the JIT, it’s missing this particular optimization, and the assembly code more directly reflects what was written in the C#. But now in .NET 10, because of this normalization, we now get this for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Test2&lt;/code&gt;, exactly what we got for&lt;code&gt;Test1&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;; .NET 10 ; Tests.Test2(Int32) sub esi,0B cmp esi,8 setbe al movzx eax,al ret ; Total bytes of code 13&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bit tests. The C# compiler has a lot of flexibility in how it emits &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt;expressions. Consider a case like this:&lt;code&gt;c is ' ' or '\t' or '\r' or '\n'&lt;/code&gt;. It could emit that as the equivalent of a series of cascading&lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt;branches, as an IL&lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt;instruction, as a bit test, or as combinations of those. The C# compiler, though, doesn’t have all of the information the JIT has, such as whether the process is 32-bit or 64-bit, or knowledge of what instructions cost on given hardware. With dotnet/runtime#107831, the JIT will now recognize more such expressions that can be implemented as a bit test and generate the code accordingly.&lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0 using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes; using BenchmarkDotNet.Running; using System.Runtime.CompilerServices; BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Tests).Assembly).Run(args); [DisassemblyDiagnoser] [HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD", "c")] public partial class Tests { [Benchmark] [Arguments('s')] public void Test(char c) { if (c is ' ' or '\t' or '\r' or '\n' or '.') { Handle(c); } [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)] static void Handle(char c) { } } }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Runtime&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Mean&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Ratio&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Code Size&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Test&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.NET 9.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.4537 ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.02&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;58 B&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Test&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.NET 10.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.1304 ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.29&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;44 B&lt;/td&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also common to see bit tests implemented in C# against shifted values; a constant mask is created with bits set at various indices, and then an incoming value to check is tested by shifting a bit to the corresponding index and seeing whether it aligns with one in the mask. For example, here is how&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Regex&lt;/code&gt;tests to see whether a provided&lt;code&gt;UnicodeCategory&lt;/code&gt;is one of those that composes the “word” class (`\w`):&lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0 using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes; using BenchmarkDotNet.Running; using System.Globalization; BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Tests).Assembly).Run(args); [DisassemblyDiagnoser] [HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD", "uc")] public partial class Tests { [Benchmark] [Arguments(UnicodeCategory.DashPunctuation)] public bool Test(UnicodeCategory uc) =&amp;gt; (WordCategoriesMask &amp;amp; (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (int)uc)) != 0; private const int WordCategoriesMask = 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (int)UnicodeCategory.UppercaseLetter | 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (int)UnicodeCategory.LowercaseLetter | 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (int)UnicodeCategory.TitlecaseLetter | 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (int)UnicodeCategory.ModifierLetter | 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (int)UnicodeCategory.OtherLetter | 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (int)UnicodeCategory.NonSpacingMark | 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (int)UnicodeCategory.DecimalDigitNumber | 1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (int)UnicodeCategory.ConnectorPunctuation; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the JIT would end up emitting that similar to how it’s written: a shift followed by a test. Now with dotnet/runtime#111979 from @varelen, it can emit it as a bit test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;; .NET 9 ; Tests.Test(System.Globalization.UnicodeCategory) mov eax,1 shlx eax,eax,esi test eax,4013F setne al movzx eax,al ret ; Total bytes of code 22 ; .NET 10 ; Tests.Test(System.Globalization.UnicodeCategory) mov eax,4013F bt eax,esi setb al movzx eax,al ret ; Total bytes of code 15&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Redundant sign extensions. With dotnet/runtime#111305, the JIT can now remove more redundant sign extensions (when you take a smaller size type, e.g. &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, and convert it to a larger size type, e.g.&lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;, while preserving the value’s sign). For example, with a test like this&lt;code&gt;public ulong Test(int x) =&amp;gt; (uint)x &amp;lt; 10 ? (ulong)x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 60 : 0&lt;/code&gt;, the JIT can now emit a&lt;code&gt;mov&lt;/code&gt;(just copy the bits) instead of&lt;code&gt;movsxd&lt;/code&gt;(move with sign extension), since it knows from the first comparison that the shift will only ever be performed with a non-negative&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Better division with BMI2. If the BMI2 instruction set is available, with dotnet/runtime#116198 from @Daniel-Svensson the JIT can now use the &lt;code&gt;mulx&lt;/code&gt;instruction (“Unsigned Multiply Without Affecting Flags”) to implement integer division, e.g.&lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0 using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes; using BenchmarkDotNet.Running; BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Tests).Assembly).Run(args); [DisassemblyDiagnoser] [HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD", "value")] public partial class Tests { [Benchmark] [Arguments(12345)] public ulong Div10(ulong value) =&amp;gt; value / 10; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;results in:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;; .NET 9 ; Tests.Div10(UInt64) mov rdx,0CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD mov rax,rsi mul rdx mov rax,rdx shr rax,3 ret ; Total bytes of code 24 ; .NET 10 ; Tests.Div10(UInt64) mov rdx,0CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCD mulx rax,rax,rsi shr rax,3 ret ; Total bytes of code 20&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Better range comparison. When comparing a &lt;code&gt;ulong&lt;/code&gt;expression against&lt;code&gt;uint.MaxValue&lt;/code&gt;, rather than being emitted as a comparison, with dotnet/runtime#113037 from @shunkino it can be handled more efficiently as a shift.&lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0 using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes; using BenchmarkDotNet.Running; BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Tests).Assembly).Run(args); [DisassemblyDiagnoser] [HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD", "x")] public partial class Tests { [Benchmark] [Arguments(12345)] public bool Test(ulong x) =&amp;gt; x &amp;lt;= uint.MaxValue; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;resulting in:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;; .NET 9 ; Tests.Test(UInt64) mov eax,0FFFFFFFF cmp rsi,rax setbe al movzx eax,al ret ; Total bytes of code 15 ; .NET 10 ; Tests.Test(UInt64) shr rsi,20 sete al movzx eax,al ret ; Total bytes of code 11&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Better dead branch elimination. The JIT’s branch optimizer is already able to use implications from comparisons to statically determine the outcome of other branches. For example, if I have this: &lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0 using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes; using BenchmarkDotNet.Running; BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Tests).Assembly).Run(args); [DisassemblyDiagnoser] [HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD", "x")] public partial class Tests { [Benchmark] [Arguments(42)] public void Test(int x) { if (x &amp;gt; 100) { if (x &amp;gt; 10) { Console.WriteLine(); } } } }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;the JIT generates this on .NET 9:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;; .NET 9 ; Tests.Test(Int32) cmp esi,64 jg short M00_L00 ret M00_L00: jmp qword ptr [7766D3E64FA8] ; Total bytes of code 12&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note there’s only a single comparison against 100 (0x64), with the comparison against 10 elided (as it’s implied by the previous comparison). However, there are many variations to this, and not all of them were handled equally well. Consider this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0 using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes; using BenchmarkDotNet.Running; BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Tests).Assembly).Run(args); [DisassemblyDiagnoser] [HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD", "x")] public partial class Tests { [Benchmark] [Arguments(42)] public void Test(int x) { if (x &amp;lt; 16) return; if (x &amp;lt; 8) Console.WriteLine(); } }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Console.WriteLine&lt;/code&gt;ideally wouldn’t appear in the emitted assembly at all, as it’s never reachable. Alas, on .NET 9, we get this (the&lt;code&gt;jmp&lt;/code&gt;instruction here is a tail call to&lt;code&gt;WriteLine&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;code&gt;; .NET 9 ; Tests.Test(Int32) push rbp mov rbp,rsp cmp esi,10 jl short M00_L00 cmp esi,8 jge short M00_L00 pop rbp jmp qword ptr [731ED8054FA8] M00_L00: pop rbp ret ; Total bytes of code 23&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;With dotnet/runtime#111766 on .NET 10, it successfully recognizes that by the time it gets to the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;x &amp;lt; 8&lt;/code&gt;, that condition will always be&lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, and it can be eliminated. And once it’s eliminated, the initial branch is also unnecessary. So the whole method reduces to this:&lt;code&gt;; .NET 10 ; Tests.Test(Int32) ret ; Total bytes of code 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Better floating-point conversion. dotnet/runtime#114410 from @saucecontrol, dotnet/runtime#114597 from @saucecontrol, and dotnet/runtime#111595 from @saucecontrol all speed up conversions between floating-point and integers, such as by using &lt;code&gt;vcvtusi2s&lt;/code&gt;when AVX512 is available, or when it isn’t, avoiding the intermediate&lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;conversion.&lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0 using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes; using BenchmarkDotNet.Running; BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Tests).Assembly).Run(args); [DisassemblyDiagnoser] [HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD", "i")] public partial class Tests { [Benchmark] [Arguments(42)] public float Compute(uint i) =&amp;gt; i; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;; .NET 9 ; Tests.Compute(UInt32) mov eax,esi vxorps xmm0,xmm0,xmm0 vcvtsi2sd xmm0,xmm0,rax vcvtsd2ss xmm0,xmm0,xmm0 ret ; Total bytes of code 16 ; .NET 10 ; Tests.Compute(UInt32) vxorps xmm0,xmm0,xmm0 vcvtusi2ss xmm0,xmm0,esi ret ; Total bytes of code 11&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unrolling. When using &lt;code&gt;CopyTo&lt;/code&gt;(or other “memmove”-based operations) with a constant source, dotnet/runtime#108576 reduces costs by avoiding a redundant memory load. dotnet/runtime#109036 unblocks more unrolling on Arm64 for&lt;code&gt;Equals&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;StartsWith&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;EndsWith&lt;/code&gt;. And dotnet/runtime#110893 enables unrolling non-zero fills (unrolling already happened for zero fills).&lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0 using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes; using BenchmarkDotNet.Running; BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Tests).Assembly).Run(args); [DisassemblyDiagnoser] [HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD")] public partial class Tests { private char[] _chars = new char[100]; [Benchmark] public void Fill() =&amp;gt; _chars.AsSpan(0, 16).Fill('x'); }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;; .NET 9 ; Tests.Fill() push rbp mov rbp,rsp mov rdi,[rdi+8] test rdi,rdi je short M00_L00 cmp dword ptr [rdi+8],10 jb short M00_L00 add rdi,10 mov esi,10 mov edx,78 call qword ptr [7F3093FBF1F8]; System.SpanHelpers.Fill[[System.Char, System.Private.CoreLib]](Char ByRef, UIntPtr, Char) nop pop rbp ret M00_L00: call qword ptr [7F3093787810] int 3 ; Total bytes of code 49 ; .NET 10 ; Tests.Fill() push rbp mov rbp,rsp mov rax,[rdi+8] test rax,rax je short M00_L00 cmp dword ptr [rax+8],10 jl short M00_L00 add rax,10 vbroadcastss ymm0,dword ptr [78EFC70C9340] vmovups [rax],ymm0 vzeroupper pop rbp ret M00_L00: call qword ptr [78EFC7447B88] int 3 ; Total bytes of code 48&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note the call to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SpanHelpers.Fill&lt;/code&gt;in the .NET 9 assembly and the absence of it in the .NET 10 assembly.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Native AOT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Native AOT is the ability for a .NET application to be compiled directly to assembly code at build-time. The JIT is still used for code generation, but only at build time; the JIT isn’t part of the shipping app at all, and no code generation is performed at run-time. As such, most of the optimizations to the JIT already discussed, as well as optimizations throughput the rest of this post, apply to Native AOT equally. Native AOT presents some unique opportunities and challenges, however.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One super power of the Native AOT tool chain is the ability to interpret (some) code at build-time and use the results of that execution rather than performing the operation at run-time. This is particularly relevant for static constructors, where the constructor’s code can be interpreted to initialize various &lt;code&gt;static readonly&lt;/code&gt; fields, and then the contents of those fields can be persisted into the generated assembly; at run-time, the contents needs only be rehydrated from the assembly rather than being recomputed. This also potentially helps to make more code redundant and removable, if for example the static constructor and anything it (and only it) referenced were no longer needed. Of course, it would be dangerous and problematic if any arbitrary code could be run during build, so instead there’s a very filtered allow list and specialized support for the most common and appropriate constructs. dotnet/runtime#107575 augments this “preinitialization” capability to support spans sourced from arrays, such that using methods like &lt;code&gt;.AsSpan()&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t cause preinitialization to bail out. dotnet/runtime#114374 also improved preinitialization, removing restrictions around accessing static fields of other types, calling methods on other types that have their own static constructors, and dereferencing pointers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conversely, Native AOT has its own challenges, specifically that size really matters and is harder to control. With a JIT available at run-time, code generation for only exactly what’s needed can be deferred until run-time. With Native AOT, all assembly code generation needs to be done at build-time, which means the Native AOT tool chain needs to work hard to determine the least amount of code it needs to emit to support everything the app might need to do at run-time. Most of the effort on Native AOT in any given release ends up being about helping it to further decrease the size of generated code. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dotnet/runtime#117411 enables folding bodies of generic instantations of the same method, essentially avoiding duplication by using the same code for copies of the same method where possible.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dotnet/runtime#117080 similarly helps improve the existing method body deduplication logic.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dotnet/runtime#117345 from @huoyaoyuan tweaks a bit of code in reflection that would previously artificially force the code to be preserved for all enumerators of all generic instantations of every collection type.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dotnet/runtime#112782 adds the same distinction that already existed for &lt;code&gt;MethodTable&lt;/code&gt;s for non-generic methods (“is this method table visible to user code or not”) to generic methods, allowing more metadata for the non-user visible ones to be optimized away.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dotnet/runtime#118718 and dotnet/runtime#118832 enable size reductions related to boxed enums. The former tweaks a few methods in &lt;code&gt;Thread&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;GC&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;CultureInfo&lt;/code&gt;to avoid boxing some enums, which means the code for those needn’t be generated. The latter tweaks the implementation of&lt;code&gt;RuntimeHelpers.CreateSpan&lt;/code&gt;, which is used by the C# compiler as part of creating spans with constructs like collection expressions.&lt;code&gt;CreateSpan&lt;/code&gt;is a generic method, and the Native AOT toolchain’s whole-program analysis would end up treating the generic type parameter as being “reflected on,” meaning the compiler had to assume any type parameter would be used with reflection and thus had to preserve relevant metadata. When used with enums, it would need to ensure support for boxed enums was kept around, and&lt;code&gt;System.Console&lt;/code&gt;has such a use with an enum. That in turn meant that a simple “hello, world” console app couldn’t trim away that boxed enum reflection support; now it can.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;VM&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The .NET runtime offers a wide range of services to managed applications, most obviously the garbage collector and the JIT compiler, but it also encompasses a host of other capabilities: assembly and type loading, exception handling, virtual method dispatch, interoperability support, stub generation, and so on. Collectively, all of these features are referred to as being a part of the .NET Virtual Machine (VM).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#108167 and dotnet/runtime#109135 rewrote various runtime helpers from C in the runtime to C# in &lt;code&gt;System.Private.CoreLib&lt;/code&gt;, including the “unboxing” helpers, which are used to unbox &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt;s to value types in niche scenarios. This rewrite avoids overheads associated with transitioning between native and managed and also enables the JIT an opportunity to optimize in the context of callers, such as with inlining. Note that these unboxing helpers are only used in obscure situations, so it requires a bit of a complicated benchmark to demonstrate the impact:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What it means to move the implementation from native to managed is most easily seen just by looking at the generated assembly. Other than uninteresting and non-impactful changes in which registers happen to get assigned, the only real difference between .NET 9 and .NET 10 is a single instruction:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-      call      CORINFO_HELP_UNBOX_NULLABLE&amp;#13;
+      call      System.Runtime.CompilerServices.CastHelpers.Unbox_Nullable(Byte ByRef, System.Runtime.CompilerServices.MethodTable*, System.Object)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#115284 streamlines how the runtime sets up and tears down the little code blocks (“funclets”) the runtime uses to implement &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;finally&lt;/code&gt; on x64. Historically, these funclets acted a lot like tiny functions, saving and restoring non-volatile CPU registers on entry and exit (a “non-volatile” register is effectively one where the caller can expect it to contain the same value after a function call as it did before the function call). This PR changes the contract so that funclets no longer need to preserve those registers themselves; instead, the runtime takes care of preserving them. That shrinks the prologs and epilogs the JIT emits for funclets, reduces instruction count and code size, and lowers the cost of entering and exiting exception handlers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With dotnet/runtime#114462, the runtime now uses a single shared “template” for many of the small executable “stubs” it needs at runtime; stubs are tiny chunks of machine code that act as jump points, call counters, or patchable trampolines. Previously, each memory allocation for stubs would regenerate the same instructions over and over. The new approach builds one copy of the stub code in a read-only page and then maps that same physical page into every place it’s needed, while giving each allocation its own writable page for the per-stub data that changes at runtime. This lets hundreds of virtual stub pages all point to one physical code page, cutting memory use, reducing startup work, and improving instruction cache locality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also interesting are dotnet/runtime#117218 and dotnet/runtime#116031, which together help optimize the generation of stack traces in large, heavily multi-threaded applications when being profiled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Threading&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ThreadPool&lt;/code&gt; underlies most work in most .NET apps and services. It’s a critical-path component that has to be able to deal with all manners of workloads efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#109841 implemented an opt-in feature that dotnet/runtime#112796 then enabled by default for .NET 10. The idea behind it is fairly straightforward, but to understand it, we first need to examine how the thread pool queues work items. The thread pool has multiple queues, typically one “global” queue and then one “local” queue per thread in the pool. When threads outside of the pool queue work, that work goes to the global queue, and when a thread pool thread queues work, especially a &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;/code&gt; or work related to an &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt;, that work item typically goes to that thread’s local queue. Then when a thread pool thread finishes whatever it was doing and goes in search of more work, it first checks its own local queue (treating its local queue as highest priority), then if that’s empty it checks the global queue, and then if that’s empty it goes and helps out the other threads in the pool by searching their queues for work to be done. This is all in an attempt to a) minimize contention on the global queue (if threads are mainly queueing and dequeuing from their own local queue, they’re not contending with each other), and b) prioritize work that’s logically part of already started work (the only way for work to get into a local queue is if that thread was processing a work item that created it). Generally, this works out well, but sometimes we get into degenerate scenarios, typically when an app does something that goes against best practices… like blocking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blocking a thread pool thread means that thread can’t service other work coming into the pool. If the blocking is brief, it’s generally fine, and if it’s longer, the thread pool tries to accommodate it by injecting more threads and finding a steady state at which things hum along. But a certain kind of blocking can be really problematic: “sync over async”. With “sync over async”, one thread blocks while waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete, and if that operation needs to do something on the thread pool in order to complete, you now have one thread pool thread blocked waiting for another thread pool thread to pick up a particular work item and process it. This can quickly lead to the whole pool getting into a jam… especially with the thread local queues. If a thread is blocked on an operation that depends on work items in that thread’s local queue getting processed, that work item being picked off now depends on the global queue being exhausted and another thread coming along and stealing the work item from this thread’s queue. If there’s a steady stream of incoming work into the global queue, though, that will never happen; essentially, the highest priority work item has become the lowest priority work item.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, back to these PRs. The idea is fairly simple: when the thread is about to block, and in particular when it’s about to block waiting on a &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;/code&gt;, it first dumps its entire local queue into the global queue. That way, this work which was highest priority for the blocked thread has a fairer chance of being processed by other threads, rather than it being the lowest priority work for everyone. We can try to see the impact of this with a specifically-crafted workload:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;queuing &lt;code&gt;Environment.ProcessorCount&lt;/code&gt;work items, each of which queues four work items to the local queue that all do a little work and then blocks on a&lt;code&gt;Task&lt;/code&gt;until they all complete&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;waiting for those &lt;code&gt;Environment.ProcessorCount&lt;/code&gt;work items to complete&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I run this on .NET 9, it hangs, because there’s so much work in the global queue, no threads are able to process those sub-work items that are necessary to unblock the main work items:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Timed out after 20002ms&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On .NET 10, it generally completes almost instantly:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Completed: 4ms&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some other tweaks were made to the pool as well:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dotnet/runtime#115402 reduced the amount of spin-waiting done on Arm processors, bringing it more in line with x64.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dotnet/runtime#112789 reduced the frequency at which the thread pool checked CPU utilization, as in some circumstances it was adding noticeable overhead, and makes the frequency configurable.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dotnet/runtime#108135 from @AlanLiu90 removed a bit of lock contention that could happen under load when starting new thread pool threads.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the subject of locking, and only for developers that find themselves with a strong need to do really low-level low-lock development, dotnet/runtime#107843 from @hamarb123 adds two new methods to the &lt;code&gt;Volatile&lt;/code&gt; class: &lt;code&gt;ReadBarrier&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WriteBarrier&lt;/code&gt;. A read barrier has “load acquire” semantics, and is sometimes referred to as a “downward fence”: it prevents instructions from being reordered in such a way that memory accesses below/after the barrier move to above/before it. In contrast, a write barrier has “store release” semantics, and is sometimes referred to as an “upwards fence”: it prevents instructions from being reordered in such a way that memory accesses above/before the barrier move to below/after it. I find it helps to think about this with regards to a &lt;code&gt;lock&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;A;&amp;#13;
lock (...)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    B;&amp;#13;
}&amp;#13;
C;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While in practice the implementation may provide stronger fences, by specification entering a &lt;code&gt;lock&lt;/code&gt; has acquire semantics and exiting a &lt;code&gt;lock&lt;/code&gt; has release semantics. Imagine if the instructions in the above code could be reordered like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;A;&amp;#13;
B;&amp;#13;
lock (...)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
}&amp;#13;
C;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;A;&amp;#13;
lock (...)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
}&amp;#13;
B;&amp;#13;
C;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both of those would be really bad. Thankfully, the barriers help us here. The acquire / read barrier semantics of entering the lock are a downwards fence: logically the brace that starts the lock puts downwards pressure on everything inside the lock to not move to before it, and the brace that ends the lock puts upwards pressure on everything inside the lock to not move to after it. Interestingly, nothing about the semantics of these barriers prevents this from happening:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;lock (...)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    A;&amp;#13;
    B;&amp;#13;
    C;&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These barriers are referred to as “half fences”; the read barrier prevents later things from moving earlier, but not the other way around, and the write barrier prevents earlier things from moving later, but not the other way around. (As it happens, though, while not required by specification, today the implementation of &lt;code&gt;lock&lt;/code&gt; does use a full barrier on both enter and exit, so nothing before or after a &lt;code&gt;lock&lt;/code&gt; will move into it.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;Task&lt;/code&gt; in .NET 10, &lt;code&gt;Task.WhenAll&lt;/code&gt; has a few changes to improve its performance. dotnet/runtime#110536 avoids a temporary collection allocation when needing to buffer up tasks from an &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;Task&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;System.Threading.Channels&lt;/code&gt; is one of the lesser-known but quite useful areas of threading in .NET (you can watch Yet Another “Highly Technical Talk” with Hanselman and Toub from Build 2025 to learn more about it). If you find yourself needing a queue to hand off some data between a producer and a consumer, you should likely look into &lt;code&gt;Channel&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The library was introduced in .NET Core 3.0 as a small, robust, and fast producer/consumer queueing mechanism; it’s evolved since, such as gaining a &lt;code&gt;ReadAllAsync&lt;/code&gt; method for consuming the contents of a channel as an &lt;code&gt;IAsyncEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;PeekAsync&lt;/code&gt; method for peeking at its contents without consuming. The original release supported &lt;code&gt;Channel.CreateUnbounded&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Channel.CreateBounded&lt;/code&gt; methods, and .NET 9 augmented those with a &lt;code&gt;Channel.CreateUnboundedPrioritized&lt;/code&gt;. .NET 10 continues to expand on channels, both with functional improvements (such as with dotnet/runtime#116097, which adds an unbuffered channel implementation), and with performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;.NET 10 helps to to reduce overall memory consumption of an application using channels. One of the cross-cutting features channels supports is cancellation: you can cancel pretty much any interaction with a channel, which sports asynchronous methods for both producing and consuming data. When a reader or writer needs to pend, it creates (or reuses a pooled instance of) an &lt;code&gt;AsyncOperation&lt;/code&gt; object that gets added to a queue; a later writer or reader that’s then able to satisfy a pending reader or writer dequeues one and marks it as completed. These queues were implemented with arrays, which makes it challenging to remove an entry from the middle of the queue if the associated operation gets canceled. So, rather than trying, it simply left the canceled object in the queue, and then when it would eventually get dequeued, it’s just thrown away and the dequeuer tries again. The theory was that, at steady state, you will quickly dequeue any canceled operations, and it’d be better to not exert a lot of effort to try to remove them more quickly. As it turns out, that assumption was problematic for some scenarios, where the workload wasn’t balanced, e.g. lots of readers would pend and timeout due to lack of writers, and each of those timed out readers would leave behind a canceled item in the queue. The next time a writer would come along, yes, all those canceled readers would get cleared out, but in the meantime, it would manifest as a notable increase in working set.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#116021 addresses that by switching from array-backed queues to linked-list-based queues. The waiter objects themselves double as the nodes in the linked lists, so the only additional memory overhead is a couple of fields for the previous and next nodes in the linked list. But even that modest increase is undesirable, so as part of the PR, it also tries to find compensating optimizations to balance things out. It’s able to remove a field from &lt;code&gt;Channel&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;‘s custom implementation of &lt;code&gt;IValueTaskSource&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; by applying a similar optimization that was made to &lt;code&gt;ManualResetValueTaskSourceCore&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in a previous release: it’s incredibly rare for an awaiter to supply an &lt;code&gt;ExecutionContext&lt;/code&gt; (via use of the awaiter’s &lt;code&gt;OnCompleted&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;UnsafeOnCompleted&lt;/code&gt; method), and even more so for that to happen when there’s also a non-default &lt;code&gt;TaskScheduler&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;SynchronizationContext&lt;/code&gt; that needs to be stored, so rather than using two fields for those concepts, they just get grouped into one (which means that in the super duper rare case where both are needed, it incurs an extra allocation). Another field is removed for storing a &lt;code&gt;CancellationToken&lt;/code&gt; on the instance, which on .NET Core can be retrieved from other available state. These changes then actually result in the size of the &lt;code&gt;AsyncOperation&lt;/code&gt; waiter instance decreasing rather than increasing. Win win. It’s hard to see the impact of this change on throughput; it’s easier to just see what the impact is on working set in the degenerate case where canceled operations are never removed. If I run this code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*"&amp;#13;
// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*"&amp;#13;

&amp;#13;
for (int i = 0; ; i++)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    CancellationTokenSource cts = new();&amp;#13;
    var vt = c.Reader.ReadAsync(cts.Token);&amp;#13;
    cts.Cancel();&amp;#13;
    await ((Task)vt.AsTask()).ConfigureAwait(ConfigureAwaitOptions.SuppressThrowing);&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    if (i % 100_000 == 0)&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        Console.WriteLine($"Working set: {Environment.WorkingSet:N0}b");&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;in .NET 9 I get output like this, with an ever increasing working set:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;.NET 8 added the &lt;code&gt;[UnsafeAccessor]&lt;/code&gt; attribute, which enables a developer to write an &lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt; method that matches up with some non-visible member the developer wants to be able to use, and the runtime fixes up the accesses to be just as if the target member was being used directly. .NET 9 then extended it with generic support.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;0.7300 ns&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there are still gaps in that story. The signature of the &lt;code&gt;UnsafeAccessor&lt;/code&gt; member needs to align with the signature of the target member, but what if that target member has parameters that aren’t visible to the code writing the &lt;code&gt;UnsafeAccessor&lt;/code&gt;? Or, what if the target member is static? There’s no way for the developer to express in the &lt;code&gt;UnsafeAccessor&lt;/code&gt; on which type the target member exists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For these scenarios, dotnet/runtime#114881 augments the story with the &lt;code&gt;[UnsafeAccessorType]&lt;/code&gt; attribute. The &lt;code&gt;UnsafeAccessor&lt;/code&gt; method can type the relevant parameters as &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; but then adorn them with an &lt;code&gt;[UnsafeAccessorType("...")]&lt;/code&gt; that provides a fully-qualified name of the target type. There are a bunch of examples then of this being used in dotnet/runtime#115583, which replaces most of the cross-library reflection done between libraries in .NET itself with use of &lt;code&gt;[UnsafeAccessor]&lt;/code&gt;. An example of where this is handy is with a cyclic relationship between &lt;code&gt;System.Net.Http&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;System.Security.Cryptography&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;System.Net.Http&lt;/code&gt; sits above &lt;code&gt;System.Security.Cryptography&lt;/code&gt;, referencing it for critical features like &lt;code&gt;X509Certificate&lt;/code&gt;. But &lt;code&gt;System.Security.Cryptography&lt;/code&gt; needs to be able to make HTTP requests in order to download OCSP information, and with &lt;code&gt;System.Net.Http&lt;/code&gt; referencing &lt;code&gt;System.Security.Cryptography&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;System.Security.Cryptography&lt;/code&gt; can’t in turn explicitly reference &lt;code&gt;System.Net.Http&lt;/code&gt;. It can, however, use reflection or &lt;code&gt;[UnsafeAccessor]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[UnsafeAccessorType]&lt;/code&gt; to do so, and it does. It used to use reflection, now in .NET 10 it uses &lt;code&gt;[UnsafeAccessor]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a few other nice improvements in and around reflection. dotnet/runtime#105814 from @huoyaoyuan updates &lt;code&gt;ActivatorUtilities.CreateFactory&lt;/code&gt; to remove a layer of delegates. &lt;code&gt;CreateFactory&lt;/code&gt; returns an &lt;code&gt;ObjectFactory&lt;/code&gt; delegate, but under the covers the implementation was creating a &lt;code&gt;Func&amp;lt;...&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and then creating an &lt;code&gt;ObjectFactory&lt;/code&gt; delegate for that &lt;code&gt;Func&amp;lt;...&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;‘s &lt;code&gt;Invoke&lt;/code&gt; method. The PR changes it to just create the &lt;code&gt;ObjectFactory&lt;/code&gt; initially, which means every invocation avoids one layer of delegate invocation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Guid&lt;/code&gt; gets several notable performance improvements in .NET 10. dotnet/runtime#105654 from @SirCxyrtyx imbues &lt;code&gt;Guid&lt;/code&gt; with an implementation of &lt;code&gt;IUtf8SpanParsable&lt;/code&gt;. This not only allows &lt;code&gt;Guid&lt;/code&gt; to be used in places where a generic parameter is constrained to &lt;code&gt;IUtf8SpanParsable&lt;/code&gt;, it gives &lt;code&gt;Guid&lt;/code&gt; overloads of &lt;code&gt;Parse&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TryParse&lt;/code&gt; that operate on UTF8 bytes. This means if you have UTF8 data, you don’t first need to transcode it to UTF16 in order to parse it, nor use &lt;code&gt;Utf8Parser.TryParse&lt;/code&gt;, which isn’t as optimized as is &lt;code&gt;Guid.TryParse&lt;/code&gt; (but which does enable parsing out a &lt;code&gt;Guid&lt;/code&gt; from the beginning of a larger input).&lt;/p&gt;

There’s not much of a performance benefit here for &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Rune&lt;/code&gt;; implementing the interface mainly yields consistency and the ability to use these types with generic routines parameterized based on that interface. But &lt;code&gt;Version&lt;/code&gt; gains the same kinds of performance (and usability) benefits as did &lt;code&gt;Guid&lt;/code&gt;: it now sports support for parsing directly from UTF8, rather than needing to transcode first to UTF16 and then parse that.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Random&lt;/code&gt; (and its cryptographically-secure counterpart &lt;code&gt;RandomNumberGenerator&lt;/code&gt;) continues to improve in .NET 10, with new methods (such as &lt;code&gt;Random.GetString&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Random.GetHexString&lt;/code&gt; from dotnet/runtime#112162) for usability, but also importantly with performance improvements to existing methods. Both &lt;code&gt;Random&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RandomNumberGenerator&lt;/code&gt; were given a handy &lt;code&gt;GetItems&lt;/code&gt; method in .NET 8; this method allows a caller to supply a set of choices and the number of items desired, allowing &lt;code&gt;Random{NumberGenerator}&lt;/code&gt; to perform “sampling with replacement”, selecting an item from the set that number of times. In .NET 9, these implementations were optimized to special-case a power-of-2 number of choices that’s less than or equal to 256. In such a case, we can avoid many trips to the underlying source of randomness by requesting bytes in bulk, rather than requesting an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; per element. With the power-of-2 choice count, we can simply mask each byte to produce the index into the choices while not introducing bias. In .NET 10, dotnet/runtime#107988 extends this to apply to non-power-of-2 cases, as well. We can’t just mask off bits as in the power-of-2 case, but we can do “rejection sampling,” which is just a fancy way of saying “if you randomly get a value outside of the allowed range, try again”.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s addressed by dotnet/runtime#104666 from @kzrnm, which tweaks the handling of this corner-case so that it’s appropriately recognized as a case that can be represented using a singleton for &lt;code&gt;int.MinValue&lt;/code&gt; (the singleton already existed, it just wasn’t applied in this case).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;–&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.00&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One area that got a lot of attention in .NET 10 is &lt;code&gt;System.Numerics.Tensors&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;System.Numerics.Tensors&lt;/code&gt; library was introduced in .NET 8, focusing on a &lt;code&gt;TensorPrimitives&lt;/code&gt; class that provided various numerical routines on spans of &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;. .NET 9 then expanded &lt;code&gt;TensorPrimitives&lt;/code&gt; with more operations and generic versions of them. Now in .NET 10, &lt;code&gt;TensorPrimitives&lt;/code&gt; gains even more operations, with many of the existing ones also made faster for various scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To start, dotnet/runtime#112933 adds over 70 new overloads to &lt;code&gt;TensorPrimitives&lt;/code&gt;, including operations like &lt;code&gt;StdDev&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Average&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Clamp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DivRem&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;IsNaN&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;IsPow2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Remainder&lt;/code&gt;, and many more. The majority of these operations are also vectorized, using shared implementations that are parameterized with generic operators. For example, the entirety of the &lt;code&gt;Decrement&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; implementation is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;public static void Decrement&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; x, Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; destination) where T : IDecrementOperators&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; =&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    InvokeSpanIntoSpan&amp;lt;T, DecrementOperator&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;(x, destination);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;InvokeSpanIntoSpan&lt;/code&gt; is a shared routine used by almost 60 methods, each of which supplies its own operator that’s then used in the heavily-optimized routine. In this case, the &lt;code&gt;DecrementOperator&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is simply this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;private readonly struct DecrementOperator&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; : IUnaryOperator&amp;lt;T, T&amp;gt; where T : IDecrementOperators&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    public static bool Vectorizable =&amp;gt; true;&amp;#13;
    public static T Invoke(T x) =&amp;gt; --x;&amp;#13;
    public static Vector128&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; Invoke(Vector128&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; x) =&amp;gt; x - Vector128&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.One;&amp;#13;
    public static Vector256&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; Invoke(Vector256&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; x) =&amp;gt; x - Vector256&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.One;&amp;#13;
    public static Vector512&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; Invoke(Vector512&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; x) =&amp;gt; x - Vector512&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.One;&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that minimal implementation, which provides a decrement implementation for vectorized widths of 128 bits, 256 bits, 512 bits, and scalar, the workhorse routine is able to provide a very efficient implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wherever possible, these methods also utilize APIs on the underlying &lt;code&gt;Vector128&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Vector256&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Vector512&lt;/code&gt; types, including new corresponding methods introduced in dotnet/runtime#111179 and dotnet/runtime#115525, such as &lt;code&gt;IsNaN&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Existing methods are also improved. dotnet/runtime#111615 from @BarionLP improves &lt;code&gt;TensorPrimitives.SoftMax&lt;/code&gt; by avoiding unnecessary recomputation of &lt;code&gt;T.Exp&lt;/code&gt;. The softmax function involves computing &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; for every element and summing them all together. The output for an element with value &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is then the &lt;code&gt;exp(x)&lt;/code&gt; divided by that sum. The previous implementation was following that outline, resulting in computing &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; twice for each element. We can instead compute &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; just once for each element, caching them temporarily in the destination while creating the sum, and then reusing those for the subsequent division, overwriting each with the actual result. The net result is close to doubling the throughput:&lt;/p&gt;

The operation already supported vectorization for &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;, for which there’s SIMD hardware-accelerated support for division, but it didn’t support &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, which lacks SIMD hardware-accelerated support. This PR teaches the JIT how to emulate SIMD integer division, by converting the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;s to &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;s, doing &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; division, and then converting back.&lt;/p&gt;

So anywhere we’re successfully vectorizing for &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;uint&lt;/code&gt; on 32-bit or &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ulong&lt;/code&gt; on 64-bit, we can also successfully vectorize for &lt;code&gt;nint&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;nuint&lt;/code&gt;. dotnet/runtime#116895 also enables vectorizing &lt;code&gt;TensorPrimitives.ConvertTruncating&lt;/code&gt; when used to convert &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;uint&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ulong&lt;/code&gt;. Vectorization hadn’t previously been enabled because the underlying operations used had some undefined behavior; that behavior was fixed late in the .NET 9 cycle, such that this vectorization can now be enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In terms of changes that affected the most operations, dotnet/runtime#116898 and dotnet/runtime#116934 take the cake. Together, these PRs extend vectorization for almost 60 distinct operations to also accelerate for &lt;code&gt;Half&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;Abs&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Add&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;AddMultiply&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;BitwiseAnd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;BitwiseOr&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Ceiling&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Clamp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CopySign&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Cos&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CosPi&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Cosh&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CosineSimilarity&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Decrement&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DegreesToRadians&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Divide&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Exp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Exp10&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Exp10M1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Exp2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Exp2M1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ExpM1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Floor&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;FusedAddMultiply&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Hypot&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Increment&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Lerp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Log&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Log10&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Log10P1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Log2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Log2P1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LogP1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Max&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MaxMagnitude&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MaxMagnitudeNumber&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MaxNumber&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Min&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MinMagnitude&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MinMagnitudeNumber&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MinNumber&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Multiply&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MultiplyAdd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MultiplyAddEstimate&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Negate&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;OnesComplement&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Reciprocal&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Remainder&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Round&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Sigmoid&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Sin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SinPi&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Sinh&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Sqrt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Subtract&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Tan&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TanPi&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Tanh&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Truncate&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Xor&lt;/code&gt;. The challenge here is that &lt;code&gt;Half&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t have accelerated hardware support, and today is not even supported by the vector types. In fact, even for its scalar operations, &lt;code&gt;Half&lt;/code&gt; is manipulated internally by converting it to a &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;, performing the relevant operation as &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;, and then casting back, e.g. here’s the implementation of the &lt;code&gt;Half&lt;/code&gt; multiplication operator:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;public static Half operator *(Half left, Half right) =&amp;gt; (Half)((float)left * (float)right);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For all of these &lt;code&gt;TensorPrimitives&lt;/code&gt; operations, they previously would treat &lt;code&gt;Half&lt;/code&gt; like any other unaccelerated type, and would just run a scalar loop that performed the operation on each &lt;code&gt;Half&lt;/code&gt;. That means for each element, we’re converting it to &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;, then performing the operation, and then converting it back. As luck would have it, though, &lt;code&gt;TensorPrimitives&lt;/code&gt; already defines the &lt;code&gt;ConvertToSingle&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ConvertToHalf&lt;/code&gt; methods, which are accelerated. We can then reuse those methods to do the same thing that’s already done for scalar operations but do it vectorized: take a vector of &lt;code&gt;Half&lt;/code&gt;s, convert them all to &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;s, process all the &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;s, and convert them all back to &lt;code&gt;Half&lt;/code&gt;s. Of course, I already stated that the vector types don’t support &lt;code&gt;Half&lt;/code&gt;, so how can we “take a vector of &lt;code&gt;Half&lt;/code&gt;“? By reinterpret casting the &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;Half&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;short&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;ushort&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;), which allows us to smuggle the &lt;code&gt;Half&lt;/code&gt;s through. And, as it turns out, even for scalar, the very first thing &lt;code&gt;Half&lt;/code&gt;‘s &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; cast operator does is convert it to a &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The net result is that a ton of operations can now be accelerated for &lt;code&gt;Half&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;System.Numerics.Tensors&lt;/code&gt; library in .NET 10 now also includes stable APIs for tensor types (which use &lt;code&gt;TensorPrimitives&lt;/code&gt; in their implementations). This includes a &lt;code&gt;Tensor&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ITensor&amp;lt;,&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TensorSpan&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlyTensorSpan&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. One of the really interesting things about these types is that they take advantage of the new C# 14 compound operators feature, and do so for a significant performance benefit. In previous versions of C#, you’re able to write custom operators, for example an addition operator:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;public class C &amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    public int Value;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    public static C operator +(C left, C right) =&amp;gt; new() { Value = left.Value + right.Value };&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that type, I can write code like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;C a = new() { Value = 42 };&amp;#13;
C b = new() { Value = 84 };&amp;#13;
C c = a + b;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
Console.WriteLine(c.Value);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;which will print out &lt;code&gt;126&lt;/code&gt;. I can also change the code to use a compound operator, &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt;, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;C a = new() { Value = 42 };&amp;#13;
C b = new() { Value = 84 };&amp;#13;
a += b;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
Console.WriteLine(a.Value);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;which will also print out &lt;code&gt;126&lt;/code&gt;, because the &lt;code&gt;a += b&lt;/code&gt; is always identical to &lt;code&gt;a = a + b&lt;/code&gt;… or, at least it was. Now with C# 14, it’s possible for a type to not only define a &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operator, it can also define a &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt; operator. If a type defines a &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt; operator, it will be used rather than expanding &lt;code&gt;a += b&lt;/code&gt; as shorthand for &lt;code&gt;a = a + b&lt;/code&gt;. And that has performance ramifications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A tensor is basically a multidimensional array, and as with arrays, these can be big… really big. If I have a sequence of operations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Tensor&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; t1 = ...;&amp;#13;
Tensor&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; t2 = ...;&amp;#13;
for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 3; i++)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    t1 += t2;&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and each of those &lt;code&gt;t1 += t2&lt;/code&gt;s exands into &lt;code&gt;t1 = t1 + t2&lt;/code&gt;, then for each I’m allocating a brand new tensor. If they’re big, that gets expensive right quick. But C# 14’s new user-defined compound operators, as initially added to the compiler in dotnet/roslyn#78400, enable mutation of the target.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;public class C &amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    public int Value;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    public static C operator +(C left, C right) =&amp;gt; new() { Value = left.Value + right.Value };&amp;#13;
    public static void operator +=(C other) =&amp;gt; left.Value += other.Value;&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that means that such compound operators on the tensor types can just update the target tensor in place rather than allocating a whole new (possibly very large) data structure for each computation. dotnet/runtime#117997 adds all of these compound operators for the tensor types. (Not only are these using C# 14 user-defined compound operators, they’re doing so as extension operators, using the new C# 14 extension types feature. Fun!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Collections&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Handling collections of data is the lifeblood of any application, and as such every .NET release tries to eke out even more performance from collections and collection processing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Enumeration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iterating through collections is one of the most common things developers do. To make this as efficient as possible, the most prominent collection types in .NET (e.g. &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) expose struct-based enumerators (e.g. &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.Enumerator&lt;/code&gt;) which their public &lt;code&gt;GetEnumerator()&lt;/code&gt; methods then return in a strongly-typed manner:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;public Enumerator GetEnumerator() =&amp;gt; new Enumerator(this);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is in addition to their &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.GetEnumerator()&lt;/code&gt; implementation, which ends up being implemented via an “explicit” interface implementation (“explicit” means the relevant method provides the interface method implementation but does not show up as a public method on the type itself), e.g. &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;‘s implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;IEnumerator&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.GetEnumerator() =&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    Count == 0 ? SZGenericArrayEnumerator&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.Empty :&amp;#13;
    GetEnumerator();&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Directly &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt;‘ing over the collection allows the C# compiler to bind to the struct-based enumerator, enabling avoiding the enumerator allocation and being able to directly see the non-virtual methods on the enumerator, rather than working with an &lt;code&gt;IEnumerator&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the interface dispatch required to invoke methods on it. That, however, falls apart once the collection is used polymorphically as an &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;; at that point, the &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.GetEnumerator()&lt;/code&gt; is used, which is forced to allocate a new enumerator instance (except for special-cases, such as how &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;‘s implementation shown above returns a singleton enumerator when the collection is empty).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, as noted earlier in the JIT section, the JIT has been gaining super powers around dynamic PGO, escape analysis, and stack allocation. This means that in many situations, the JIT is now able to see that the most common concrete type for a given call site is a specific enumerator type and generate code specific to when it is that type, devirtualizing the calls, possibly inlining them, and then, if it’s able to do so sufficiently, stack allocating the enumerator. With the progress that’s been made in .NET 10, this now happens very frequently for arrays and &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. While the JIT is able to do this in general regardless of an object’s type, the ubiquity of enumeration makes it all that much more important for &lt;code&gt;IEnumerator&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, so dotnet/runtime#116978 marks &lt;code&gt;IEnumerator&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; as an &lt;code&gt;[Intrinsic]&lt;/code&gt;, giving the JIT the ability to better reason about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, some enumerators still needed a bit of help. Besides &lt;code&gt;T[]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the most popular collection type in .NET, and with the JIT changes, many &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt;s of an &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that are actually &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will successfully have the enumerator stack allocated. Awesome. That awesomeness dwindled, however, when trying out different sized lists. This is a benchmark that tests out enumerating a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; typed as &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, with different lengths, along with benchmark results from early August 2025 (around .NET 10 Preview 7).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that for the &lt;code&gt;500&lt;/code&gt; element &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the allocation column shows that nothing was allocated on the heap, as the enumerator was successfully stack allocated. Fabulous. But then just increasing the size of the list caused it to no longer be stack-allocated. Why? The reason for the allocation in the jump from &lt;code&gt;500&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;5000&lt;/code&gt; has to do with dynamic PGO combined with how &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;‘s enumerator was written oh so many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;‘s enumerator’s &lt;code&gt;MoveNext&lt;/code&gt; was structured like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;public bool MoveNext()&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    if (_version == _list._version &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ((uint)_index &amp;lt; (uint)_list._size))&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        ... // handle successfully getting next element&amp;#13;
        return true;&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    return MoveNextRare();&amp;#13;
}&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
private bool MoveNextRare()&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    ... // handle version mismatch and/or returning false for completed enumeration&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Rare&lt;/code&gt; in the name gives a hint as to why it’s split like this. The &lt;code&gt;MoveNext&lt;/code&gt; method was kept as thin as possible for the common case of invoking &lt;code&gt;MoveNext&lt;/code&gt;, namely all successful calls that return &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;; the only time &lt;code&gt;MoveNextRare&lt;/code&gt; is needed, other than when the enumerator is misused, is for the final call to it after all elements have been yielded. That streamlining of &lt;code&gt;MoveNext&lt;/code&gt; itself was done to make &lt;code&gt;MoveNext&lt;/code&gt; inlineable. However, a lot has changed since this code was written, making it less important, and the separating out of &lt;code&gt;MoveNextRare&lt;/code&gt; has a really interesting interaction with dynamic PGO. One of the things dynamic PGO looks for is whether code is considered hot (used a lot) or cold (used rarely), and that data influences whether a method should be considered for inlining. For shorter lists, dynamic PGO will see &lt;code&gt;MoveNextRare&lt;/code&gt; invoked a reasonable number of times, and will consider it for inlining. And if all of the calls to the enumerator are inlined, the enumerator instance can avoid escaping the call frame, and can then be stack allocated. But once the list length grows to a much larger amount, that &lt;code&gt;MoveNextRare&lt;/code&gt; method will start to look really cold, will struggle to be inlined, and will then allow the enumerator instance to escape, preventing it from being stack allocated. dotnet/runtime#118425 recognizes that times have changed since this enumerator was written, with many changes to inlining heuristics and PGO and the like; it undoes the separating out of &lt;code&gt;MoveNextRare&lt;/code&gt; and simplifies the enumerator. With how the system works today, the re-combined &lt;code&gt;MoveNext&lt;/code&gt; is still inlineable, with or without PGO, and we’re able to stack allocate at the larger size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Method&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Count&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Mean&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Allocated&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sum&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;500&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;221.2 ns&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;–&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sum&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2,153.6 ns&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;–&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sum&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;15000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;14,724.9 ns&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;40 B&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that fix, we still had an issue, though. We’re now avoiding the allocation at lengths 500 and 5000, but at 15,000 we still see the enumerator being allocated. Now why? This has to do with OSR (on-stack replacement), which was introduced in .NET 7 as a key enabler for allowing tiered compilation to be used with methods containing loops. OSR allows for a method to be recompiled with optimizations even while it’s executing, and for an invocation of the method to jump from the unoptimized code for the method to the corresponding location in the newly optimized method. While OSR is awesome, it unfortunately causes some complications here. Once the list gets long enough, an invocation of the tier 0 (unoptimized) method will transition to the OSR optimized method… but OSR methods don’t contain dynamic PGO instrumentation (they used to, but it was removed because it led to problems if the instrumented code never got recompiled again and thus suffered regressions due to forever-more running with the instrumentation probes in place). Without the instrumentation, and in particular without the instrumentation for the tail portion of the method (where the enumerator’s &lt;code&gt;Dispose&lt;/code&gt; method is invoked), even though &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.Dispose&lt;/code&gt; is a nop, the JIT may not be able to do the guarded devirtualization that enables the &lt;code&gt;IEnumerator&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.Dispose&lt;/code&gt; to be devirtualized and inlined. Meaning, ironically, that the nop &lt;code&gt;Dispose&lt;/code&gt; causes escape analysis to see the enumerator instance escape, such that it can’t be stack allocated. Whew.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, dotnet/runtime#118461 addresses that in the JIT. Specifically for enumerators, this PR enables dynamic PGO to infer the missing instrumentation based on the earlier probes used with the other enumerator methods, which then enables it to successfully devirtualize and inline &lt;code&gt;Dispose&lt;/code&gt;. So, for .NET 10, and the same benchmark, we end up with this lovely sight:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Method&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Count&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Mean&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Allocated&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sum&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;500&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;216.5 ns&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;–&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sum&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2,082.4 ns&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;–&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sum&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;15000&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6,525.3 ns&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;–&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other types needed a bit of help as well. dotnet/runtime#118467 addresses &lt;code&gt;PriorityQueue&amp;lt;TElement, TPriority&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;‘s enumerator; it’s enumerator was a port of &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;‘s and so was changed similarly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Separately, dotnet/runtime#117328 streamline’s &lt;code&gt;Stack&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;‘s enumerator type, removing around half the lines of code that previously composed it. The previous enumerator’s &lt;code&gt;MoveNext&lt;/code&gt; incurred five branches on the way to grabbing most next elements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It first did a version check, comparing the stack’s version number against the enumerator’s captured version number, to ensure the stack hadn’t been mutated since the time the enumerator was grabbed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It then checked to see whether this was the first call to the enumerator, taking one path that lazily-initialized some state if it was and another path assuming already-initialized state if not.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Assuming this wasn’t the first call, it then checked whether enumeration had previously ended.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Assuming it hadn’t, it then checked whether there’s anything left to enumerate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;And finally, it dereferenced the underlying array, incurring a bounds check.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new implementation cuts that in half. It relies on the enumerator’s constructor initializing the current index to the length of the stack, such that each &lt;code&gt;MoveNext&lt;/code&gt; call just decrements this value. When the data is exhausted, the count will go negative. This means that we can combine a whole bunch of these checks into a single check:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if ((uint)index &amp;lt; (uint)array.Length)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and we’re left with just two branches on the way to reading any element: the version check and whether the index is in bounds. That reduction not only means there’s less code to process and fewer branches that might be improperly predicted, it also shrinks the size of the members to the point where they’re much more likely to be inlined, which in turns makes it much more likely that the enumerator object can be stack allocated.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#117341 does something similar but for &lt;code&gt;Queue&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Queue&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; has an interesting complication when compared to &lt;code&gt;Stack&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which is that it can wrap around the length of the underlying array. Whereas with &lt;code&gt;Stack&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, we can always start at a particular index and just count down to 0, using that index as the offset into the array, with &lt;code&gt;Queue&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the starting index can be anywhere in the array, and when walking from that index to the last element, we might need to wrap around back to the beginning. Such wrapping can be accomplished using &lt;code&gt;% array.Length&lt;/code&gt; (which is what &lt;code&gt;Queue&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; does on .NET Framework), but such a division operation can be relatively costly. An alternative, since we know the count can never be more than the array’s length, is to check whether we’ve already walked past the end of the array, and if we have, then subtract the array’s length to get to the corresponding location from the start of the array. The existing implementation in .NET 9 did just that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if (index &amp;gt;= array.Length)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    index -= array.Length; // wrap around if needed&amp;#13;
}&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
_currentElement = array[index];&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is two branches, one for the check against the array length, and one for the bounds check. The bounds check can’t be eliminated here because the JIT hasn’t seen proof that the index is actually in-bounds and thus needs to be defensive. Instead, we can write it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if ((uint)index &amp;lt; (uint)array.Length)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    _currentElement = array[index];&amp;#13;
}&amp;#13;
else&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    index -= array.Length;&amp;#13;
    _currentElement = array[index];&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An enumeration of a queue can logically be split into two parts: the elements from the head index to the end of the array, and the elements from the beginning of the array to the tail. All of the former now fall into the first block, which incurs only one branch because the JIT can use the knowledge gleaned from the comparison to eliminate the bounds check. It only incurs a bounds check when in the second portion of the enumeration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can more easily visualize the branch savings by using benchmarkdotnet’s &lt;code&gt;HardwareCounters&lt;/code&gt; diagnoser, asking it to track &lt;code&gt;HardwareCounter.BranchInstructions&lt;/code&gt; (this diagnoser only works on Windows). Note here, as well, that the changes not only improve throughput, they also enable the boxed enumerator to be stack allocated.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ConcurrentDictionary&amp;lt;TKey, TValue&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; also gets in on the fun. The dictionary is implemented as a collection of “buckets”, each of which of which is a linked list of entries. It had a fairly complicated enumerator for processing these structures, relying on jumping between cases of a switch statement, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;switch (_state)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    case StateUninitialized:&amp;#13;
        ... // Initialize on first MoveNext.&amp;#13;
        goto case StateOuterloop;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    case StateOuterloop:&amp;#13;
        // Check if there are more buckets in the dictionary to enumerate.&amp;#13;
        if ((uint)i &amp;lt; (uint)buckets.Length)&amp;#13;
        {&amp;#13;
            // Move to the next bucket.&amp;#13;
            ...&amp;#13;
            goto case StateInnerLoop;&amp;#13;
        }&amp;#13;
        goto default;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    case StateInnerLoop:&amp;#13;
        ... // Yield elements from the current bucket.&amp;#13;
        goto case StateOuterloop;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    default:&amp;#13;
        // Done iterating.&amp;#13;
        ...&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you squint, there are nested loops here, where we’re enumerating each bucket and for each bucket enumerating its contents. With how this is structured, however, from the JIT’s perspective, we could enter those loops from any of those &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt;s, depending on the current value of &lt;code&gt;_state&lt;/code&gt;. That produces something referred to as an “irreducible loop,” which is a loop that has multiple possible entry points. Imagine you have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;A:&amp;#13;
if (someCondition) goto B;&amp;#13;
...&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
B:&amp;#13;
if (someOtherCondition) goto A;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Labels &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; form a loop, but that loop can be entered by jumping to either &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; or to &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;. If the compiler could prove that this loop were only ever enterable from &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; or only ever enterable from &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, then the loop would be “reducible.” Irreducible loops are much more complex than reducible loops for a compiler to deal with, as they have more complex control and data flow and in general are harder to analyze. dotnet/runtime#116949 rewrites the &lt;code&gt;MoveNext&lt;/code&gt; method to be a more typical &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop, which is not only easier to read and maintain, it’s also reducible and more efficient, and because it’s more streamlined, it’s also inlineable and enables possible stack allocation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;LINQ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of these examples show enumerating collections using a &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; loop, and while that’s obviously incredibly common, so too is using LINQ (Language Integrated Query) to enumerate and process collections. For in-memory collections, LINQ provides literally hundreds of extension methods for performing maps, filters, sorts, and a plethora of other operations over enumerables. It is incredibly handy, is thus used everywhere, and is thus important to optimize. Every release of .NET has seen improvements to LINQ, and that continues in .NET 10.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most prominent from a performance perspective in this release are the changes to &lt;code&gt;Contains&lt;/code&gt;. As discussed in depth in Deep .NET: Deep Dive on LINQ with Stephen Toub and Scott Hanselman and Deep .NET: An even DEEPER Dive into LINQ with Stephen Toub and Scott Hanselman, the LINQ methods are able to pass information between them by using specialized internal &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; implementations. When you call &lt;code&gt;Select&lt;/code&gt;, that might return an &lt;code&gt;ArraySelectIterator&amp;lt;TSource, TResult&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or an &lt;code&gt;IListSelectIterator&amp;lt;TSource, TResult&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or an &lt;code&gt;IListSkipTakeSelectIterator&amp;lt;TSource, TResult&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or one of any number of other types. Each of these types has fields that carry information about the source (e.g. the &lt;code&gt;IListSkipTakeSelectIterator&amp;lt;TSource, TResult&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; has fields not only for the &lt;code&gt;IList&amp;lt;TSource&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; source and the &lt;code&gt;Func&amp;lt;TSource, TResult&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; selector, but also for the tracked min and max bounds based on previous &lt;code&gt;Skip&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Take&lt;/code&gt; calls), and they have overrides of virtual methods that allow for various operations to be specialized. This means sequences of LINQ methods can be optimized. For example, &lt;code&gt;source.Where(...).Select(...)&lt;/code&gt; is optimized a) to combine both the filter and the map delegates into a single &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, thus removing the overhead of an extra layer of interface dispatch, and b) to perform operations specific to the original source data type (e.g. if &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; was an array, the processing can be done directly on that array rather than via &lt;code&gt;IEnumerator&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of these optimizations make the most sense when a method returns an &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that happens to be the result of a LINQ query. The producer of that method doesn’t know how the consumer will be consuming it, and the consumer doesn’t know the details of how the producer produced it. But since the LINQ methods flow context via the concrete implementations of &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, significant optimizations are possible for interesting combinations of consumer and producer methods. For example, let’s say a producer of an &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; decides they want to always return data in ascending order, so they do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;public static IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; GetData()&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    ...&amp;#13;
    return data.OrderBy(s =&amp;gt; s.CreatedAt);&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But as it turns out, the consumer won’t be looking at all of the elements, and instead just wants the first:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;T value = GetData().First();&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LINQ optimizes this by having the enumerable returned from &lt;code&gt;OrderBy&lt;/code&gt; provide a specialized implementation of &lt;code&gt;First&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;FirstOrDefault&lt;/code&gt;: it doesn’t need to perform an &lt;code&gt;O(N log N)&lt;/code&gt; sort (or allocate a lot of memory to hold all of the keys), it can instead just do an &lt;code&gt;O(N)&lt;/code&gt; search for the smallest element in the source, because the smallest element would be the first to be yielded from &lt;code&gt;OrderBy&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Contains&lt;/code&gt; is ripe for these kinds of optimizations as well, e.g. &lt;code&gt;OrderBy&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Distinct&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Reverse&lt;/code&gt; all entail non-trivial processing and/or allocation, but if followed by a &lt;code&gt;Contains&lt;/code&gt;, all that work can be skipped, as the &lt;code&gt;Contains&lt;/code&gt; can just search the source directly. With dotnet/runtime#112684, this set of optimizations is extended to &lt;code&gt;Contains&lt;/code&gt;, with almost 30 specialized implementations of &lt;code&gt;Contains&lt;/code&gt; across the various iterator specializations.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LINQ in .NET 10 also gains some new methods, including &lt;code&gt;Sequence&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Shuffle&lt;/code&gt;. While the primary purpose of these new methods is not performance, they can have a meaningful impact on performance, due to how they’ve been implemented and how they integrate with the rest of the optimizations in LINQ. Take &lt;code&gt;Sequence&lt;/code&gt;, for example. &lt;code&gt;Sequence&lt;/code&gt; is similar to &lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt;, in that its a source for numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;public static IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; Sequence&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(T start, T endInclusive, T step) where T : INumber&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whereas &lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt; only works with &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and produces a contiguous series of non-overflowing numbers starting at the initial value, &lt;code&gt;Sequence&lt;/code&gt; works with any &lt;code&gt;INumber&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, supports &lt;code&gt;step&lt;/code&gt; values other than &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; (including negative values), and allows for wrapping around &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;‘s maximum or minimum. However, when appropriate (e.g. &lt;code&gt;step&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;), &lt;code&gt;Sequence&lt;/code&gt; will try to utilize &lt;code&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt;‘s implementation, which has internally been updated to work with any &lt;code&gt;T : INumber&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, even though its public API is still tied to &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. That means that all of the optimizations afforded to &lt;code&gt;Range&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; propagate to &lt;code&gt;Sequence&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My favorite new LINQ method, though, is &lt;code&gt;Shuffle&lt;/code&gt; (introduced in dotnet/runtime#112173), in part because it’s very handy, but in part because of its implementation and performance focus. The purpose of &lt;code&gt;Shuffle&lt;/code&gt; is to randomize the source input, and logically, it’s akin to a very simple implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;public static IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; Shuffle&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;(IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; source)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    T[] arr = source.ToArray();&amp;#13;
    Random.Shared.Shuffle(arr);&amp;#13;
    foreach (T item in arr) yield return item;&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Worst case, this implementation is effectively what’s in LINQ. Just as in the worst case &lt;code&gt;OrderBy&lt;/code&gt; needs to buffer up the whole input because it’s possible any item might be the smallest and thus need to be yielded first, &lt;code&gt;Shuffle&lt;/code&gt; similarly needs to support the possibility that the last element should probabilistically be yielded first. However, there are a variety of special-cases in the implementation that allow it to perform significantly better than such a hand-rolled &lt;code&gt;Shuffle&lt;/code&gt; implementation you might be using today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, &lt;code&gt;Shuffle&lt;/code&gt; has some of the same characteristics as &lt;code&gt;OrderBy&lt;/code&gt;, in that they’re both creating permutations of the input. That means that many of the ways we can specialize subsequent operations on the result of an &lt;code&gt;OrderBy&lt;/code&gt; also apply to &lt;code&gt;Shuffle&lt;/code&gt;. For example, &lt;code&gt;Shuffle.First&lt;/code&gt; on an &lt;code&gt;IList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; can just select an element from the list at random. &lt;code&gt;Shuffle.Count&lt;/code&gt; can just count the underlying source, since the order of the elements is irrelevant to the result. &lt;code&gt;Shuffle.Contains&lt;/code&gt; can just perform the contains on the underlying source. Etc. But my two favorite sequences are &lt;code&gt;Shuffle.Take&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Shuffle.Take.Contains&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Shuffle.Take&lt;/code&gt; provides an interesting optimization opportunity: whereas with &lt;code&gt;Shuffle&lt;/code&gt; by itself we need to build the whole shuffled sequence, with a &lt;code&gt;Shuffle&lt;/code&gt; followed immediately by a &lt;code&gt;Take(N)&lt;/code&gt;, we only need to sample &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; items from the source. We still need those &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; items to be a uniformly random distribution, akin to what we’d get if we performed the buffering shuffle and then selected the first &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; items in the resulting array, but we can do so using an algorithm that allows us to avoid buffering everything. We need an algorithm that will let us iterate through the source data once, picking out elements as we go, and only ever buffering &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; items at a time. Enter “reservoir sampling.” I previously discussed reservoir sampling in Performance Improvements in .NET 8, as it’s employed by the JIT as part of its dynamic PGO implementation, and we can use the algorithm here in &lt;code&gt;Shuffle&lt;/code&gt; as well. Reservoir sampling provides exactly the single-pass, low-memory path we want: initialize a “reservoir” (an array) with the first &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; items, then as we scan the rest of the sequence, probabilistically overwrite one of the elements in our reservoir with the current item. The algorithm ensures that every element ends up in the reservoir with equal probability, yielding the same distribution as fully shuffling and taking &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;, but using only &lt;code&gt;O(N)&lt;/code&gt; space and only making a single pass over an otherwise unknown-length source.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Shuffle.Take.Contains&lt;/code&gt; is even more fun. We now have a probability problem that reads like a brain teaser or an SAT question. “I have &lt;code&gt;totalCount&lt;/code&gt; items of which &lt;code&gt;equalCount&lt;/code&gt; match my target value, and we’re going to pick &lt;code&gt;takeCount&lt;/code&gt; items at random. What is the probability that at least one of those &lt;code&gt;takeCount&lt;/code&gt; items is one of the &lt;code&gt;equalCount&lt;/code&gt; items?” This is called a hypergeometric distribution, and we can use an implementation of it for &lt;code&gt;Shuffle.Take.Contains&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make this easier to reason about, let’s talk candy. Imagine you have a jar of 100 jelly beans, of which 20 are your favorite flavor, Watermelon, and you’re going to pick 5 of the 100 beans at random; what are the chances you get at least one Watermelon? To solve this, we could reason through all the different ways we might get 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 Watermelons, but instead, let’s do the opposite and think through how likely it is that we don’t get any (sad panda):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The chance that our first pick isn’t a Watermelon is the number of non-Watermelons divided by the total number of beans, so &lt;code&gt;(100-20)/100&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Once we’ve picked a bean out of the jar, we’re not putting it back, so the chance that our second pick isn’t a Watermelon is now &lt;code&gt;(99-20)/99&lt;/code&gt;(we have one fewer bean, but our first pick wasn’t a Watermelon, so there’s the same number of Watermelons as there was before).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For a third pick, it’s now &lt;code&gt;(98-20)/98&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;And so on.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After five rounds, we end up with &lt;code&gt;(80/100) * (79/99) * (78/98) * (77/97) * (76/96)&lt;/code&gt;, which is ~32%. If the chances I don’t get a Watermelon are ~32%, then the chances I do get a Watermelon are ~68%. Jelly beans aside, that’s our algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;double probOfDrawingZeroMatches = 1;&amp;#13;
for (long i = 0; i &amp;lt; _takeCount; i++)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    probOfDrawingZeroMatches *= (double)(totalCount - i - equalCount) / (totalCount - i);&amp;#13;
}&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
return Random.Shared.NextDouble() &amp;gt; probOfDrawingZeroMatches;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The net effect is we can compute the answer much more efficiently than with a naive implementation that shuffles and then separately takes and separately contains.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LINQ&lt;/code&gt; in .NET 10 also sports some new methods that are about performance (at least in part), in particular &lt;code&gt;LeftJoin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RightJoin&lt;/code&gt;, from dotnet/runtime#110872. I say these are about performance because it’s already possible to achieve the left and right join semantics using existing LINQ surface area, and the new methods do it more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Enumerable.Join&lt;/code&gt; implements an “inner join,” meaning only matching pairs from the two supplied collections appear in the output. For example, this code, which is joining based on the first letter in each string:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;string&amp;gt; left = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "grape", "honeydew"];&amp;#13;
IEnumerable&amp;lt;string&amp;gt; right = ["aardvark", "dog", "elephant", "goat", "gorilla", "hippopotamus"];&amp;#13;
foreach (string result in left.Join(right, s =&amp;gt; s[0], s =&amp;gt; s[0], (s1, s2) =&amp;gt; $"{s1} {s2}"))&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    Console.WriteLine(result);&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;outputs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;apple aardvark&amp;#13;
date dog&amp;#13;
grape goat&amp;#13;
grape gorilla&amp;#13;
honeydew hippopotamus&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast, a “left join” (also known as a “left outer join”) would yield the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;apple aardvark&amp;#13;
banana&amp;#13;
cherry&amp;#13;
date dog&amp;#13;
grape goat&amp;#13;
grape gorilla&amp;#13;
honeydew hippopotamus&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that it has all of the same output as with the “inner join,” except it has at least one row for every &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; element, even if there’s no matching element in the &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt; row. And then a “right join” (also known as a “right outer join”) would yield the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;apple aardvark&amp;#13;
date dog&amp;#13;
 elephant&amp;#13;
grape goat&amp;#13;
grape gorilla&amp;#13;
honeydew hippopotamus&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again, all the same output as with the “inner join,” except it has at least one row for every &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt; element, even if there’s no matching element in the &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; row.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to .NET 10, there was no &lt;code&gt;LeftJoin&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;RightJoin&lt;/code&gt;, but their semantics could be achieved using a combination of &lt;code&gt;GroupJoin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SelectMany&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;DefaultIfEmpty&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;public static IEnumerable&amp;lt;TResult&amp;gt; LeftJoin&amp;lt;TOuter, TInner, TKey, TResult&amp;gt;(&amp;#13;
    this IEnumerable&amp;lt;TOuter&amp;gt; outer, IEnumerable&amp;lt;TInner&amp;gt; inner,&amp;#13;
    Func&amp;lt;TOuter, TKey&amp;gt; outerKeySelector, Func&amp;lt;TInner, TKey&amp;gt; innerKeySelector,&amp;#13;
    Func&amp;lt;TOuter, TInner?, TResult&amp;gt; resultSelector) =&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    outer&amp;#13;
    .GroupJoin(inner, outerKeySelector, innerKeySelector, (o, inners) =&amp;gt; (o, inners))&amp;#13;
    .SelectMany(x =&amp;gt; x.inners.DefaultIfEmpty(), (x, i) =&amp;gt; resultSelector(x.o, i));&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;GroupJoin&lt;/code&gt; creates a group for each &lt;code&gt;outer&lt;/code&gt; (“left”) element, where the group contains all matching items from &lt;code&gt;inner&lt;/code&gt; (“right”). We can flatten those results by using &lt;code&gt;SelectMany&lt;/code&gt;, such that we end up with an output for each pairing, using &lt;code&gt;DefaultIfEmpty&lt;/code&gt; to ensure that there’s always at least a default inner element to pair. We can do the exact same thing for a &lt;code&gt;RightJoin&lt;/code&gt;: in fact, we can implement the right join just by delegating to the left join and flipping all the arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;public static IEnumerable&amp;lt;TResult&amp;gt; RightJoin&amp;lt;TOuter, TInner, TKey, TResult&amp;gt;(&amp;#13;
    this IEnumerable&amp;lt;TOuter&amp;gt; outer, IEnumerable&amp;lt;TInner&amp;gt; inner,&amp;#13;
    Func&amp;lt;TOuter, TKey&amp;gt; outerKeySelector, Func&amp;lt;TInner, TKey&amp;gt; innerKeySelector,&amp;#13;
    Func&amp;lt;TOuter, TInner?, TResult&amp;gt; resultSelector) =&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    inner.LeftJoin(outer, innerKeySelector, outerKeySelector, (i, o) =&amp;gt; resultSelector(o, i));&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, you no longer need to do that yourself, and this isn’t how the new &lt;code&gt;LeftJoin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RightJoin&lt;/code&gt; methods are implemented in .NET 10. We can see the difference with a benchmark:&lt;/p&gt;

In the specialized iterator implementation used for &lt;code&gt;Take&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Skip&lt;/code&gt;, this PR simply checks in the &lt;code&gt;ToList&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ToArray&lt;/code&gt; implementations whether the source is something from which we can easily get a &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (namely a &lt;code&gt;T[]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;). If it is, rather than copying elements one by one into the destination, it can slice the retrieved span and use its &lt;code&gt;CopyTo&lt;/code&gt;, which, depending on the &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;, may even be vectorized.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;LINQ in .NET 10 also sees a few notable enhancements for Native AOT. The code for LINQ has grown over time, as all of these various specializations have found their way into the codebase. These optimizations are generally implemented by deriving specialized iterators from a base &lt;code&gt;Iterator&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which has a bunch of &lt;code&gt;abstract&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; methods for performing the subsequent operation (e.g. &lt;code&gt;Contains&lt;/code&gt;). With Native AOT, any use of a method like &lt;code&gt;Enumerable.Contains&lt;/code&gt; then prevents the corresponding implementations on all of those specializations from being trimmed away, leading to non-trivial increase in assembly code size. As such, years ago multiple builds of &lt;code&gt;System.Linq.dll&lt;/code&gt; were introduced into the &lt;code&gt;dotnet/runtime&lt;/code&gt; build system: one focused on speed, and one focused on size. When building &lt;code&gt;System.Linq.dll&lt;/code&gt; to go with coreclr, you’d end up with the speed-optimized build that has all of these specializations. When building &lt;code&gt;System.Linq.dll&lt;/code&gt; to go with other flavors, like Native AOT, you’d instead get the size-optimized build, which eschews many of the LINQ optimizations that have been added in the last decade. And as this was a build-time decision, developers using one of these platforms didn’t get a choice; as you learn in kindergarten, “you get what you get and you don’t get upset.” Now in .NET 10, if you do forget what you learned in kindergarten and you do get upset, you have recourse: thanks to dotnet/runtime#111743 and dotnet/runtime#109978, this setting is now a feature switch rather than a build-time configuration. So, in particular if you’re publishing for Native AOT and you’d prefer all the speed-focused optimizations, you can add &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;UseSizeOptimizedLinq&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/UseSizeOptimizedLinq&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to your project file and be happy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the need for that switch is now also reduced significantly by dotnet/runtime#118156. When this size/speed split was previously introduced into the &lt;code&gt;System.Linq.dll&lt;/code&gt; build, all of these specializations were eschewed, without a lot of an analysis for tradeoffs involved; as this was focused on optimizing for size, any specialized overrides were removed, no matter how much space they actually saved. Many of those savings turned out to be minimal, however, and in a variety of situations, the throughput cost was significant. This PR brings back some of the more impactful specializations where the throughput gains significantly outweigh the relatively-minimal size cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Frozen Collections&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;FrozenDictionary&amp;lt;TKey, TValue&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FrozenSet&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; collection types were introduced in .NET 8 as collections optimized for the common scenario of creating a long-lived collection that’s then read from a lot. They spend more time at construction in exchange for faster read operations. Under the covers, this is achieved in part by having specializations of the implementations that are optimized for different types of data or shapes of input. .NET 9 improved upon the implementations, and .NET 10 takes it even further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;FrozenDictionary&amp;lt;TKey, TValue&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; exerts a lot of energy for &lt;code&gt;TKey&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, as that is such a common use case. It also has specializations for &lt;code&gt;TKey&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;Int32&lt;/code&gt;. dotnet/runtime#111886 and dotnet/runtime#112298 extend that further by adding specializations for when &lt;code&gt;TKey&lt;/code&gt; is any primitive integral type that’s the size of an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; or smaller (e.g. &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ushort&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) as well as enums backed by such primitives (which represent the vast, vast majority of enums used in practice). In particular, they handle the common case where these values are densely packed, in which case they implement the dictionary as an array that it can index into based on the integer’s value. This makes for a very efficient lookup, while not consuming too much additional space: it’s only used when the values are dense and thus won’t be wasting many empty slots in the array.&lt;/p&gt;

Alternate lookups are a mechanism that enables getting a proxy for a dictionary or set that’s keyed with a different key from &lt;code&gt;TKey&lt;/code&gt;, most commonly a &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; when &lt;code&gt;TKey&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;. As noted, both &lt;code&gt;FrozenDictionary&amp;lt;TKey, TValue&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FrozenSet&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; achieve their goals by having different implementations based on the nature of the indexed data, and that specialization is achieved by virtual methods that derived specializations override. The JIT is typically able to minimize the costs of such virtuals, especially if the collections are stored in &lt;code&gt;static readonly&lt;/code&gt; fields. However, the alternate lookup support complicated things, as it introduced a virtual method with a generic method parameter (the alternate key type), otherwise known as GVM. “GVM” might as well be a four-letter word in performance circles, as they’re hard for the runtime to optimize. The purpose of these alternate lookups is primarily performance, but the use of a GVM significantly reduced those performance gains. dotnet/runtime#108732 from @andrewjsaid addresses this by changing the frequency with which a GVM needs to be invoked. Rather than the lookup operation itself being a generic virtual method, the PR introduces a separate generic virtual method that retrieves a delegate for performing the lookup; the retrieval of that delegate still incurs GVM penalties, but once the delegate is retrieved, it can be cached, and invoking it does not incur said overheads. This results in measurable improvements on throughput.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;BitArray&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;BitArray&lt;/code&gt; provides support for exactly what its name says, a bit array. You create it with the desired number of values and can then read and write a &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt; for each index, turning the corresponding bit to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; accordingly. It also provides a variety of helper operations for processing the whole bit array, such as for Boolean logic operations like &lt;code&gt;And&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Not&lt;/code&gt;. Where possible, those operations are vectorized, taking advantage of SIMD to process many bits per instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, for situations where you want to write custom manipulations of the bits, you only have two options: use the indexer (or corresponding &lt;code&gt;Get&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt; methods), which means multiple instructions required to process each bit, or use &lt;code&gt;CopyTo&lt;/code&gt; to extract all of the bits to a separate array, which means you need to allocate (or at least rent) such an array and pay for the memory copy before you can then manipulate the bits. There’s also not a great way to then copy those bits back if you wanted to manipulate the &lt;code&gt;BitArray&lt;/code&gt; in place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#116308 adds a &lt;code&gt;CollectionsMarshal.AsBytes(BitArray)&lt;/code&gt; method that returns a &lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; directly referencing the &lt;code&gt;BitArray&lt;/code&gt;‘s underlying storage. This provides a very efficient way to get access to all the bits, which then makes it possible to write (or reuse) vectorized algorithms. Say, for example, you wanted to use a &lt;code&gt;BitArray&lt;/code&gt; to represent a binary embedding (an “embedding” is a vector representation of the semantic meaning of some data, basically an array of numbers, each one corresponding to some aspect of the data; a binary embedding uses a single bit for each number). To determine how semantically similar two inputs are, you get an embedding for each and then perform a distance or similarity calculation on the two. For binary embeddings, a common distance metric is “hamming distance,” which effectively lines up the bits and tells you the number of positions that have different values, e.g. &lt;code&gt;0b1100&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;0b1010&lt;/code&gt; have a hamming distance of 2. Helpfully, &lt;code&gt;TensorPrimitives.HammingBitDistance&lt;/code&gt; provides an implementation of this, accepting two &lt;code&gt;ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s and computing the number of bits that differ between them. With &lt;code&gt;CollectionsMarshal.AsBytes&lt;/code&gt;, we can now utilize that helper directly with the contents of &lt;code&gt;BitArray&lt;/code&gt;s, both saving us the effort of having to write it manually and benefiting from any optimizations in &lt;code&gt;HammingBitDistance&lt;/code&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The main motivation for this PR was adding the &lt;code&gt;AsBytes&lt;/code&gt; method, but doing so triggered a series of other modifications that themselves help with performance. For example, rather than backing the &lt;code&gt;BitArray&lt;/code&gt; with an &lt;code&gt;int[]&lt;/code&gt; as was previously done, it’s now backed by a &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt;, and rather than reading elements one by one in the &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt;-based constructor, vectorized copy operations are now being used (they were already being used and continue to be used in the &lt;code&gt;int[]&lt;/code&gt;-based constructor).&lt;/p&gt;

When a full&lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;is appended to, the typical process is a new larger array is allocated, all of the existing elements are copied over (one array copy), and then the new element is stored into the array in the next available slot. If that same growth routine is used when inserting rather than appending an element, you possibly end up copying some elements twice: you first copy over all of the elements into the new array, and then to handle the insert, you may again need to copy some of the elements you already copied as part of shifting them to make room for the insertion at the new location. In the extreme, if you’re inserting at index 0, you copy all of the elements into the new array, and then you copy all of the elements again to shift them by one slot. The same applies when inserting a range of elements, so with this PR, rather than first copying over all of the elements and then shifting a subset,&lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;now grows by copying the elements above and below the target range for the insertion to their correct location and then fills in the target range with the inserted elements.&lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0 using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes; using BenchmarkDotNet.Running; BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Tests).Assembly).Run(args); [HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD")] public partial class Tests { private readonly int[] _data = [1, 2, 3, 4]; [Benchmark] public List&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; Test() { List&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; list = new(4); list.AddRange(_data); list.InsertRange(0, _data); return list; } }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Runtime&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Mean&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Ratio&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Test&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.NET 9.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;48.65 ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.00&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Test&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.NET 10.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;30.07 ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.62&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;ConcurrentDictionary&amp;lt;TKey, TValue&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. dotnet/runtime#108065 from @koenigst changes how a&lt;code&gt;ConcurrentDictionary&lt;/code&gt;‘s backing array is sized when it’s cleared.&lt;code&gt;ConcurrentDictionary&lt;/code&gt;is implemented with an array of linked lists, and when the collection is constructed, a constructor parameter allows for presizing that array. Due to the concurrent nature of the dictionary and its implementation,&lt;code&gt;Clear&lt;/code&gt;‘ing it necessitates creating a new array rather than just using part of the old one. When that new array was created, it reset to using the default size. This PR tweaks that to remember the initial capacity requested by the user, and using that initial size again when constructing the new array.&lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0 using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes; using BenchmarkDotNet.Running; using System.Collections.Concurrent; BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Tests).Assembly).Run(args); [MemoryDiagnoser(displayGenColumns: false)] [HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD")] public partial class Tests { private ConcurrentDictionary&amp;lt;int, int&amp;gt; _data = new(concurrencyLevel: 1, capacity: 1024); [Benchmark] public void ClearAndAdd() { _data.Clear(); for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 1024; i++) { _data.TryAdd(i, i); } } }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Runtime&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Mean&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Ratio&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Allocated&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Alloc Ratio&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;ClearAndAdd&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.NET 9.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;51.95 us&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.00&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;134.36 KB&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.00&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ClearAndAdd&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.NET 10.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;30.32 us&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.58&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;48.73 KB&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.36&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dictionary&amp;lt;TKey, TValue&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;code&gt;Dictionary&lt;/code&gt;is one of the most popular collection types across .NET, and&lt;code&gt;TKey&lt;/code&gt;==&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;is one of (if not the) most popular forms. dotnet/runtime#117427 makes dictionary lookups with constant&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;s much faster. You might expect it would be a complicated change, but it ends up being just a few strategic tweaks. A variety of methods for operating on&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;s are already known to the JIT and already have optimized implementations for when dealing with constants. All this PR needed to do was change which methods&lt;code&gt;Dictionary&amp;lt;TKey, TValue&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;was using in its optimized&lt;code&gt;TryGetValue&lt;/code&gt;lookup path, and because that path is often inlined, a constant argument to&lt;code&gt;TryGetValue&lt;/code&gt;can be exposed as a constant to these helpers, e.g.&lt;code&gt;string.Equals&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0 using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes; using BenchmarkDotNet.Running; BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Tests).Assembly).Run(args); [HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD")] public partial class Tests { private Dictionary&amp;lt;string, int&amp;gt; _data = new() { ["a"] = 1, ["b"] = 2, ["c"] = 3, ["d"] = 4, ["e"] = 5 }; [Benchmark] public int Get() =&amp;gt; _data["a"] + _data["b"] + _data["c"] + _data["d"] + _data["e"]; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Runtime&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Mean&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Ratio&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Get&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.NET 9.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;33.81 ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.00&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Get&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.NET 10.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14.02 ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.41&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;OrderedDictionary&amp;lt;TKey, TValue&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. dotnet/runtime#109324 adds new overloads of&lt;code&gt;TryAdd&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;TryGetValue&lt;/code&gt;that provide the index of the added or retrieved element in the collection. This index can then be used in subsequent operations on the dictionary to access the same slot. For example, if you want to implement an&lt;code&gt;AddOrUpdate&lt;/code&gt;operation on top of&lt;code&gt;OrderedDictionary&lt;/code&gt;, you need to perform one or two operations, first trying to add the item, and then if found to already exist, updating it, and that update can benefit from targeting the exact index that contains the element rather than it needing to do another keyed lookup.&lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes; using BenchmarkDotNet.Running; BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Tests).Assembly).Run(args); [HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD")] public partial class Tests { private OrderedDictionary&amp;lt;string, int&amp;gt; _dictionary = new(); [Benchmark(Baseline = true)] public void Old() =&amp;gt; AddOrUpdate_Old(_dictionary, "key", k =&amp;gt; 1, (k, v) =&amp;gt; v + 1); [Benchmark] public void New() =&amp;gt; AddOrUpdate_New(_dictionary, "key", k =&amp;gt; 1, (k, v) =&amp;gt; v + 1); private static void AddOrUpdate_Old(OrderedDictionary&amp;lt;string, int&amp;gt; d, string key, Func&amp;lt;string, int&amp;gt; addFunc, Func&amp;lt;string, int, int&amp;gt; updateFunc) { if (d.TryGetValue(key, out int existing)) { d[key] = updateFunc(key, existing); } else { d.Add(key, addFunc(key)); } } private static void AddOrUpdate_New(OrderedDictionary&amp;lt;string, int&amp;gt; d, string key, Func&amp;lt;string, int&amp;gt; addFunc, Func&amp;lt;string, int, int&amp;gt; updateFunc) { if (d.TryGetValue(key, out int existing, out int index)) { d.SetAt(index, updateFunc(key, existing)); } else { d.Add(key, addFunc(key)); } } }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Mean&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Ratio&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Old&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6.961 ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.00&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;New&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.201 ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.60&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;ImmutableArray&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The&lt;code&gt;ImmutableCollectionsMarshal&lt;/code&gt;class already exposes an&lt;code&gt;AsArray&lt;/code&gt;method that enables retrieving the backing&lt;code&gt;T[]&lt;/code&gt;from an&lt;code&gt;ImmutableArray&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. However, if you had an&lt;code&gt;ImmutableArray&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.Builder&lt;/code&gt;, there was previously no way to access the backing store it was using. dotnet/runtime#112177 enables doing so, with an&lt;code&gt;AsMemory&lt;/code&gt;method that retrieves the underlying storage as a&lt;code&gt;Memory&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;InlineArray&lt;/code&gt;. .NET 8 introduced&lt;code&gt;InlineArrayAttribute&lt;/code&gt;, which can be used to attribute a struct containing a single field; the attribute accepts a count, and the runtime replicates the struct’s field that number of times, as if you’d logically copy/pasted the field repeatedly. The runtime also ensures that the storage is contiguous and appropriately aligned, such that if you had an indexible collection that pointed to the beginning of the struct, you could use it as an array. And it so happens such a collection exists:&lt;code&gt;Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. C# 12 then makes it easy to treat any such attributed struct as a span, e.g.&lt;code&gt;[InlineArray(8)] internal struct EightStrings { private string _field; } ... EightStrings strings = default; Span&amp;lt;string&amp;gt; span = strings;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The C# compiler will itself emit code that uses this capability. For example, if you use collection expressions to initialize a span, you’re likely triggering the compiler to emit an&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;InlineArray&lt;/code&gt;. When I write this:&lt;code&gt;public void M(int a, int b, int c, int d) { Span&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; span = [a, b, c, d]; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;the compiler emits something like the following equivalent:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;public void M(int a, int b, int c, int d) { &amp;lt;&amp;gt;y__InlineArray4&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; buffer = default(&amp;lt;&amp;gt;y__InlineArray4&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;); &amp;lt;PrivateImplementationDetails&amp;gt;.InlineArrayElementRef&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;y__InlineArray4&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;, int&amp;gt;(ref buffer, 0) = a; &amp;lt;PrivateImplementationDetails&amp;gt;.InlineArrayElementRef&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;y__InlineArray4&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;, int&amp;gt;(ref buffer, 1) = b; &amp;lt;PrivateImplementationDetails&amp;gt;.InlineArrayElementRef&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;y__InlineArray4&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;, int&amp;gt;(ref buffer, 2) = c; &amp;lt;PrivateImplementationDetails&amp;gt;.InlineArrayElementRef&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;y__InlineArray4&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;, int&amp;gt;(ref buffer, 3) = d; &amp;lt;PrivateImplementationDetails&amp;gt;.InlineArrayAsSpan&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;y__InlineArray4&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;, int&amp;gt;(ref buffer, 4); }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;where it has defined that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;y__InlineArray4&lt;/code&gt;like this:&lt;code&gt;[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Auto)] [InlineArray(4)] internal struct &amp;lt;&amp;gt;y__InlineArray4&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; { [CompilerGenerated] private T _element0; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shows up elsewhere, too. For example, C# 13 introduced support for using&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;params&lt;/code&gt;with collections other than arrays, including spans, so now I can write this:&lt;code&gt;public void Caller(int a, int b, int c, int d) =&amp;gt; M(a, b, c, d); public void M(params ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; span) { }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;and for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Caller&lt;/code&gt;we’ll see very similar code emitted to what I previously showed, with the compiler manufacturing such an&lt;code&gt;InlineArray&lt;/code&gt;type. As you might imagine, the popularity of the features that cause the compiler to produce these types has caused there to be a lot of them emitted. Each type is specific to a particular length, so while the compiler will reuse them, a) it can end up needing to emit a lot to cover different lengths, and b) it emits them as internal to each assembly that needs them, so there can end up being a lot of duplication. Looking just at the shared framework for .NET 9 (the core libraries like&lt;code&gt;System.Private.CoreLib&lt;/code&gt;that ship as part of the runtime), there are ~140 of these types… all of which are for sizes no larger than 8. For .NET 10, dotnet/runtime#113403 adds a set of public&lt;code&gt;InlineArray2&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;InlineArray3&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, etc., that should cover the vast majority of sizes the compiler would otherwise need to emit types. In the near future, the C# compiler will be updated to use those new types when available instead of emitting its own, thereby yielding non-trivial size savings.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;I/O&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In previous .NET releases, there have been concerted efforts that have invested a lot in improving specific areas of I/O performance, such as completely rewriting &lt;code&gt;FileStream&lt;/code&gt; in .NET 6. Nothing as comprehensive as that was done for I/O in .NET 10, but there are some nice one-off improvements that can still have a measurable impact on certain scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Unix, when a &lt;code&gt;MemoryMappedFile&lt;/code&gt; is created and it’s not associated with a particular &lt;code&gt;FileStream&lt;/code&gt;, it needs to create some kind of backing memory for the MMF’s data. On Linux, it’d try to use &lt;code&gt;shm_open&lt;/code&gt;, which creates a shared memory object with appropriate semantics. However, in the years since &lt;code&gt;MemoryMappedFile&lt;/code&gt; was initially enabled on Linux, the Linux kernel has added support for anonymous files and the &lt;code&gt;memfd_create&lt;/code&gt; function that creates them. These are ideal for &lt;code&gt;MemoryMappedFile&lt;/code&gt; and much more efficient, so dotnet/runtime#105178 from @am11 switches over to using &lt;code&gt;memfd_create&lt;/code&gt; when it’s available.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;FileSystemWatcher&lt;/code&gt; is improved in dotnet/runtime#116830. The primary purpose for this PR was to fix a memory leak, where on Windows disposing of a &lt;code&gt;FileSystemWatcher&lt;/code&gt; while it was in use could end up leaking some objects. However, it also addresses a performance issue specific to Windows. &lt;code&gt;FileSystemWatcher&lt;/code&gt; needs to pass a buffer to the OS for the OS to populate with file-changed information. That meant that &lt;code&gt;FileSystemWatcher&lt;/code&gt; was allocating a managed array and then immediately pinning that buffer so it could pass a pointer to it into native code. For certain consumption of &lt;code&gt;FileSystemWatcher&lt;/code&gt;, especially in scenarios where lots of &lt;code&gt;FileSystemWatcher&lt;/code&gt; instances are created, that pinning could contribute to non-trivial heap fragmentation. Interestingly, though, this array is effectively never consumed as an array: all of the writes into it are performed in native code via the pointer that was passed to the OS, and all consumption of it in managed code to read out the events are done via a span. That means the array nature of it doesn’t really matter, and we’re better off just allocating a native rather than managed buffer that then requires pinning.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;BufferedStream&lt;/code&gt; gets a boost from dotnet/runtime#104822 from @ANahr. There is a curious and problematic inconsistency in &lt;code&gt;BufferedStream&lt;/code&gt; that’s been there since, well, forever as far as I can tell. It’s obviously been revisited in the past, and due to the super duper strong backwards compatibility concerns for .NET Framework (where a key feature is that the framework doesn’t change), the issue was never fixed. There’s even a comment in the code to this point:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// We should not be flushing here, but only writing to the underlying stream, but previous version flushed, so we keep this.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;BufferedStream&lt;/code&gt; does what its name says. It wraps an underlying &lt;code&gt;Stream&lt;/code&gt; and buffers access to it. So, for example, if it were configured with a buffer size of 1000, and you wrote 100 bytes to the &lt;code&gt;BufferedStream&lt;/code&gt; at a time, your first 10 writes would just go to the buffer and the underlying &lt;code&gt;Stream&lt;/code&gt; wouldn’t be touched at all. Only on the 11th write would the buffer be full and need to be flushed (meaning written) to the underlying &lt;code&gt;Stream&lt;/code&gt;. So far, so good. Moreover, there’s a difference between flushing to the underlying stream and flushing the underlying stream. Those sound almost identical, but they’re not: in the former case, we’re effectively calling &lt;code&gt;_stream.Write(buffer)&lt;/code&gt; to write the buffer to that stream, and in the latter case, we’re effectively calling &lt;code&gt;_stream.Flush()&lt;/code&gt; to force any buffering that stream was doing to propagate it to its underlying destination. &lt;code&gt;BufferedStream&lt;/code&gt; really shouldn’t be in the business of doing the latter when &lt;code&gt;Write&lt;/code&gt;‘ing to the &lt;code&gt;BufferedStream&lt;/code&gt;, and in general it wasn’t… except in one case. Whereas most of the writing-related methods would not call &lt;code&gt;_stream.Flush()&lt;/code&gt;, for some reason &lt;code&gt;WriteByte&lt;/code&gt; did. In particular for cases where the &lt;code&gt;BufferedStream&lt;/code&gt; is configured with a small buffer, and where the underlying stream’s flush is relatively expensive (e.g. &lt;code&gt;DeflateStream.Flush&lt;/code&gt; forces any buffered bytes to be compressed and emitted), that can be problematic for performance, nevermind the inconsistency. This change simply fixes the inconsistency, such that &lt;code&gt;WriteByte&lt;/code&gt; no longer forces a flush on the underlying stream.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While on the subject of compression, it’s worth calling out several improvements in &lt;code&gt;System.IO.Compression&lt;/code&gt; in .NET 10, too. As noted in Performance Improvements in .NET 9, &lt;code&gt;DeflateStream&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;GZipStream&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ZLibStream&lt;/code&gt; are managed wrappers around an underlying native &lt;code&gt;zlib&lt;/code&gt; library. For a long time, that was the original &lt;code&gt;zlib&lt;/code&gt; (madler/zlib). Then it was Intel’s &lt;code&gt;zlib-intel&lt;/code&gt; fork (intel/zlib), which is now archived and no longer maintained. In .NET 9, the library switched to using &lt;code&gt;zlib-ng&lt;/code&gt; (zlib-ng/zlib-ng), which is a modernized fork that’s well-maintained and optimized for a large number of hardware architectures. .NET 9 is based on &lt;code&gt;zlib-ng&lt;/code&gt; 2.2.1. dotnet/runtime#118457 updates it to use &lt;code&gt;zlib-ng&lt;/code&gt; 2.2.5. Compared with the 2.2.1 release, there are a variety of performance improvements in &lt;code&gt;zlib-ng&lt;/code&gt; itself, which .NET 10 then inherits, such as improved used of AVX2 and AVX512. Most importantly, though, the update includes a revert that undoes a cleanup change in the 2.2.0 release; the original change removed a workaround for a function that had been slow and was found to no longer be slow, but as it turns out, it’s still slow in some circumstances (long, highly compressible data), resulting in a throughput regression. The fix in 2.2.5 puts back the workaround to fix the regression.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The managed wrapper for &lt;code&gt;zlib&lt;/code&gt; also gains some improvements. dotnet/runtime#113587 from @edwardneal improves the case where multiple gzip payloads are being read from the underlying &lt;code&gt;Stream&lt;/code&gt;. Due to its nature, multiple complete gzip payloads can be written one after the other, and a single &lt;code&gt;GZipStream&lt;/code&gt; can be used to decompress all of them as if they were one. Each time it hit a boundary between payloads, the managed wrapper was throwing away the old interop handles and creating new ones, but it can instead take advantage of reset capabilities in the underlying &lt;code&gt;zlib&lt;/code&gt; library, shaving off some cycles associated with freeing and re-allocating the underlying data structures. This is a very biased micro-benchmark (a stream containing a 1000 gzip payloads that each decompresses into a single byte), highlighting the worst case, but it exemplifies the issue:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other components that sit above these streams, like &lt;code&gt;ZipArchive&lt;/code&gt;, have also improved. dotnet/runtime#103153 from @edwardneal updates &lt;code&gt;ZipArchive&lt;/code&gt; to not rely on &lt;code&gt;BinaryReader&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;BinaryWriter&lt;/code&gt;, avoiding their underlying buffer allocations and having more fine-grained control over how and when exactly data is encoded/decoded and written/read. And dotnet/runtime#102704 from @edwardneal reduces memory consumption and allocation when updating &lt;code&gt;ZipArchive&lt;/code&gt;s. A &lt;code&gt;ZipArchive&lt;/code&gt; update used to be “rewrite the world”: it loaded every entry’s data into memory and rewrote all the file headers, all entry data, and the “central directory” (what the zip format calls its catalog of all the entries in the archive). A large archive would have proportionally large allocation. This PR introduces change tracking plus ordering of entries so that only the portion of the file from the first actually affected entry (or one whose variable‑length metadata/data changed) is rewritten, rather than always rewriting the whole thing. The effects can be significant.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;code&gt;ZipArchive&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ZipFile&lt;/code&gt; also gain async APIs in dotnet/runtime#114421, a long requested feature that allows using async I/O while loading, manipulating, and saving zips.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, somewhere between performance and reliability, dotnet/roslyn-analyzers#7390 from @mpidash adds a new analyzer for &lt;code&gt;StreamReader.EndOfStream&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;StreamReader.EndOfStream&lt;/code&gt; seems like it should be harmless, but it’s quite the devious little property. The intent is to determine whether the reader is at the end up of the underlying &lt;code&gt;Stream&lt;/code&gt;. Seems easy enough. If the &lt;code&gt;StreamReader&lt;/code&gt; still has previously read data buffered, obviously it’s not at the end. And if the reader has previously seen EOF, e.g. &lt;code&gt;Read&lt;/code&gt; returned &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, then it obviously is at the end. But in all other situations, there’s no way to know you’re at the end of the stream (at least in the general case) without performing a read, which means this property does something properties should never do: perform I/O. Worse than just performing I/O, that read can be a blocking operation, e.g. if the &lt;code&gt;Stream&lt;/code&gt; represents a network stream for a &lt;code&gt;Socket&lt;/code&gt;, and performing a read actually means blocking until data is received. Even worse, though, is when it’s used in an asynchronous method, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;while (!reader.EndOfStream)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    string? line = await reader.ReadLineAsync();&amp;#13;
    ...&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now not only might &lt;code&gt;EndOfStream&lt;/code&gt; do I/O and block, it’s doing that in a method that’s supposed to do all of its waiting asynchronously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What makes this even more frustrating is that &lt;code&gt;EndOfStream&lt;/code&gt; isn’t even useful in a loop like that above. &lt;code&gt;ReadLineAsync&lt;/code&gt; will return a &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; string if it’s at the end of the stream, so the loop would instead be better as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;while (await reader.ReadLineAsync() is string line)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    ...&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simpler, cheaper, and no ticking time bombs of synchronous I/O. Thanks to this new analyzer, any such use of &lt;code&gt;EndOfStream&lt;/code&gt; in an async method will trigger &lt;code&gt;CA2024&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Networking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Networking-related operations show up in almost every modern workload. Past releases of .NET have seen a lot of energy exerted on whittling away at networking overheads, as these components are used over and over and over, often in critical paths, and the overheads can add up. .NET 10 continues the streamlining trend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As was seen with core primitives earlier, &lt;code&gt;IPAddress&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IPNetwork&lt;/code&gt; are both imbued with UTF8 parsing capabilities, thanks to dotnet/runtime#102144 from @edwardneal. As is the case with most other such types in the core libraries, the UTF8-based implementation and the UTF16-based implementation are mostly the same implementation, sharing most of their code via generic methods parameterized on &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;. And as a result of the focus on enabling UTF8, not only can you parse UTF8 bytes directly rather than needing to transcode first, the existing code actually gets a bit faster.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Uri&lt;/code&gt;, used in the above benchmark, also gets some notable improvements. In fact, one of my favorite improvements in all of .NET 10 is in &lt;code&gt;Uri&lt;/code&gt;. The feature itself isn’t a performance improvement, but there are some interesting performance-related ramifications for it. In particular, since forever, &lt;code&gt;Uri&lt;/code&gt; has had a length limitation due to implementation details. &lt;code&gt;Uri&lt;/code&gt; keeps track of various offsets in the input, such as where the host portion starts, where the path starts, where the query starts, and so on. The implementer chose to use &lt;code&gt;ushort&lt;/code&gt; for each of these values rather than &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. That means the maximum length of a &lt;code&gt;Uri&lt;/code&gt; is then constrained to the lengths a &lt;code&gt;ushort&lt;/code&gt; can describe, namely 65,535 characters. That sounds like a ridiculously long &lt;code&gt;Uri&lt;/code&gt;, one no one would ever need to go beyond… until you consider data URIs. Data URIs embed a representation of arbitrary bytes, typically Base64 encoded, in the URI itself. This allows for files to be represented directly in links, and it’s become a common way for AI-related services to send and receive data payloads, like images. It doesn’t take a very large image to exceed 65K characters, however, especially with Base64 encoding increasing the payload size by ~33%. dotnet/runtime#117287 finally removes that limitation, so now &lt;code&gt;Uri&lt;/code&gt; can be used to represent very large data URIs, if desired. This, however, has some performance ramifications (beyond the few percentage increase in the size of &lt;code&gt;Uri&lt;/code&gt;, to accomodate the extra &lt;code&gt;ushort&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; bytes). In particular, &lt;code&gt;Uri&lt;/code&gt; implements path compression, so for example this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Console.WriteLine(new Uri("http://test/hello/../hello/../hello"));&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;prints out:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;http://test/hello&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the algorithm implementing that path compression is &lt;code&gt;O(N^2)&lt;/code&gt;. Oops. With a limit of 65K characters, such a quadratic complexity isn’t a security concern (as &lt;code&gt;O(N^2)&lt;/code&gt; operations can sometimes be, as if &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; is unbounded, it creates an attack vector where an attacker can do &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; work and get the attackee to do disproportionately more). But once the limit is removed entirely, it could be. As such, dotnet/runtime#117820 compensates by making the path compression &lt;code&gt;O(N)&lt;/code&gt;. And while in the general case, we don’t expect path compression to be a meaningfully impactful part of constructing &lt;code&gt;Uri&lt;/code&gt;, in degenerate cases, even under the old limit, the change can still make a measurable improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In the same vein, the longer the URI, the more effort is required to do whatever validation is needed in the constructor. &lt;code&gt;Uri&lt;/code&gt;‘s constructor needs to check whether the input has any Unicode characters that might need to be handled. Rather than checking all the characters one at a time, with dotnet/runtime#107357, &lt;code&gt;Uri&lt;/code&gt; can now use &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&lt;/code&gt; to more quickly rule out or find the first location of a character that needs to be looked at more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Other changes were made to &lt;code&gt;Uri&lt;/code&gt; that further reduce construction costs in various other cases, too. For cases where the URI host is an IPv6 address, e.g. &lt;code&gt;http://[2603:1020:201:10::10f]&lt;/code&gt;, dotnet/runtime#117292 recognizes that scope IDs are relatively rare and makes the cases without a scope ID cheaper in exchange for making the cases with a scope ID a little more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;(Note that the .NET 10 allocation is 8 bytes larger than the .NET 9 allocation due to the extra space required in this case for dropping the length limitation, as discussed earlier.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#117289 also improves construction for cases where the URI requires normalization, saving some allocations by using normalization routines over spans (which were added in dotnet/runtime#110465) instead of needing to allocate &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;s for the inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Various improvements have also found their way into the HTTP stack. For starters, the download helpers on &lt;code&gt;HttpClient&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;HttpContent&lt;/code&gt; have improved. These types expose helper methods for some of the most common forms of grabbing data; while a developer can grab the response &lt;code&gt;Stream&lt;/code&gt; and consume that efficiently, for simple and common cases like “just get the whole response as a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;” or “just get the whole response as a &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt;“, the &lt;code&gt;GetStringAsync&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;GetByteArrayAsync&lt;/code&gt; make that really easy to do. dotnet/runtime#109642 changes how these methods operate in order to better manage the temporary buffers that are required, especially in the case where the server hasn’t advertised a &lt;code&gt;Content-Length&lt;/code&gt;, such that the client doesn’t know ahead of time how much data to expect and thus how much space to allocate.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#117071 reduces overheads associated with HTTP header validation. In the &lt;code&gt;System.Net.Http&lt;/code&gt; implementation, some headers have dedicated parsers for them, while many (the majority of custom ones that services define) don’t. This PR recognizes that for these, the validation that needs to be performed amounts to only checking for forbidden newline characters, and the objects that were being created for all headers weren’t necessary for these.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For folks using HTTP/2, dotnet/runtime#112719 decreases per-connection memory consumption, by changing the &lt;code&gt;HPackDecoder&lt;/code&gt; to lazily grow its buffers, starting from expected-case sizing rather than worst-case. (“HPACK” is the header compression algorithm used by HTTP/2, utilizing a table shared between client and server for managing commonly transmitted headers.) It’s a little hard to measure in a micro-benchmark, since in a real app the connections get reused (and the benefits here aren’t about temporary allocation but rather connection density and overall working set), but we can get a glimpse of it by doing what you’re not supposed to do and create a new &lt;code&gt;HttpClient&lt;/code&gt; for each request (you’re not supposed to do that, or more specifically not supposed to create a new handler for each request, because doing so tears down the connection pool and the connections it contains… which is bad for an app but exactly what we want for our micro-benchmark).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Also, on Linux and macOS, all HTTP use (and, more generally, all socket interactions) gets a tad cheaper from dotnet/runtime#109052, which eliminates a &lt;code&gt;ConcurrentDictionary&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; lookup for each asynchronous operation that completes on a &lt;code&gt;Socket&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And for all you Native AOT fans, dotnet/runtime#117012 also adds a feature switch that enables trimming out the HTTP/3 implementation from &lt;code&gt;HttpClient&lt;/code&gt;, which can represent a very sizeable and “free” space savings if you’re not using HTTP/3 at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Searching&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Someone once told me that computer science was “all about sorting and searching.” That’s not far off. Searching in one way, shape, or form is an integral part of many applications and services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Regex&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether you love or hate the terse syntax, regular expressions (regex) continue to be an integral part of software development, with applications as part of both software and the software development process. As such, it’s had robust support in .NET since the early days of the platform, with the &lt;code&gt;System.Text.RegularExpressions&lt;/code&gt; namespace providing a feature-rich set of regex capabilities. The performance of &lt;code&gt;Regex&lt;/code&gt; was improved significantly in .NET 5 (Regex Performance Improvements in .NET 5) and then again in .NET 7, which also saw a significant amount of new functionality added (Regular Expression Improvements in .NET 7). It’s continued to be improved in every release since, and .NET 10 is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I’ve discussed in previous blog posts about regex and performance, there are two high-level ways regex engines are implemented, either with backtracking or without. Non-backtracking engines typically work by creating some form of finite automata that represents the pattern, and then for each character consumed from the input, moves around the deterministic finite automata (DFA, meaning you can be in only a single state at a time) or non-deterministic finite automata (NFA, meaning you can be in multiple states at a time), transitioning from one state to another. A key benefit of a non-backtracking engine is that it can often make linear guarantees about processing time, where an input string of length &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; can be processed in worst-case &lt;code&gt;O(N)&lt;/code&gt; time. A key downside of a non-backtracking engine is it can’t support all of the features developers are familiar with in modern regex engines, like back references. Backtracking engines are named as such because they’re able to “backtrack,” trying one approach to see if there’s a match and then going back and trying another. If you have the regex pattern &lt;code&gt;\w*\d&lt;/code&gt; (which matches any number of word characters followed by a single digit) and supply it with the string &lt;code&gt;"12"&lt;/code&gt;, a backtracking engine is likely to first try treating both the &lt;code&gt;'1'&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;'2'&lt;/code&gt; as word characters, then find that it doesn’t have anything to fulfill the &lt;code&gt;\d&lt;/code&gt;, and thus backtrack, instead treating only the &lt;code&gt;'1'&lt;/code&gt; as being consumed by the &lt;code&gt;\w*&lt;/code&gt;, and leaving the &lt;code&gt;'2'&lt;/code&gt; to be consumed by the &lt;code&gt;\d&lt;/code&gt;. Backtracking is how engines support features like back references, variable-length lookarounds, conditional expressions, and more. They can also have excellent performance, especially on the average and best cases. A key downside, however, is their worst case, where on some patterns they can suffer from “catastrophic backtracking.” That happens when all of that backtracking leads to exploring the same input over and over and over again, possibly consuming much more than linear time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since .NET 7, .NET has had an opt-in non-backtracking engine, which is what you get with &lt;code&gt;RegexOptions.NonBacktracking&lt;/code&gt;, Otherwise, it uses a backtracking engine, whether using the default interpreter, or a regex compiled to IL (&lt;code&gt;RegexOptions.Compiled&lt;/code&gt;), or a regex emitted as a custom C# implementation with the regex source generator (&lt;code&gt;[GeneratedRegex(...)]&lt;/code&gt;). These backtracking engines can yield exceptional performance, but due to their backtracking nature, they are susceptible to bad worst-case performance, which is why specifying timeouts to a &lt;code&gt;Regex&lt;/code&gt; is often encouraged, especially when using patterns of unknown provenance. Still, there are things backtracking engines can do to help mitigate some such backtracking, in particular avoiding the need for some of the backtracking in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the main tools backtracking engines offer for reduced backtracking is an “atomic” construct. Some regex syntaxes surface this via “possessive quantifiers,” while others, including .NET, surface it via “atomic groups.” They’re fundamentally the same thing, just expressed in the syntax differently. An atomic group in .NET’s regex syntax is a group that is never backtracked into. If we take our previous &lt;code&gt;\w*\d&lt;/code&gt; example, we could wrap the &lt;code&gt;\w*&lt;/code&gt; loop in an atomic group like this: &lt;code&gt;(?&amp;gt;\w*)\d&lt;/code&gt;. In doing so, whatever that &lt;code&gt;\w*&lt;/code&gt; consumes won’t change via backtracking after exiting the group and moving on to whatever comes after it in the pattern. So if I try to match &lt;code&gt;"12"&lt;/code&gt; with such a pattern, it’ll fail, because the &lt;code&gt;\w*&lt;/code&gt; will consume both characters, the &lt;code&gt;\d&lt;/code&gt; will have nothing to match, and no backtracking will be applied, because the &lt;code&gt;\w*&lt;/code&gt; is wrapped in an atomic group and thus exposes no backtracking opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that example, wrapping the &lt;code&gt;\w*&lt;/code&gt; with an atomic group changes the meaning of the pattern, and thus it’s not something that a regex engine could choose to do automatically. However, there are many cases where wrapping otherwise backtracking constructs in an atomic group does not observably change behavior, because any backtracking that would otherwise happen would provably never be fruitful. Consider a pattern &lt;code&gt;a*b&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;a*b&lt;/code&gt; is observably identical to &lt;code&gt;(?&amp;gt;a*)b&lt;/code&gt;, which says that the &lt;code&gt;a*&lt;/code&gt; should not be backtracked into. That’s because there’s nothing the &lt;code&gt;a*&lt;/code&gt; can “give back” (which can only be &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;s) that would satisfy what comes next in the pattern (which is only &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;). It’s thus valid for a backtracking engine to transform how it processes &lt;code&gt;a*b&lt;/code&gt; to instead be the equivalent of how it processes &lt;code&gt;(?&amp;gt;a*)b&lt;/code&gt;. And the .NET regex engine has been capable of such transformations since .NET 5. This can result in massive improvements to throughput. With backtracking, waving my hands, we effectively need to execute everything after the backtracking construct for each possible position we could backtrack to. So, for example, with &lt;code&gt;\w*SOMEPATTERN&lt;/code&gt;, if the &lt;code&gt;w*&lt;/code&gt; successfully initially consumes 100 characters, we then possibly need to try to match &lt;code&gt;SOMEPATTERN&lt;/code&gt; up to 100 different times, as we may need to backtrack up to 100 times and re-evaluate &lt;code&gt;SOMEPATTERN&lt;/code&gt; each time we give back one of the things initially matched. If we instead make that &lt;code&gt;(?&amp;gt;\w*)&lt;/code&gt;, we eliminate all but one of those! That makes improvements to this ability to automatically transform backtracking constructs to be non-backtracking possibly massive improvements in performance, and practically every release of .NET since .NET 5 has increased the set of patterns that are automatically transformed. .NET 10 included.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start with dotnet/runtime#117869, which teaches the regex optimizer about more “disjoint” sets. Consider the previous example of &lt;code&gt;a*b&lt;/code&gt;, and how I said we can make that &lt;code&gt;a*&lt;/code&gt; loop atomic because there’s nothing &lt;code&gt;a*&lt;/code&gt; can “give back” that matches &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. That is a general statement about auto-atomicity: a loop can be made atomic if it’s guaranteed to end with something that can’t possibly match the thing that comes after it. So, if I have &lt;code&gt;[abc]+[def]&lt;/code&gt;, that loop can be made atomic, because there’s nothing &lt;code&gt;[abc]&lt;/code&gt; can match that &lt;code&gt;[def]&lt;/code&gt; can also match. In contrast, if the expression were instead &lt;code&gt;[abc]+[cef]&lt;/code&gt;, that loop must not be made atomic automatically, as doing so could change behavior. The sets do overlap, as both can match &lt;code&gt;'c'&lt;/code&gt;. So, for example, if the input were just &lt;code&gt;"cc"&lt;/code&gt;, the original expression should match it (the &lt;code&gt;[abc]*&lt;/code&gt; loop would match &lt;code&gt;'c'&lt;/code&gt; with one iteration of the loop and then the second &lt;code&gt;'c'&lt;/code&gt; would satisfy the &lt;code&gt;[cef]&lt;/code&gt; set), but if the expression were instead &lt;code&gt;(?&amp;gt;[abc]+)[cef]&lt;/code&gt;, it would no longer match, as the &lt;code&gt;[abc]+&lt;/code&gt; would consume both &lt;code&gt;'c'&lt;/code&gt;s, and there’d be nothing left for the &lt;code&gt;[cef]&lt;/code&gt; set to match. Two sets that don’t have any overlap are referred to as being “disjoint,” and so the optimizer needs to be able to prove the disjointedness of sets in order to perform these kinds of auto-atomicity optimizations. The optimizer was already able to do so for many sets, in particular ones that were composed purely of characters or character ranges, e.g. &lt;code&gt;[ace]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[a-zA-Z0-9]&lt;/code&gt;. But many sets are instead composed of entire Unicode categories. For example, when you write &lt;code&gt;\d&lt;/code&gt;, unless you’ve specified &lt;code&gt;RegexOptions.ECMAScript&lt;/code&gt; that’s the same as &lt;code&gt;\p{Nd}&lt;/code&gt;, which says “match any character in the Unicode category of Number decimal digits”, aka all characters for which &lt;code&gt;char.GetUnicodeCategory&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;UnicodeCategory.DecimalDigitNumber&lt;/code&gt;. And the optimizer was unable to reason about overlap between such sets. So, for example, if you had the expression &lt;code&gt;\w*\p{Sm}&lt;/code&gt;, that matches anything that’s any number of word characters followed by a math symbol (&lt;code&gt;UnicodeCategory.MathSymbol&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;code&gt;\w&lt;/code&gt; is actually just a set of eight specific Unicode categories, such that the previous expression behaves identically to if I’d written &lt;code&gt;[\p{Ll}\p{Lu}\p{Lt}\p{Lm}\p{Lo}\p{Mn}\p{Nd}\p{Pc}]*\p{Sm}&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;\w&lt;/code&gt; is composed of &lt;code&gt;UnicodeCategory.UppercaseLetter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;UnicodeCategory.LowercaseLetter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;UnicodeCategory.TitlecaseLetter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;UnicodeCategory.ModiferLetter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;UnicodeCategory.OtherLetter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;UnicodeCategory.NonSpacingMark&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;UnicodeCategory.ModiferLetter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;UnicodeCategory.DecimalDigitNumber&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;UnicodeCategory.ConnectorPunctuation&lt;/code&gt;). Note that none of those eight categories is the same as &lt;code&gt;\p{Sm}&lt;/code&gt;, which means they’re disjoint, which means we can safely change that loop to being atomic without impacting behavior; it just makes it faster. One of the easiest ways to see the effect of this is to look at the output from the regex source generator. Before the change, if I look at the XML comment generated for that expression, I get this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/// ○ Match a word character greedily any number of times.&amp;#13;
/// ○ Match a character in the set [\p{Sm}].&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and after, I get this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/// ○ Match a word character atomically any number of times.&amp;#13;
/// ○ Match a character in the set [\p{Sm}].&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That one word change in the first sentence makes a huge difference. Here’s the relevant portion of the C# code emitted by the source generator for the matching routine before the change:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Match a word character greedily any number of times.&amp;#13;
//{&amp;#13;
    charloop_starting_pos = pos;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    int iteration = 0;&amp;#13;
    while ((uint)iteration &amp;lt; (uint)slice.Length &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Utilities.IsWordChar(slice[iteration]))&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        iteration++;&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    slice = slice.Slice(iteration);&amp;#13;
    pos += iteration;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    charloop_ending_pos = pos;&amp;#13;
    goto CharLoopEnd;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    CharLoopBacktrack:&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    if (Utilities.s_hasTimeout)&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        base.CheckTimeout();&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    if (charloop_starting_pos &amp;gt;= charloop_ending_pos)&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        return false; // The input didn't match.&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
    pos = --charloop_ending_pos;&amp;#13;
    slice = inputSpan.Slice(pos);&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    CharLoopEnd:&amp;#13;
//}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see how backtracking influences the emitted code. The core loop in there is iterating through as many word characters as it can match, but then before moving on, it remembers some position information about where it was. It also sets up a label for where subsequent code should jump to if it needs to backtrack; that code undoes one of the matched characters and then retries everything that came after it. If the code needs to backtrack again, it’ll again undo one of the characters and retry. And so on. Now, here’s what the code looks like after the change:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Match a word character atomically any number of times.&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    int iteration = 0;&amp;#13;
    while ((uint)iteration &amp;lt; (uint)slice.Length &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Utilities.IsWordChar(slice[iteration]))&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        iteration++;&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    slice = slice.Slice(iteration);&amp;#13;
    pos += iteration;&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of that backtracking gunk is gone; the loop matches as much as it can, and that’s that. You can see the effect this has one some cases with a micro-benchmark like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0&amp;#13;

}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a simple test where we’re trying to match any positive number of whitespace characters followed by any positive number of non-whitespace characters, giving it an input composed entirely of whitespace. Without atomicity, the engine is going to consume all of the whitespace as part of the &lt;code&gt;\s+&lt;/code&gt; but will then find that there isn’t any non-whitespace available to match the &lt;code&gt;\S+&lt;/code&gt;. What does it do then? It backtracks, gives back one of the hundred spaces consumed by &lt;code&gt;\s+&lt;/code&gt;, and tries again to match the &lt;code&gt;\S+&lt;/code&gt;. It won’t match, so it backtracks again. And again. And again. A hundred times, until it has nothing left to try and gives up. With atomicity, all that backtracking goes away, allowing it to fail faster.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#117892 is a related improvement. In regex, &lt;code&gt;\b&lt;/code&gt; is called a “word boundary”; it checks whether the wordness of the previous character (whether the previous character matches &lt;code&gt;\w&lt;/code&gt;) matches the wordness of the next character, calling it a boundary if they differ. You can see this in the engine’s &lt;code&gt;IsBoundary&lt;/code&gt; helper’s implementation, which follows (note that according to TR18 whether a character is considered a boundary word char is almost exactly the same as &lt;code&gt;\w&lt;/code&gt;, except with two additional zero-width Unicode characters also included):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;internal static bool IsBoundary(ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; inputSpan, int index)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    int indexM1 = index - 1;&amp;#13;
    return ((uint)indexM1 &amp;lt; (uint)inputSpan.Length &amp;amp;&amp;amp; RegexCharClass.IsBoundaryWordChar(inputSpan[indexM1])) !=&amp;#13;
           ((uint)index &amp;lt; (uint)inputSpan.Length &amp;amp;&amp;amp; RegexCharClass.IsBoundaryWordChar(inputSpan[index]));&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The optimizer already had a special-case in its auto-atomicity logic that had knowledge of boundaries and their relationship to &lt;code&gt;\w&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\d&lt;/code&gt;, specifically. So, if you had &lt;code&gt;\w+\b&lt;/code&gt;, the optimizer would recognize that in order for the &lt;code&gt;\b&lt;/code&gt; to match, what comes after what the &lt;code&gt;\w+&lt;/code&gt; matches must necessarily not match &lt;code&gt;\w&lt;/code&gt;, because then it wouldn’t be a boundary, and thus the &lt;code&gt;\w+&lt;/code&gt; could be made atomic. Similarly, with a pattern of &lt;code&gt;\d+\b&lt;/code&gt;, it would recognize that what came after must not be in &lt;code&gt;\d&lt;/code&gt;, and could make the loop atomic. It didn’t generalize this, though. Now in .NET 10, it does. This PR teaches the optimizer how to recognize subsets of &lt;code&gt;\w&lt;/code&gt;, because, as with the special-case of &lt;code&gt;\d&lt;/code&gt;, any subset of &lt;code&gt;\w&lt;/code&gt; can similarly benefit: if what comes before the &lt;code&gt;\b&lt;/code&gt; is a word character, what comes after must not be. Thus, with this PR, an expression like &lt;code&gt;[a-zA-Z]+\b&lt;/code&gt; will now have the loop made atomic.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just doing a better job of set disjointedness analysis is helpful, but more so is actually recognizing whole new classes of things that can be made atomic. In prior releases, the auto-atomicity optimizations only kicked in for loops over single characters, e.g. &lt;code&gt;a*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[abc]*?&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[^abc]*&lt;/code&gt;. That is obviously only a subset of loops, as many loops are composed of more than just a single character; loops can surround any regex construct. Even a capture group thrown into the mix would knock the auto-atomicity behavior off the rails. Now with dotnet/runtime#117943, a significant number of loops involving more complicated constructs can be made atomic. Loops larger than a single character are tricky, though, as there are more things that need to be taken into account when reasoning through atomicity. With a single character, we only need to prove disjointedness for that one character with what comes after it. But, consider an expression like &lt;code&gt;([a-z][0-9])+a1&lt;/code&gt;. Can that loop be made atomic? What comes after the loop (&lt;code&gt;'a'&lt;/code&gt;) is provably disjoint from what ends the loop (&lt;code&gt;[0-9]&lt;/code&gt;), and yet making this loop atomic automatically would change behavior and be a no-no. Imagine if the input were &lt;code&gt;"b2a1"&lt;/code&gt;. That matches; if this expression is processed normally, the loop would match a single iteration, consuming the &lt;code&gt;"b2"&lt;/code&gt;, and then the &lt;code&gt;a1&lt;/code&gt; after the loop would consume the corresponding &lt;code&gt;a1&lt;/code&gt; in the input. But, if the loop were made atomic, e.g. &lt;code&gt;(?&amp;gt;([a-z][0-9])+)a1&lt;/code&gt;, the loop would end up performing two iterations and consuming both the &lt;code&gt;"b2"&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;"a1"&lt;/code&gt;, leaving nothing for the &lt;code&gt;a1&lt;/code&gt; in the pattern. As it turns out, we not only need to ensure what ends the loop is disjoint from what comes after it, we also need to ensure that what starts the loop is disjoint from what comes after it. That’s not all, though. Now consider an expression &lt;code&gt;^(a|ab)+$&lt;/code&gt;. This matches an entire input composed of &lt;code&gt;"a"&lt;/code&gt;s and &lt;code&gt;"ab"&lt;/code&gt;s. Given an input string like &lt;code&gt;"aba"&lt;/code&gt;, this will match successfully, as it will consume the &lt;code&gt;"ab"&lt;/code&gt; with the second branch of the alternation, and then consume the remaining &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; with the first branch of the alternation on the next iteration of the loop. But now consider what happens if we make the loop atomic: &lt;code&gt;^(?&amp;gt;(a|ab)+)$&lt;/code&gt;. Now on that same input, the initial &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; in the input will be consumed by the first branch of the alternation, and that will satisfy the loop’s minimum bound of 1 iteration, exiting the loop. It’ll then proceed to validate that it’s at the end of the string, and fail, but with the loop now atomic, there’s nothing to backtrack into, and the whole match fails. Oops. The problem here is that the loop’s ending must not only be disjoint with what comes next, and the loop’s beginning must not only be disjoint with what comes next, but because it’s a loop, what comes next can actually be itself, which means the loop’s beginning and ending must be disjoint from each other. Those criteria significantly limit to what patterns this can be applied, but even with that, it’s still surprisingly common: &lt;code&gt;dotnet/runtime-assets&lt;/code&gt; (which contains test assets for use with &lt;code&gt;dotnet/runtime&lt;/code&gt;) contains a database of regex patterns sourced from appropriately-licensed nuget packages, yielding almost 20,000 unique patterns, and more than 7% of those were positively impacted by this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is an example that’s searching “The Entire Project Gutenberg Works of Mark Twain” for sequences of all lowercase ASCII words, each followed by a space, and then all followed by an uppercase ASCII letter.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In previous releases, that inner loop would be made atomic, but the outerloop would remain greedy (backtracking). From the XML comment generated by the source generator, we get this:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with any optimization, auto-atomicity should never change observable behavior; it should just make things faster. And as such, every case where atomicity is automatically applied requires it being reasoned through to ensure that the optimization is of sound logic. In some cases, the optimization was written to be conservative, as the relevant reasoning through the logic wasn’t previously done. An example of that is addressed by dotnet/runtime#118191, which makes a few tweaks to how boundaries are handled in the auto-atomicity logic, removing some constraints that were put in place but which, as it turns out, are unnecessary. The core logic that implements the atomicity analysis is a method that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;private static bool CanBeMadeAtomic(RegexNode node, RegexNode subsequent, ...)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; is the representation for the part of the regex that’s being considered for becoming atomic (e.g. a loop) and &lt;code&gt;subsequent&lt;/code&gt; is what comes immediately after it in the pattern; the method then proceeds to validate &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; against &lt;code&gt;subsequent&lt;/code&gt; to see whether it can prove there wouldn’t be any behavioral changes if &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; were made atomic. However, not all cases are sufficiently handled just by validating against &lt;code&gt;subsequent&lt;/code&gt; itself. Consider a pattern like &lt;code&gt;a*b*\w&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; represents &lt;code&gt;a*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;subsequent&lt;/code&gt; represents &lt;code&gt;b*&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are obviously disjoint, and so &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; can be made atomic with regards to &lt;code&gt;subsequent&lt;/code&gt;, but… here &lt;code&gt;subsequent&lt;/code&gt; is also “nullable,” meaning it might successfully match 0 characters (the loop has a lower bound of 0). And in such a case, what comes after the &lt;code&gt;a*&lt;/code&gt; won’t necessarily be a &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; but could be what comes after the &lt;code&gt;b*&lt;/code&gt;, which here is a &lt;code&gt;\w&lt;/code&gt;, which overlaps with &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, and as such, it would be a behavioral change to make this into &lt;code&gt;(?&amp;gt;a*)b*\w&lt;/code&gt;. Consider an input of just &lt;code&gt;"a"&lt;/code&gt;. With the original pattern, &lt;code&gt;a*&lt;/code&gt; would successfully match the empty string with 0 iterations, &lt;code&gt;b*&lt;/code&gt; would successfully match the empty string with 0 iterations, and then &lt;code&gt;\w&lt;/code&gt; would successfully match the input &lt;code&gt;'a'&lt;/code&gt;. But with the atomicized pattern, &lt;code&gt;(?&amp;gt;a*)&lt;/code&gt; would successfully match the input &lt;code&gt;'a'&lt;/code&gt; with a single iteration, leaving nothing to match the &lt;code&gt;\w&lt;/code&gt;. As such, when &lt;code&gt;CanBeMadeAtomic&lt;/code&gt; detects that &lt;code&gt;subsequent&lt;/code&gt; may be nullable and successfully match the empty string, it needs to iterate to also validate against what comes after &lt;code&gt;subsequent&lt;/code&gt; (and possibly again and again if what comes next itself keeps being nullable).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CanBeMadeAtomic&lt;/code&gt; already factored in boundaries (&lt;code&gt;\b&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\B&lt;/code&gt;), but it did so with the conservative logic that since a boundary is “zero-width” (meaning it doesn’t consume any input), it must always require checking what comes after it. But that’s not actually the case. Even though a boundary is zero-width, it still makes guarantees about what comes next: if the prior character is a word character, the next is guaranteed to not be with a successful match. And as such, we can safely make this more liberal and not require checking what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This last example also highlights an interesting aspect of this auto-atomicity optimization in general. There is nothing this optimization provides that the developer writing the regex in the first place couldn’t have done themselves. Instead of &lt;code&gt;a*b&lt;/code&gt;, a developer can write &lt;code&gt;(?&amp;gt;a*)b&lt;/code&gt;. Instead of &lt;code&gt;[a-z]+(?= )&lt;/code&gt;, a developer can write &lt;code&gt;(?&amp;gt;[a-z]+)(?= )&lt;/code&gt;. And so on. But when was the last time you explicitly added an atomic group to a regex you authored? Of the almost 20,000 regular expression patterns in the aforementioned database of real-world regexes sourced from nuget, care to guess how many include an explicitly written atomic group? The answer: ~100. It’s just not something developers in general think to do, so although the optimization transforms the user’s pattern into something they could have written themselves, it’s an incredibly valuable optimization, especially since now in .NET 10 over 70% of those patterns have at least one construct upgraded to be atomic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The auto-atomicity optimization is an example of the optimizer removing unnecessary work. A key example of that, but certainly not the only example. Several additional PRs in .NET 10 have also eliminated unnecessary work, in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#118084 is a fun example of this, but to understand it, we first need to understand lookarounds. A “lookaround” is a regex construct that makes its contents zero-width. Whereas when a set like “[abc]” matches it consumes a single character from the input, or when a loop like “[abc]{3,5}” matches it’ll consume between 3-5 characters from the input, lookarounds (as with other zero-width constructs, like anchors) don’t consume anything. You wrap a lookaround around a regex expression, and it effectively makes the consumption temporary, e.g. if I wrap &lt;code&gt;[abc]{3,5}&lt;/code&gt; in a positive lookahead as &lt;code&gt;(?=[abc]{3,5})&lt;/code&gt;, that will end up performing the whole match for the 3-5 set characters, but those characters won’t remain consumed after exiting the lookaround; the lookaround is just performing a test to ensure the inner pattern matches but the position in the input is reset upon exiting the lookaround. This is again visualized easily by looking at the code emitted by the regex source generator for a pattern like &lt;code&gt;(?=[abc]{3,5})abc&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Zero-width positive lookahead.&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    int positivelookahead_starting_pos = pos;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    // Match a character in the set [a-c] atomically at least 3 and at most 5 times.&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        int iteration = 0;&amp;#13;
        while (iteration &amp;lt; 5 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (uint)iteration &amp;lt; (uint)slice.Length &amp;amp;&amp;amp; char.IsBetween(slice[iteration], 'a', 'c'))&amp;#13;
        {&amp;#13;
            iteration++;&amp;#13;
        }&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
        if (iteration &amp;lt; 3)&amp;#13;
        {&amp;#13;
            return false; // The input didn't match.&amp;#13;
        }&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
        slice = slice.Slice(iteration);&amp;#13;
        pos += iteration;&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    pos = positivelookahead_starting_pos;&amp;#13;
    slice = inputSpan.Slice(pos);&amp;#13;
}&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
// Match the string "abc".&amp;#13;
if (!slice.StartsWith("abc"))&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    return false; // The input didn't match.&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see that the lookaround is caching the starting position, then proceeding to try to match the loop it contains, and if successful, resetting the matching position to what it was when the lookaround was entered, then continuing on to perform the match for what comes after the lookaround.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These examples have been for a particular flavor of lookaround, called a positive lookahead. There are four variations of lookarounds composed of two choices: positive vs negative, and lookahead vs lookbehind. Lookaheads validate the pattern starting from the current position and proceeding forwards (as matching typically is), while lookbehinds validate the pattern starting from just before the current position and extending backwards. Positive indicates that the pattern should match, while negative indicates that the pattern should not match. So, for example, the negative lookbehind &lt;code&gt;(?&amp;lt;!\w)&lt;/code&gt; will match if what comes before the current position is not a word character.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Negative lookarounds are particularly interesting, because, unlike every other regex construct, they guarantee that the pattern they contain doesn’t match. That also makes them special in other regards, in particular around capture groups. For a positive lookaround, even though they’re zero width, anything capture groups inside of the lookaround capture still remain to outside of the lookaround, e.g. &lt;code&gt;^(?=(abc))\1$&lt;/code&gt;, which entails a backreference successfully matching what’s captured by the capture group inside of the positive lookahead, will successfully match the input &lt;code&gt;"abc"&lt;/code&gt;. But because negative lookarounds guarantee their content doesn’t match, it would be counter-intuitive if anything captured inside of a negative lookaround persisted past the lookaround… so it doesn’t. The capture groups inside of a negative lookaround are still possibly meaningful, in particular if there’s a backreference also inside of the same lookaround that refers back to the capture group, e.g. the pattern &lt;code&gt;^(?!(ab)\1cd)ababc&lt;/code&gt; is checking to see whether the input does not begin with &lt;code&gt;ababcd&lt;/code&gt; but does begin with &lt;code&gt;ababc&lt;/code&gt;. But if there’s no backreference, the capture group is useless, and we don’t need to do any work for it as part of processing the regex (work like remembering where the capture occurred). Such capture groups can be completely eliminated from the node tree as part of the optimization phase, and that’s exactly what dotnet/runtime#118084 does. Just as developers often use backtracking constructs without thinking to make them atomic, developers also often use capture groups purely as a grouping mechanism without thinking of the possibility of making them non-capturing groups. Since captures in general need to persist to be examined by the &lt;code&gt;Match&lt;/code&gt; object returned from a &lt;code&gt;Regex&lt;/code&gt;, we can’t just eliminate all capture groups that aren’t used internally in the pattern, but we can for these negative lookarounds. Consider a pattern like &lt;code&gt;(?&amp;lt;!(access|auth)\s)token&lt;/code&gt;, which is looking for the word &lt;code&gt;"token"&lt;/code&gt; when it’s not preceeded by &lt;code&gt;"access "&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;"auth "&lt;/code&gt;; the developer here (me, in this case) did what’s fairly natural, putting a group around the alternation so that the &lt;code&gt;\s&lt;/code&gt; that follows either word can be factored out (if it were instead &lt;code&gt;access|auth\s&lt;/code&gt;, the whitespace set would only be in the second branch of the alternation and wouldn’t apply to the first). But my “simple” grouping here is actually a capture group by default; to get it to be non-capturing, I’d either need to write it as a non-capturing group, i.e. &lt;code&gt;(?&amp;lt;!(?:access|auth)\s)token&lt;/code&gt;, or I’d need to use &lt;code&gt;RegexOptions.ExplicitCapture&lt;/code&gt;, which turns all non-named capture groups into non-capturing groups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can similarly remove other work related to lookarounds. As noted, positive lookarounds exist to transform any pattern into a zero-width pattern, i.e. don’t consume anything. That’s all they do. If the pattern being wrapped by the positive lookaround is already zero-width, the lookaround contributes nothing to the behavior of the expression and can be removed. So, for example, if you have &lt;code&gt;(?=$)&lt;/code&gt;, that can be transformed into just &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;. That’s exactly what dotnet/runtime#118091 does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#118079 and dotnet/runtime#118111 handle other transformations relative to zero-width assertions, in particular with regards to loops. For whatever reason, you’ll see developers wrapping zero-width assertions inside of loops, either making such assertions optional (e.g. &lt;code&gt;\b?&lt;/code&gt;) or with some larger upper bound (e.g. &lt;code&gt;(?=abc)*&lt;/code&gt;). But these zero-width assertions don’t consume anything; their sole purpose is to flag whether something is true or false at the current position. If you make such a zero-width assertion optional, then you’re saying “check whether it’s true or false, and then immediately ignore the answer, because both answers are valid”; as such, the whole expression can be removed as a nop. Similarly, if you wrap a loop with an upper bound greater than 1 around such an expression, you’re saying “check whether it’s true or false, now without changing anything check again, and check again, and check again.” There’s a common English expression that’s something along the lines of “insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” That applies here. There may be behavioral benefits to invoking the zero-width assertion once, but repeating it beyond that is a pure waste: if it was going to fail, it would have failed the first time. Mostly. There’s one specific case where the difference is actually observable, and that has to do with an interesting feature of .NET regexes: capture groups track all matched captures, not just the last. Consider this program:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
using System.Diagnostics;&amp;#13;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
Match m = Regex.Match("abc", "^(?=(\\w+)){3}abc$");&amp;#13;
Debug.Assert(m.Success);&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
foreach (Group g in m.Groups)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    foreach (Capture c in g.Captures)&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        Console.WriteLine($"Group: {g.Name}, Capture: {c.Value}");&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you run that, you may be surprised to see that capture group #1 (the explicit group I have inside of the lookahead) provides three capture values:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Group: 0, Capture: abc&amp;#13;
Group: 1, Capture: abc&amp;#13;
Group: 1, Capture: abc&amp;#13;
Group: 1, Capture: abc&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s because the loop around the positive lookahead does three iterations, each iteration matches &lt;code&gt;"abc"&lt;/code&gt;, and each successful capture is persisted for subsequent inspection via the &lt;code&gt;Regex&lt;/code&gt; APIs. As such, we can’t optimize any loop around zero-width assertions by lowering the upper bound from greater than 1 to 1; we can only do so if it doesn’t contain any captures. And that’s what these PRs do. Given a loop that wraps a zero-width assertion that does not contain a capture, if the lower bound of the loop is 0, the whole loop and its contents can be eliminated, and if the upper bound of the loop is greater than 1, the loop itself can be removed, leaving only its contents in its stead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any time work like this is eliminated, it’s easy to construct monstrous, misleading micro-benchmarks… but it’s also a lot of fun, so, I’ll allow myself it this time.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#118083 is similar. “Repeaters” are a name for a regex loop that has the same lower and upper bound, such that the contents of the loop “repeats” that fixed number of times. Typically you’ll see these written out using the &lt;code&gt;{N}&lt;/code&gt; syntax, e.g. &lt;code&gt;[abc]{3}&lt;/code&gt; is a repeater that requires three characters, any of which can be &lt;code&gt;'a'&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'b'&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;'c'&lt;/code&gt;. But of course it could also be written out in long-form, just by manually repeating the contents, e.g. &lt;code&gt;[abc][abc][abc]&lt;/code&gt;. Just as we saw how we can condense loops around zero-width assertions when specified in loop form, we can do the exact same thing when manually written out. So, for example, &lt;code&gt;\b\b&lt;/code&gt; is the same as just &lt;code&gt;\b{2}&lt;/code&gt;, which is just &lt;code&gt;\b&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another nice example of removing unnecessary work is dotnet/runtime#118105. Boundary assertions are used in many expressions, e.g. it’s quite common to see a simple pattern like &lt;code&gt;\b\w+\b&lt;/code&gt;, which is trying to match an entire word. When the regex engine encounters such an assertion, historically it’s delegated to the &lt;code&gt;IsBoundary&lt;/code&gt; helper shown earlier. There is, however, some subtle unnecessary work here, which is more obvious when you see what the regex source generator outputs for an expression like &lt;code&gt;\b\w+\b&lt;/code&gt;. This is what the output looks like on .NET 9:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Match if at a word boundary.&amp;#13;
if (!Utilities.IsBoundary(inputSpan, pos))&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    return false; // The input didn't match.&amp;#13;
}&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
// Match a word character atomically at least once.&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    int iteration = 0;&amp;#13;
    while ((uint)iteration &amp;lt; (uint)slice.Length &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Utilities.IsWordChar(slice[iteration]))&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        iteration++;&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    if (iteration == 0)&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        return false; // The input didn't match.&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    slice = slice.Slice(iteration);&amp;#13;
    pos += iteration;&amp;#13;
}&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
// Match if at a word boundary.&amp;#13;
if (!Utilities.IsBoundary(inputSpan, pos))&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    return false; // The input didn't match.&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pretty straightforward: match the boundary, consume as many word characters as possible, then again match a boundary. Except if you look back at the definition of &lt;code&gt;IsBoundary&lt;/code&gt;, you’ll notice that it’s doing two checks, one against the previous character and one against the next character.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;internal static bool IsBoundary(ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; inputSpan, int index)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    int indexM1 = index - 1;&amp;#13;
    return ((uint)indexM1 &amp;lt; (uint)inputSpan.Length &amp;amp;&amp;amp; RegexCharClass.IsBoundaryWordChar(inputSpan[indexM1])) !=&amp;#13;
           ((uint)index &amp;lt; (uint)inputSpan.Length &amp;amp;&amp;amp; RegexCharClass.IsBoundaryWordChar(inputSpan[index]));&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, look at that, and look back at the generated code, and look at this again, and back at the source generated code again. See anything unnecessary? When we perform the first boundary comparison, we are dutifully checking the previous character, which is necessary, but then we’re checking the current character, which is about to checked against &lt;code&gt;\w&lt;/code&gt; by the subsequent &lt;code&gt;\w+&lt;/code&gt; loop. Similarly for the second boundary check, we just finished matching &lt;code&gt;\w+&lt;/code&gt;, which will have only successfully matched if there was at least one word character. While we still need to validate that the subsequent character is not a boundary character (there are two characters considered boundary characters that aren’t word characters), we don’t need to re-validate the previous character. So, dotnet/runtime#118105 overhauls boundary handling in the compiler and source generator to emit customized boundary checks based on surrounding knowledge. If it can prove that the subsequent construct will validate that a character is a word character, then it only needs to validate that the previous character is not a boundary character; similarly, if it can prove that the previous construct will have already validated that a character is a word character, then it only needs to validate that the next character isn’t. This leads to this tweaked source generated code now on .NET 10:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Match if at a word boundary.&amp;#13;
if (!Utilities.IsPreWordCharBoundary(inputSpan, pos))&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    return false; // The input didn't match.&amp;#13;
}&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
// Match a word character atomically at least once.&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    int iteration = 0;&amp;#13;
    while ((uint)iteration &amp;lt; (uint)slice.Length &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Utilities.IsWordChar(slice[iteration]))&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        iteration++;&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    if (iteration == 0)&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        return false; // The input didn't match.&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    slice = slice.Slice(iteration);&amp;#13;
    pos += iteration;&amp;#13;
}&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
// Match if at a word boundary.&amp;#13;
if (!Utilities.IsPostWordCharBoundary(inputSpan, pos))&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    return false; // The input didn't match.&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those &lt;code&gt;IsPreWordCharBoundary&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;IsPostWordCharBoundary&lt;/code&gt; helpers are just half the checks in the main boundary helper. In cases where there are lots of boundary tests being performed, the reduced check count can add up.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Regex&lt;/code&gt; optimizer is all about pattern recognition: it looks for sequences and shapes it recognizes and performs transforms over those to put them into a more efficiently-processable form. One example of this is with alternations around coalescable branches. Let’s say you have an alternation &lt;code&gt;a|e|i|o|u&lt;/code&gt;. You could process that as an alternation, but it’s also much more efficiently represented and processed as the equivalent set &lt;code&gt;[aeiou]&lt;/code&gt;. There is an optimization that does such transformations as part of handling alternations. However, through .NET 9, it only handled single characters and sets, but not negated sets. For example, it would transform &lt;code&gt;a|e|i|o|u&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;[aeiou]&lt;/code&gt;, and it would transform &lt;code&gt;[aei]|[ou]&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;[aeiou]&lt;/code&gt;, but it would not merge negations like &lt;code&gt;[^\n]&lt;/code&gt;, otherwise known as &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; (when not in &lt;code&gt;RegexOptions.Singleline&lt;/code&gt; mode). When developers want a set that represents all characters, there are various idioms they employ, such as &lt;code&gt;[\s\S]&lt;/code&gt;, which says “this is a set of all whitespace and non-whitespace characters”, aka everything. Another common idiom is &lt;code&gt;\n|.&lt;/code&gt;, which is the same as &lt;code&gt;\n|[^\n]&lt;/code&gt;, which says “this is an alternation that matches either a newline or anything other than a newline”, aka also everything. Unfortunately, while examples like &lt;code&gt;[\d\D]&lt;/code&gt; have been handled well, &lt;code&gt;.|\n&lt;/code&gt; has not, because of the gap in the alternation optimization. dotnet/runtime#118109 improves that, such that such “not” cases are mergable as part of the existing optimization. That takes a relatively expensive alternation and converts it into a super fast set check. And while, in general, set containment checks are very efficient, this one is as efficient as you can get, as it’s always true. We can see an example of this with a pattern intended to match C-style comment blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that there’s another change that helps .NET 10 here, dotnet/runtime#118373, though I hesitate to call it out as a performance improvement since it’s really more of a bug fix. As part of writing this post, these benchmark numbers were showing some oddities (it’s important in general to be skeptical of benchmark results and to investigate anything that doesn’t align with reason and expectations). The result of investigating was a one-word change that yielded significant speedups on this test, specifically when using &lt;code&gt;RegexOptions.Compiled&lt;/code&gt; (the bug didn’t exist in the source generator). As part of handling lazy loops, there’s a special-case for when the lazy loop is around a set that matches any character, which, thanks to the previous PR, &lt;code&gt;(?:.|\n)&lt;/code&gt; now does. That special-case recognizes that if the lazy loop matches anything, we can efficiently find the end of the lazy loop by searching for whatever comes after the loop (e.g. in this test, the loop is followed by the literal &lt;code&gt;"*/"&lt;/code&gt;). Unfortunately, the helper that emits that &lt;code&gt;IndexOf&lt;/code&gt; call was passed the wrong node from the pattern: it was being passed the object representing the &lt;code&gt;(?:.|\n)&lt;/code&gt; any-set rather than the &lt;code&gt;"*/"&lt;/code&gt; literal, which resulted in it emitting the equivalent of &lt;code&gt;IndexOfAnyInRange((char)0, '\uFFFF')&lt;/code&gt; rather than the equivalent of &lt;code&gt;IndexOf("*/")&lt;/code&gt;. Oops. It was still functionally correct, in that the &lt;code&gt;IndexOfAnyInRange&lt;/code&gt; call would successfully match the first character and the loop would re-evaluate from that location, but that means that rather than efficiently skipping using SIMD over a bunch of positions that couldn’t possibly match, we were doing non-trivial work for each and every position along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#118087 represents another interesting transformation related to alternations. It’s very common to come across alternations with empty branches, possibly because that’s what the developer wrote, but more commonly as an outcome of other transformations that have happened. For example, given the pattern &lt;code&gt;\r\n|\r&lt;/code&gt;, which is trying to match line endings that begin with &lt;code&gt;\r&lt;/code&gt;, there is an optimization that will factor out a common prefix of all of the branches, producing the equivalent of &lt;code&gt;\r(?:\n|)&lt;/code&gt;; in other words, &lt;code&gt;\r&lt;/code&gt; followed by either a line feed or empty. Such an alternation is a perfectly valid representation for this concept, but there’s a more natural one: &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;. Behaviorally, this pattern is identical to &lt;code&gt;\r\n?&lt;/code&gt;, and because the latter is more common and more canonical, the regex engine has more optimizations that recognize this loop-based form, for example coalescing with other loops, or auto-atomicity. As such, this PR finds all alternations of the form &lt;code&gt;X|&lt;/code&gt; and transforms them into &lt;code&gt;X?&lt;/code&gt;. Similarly, it finds all alternations of the form &lt;code&gt;|X&lt;/code&gt; and transforms them into &lt;code&gt;X??&lt;/code&gt;. The difference between &lt;code&gt;X|&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;|X&lt;/code&gt; is whether &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; is tried first or empty is tried first; similarly, the difference between the greedy &lt;code&gt;X?&lt;/code&gt; loop and the lazy &lt;code&gt;X??&lt;/code&gt; loop is whether &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; is tried first or empty is tried first. The impact of this can be seen in the code generated for the previously cited example. Here is the source-generated code for the heart of the matching routine for &lt;code&gt;\r\n|\r&lt;/code&gt; on .NET 9:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Match '\r'.&amp;#13;
if (slice.IsEmpty || slice[0] != '\r')&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    return false; // The input didn't match.&amp;#13;
}&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
// Match with 2 alternative expressions, atomically.&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    int alternation_starting_pos = pos;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    // Branch 0&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        // Match '\n'.&amp;#13;
        if ((uint)slice.Length &amp;lt; 2 || slice[1] != '\n')&amp;#13;
        {&amp;#13;
            goto AlternationBranch;&amp;#13;
        }&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
        pos += 2;&amp;#13;
        slice = inputSpan.Slice(pos);&amp;#13;
        goto AlternationMatch;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
        AlternationBranch:&amp;#13;
        pos = alternation_starting_pos;&amp;#13;
        slice = inputSpan.Slice(pos);&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    // Branch 1&amp;#13;
    {      &amp;#13;
        pos++;&amp;#13;
        slice = inputSpan.Slice(pos);&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    AlternationMatch:;&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, here’s what’s produced on .NET 10:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Match '\r'.&amp;#13;
if (slice.IsEmpty || slice[0] != '\r')&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    return false; // The input didn't match.&amp;#13;
}&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
// Match '\n' atomically, optionally.&amp;#13;
if ((uint)slice.Length &amp;gt; (uint)1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; slice[1] == '\n')&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    slice = slice.Slice(1);&amp;#13;
    pos++;&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The optimizer recognized that the &lt;code&gt;\r\n|\r&lt;/code&gt; was the same as &lt;code&gt;\r(?:\n|)&lt;/code&gt;, which is the same as &lt;code&gt;\r\n?&lt;/code&gt;, which is the same as &lt;code&gt;\r(?&amp;gt;\n?)&lt;/code&gt;, which it can produce much simplified code for, given that it no longer needs any backtracking.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;.NET 10 also features improvements to &lt;code&gt;Regex&lt;/code&gt; that go beyond just this form of work elimination. &lt;code&gt;Regex&lt;/code&gt;‘s matching routines are logically factored into two pieces: finding as quickly as possible the next place that could possibly match (&lt;code&gt;TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition&lt;/code&gt;), and then performing the full matching routine at that location (&lt;code&gt;TryMatchAtCurrentPosition&lt;/code&gt;). It’s desirable that &lt;code&gt;TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition&lt;/code&gt; both does its work as quickly as possible while also significantly limiting the number of locations a full match should be performed. &lt;code&gt;TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition&lt;/code&gt;, for example, could operate very quickly just by always saying that the next index in the input should be tested, which would result in the full matching logic being performed at every index in the input; that’s not great for performance. Instead, the optimizer analyzes the pattern looking for things that would allow it to quickly search for viable starting locations, e.g. fixed strings or sets at known offsets in the pattern. Anchors are some of the most valuable things the optimizer can find, as they significantly inhibit the possible places matching is valid; the ideal pattern begins with a beginning anchor (&lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;), which then means the only possible place matching can be successful is at index 0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We previously discussed lookarounds, but as it turns out, until .NET 10, lookarounds weren’t factored into what &lt;code&gt;TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition&lt;/code&gt; should look for. dotnet/runtime#112107 changes that. It teaches the optimizer when and how to explore positive lookaheads at the beginning of a pattern for constructs that could help it more efficiently find starting locations. For example, in .NET 9, for the pattern &lt;code&gt;(?=^)hello&lt;/code&gt;, here’s what the source generator emits for &lt;code&gt;TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;private bool TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition(ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; inputSpan)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    int pos = base.runtextpos;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    // Any possible match is at least 5 characters.&amp;#13;
    if (pos &amp;lt;= inputSpan.Length - 5)&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        // The pattern has the literal "hello" at the beginning of the pattern. Find the next occurrence.&amp;#13;
        // If it can't be found, there's no match.&amp;#13;
        int i = inputSpan.Slice(pos).IndexOfAny(Utilities.s_indexOfString_hello_Ordinal);&amp;#13;
        if (i &amp;gt;= 0)&amp;#13;
        {&amp;#13;
            base.runtextpos = pos + i;&amp;#13;
            return true;&amp;#13;
        }&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    // No match found.&amp;#13;
    base.runtextpos = inputSpan.Length;&amp;#13;
    return false;&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The optimizer found the &lt;code&gt;"hello"&lt;/code&gt; string in the pattern and is thus searching for that as part of finding the next possible place to do the full match. That would be excellent, if it weren’t for the lookahead that also says any match must happen at the beginning of the input. Now in .NET 10, we get this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;private bool TryFindNextPossibleStartingPosition(ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; inputSpan)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    int pos = base.runtextpos;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    // Any possible match is at least 5 characters.&amp;#13;
    if (pos &amp;lt;= inputSpan.Length - 5)&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        // The pattern leads with a beginning (\A) anchor.&amp;#13;
        if (pos == 0)&amp;#13;
        {&amp;#13;
            return true;&amp;#13;
        }&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    // No match found.&amp;#13;
    base.runtextpos = inputSpan.Length;&amp;#13;
    return false;&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That &lt;code&gt;pos == 0&lt;/code&gt; check is critical, because it means we will only ever attempt the full match in one location and we can avoid the search that would happen even if we never found a good location to perform the match. Again, any time you eliminate work like this, you can construct tantalizing micro-benchmarks…&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That same PR also improved optimizations over alternations. It’s already the case that the branches of alternations are analyzed looking for common prefixes that can be factored out. For example, given the pattern &lt;code&gt;abc|abd&lt;/code&gt;, the optimizer will spot the shared &lt;code&gt;"ab"&lt;/code&gt; prefix at the beginning of each branch and factor that out, resulting in &lt;code&gt;ab(?:c|d)&lt;/code&gt;, and will then see that each branch of the remaining alternation are individual characters, which it can convert into a set, &lt;code&gt;ab[cd]&lt;/code&gt;. If, however, the branches began with anchors, these optimizations wouldn’t be applied. Given the pattern &lt;code&gt;^abc|^abd&lt;/code&gt;, the code generators would end up emitting this exactly as it’s written, with an alternation with two branches, the first branch checking for the beginning and then matching &lt;code&gt;"abc"&lt;/code&gt;, the second branch also checking for the beginning and then matching &lt;code&gt;"abd"&lt;/code&gt;. Now in .NET 10, the anchor can be factored out, such that &lt;code&gt;^abc|^abd&lt;/code&gt; ends up being rewritten as &lt;code&gt;^ab[cd]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a small tweak, dotnet/runtime#112065 also helps improve the source generated code for repeaters by using a more efficient searching routine. Let’s take the pattern &lt;code&gt;[0-9a-f]{32}&lt;/code&gt; as an example. This is looking for sequences of 32 lowercase hex digits. In .NET 9, the implementation of that ends up looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Match a character in the set [0-9a-f] exactly 32 times.&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    if ((uint)slice.Length &amp;lt; 32)&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        return false; // The input didn't match.&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    if (slice.Slice(0, 32).IndexOfAnyExcept(Utilities.s_asciiHexDigitsLower) &amp;gt;= 0)&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        return false; // The input didn't match.&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simple, clean, fairly concise, and utilizing the vectorized &lt;code&gt;IndexOfAnyExcept&lt;/code&gt; to very efficiently validate that the whole sequence of 32 characters are lowercase hex. We can do a tad bit better, though. The &lt;code&gt;IndexOfAnyExcept&lt;/code&gt; method not only needs to find whether the span contains something other than one of the provided values, it needs to specify the index at which that found value occurs. That’s only a few instructions, but it’s a few unnecessary instructions, since here that exact index isn’t utilized… the implementation only cares whether it’s &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;= 0&lt;/code&gt;, meaning whether anything was found or not. As such, we can instead use the &lt;code&gt;Contains&lt;/code&gt; variant of this method, which doesn’t need to spend extra cycles determining the exact index. Now in .NET 10, this is generated:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Match a character in the set [0-9a-f] exactly 32 times.&amp;#13;
if ((uint)slice.Length &amp;lt; 32 || slice.Slice(0, 32).ContainsAnyExcept(Utilities.s_asciiHexDigitsLower))&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    return false; // The input didn't match.&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the .NET 10 SDK includes a new analyzer related to &lt;code&gt;Regex&lt;/code&gt;. It’s oddly common to see code that determines whether an input matches a &lt;code&gt;Regex&lt;/code&gt; written like this: &lt;code&gt;Regex.Match(...).Success&lt;/code&gt;. While functionally correct, that’s much more expensive than &lt;code&gt;Regex.IsMatch(...)&lt;/code&gt;. For all of the engines, &lt;code&gt;Regex.Match(...)&lt;/code&gt; requires allocating a new &lt;code&gt;Match&lt;/code&gt; object and supporting data structures (except when there isn’t a match found, in which case it’s able to use an empty singleton); in contrast, &lt;code&gt;IsMatch&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t need to allocate such an instance because it doesn’t need to return such an instance (as an implementation detail, it may still use a &lt;code&gt;Match&lt;/code&gt; object, but it can reuse one rather than creating a new one each time). It can also avoid other inefficiencies. &lt;code&gt;RegexOptions.NonBacktracking&lt;/code&gt; is “pay-for-play” with the information it needs to gather. Determining just whether there’s a match is cheaper than determining exactly where the match begins and ends, which is cheaper still than determining all of the captures that make up that match. &lt;code&gt;IsMatch&lt;/code&gt; is thus the cheapest, only needing to determine that there is a match, not exactly where it is or what the exact captures are, whereas &lt;code&gt;Match&lt;/code&gt; needs to determine all of that. &lt;code&gt;Regex.Matches(...).Count&lt;/code&gt; is similar; it’s having to gather all of the relevant details and allocate a whole bunch of objects, whereas &lt;code&gt;Regex.Count(...)&lt;/code&gt; can do so in a much more efficient manner. dotnet/roslyn-analyzers#7547 adds CA1874 and CA1875, which flag these cases and recommend use of &lt;code&gt;IsMatch&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Count&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Regex&lt;/code&gt; is one form of searching, but there are other primitives and helpers throughout .NET for various forms of searching, and they’ve seen meaningful improvements in .NET 10, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;SearchValues&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When discussing performance improvements in .NET 8, I called out two changes that were my favorites. The first was dynamic PGO. The second was &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SearchValues&lt;/code&gt; provides a mechanism for precomputing optimal strategies for searching. .NET 8 introduced overloads of &lt;code&gt;SearchValues.Create&lt;/code&gt; that produce &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and corresponding overloads of &lt;code&gt;IndexOfAny&lt;/code&gt; and friends that accept such instances. If there’s a set of values you’ll be searching for over and over and over, you can create one of these instances once, cache it, and then use it for all subsequent searches for those values, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;private static readonly SearchValues&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; s_validBase64Chars = SearchValues.Create("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/");&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
internal static bool IsValidBase64(ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; input) =&amp;gt;&amp;#13;
    input.ContainsAnyExcept(s_validBase64Chars);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a plethora of different implementations used by &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; behind the scenes, each of which is selected and configured based on the &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; and the exact nature of the target values for which we’re searching. dotnet/runtime#106900 adds another, which both helps to shave off several instructions in the core vectorized search loop, and helps to highlight just how nuanced these different algorithms can be. Previously, if four target &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt; values were provided, and they weren’t in a contiguous range, &lt;code&gt;SearchValues.Create&lt;/code&gt; would choose an implementation that just uses four vectors, one per target byte, and does four comparisons (one against each target vector) for each input vector being tested. However, there’s already a specialization that’s used for more than five target bytes when all of the target bytes are ASCII. This PR allows that specialization to be used for both four or five targets when the lower nibble (the bottom four bits) of each of the targets is unique, and in doing so, it becomes several instructions cheaper: rather than doing four comparisons, it can do a single shuffle and equality check.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;0.72&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#107798 improves another such algorithm, when AVX512 is available. One of the fallback strategies used by &lt;code&gt;SearchValues.Create&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a vectorized “probabilistic map”, basically a Bloom filter. It has a bitmap that stores a bit for each &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;; when testing to see whether the &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; is in the target set, it checks to see whether the bit for each of the &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;‘s &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt;s is set. If at least one isn’t set, the &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; definitely isn’t in the target set. If both are set, more validation will need to be done to determine the actual inclusion of that value in the set. This can make it very efficient to rule out large amounts of input that definitely are not in the set and then only spend more effort on input that might be. The implementation involves various shuffle, shift, and permute operations, and this change is able to use a better set of instructions that reduce the number needed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;0.92&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While .NET 8 introduced support for &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, .NET 9 introduced support for &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is used a bit differently from &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;; whereas &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is used to search for target &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt;s within a collection of &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt;s and &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is used to search for target &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;s within a collection of &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;s, &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is used to search for target &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;s within a single &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; (or span of &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;s). In other words, it’s a multi-substring search. Let’s say you have the regular expression &lt;code&gt;(?i)hello|world&lt;/code&gt;; that is specifying that it should look for either “hello” or “world” in a case-insensitive manner; the &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&lt;/code&gt; equivalent of that is &lt;code&gt;SearchValues.Create(["hello", "world"], StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)&lt;/code&gt; (in fact, if you specify that pattern, the &lt;code&gt;Regex&lt;/code&gt; compiler and source generator will use such a &lt;code&gt;SearchValues.Create&lt;/code&gt; call under the covers in order to optimize the search).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SearchValues&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; also gets better in .NET 10. A key algorithm used by &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; whenever possible and relevant is called “Teddy,” and enables performing a vectorized search for multiple substrings. In its core processing loop, when using AVX512, there are two instructions, a &lt;code&gt;PermuteVar8x64x2&lt;/code&gt; and an &lt;code&gt;AlignRight&lt;/code&gt;; dotnet/runtime#107819 recognizes that those can be replaced by a single &lt;code&gt;PermuteVar64x8x2&lt;/code&gt;. Similarly, when on Arm64, dotnet/runtime#118110 plays the instructions game and replaces a use of &lt;code&gt;ExtractNarrowingSaturateUpper&lt;/code&gt; with the slightly cheaper &lt;code&gt;UnzipEven&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SearchValues&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is also able to optimize searching for a single string, spending more time to come up with optimal search parameters than does a simpler &lt;code&gt;IndexOf(string, StringComparison)&lt;/code&gt; call. Similar to the approach with the probabilistic maps employed earlier, the vectorized search can yield false positives that then need to be weeded out. In some cases by construction, however, we know that false positives aren’t possible; dotnet/runtime#108368 extends an existing optimization that was case-sensitive only to also apply in some case-insensitive uses, such that we can avoid doing the extra validation step in more cases. For the candidate verification that remains, dotnet/runtime#108365 also significantly reduces overhead in a variety of cases, including adding specialized handling for needles (the things being searched for) of up to 16 characters (previously it was only up to 8), and precomputing more information to make the verification faster.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;MemoryExtensions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The searching improvements continue beyond &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&lt;/code&gt;, of course. Prior to .NET 10, the &lt;code&gt;MemoryExtensions&lt;/code&gt; class already had a wealth of support for searching and manipulating spans, with extension methods like &lt;code&gt;IndexOf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;IndexOfAnyExceptInRange&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ContainsAny&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Count&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Replace&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SequenceCompare&lt;/code&gt;, and more (the set was further extended as well by dotnet/runtime#112951, which added &lt;code&gt;CountAny&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ReplaceAny&lt;/code&gt;), but the vast majority of these were limited to work with &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; types constrained to be &lt;code&gt;IEquatable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. And in practice, many of the types you want to search do in fact implement &lt;code&gt;IEquatable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. However, you might be in a generic context with an unconstrained &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;, such that even if the &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; used to instatiate the generic type or method is equatable, it’s not evident in the type system and thus the &lt;code&gt;MemoryExtensions&lt;/code&gt; method couldn’t be used. And of course there are scenarios where you want to be able to supply a different comparison routine. Both of these scenarios show up, for example, in the implementation of LINQ’s &lt;code&gt;Enumerable.Contains&lt;/code&gt;; if the source &lt;code&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;TSource&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is actually something we could treat as a span, like &lt;code&gt;TSource[]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;TSource&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, it’d be nice to be able to just delegate to the optimized &lt;code&gt;MemoryExtensions.Contains&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, but a) &lt;code&gt;Enumerable.Contains&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t constrain its &lt;code&gt;TSource : IEquatable&amp;lt;TSource&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and b) &lt;code&gt;Enumerable.Contains&lt;/code&gt; accepts an optional comparer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To address this, dotnet/runtime#110197 adds ~30 new overloads to the &lt;code&gt;MemoryExtensions&lt;/code&gt; class. These overloads all parallel existing methods, but remove the &lt;code&gt;IEquatable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;IComparable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) constraint on the generic method parameter and accept an optional &lt;code&gt;IEqualityComparer&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;?&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;IComparer&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;). When no comparer or a default comparer is supplied, they can fall back to using the same vectorized logic for relevant types, and otherwise can provide as optimal an implementation as they can muster, based on the nature of &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; and the supplied comparer.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(It’s also worth highlighting that with the “first-class” span support in C# 14, many of these extensions from &lt;code&gt;MemoryExtensions&lt;/code&gt; now naturally show up directly on types like &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This kind of searching often shows up as part of other APIs. For example, encoding APIs often need to first find something to be encoded, and that searching can be accelerated by using one of these efficiently implemented search APIs. There are dozens and dozens of existing examples of that throughout the core libraries, many of the places using &lt;code&gt;SearchValues&lt;/code&gt; or these various &lt;code&gt;MemoryExtensions&lt;/code&gt; methods. dotnet/runtime#110574 adds another, speeding up &lt;code&gt;string.Normalize&lt;/code&gt;‘s argument validation. The current implementation walks character by character looking for the first surrogate. The new implementation gives that a jump start by using &lt;code&gt;IndexOfAnyInRange&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;JSON&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JSON is at the heart of many different domains, having become the lingua franca of data interchange on the web. With &lt;code&gt;System.Text.Json&lt;/code&gt; as the recommended library for working with JSON in .NET, it is constantly evolving to meet additional performance requirements. .NET 10 sees it updated with both improvements to the performance of existing methods as well as new methods specifically geared towards helping with performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;JsonSerializer&lt;/code&gt; type is layered on top of the lower-level &lt;code&gt;Utf8JsonReader&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Utf8JsonWriter&lt;/code&gt; types. When serializing, &lt;code&gt;JsonSerializer&lt;/code&gt; needs an instance of &lt;code&gt;Utf8JsonWriter&lt;/code&gt;, which is a &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt;, and any associated objects, such as an &lt;code&gt;IBufferWriter&lt;/code&gt; instance. For any temporary buffers it requires, it’ll use rented buffers from &lt;code&gt;ArrayPool&amp;lt;byte&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, but for these helper objects, it maintains its own cache, to avoid needing to recreate them at very high frequencies. That cache was being used for all asynchronous streaming serialization operations, but as it turns out, it wasn’t being used for synchronous streaming serialization operations. dotnet/runtime#112745 fixes that to make the use of the cache consistent, avoiding these intermediate allocations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;0.00&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier when discussing collections, it was noted that &lt;code&gt;OrderedDictionary&amp;lt;TKey, TValue&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; now exposes overloads of methods like &lt;code&gt;TryAdd&lt;/code&gt; that return the relevant item’s index, which then allows subsequent access to avoid the more costly key-based lookup. As it turns out, &lt;code&gt;JsonObject&lt;/code&gt;‘s indexer needs to do that, first indexing into the dictionary by key, doing some checks, and then indexing again. It’s now been updated to use these new overloads. As those lookups typically dominate the cost of using the setter, this can upwards of double throughput of &lt;code&gt;JsonObject&lt;/code&gt;‘s indexer:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0&amp;#13;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Set&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;.NET 9.0&lt;/cell&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Most of the improvements in &lt;code&gt;System.Text.Json&lt;/code&gt;, however, are actually via new APIs. This same “avoid a double lookup” issue shows up in other places, for example wanting to add a property to a &lt;code&gt;JsonObject&lt;/code&gt; but only if it doesn’t yet exist. With dotnet/runtime#111229 from @Flu, that’s addressed with a new &lt;code&gt;TryAdd&lt;/code&gt; method (as well as a &lt;code&gt;TryAdd&lt;/code&gt; overload and an overload of the existing &lt;code&gt;TryGetPropertyValue&lt;/code&gt; that, as with &lt;code&gt;OrderedDictionary&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, returns the index of the property).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#109472 from @karakasa also imbues &lt;code&gt;JsonArray&lt;/code&gt; with new &lt;code&gt;RemoveAll&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RemoveRange&lt;/code&gt; methods. In addition to the usability benefits these can provide, they have the same performance benefits they have on &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (which is not a coincidence, given that &lt;code&gt;JsonArray&lt;/code&gt; is, as an implementation detail, a wrapper for a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;JsonNode?&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;). Removing “incorrectly” from a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; can end up being an &lt;code&gt;O(N^2)&lt;/code&gt; endeavor, e.g. when I run this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
using System.Diagnostics;&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
for (int i = 100_000; i &amp;lt; 700_000; i += 100_000)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    List&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; items = Enumerable.Range(0, i).ToList();&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
    Stopwatch sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();&amp;#13;
    while (items.Count &amp;gt; 0)&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        items.RemoveAt(0); // uh oh&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
    Console.WriteLine($"{i} =&amp;gt; {sw.Elapsed}");&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I get output like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;100000 =&amp;gt; 00:00:00.2271798&amp;#13;
200000 =&amp;gt; 00:00:00.8328727&amp;#13;
300000 =&amp;gt; 00:00:01.9820088&amp;#13;
400000 =&amp;gt; 00:00:03.9242008&amp;#13;
500000 =&amp;gt; 00:00:06.9549009&amp;#13;
600000 =&amp;gt; 00:00:11.1104903&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note how as the list length grows linearly, the elapsed time is growing non-linearly. That’s primarily because each &lt;code&gt;RemoveAt(0)&lt;/code&gt; is requiring the entire remainder of the list to shift down, which is &lt;code&gt;O(N)&lt;/code&gt; in the length of the list. That means we get &lt;code&gt;N + (N-1) + (N-2) + ... + 1&lt;/code&gt; operations, which is &lt;code&gt;N(N+1)/2&lt;/code&gt;, which is &lt;code&gt;O(N^2)&lt;/code&gt;. Both &lt;code&gt;RemoveRange&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RemoveAll&lt;/code&gt; are able to avoid those costs by doing the shifting only once per element. Of course, even without such methods, I could have written my previous removal loop in a way that keeps it linear, namely by repeatedly removing the last element rather than the first (and, of course, if I really intended on removing everything, I could have just used &lt;code&gt;Clear&lt;/code&gt;). Typical use, however, ends up removing a smattering of elements, and being able to just delegate and not worry about accidentally incurring a non-linear overhead is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;24 B&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Note that while &lt;code&gt;RemoveAll&lt;/code&gt; in this micro-benchmark is more than 150x faster, it does have that small allocation that the manual implementation doesn’t. That’s due to a closure in the implementation while delegating to &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;.RemoveAll&lt;/code&gt;. This could be avoided in the future if necessary.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another frequently-requested new method is from dotnet/runtime#116363, which adds new &lt;code&gt;Parse&lt;/code&gt; methods to &lt;code&gt;JsonElement&lt;/code&gt;. If a developer wants a &lt;code&gt;JsonElement&lt;/code&gt; and only needs it temporarily, the most efficient mechanism available today is still the right answer: &lt;code&gt;Parse&lt;/code&gt; a &lt;code&gt;JsonDocument&lt;/code&gt;, use its &lt;code&gt;RootElement&lt;/code&gt;, and then only when done with the &lt;code&gt;JsonElement&lt;/code&gt;, dispose of the &lt;code&gt;JsonDocument&lt;/code&gt;, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;using (JsonDocument doc = JsonDocument.Parse(json))&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    DoSomething(doc.RootElement);&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That, however, is really only viable when the &lt;code&gt;JsonElement&lt;/code&gt; is used in a scoped manner. If a developer needs to hand out the &lt;code&gt;JsonElement&lt;/code&gt;, they’re left with three options:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Parse&lt;/code&gt;into a&lt;code&gt;JsonDocument&lt;/code&gt;, clone its&lt;code&gt;RootElement&lt;/code&gt;, dispose of the&lt;code&gt;JsonDocument&lt;/code&gt;, hand out the clone. While using&lt;code&gt;JsonDocument&lt;/code&gt;is good for the temporary case, making a clone like this entails a fair bit of overhead:&lt;code&gt;JsonElement clone; using (JsonDocument doc = JsonDocument.Parse(json)) { clone = doc.RootElement.Clone(); } return clone;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Parse&lt;/code&gt;into a&lt;code&gt;JsonDocument&lt;/code&gt;and just hand out its&lt;code&gt;RootElement&lt;/code&gt;. Please do not do this!&lt;code&gt;JsonDocument.Parse&lt;/code&gt;creates a&lt;code&gt;JsonDocument&lt;/code&gt;that’s backed by an array from the&lt;code&gt;ArrayPool&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If you don’t&lt;code&gt;Dispose&lt;/code&gt;of the&lt;code&gt;JsonDocument&lt;/code&gt;in this case, an array will be rented and then never returned to the pool. That’s not the end of the world; if someone else requests an array from the pool and the pool doesn’t have one cached to give them, it’ll just manufacture one, so eventually the pool’s arrays will be replenished. But the arrays in the pool are generally “more valuable” than others, because they’ve generally been around longer, and are thus more likely to be in higher generations. By using an&lt;code&gt;ArrayPool&lt;/code&gt;array rather than a new array for a shorter-lived&lt;code&gt;JsonDocument&lt;/code&gt;, you’re more likely throwing away an array that’ll have net more impact on the overall system. The impact of that is not easily seen in a micro-benchmark.&lt;code&gt;return JsonDocument.Parse(json).RootElement; // please don't do this&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;JsonSerializer&lt;/code&gt;to deserialize a&lt;code&gt;JsonElement&lt;/code&gt;. This is a simple and reasonable one-liner, but it does invoke the&lt;code&gt;JsonSerializer&lt;/code&gt;machinery, which brings in more overhead.&lt;code&gt;return JsonSerializer.Deserialize&amp;lt;JsonElement&amp;gt;(json);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now in .NET 10, there’s a fourth option:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;JsonElement.Parse&lt;/code&gt;. This is the right answer. Use this instead of (1), (2), or (3).&lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes; using BenchmarkDotNet.Running; using System.Text.Json; BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Tests).Assembly).Run(args); [MemoryDiagnoser(displayGenColumns: false)] [HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD")] public partial class Tests { private const string JsonString = """{ "name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York" }"""; [Benchmark] public JsonElement WithClone() { using JsonDocument d = JsonDocument.Parse(JsonString); return d.RootElement.Clone(); } [Benchmark] public JsonElement WithoutClone() =&amp;gt; JsonDocument.Parse(JsonString).RootElement; // please don't do this in production code [Benchmark] public JsonElement WithDeserialize() =&amp;gt; JsonSerializer.Deserialize&amp;lt;JsonElement&amp;gt;(JsonString); [Benchmark] public JsonElement WithParse() =&amp;gt; JsonElement.Parse(JsonString); }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Mean&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Allocated&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;WithClone&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;303.7 ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;344 B&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;WithoutClone&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;249.6 ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;312 B&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;WithDeserialize&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;397.3 ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;272 B&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;WithParse&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;261.9 ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;272 B&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With JSON being used as an encoding for many modern protocols, streaming large JSON payloads has become very common. And for most use cases, it’s already possible to stream JSON well with &lt;code&gt;System.Text.Json&lt;/code&gt;. However, in previous releases there wasn’t been a good way to stream partial string properties; string properties had to have their values written in one operation. If you’ve got small strings, that’s fine. If you’ve got really, really large strings, and those strings are lazily-produced in chunks, however, you ideally want the ability to write those chunks of the property as you have them, rather than needing to buffer up the value in its entirety. dotnet/runtime#101356 augmented &lt;code&gt;Utf8JsonWriter&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;WriteStringValueSegment&lt;/code&gt; method, which enables such partial writes. That addresses the majority case, however there’s a very common case where additional encoding of the value is desirable, and an API that automatically handles that encoding helps to be both efficient and easy. These modern protocols often transmit large blobs of binary data within the JSON payloads. Typically, these blobs end up being Base64 strings as properties on some JSON object. Today, outputting such blobs requires Base64-encoding the whole input and then writing the resulting &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt;s or &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;s in their entirety into the &lt;code&gt;Utf8JsonWriter&lt;/code&gt;. To address that, dotnet/runtime#111041 adds a &lt;code&gt;WriteBase64StringSegment&lt;/code&gt; method to &lt;code&gt;Utf8JsonWriter&lt;/code&gt;. For those sufficiently motivated to reduce memory overheads, and to enable the streaming of such payloads, &lt;code&gt;WriteBase64StringSegment&lt;/code&gt; enables passing in a span of bytes, which the implementation will Base64-encode and write to the JSON property; it can be called multiple times with &lt;code&gt;isFinalSegment=false&lt;/code&gt;, such that the writer will continue appending the resulting Base64 data to the property, until it’s called with a final segment that ends the property. (&lt;code&gt;Utf8JsonWriter&lt;/code&gt; has long had a &lt;code&gt;WriteBase64String&lt;/code&gt; method, this new &lt;code&gt;WriteBase64StringSegment&lt;/code&gt; simply enables it to be written in pieces.) The primary benefit of such a method is reduced latency and working set, as the entirety of the data payload needn’t be buffered before being written out, but we can still come up with a throughput benchmark that shows benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;.NET 9 saw the introduction of the &lt;code&gt;JsonMarshal&lt;/code&gt; class and the &lt;code&gt;GetRawUtf8Value&lt;/code&gt; method, which provides raw access to the underlying bytes of property values fronted by a &lt;code&gt;JsonElement&lt;/code&gt;. For situations where the name of the property is also needed, dotnet/runtime#107784 from @mwadams provides a corresponding &lt;code&gt;JsonMarshal.GetRawUtf8PropertyName&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Diagnostics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the years, I’ve seen a fair number of codebases introduce a &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;-based &lt;code&gt;ValueStopwatch&lt;/code&gt;; I think there are even a few still floating around the &lt;code&gt;Microsoft.Extensions&lt;/code&gt; libraries. The premise behind these is that &lt;code&gt;System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt;, but it simply wraps a &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; (a timestamp), so rather than writing code like the following that allocates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Stopwatch sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();&amp;#13;
... // something being measured&amp;#13;
sw.Stop();&amp;#13;
TimeSpan elapsed = sw.Elapsed;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;you could write:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ValueStopwatch sw = ValueStopwatch.StartNew();&amp;#13;
... // something being measured&amp;#13;
sw.Stop();&amp;#13;
TimeSpan elapsed = sw.Elapsed;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and avoid the allocation. &lt;code&gt;Stopwatch&lt;/code&gt; subsequently gained helpers that make such a &lt;code&gt;ValueStopwatch&lt;/code&gt; less appealing, since as of .NET 7, I can write it instead like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;long start = Stopwatch.GetTimestamp();&amp;#13;
... // something being measured&amp;#13;
long end = Stopwatch.GetTimestamp();&amp;#13;
TimeSpan elapsed = Stopwatch.GetElapsedTime(start, end);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, that’s not quite as natural as the original example, that just uses &lt;code&gt;Stopwatch&lt;/code&gt;. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could write the original example and have it executed as if it were the latter? With all the investments in .NET 9 and .NET 10 around escape analysis and stack allocation, you now can. dotnet/runtime#111834 streamlines the &lt;code&gt;Stopwatch&lt;/code&gt; implementation so that &lt;code&gt;StartNew&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Elapsed&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Stop&lt;/code&gt; are fully inlineable. At that point, the JIT can see that the allocated &lt;code&gt;Stopwatch&lt;/code&gt; instance never escapes the frame, and it can be stack allocated.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#117031 is a nice improvement that helps reduce working set for anyone using an &lt;code&gt;EventSource&lt;/code&gt; and that has events with really large IDs. For efficiency purposes, &lt;code&gt;EventSource&lt;/code&gt; was using an array to map event ID to the data for that ID; lookup needs to be really fast, since the lookup is performed on every event write in order to look up the metadata for the event being written. In many &lt;code&gt;EventSource&lt;/code&gt;s, the developer authors events with a small, contiguous range of IDs, and the array ends up being very dense. But if a developer authors any event with a really large ID (which we’ve seen happen in multiple real-world projects, due to splitting events into multiple partial class definitions shared between different projects and selecting IDs for each file unlikely to conflict with each other), an array is still created with a length to accomodate that large ID, which can result in a really big allocation that persists for the lifetime of the event source, and a lot of that allocation ends up just being wasted space. Thankfully, since &lt;code&gt;EventSource&lt;/code&gt; was written years ago, the performance of &lt;code&gt;Dictionary&amp;lt;TKey, TValue&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; has increased significantly, to the point where it’s able to efficiently handle the lookups without needing the event IDs to be dense. Note that there should really only ever be one instance of a given &lt;code&gt;EventSource&lt;/code&gt;-derived type; the recommended pattern is to store one into a static readonly field and just use that one. So the overheads incurred as part of this are primarily about the impact that single large allocation has on working set for the duration of the process. To make it easier to demonstrate, though, I’m doing something you’d never, ever do, and creating a new instance per event. Don’t try this at home, or at least not in production.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#107333 from @AlgorithmsAreCool reduces thread contention involved in starting and stopping an &lt;code&gt;Activity&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;ActivitySource&lt;/code&gt; maintains a thread-safe list of listeners, which only changes on the rare occasion that a listener is registered or unregistered. Any time an &lt;code&gt;Activity&lt;/code&gt; is created or destroyed (which can happen at very high frequency), each listener gets notified, which requires walking through the list of listeners. The previous code used a lock to protect that listeners list, and to avoid notifying the listener while holding the lock, the implementation would take the lock, determine the next listener, release the lock, notify the listener, and rinse and repeat until it had notified all listeners. This could result in significant contention, as multiple threads started and stopped &lt;code&gt;Activity&lt;/code&gt;s. Now with this PR, the list switches to be an immutable array. Each time the list changes, a new array is created with the modified set of listeners. This makes the act of changing the listeners list much more expensive, but, as noted, that’s generally a rarity. And in exchange, notifying listeners becomes much cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;dotnet/runtime#117334 from @petrroll avoids the overheads of callers needing to interact with null loggers by excluding them in &lt;code&gt;LoggerFactory.CreateLoggers&lt;/code&gt;, while dotnet/runtime#117342 seals the &lt;code&gt;NullLogger&lt;/code&gt; type so type checks against &lt;code&gt;NullLogger&lt;/code&gt; (e.g. &lt;code&gt;if (logger is NullLogger&lt;/code&gt;) can be made more efficient by the JIT. And dotnet/roslyn-analyzers# from @mpidash will help developers to realize that their logging operations aren’t as cheap as they thought they might be. Consider this code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[LoggerMessage(Level = LogLevel.Information, Message = "This happened: {Value}")]&amp;#13;
private static partial void Oops(ILogger logger, string value);&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
public static void UnexpectedlyExpensive()&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    Oops(NullLogger.Instance, $"{Guid.NewGuid()} {DateTimeOffset.UtcNow}");&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s using the logger source generator, which will emit an implementation dedicated to this log method, including a log level check so that it doesn’t pay the bulk of the costs associated with logging unless the associated level is enabled:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[global::System.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCodeAttribute("Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Generators", "6.0.5.2210")]&amp;#13;
private static partial void Oops(global::Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger logger, global::System.String value)&amp;#13;
{&amp;#13;
    if (logger.IsEnabled(global::Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel.Information))&amp;#13;
    {&amp;#13;
        __OopsCallback(logger, value, null);&amp;#13;
    }&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except, the call site is doing non-trivial work, creating a new &lt;code&gt;Guid&lt;/code&gt;, fetching the current time, and allocating a string via string interpolation, even though it might be wasted work if &lt;code&gt;LogLevel.Information&lt;/code&gt; isn’t available. This CA1873 analyzer flags that:

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cryptography&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A ton of effort went into cryptography in .NET 10, almost entirely focused on post‑quantum cryptography (PQC). PQC refers to a class of cryptographic algorithms designed to resist attacks from quantum computers, machines that could one day render classic cryptographic algorithms like Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) or Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) insecure by efficiently solving problems such as integer factorization and discrete logarithms. With the looming threat of “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks (where a well-funded attacker idly captures encrypted internet traffic, expecting that they’ll be able to decrypt and read it later) and the multi-year process required to migrate critical infrastructure, the transition to quantum‑safe cryptographic standards has become an urgent priority. In this light, .NET 10 adds support for ML-DSA (a National Institute of Standards and Technology PQC digital signature algorithm), Composite ML-DSA (a draft Internet Engineering Task Force specification for creating signatures that combine ML-DSA with a classical crypto algorithm like RSA), SLH-DSA (another NIST PQC signature algorithm), and ML-KEM (a NIST PQC key encapsulation algorithm). This is an important step towards quantum-resistant security, enabling developers to begin experimenting with and planning for post-quantum identity and authenticity scenarios. While this PQC effort is not about performance, the design of them is very much focused on more modern sensibilities that have performance as a key motivator. While older types, like those that derive from &lt;code&gt;AsymmetricAlgorithm&lt;/code&gt;, are design around arrays, with support for spans tacked on later, the new types are design with spans at the center, and with array-based APIs available only for convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are, however, some cryptography-related changes in .NET 10 that are focused squarely on performance. One is around improving OpenSSL “digest” performance. .NET’s cryptography stack is built on top of the underlying platform’s native cryptographic libraries; on Linux, that means using OpenSSL, making it a hot path for common operations like hashing, signing, and TLS. “Digest algorithms” are the family of cryptographic hash functions (for example, SHA‑256, SHA‑512, SHA‑3) that turn arbitrary input into fixed‑size fingerprints; they’re used all of the place, from verifying packages to TLS handshakes to content de-duplication. While .NET can use OpenSSL 1.x if that’s what’s offered by the OS, since .NET 6 it’s been focusing more and more on optimizing for and lighting-up with OpenSSL 3 (the previously-discussed PQC support requires OpenSSL 3.5 or later). With OpenSSL 1.x, OpenSSL exposed getter functions like &lt;code&gt;EVP_sha256()&lt;/code&gt;, which were cheap functions that just returned a direct pointer to the &lt;code&gt;EVP_MD&lt;/code&gt; for the relevant hash implementation. OpenSSL 3.x introduced a provider model, with a fetch function (&lt;code&gt;EVP_MD_fetch&lt;/code&gt;) for retrieving the provider-backed implementation. To keep source compatibility, the 1.x-era getter functions were changed to return pointers to compatibility shims: when you pass one of these legacy &lt;code&gt;EVP_MD&lt;/code&gt; pointers into operations like &lt;code&gt;EVP_DigestInit_ex&lt;/code&gt;, OpenSSL performs an “implicit fetch” under the covers to resolve the actual implementation. That implicit fetch path adds extra work, on each use. Instead, OpenSSL recommends consumers do an explicit fetch and then cache the result for reuse. That’s what dotnet/runtime#118613 does. The result is leaner and faster cryptographic hash operations on OpenSSL‑based platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;PemEncoding&lt;/code&gt;UTF-8. dotnet/runtime#109438 adds UTF-8 support to&lt;code&gt;PemEncoding&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;code&gt;PemEncoding&lt;/code&gt;, a utility class for parsing and formatting PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail)-encoded data such as that used in certificates and keys, previously worked only with&lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;s. As was then done in dotnet/runtime#109564, this change makes it possible to parse UTF8 data directly without first needing to transcode to UTF16.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;FindByThumbprint&lt;/code&gt;. dotnet/runtime#109130 adds an&lt;code&gt;X509Certification2Collection.FindByThumbprint&lt;/code&gt;method. The implementation uses a stack-based buffer for the thumbprint value for each candidate certificate, eliminating the arrays that would otherwise be created in a naive manual implementation. dotnet/runtime#113606 then utilized this in&lt;code&gt;SslStream&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;SetKey&lt;/code&gt;dotnet/runtime#113146 adds a span-based&lt;code&gt;SymmetricAlgorithm.SetKey&lt;/code&gt;method which can then be used to avoid creating unnecessary arrays.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Peanut Butter&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As in every .NET release, there are a large number of PRs that help with performance in some fashion. The more of these that are addressed, the more the overall overhead for applications and services is lowered. Here are a smattering from this release:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GC. DATAS (Dynamic Adaptation To Application Sizes) was introduced in .NET 8 and enabled by default in .NET 9. Now in .NET 10, dotnet/runtime#105545 tuned DATAS to improve its overall behavior, cutting unnecessary work, smoothing out pauses (especially under high allocation rates), correcting fragmentation accounting that could cause extra short collections (gen1), and other such tweaks. The net result is fewer unnecessary collections, steadier throughput, and more predictable latency for allocation-heavy workloads. dotnet/runtime#118762 also adds several knobs for configuring how DATAS behaves, and in particular settings to fine-tune how Gen0 grows.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GCHandle. The GC supports various types of “handles” that allow for explicit management of resources in relation to GC operation. For example, you can create a “pinning handle,” which ensures that the GC will not move the object in question. Historically, these handles were surfaced to developers via the &lt;code&gt;GCHandle&lt;/code&gt;type, but it has a variety of issues, including that it’s really easy to misuse due to lack of strong typing. To help address that, dotnet/runtime#111307 introduces a few new strongly-typed flavors of handles, with&lt;code&gt;GCHandle&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;PinnedGCHandle&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;WeakGCHandle&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. These should not only address some of the usability issues, they’re also able to shave off a bit of the overheads incurred by the old design.&lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net10.0 --filter "*" using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes; using BenchmarkDotNet.Running; using System.Runtime.InteropServices; BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Tests).Assembly).Run(args); [HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD")] public partial class Tests { private byte[] _array = new byte[16]; [Benchmark(Baseline = true)] public void Old() =&amp;gt; GCHandle.Alloc(_array, GCHandleType.Pinned).Free(); [Benchmark] public void New() =&amp;gt; new PinnedGCHandle&amp;lt;byte[]&amp;gt;(_array).Dispose(); }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Mean&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Ratio&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Old&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;27.80 ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.00&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;New&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;22.73 ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.82&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mono interpreter. The mono interpreter gained optimized support for several opcodes, including switches (dotnet/runtime#107423), new arrays (dotnet/runtime#107430), and memory barriers (dotnet/runtime#107325). But arguably more impactful was a series of more than a dozen PRs that enabled the interpreter to vectorize more operations with WebAssembly (Wasm). This included contributions like dotnet/runtime#114669, which enabled vectorization of shift operations, and dotnet/runtime#113743, which enabled vectorization of a plethora of operations like &lt;code&gt;Abs&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Divide&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;Truncate&lt;/code&gt;. Other PRs used the Wasm-specific intrinsic APIs in more places, in order to accelerate on Wasm routines that were already accelerated on other architectures using architecture-specific intrinsics, e.g. dotnet/runtime#115062 used&lt;code&gt;PackedSimd&lt;/code&gt;in the workhorse methods behind the hex conversion routines on&lt;code&gt;Convert&lt;/code&gt;, like&lt;code&gt;Convert.FromBase64String&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FCALLs. There are many places in the lower-layers of &lt;code&gt;System.Private.CoreLib&lt;/code&gt;where managed code needs to call into native code in the runtime. There are two primary ways this transition from managed to native has happened, historically. One method is through what’s called a “QCALL”, essentially just a DllImport (P/Invoke) into native functions exposed by the runtime. The other, which historically was the dominant mechansim, is an “FCALL,” which is a more complex and specialized pathway that allows direct access to managed objects from native code. FCALLs were once the standard, but over time, more of them were converted to QCALLs. This shift improves reliability (since FCALLs are notoriously tricky to implement correctly) and can also boost performance, as FCALLs require helper method frames, which QCALLs can often avoid. A ton of PRs in .NET 10 went into removing FCALLs, like dotnet/runtime#107218 for helper method frames in&lt;code&gt;Exception&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;GC&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;Thread&lt;/code&gt;, dotnet/runtime#106497 for helper method frames in&lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt;, dotnet/runtime#107152 for those used in connecting to profilers, dotnet/runtime#108415 and dotnet/runtime#108535 for ones in reflection, and over a dozen others. In the end, all FCALLS that touched managed memory or threw exceptions were removed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Converting hex. Recent .NET releases added methods to &lt;code&gt;Convert&lt;/code&gt;like&lt;code&gt;FromHexString&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;TryToHexStringLower&lt;/code&gt;, but such methods all used UTF16. dotnet/runtime#117965 adds overloads of these that work with UTF8 bytes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Formatting. String interpolation is backed by “interpolated string handlers.” When you interpolate with a string target type, by default you get the &lt;code&gt;DefaultInterpolatedStringHandler&lt;/code&gt;that comes from&lt;code&gt;System.Runtime.CompilerServices&lt;/code&gt;. That implementation is able to use stack-allocated memory and the&lt;code&gt;ArrayPool&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;for reduced allocation overheads as it’s buffering up text formatted to it. While very advanced, other code, including other interpolated string handlers, can use&lt;code&gt;DefaultInterpolatedStringHandler&lt;/code&gt;as an implementation detail. However, when doing so, such code only could get access to the final output as a&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;; the underlying buffer wasn’t exposed. dotnet/runtime#112171 adds a&lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;property to&lt;code&gt;DefaultInterpolatedStringHandler&lt;/code&gt;for code that wants access to the already formatted text in a&lt;code&gt;ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enumeration-related allocations. dotnet/runtime#118288 removes a handful of allocations related to enumeration, for example removing a &lt;code&gt;string.Split&lt;/code&gt;call in&lt;code&gt;EnumConverter&lt;/code&gt;and replacing it with a&lt;code&gt;MemoryExtensions.Split&lt;/code&gt;call that doesn’t need to allocate either the&lt;code&gt;string[]&lt;/code&gt;or the individual&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;instances.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NRBF decoding. dotnet/runtime#107797 from @teo-tsirpanis removes an array allocation used in a &lt;code&gt;decimal&lt;/code&gt;constructor call, replacing it instead with a collection expression targeting a span, which will result in the state being stack allocated.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TypeConverter allocations. dotnet/runtime#111349 from @AlexRadch reduces some parsing overheads in the &lt;code&gt;TypeConverter&lt;/code&gt;s for&lt;code&gt;Size&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;SizeF&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Point&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;Rectangle&lt;/code&gt;by using more modern APIs and constructs, such as the span-based&lt;code&gt;Split&lt;/code&gt;method and string interpolation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Generic math conversions. Most of the &lt;code&gt;TryConvertXx&lt;/code&gt;methods using the various primitive’s implementations of the generic math interfaces are marked as&lt;code&gt;MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining&lt;/code&gt;, to help the JIT realize they should always be inlined, but a few stragglers were left out. dotnet/runtime#112061 from @hez2010 fixes that.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ThrowIfNull. C# 14 now supports the ability to write extension static methods. This is a huge boon for libraries that need to support downlevel targeting, as it means static methods can be polyfilled just as instance methods can be. There are many libraries in .NET that build not only for the latest runtimes but also for .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET Framework, and those libraries have been unable to use helper static methods like &lt;code&gt;ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull&lt;/code&gt;, which can help to streamline call sites and make methods more inlineable (in addition, of course, to tidying up the code). Now that the dotnet/runtime repo builds with a C# 14 compiler, dotnet/runtime#114644 replaced ~2500 call sites in such libraries with use of a&lt;code&gt;ThrowIfNull&lt;/code&gt;polyfill.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FileProvider Change Tokens. dotnet/runtime#116175 reduces allocation in &lt;code&gt;PollingWildCardChangeToken&lt;/code&gt;by using allocation-free mechanisms for computing hashes, while dotnet/runtime#115684 from @rameel reduces allocation in&lt;code&gt;CompositeFileProvider&lt;/code&gt;by avoiding taking up space for nop&lt;code&gt;NullChangeToken&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;String interpolation. dotnet/runtime#114497 removes a variety of null checks when dealing with nullable inputs, shaving off some overheads of the interpolation operation. &lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0 using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes; using BenchmarkDotNet.Running; BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Tests).Assembly).Run(args); [HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD")] public partial class Tests { private string _value = " "; [Benchmark] public string Interpolate() =&amp;gt; $"{_value} {_value} {_value} {_value}"; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Runtime&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Mean&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Ratio&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Interpolate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.NET 9.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;34.21 ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.00&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Interpolate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.NET 10.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;29.47 ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.86&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;AssemblyQualifiedName&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;code&gt;Type.AssemblyQualifiedName&lt;/code&gt;previously recomputed the result on every access. As of dotnet/runtime#118389, it’s now cached.&lt;code&gt;// dotnet run -c Release -f net9.0 --filter "*" --runtimes net9.0 net10.0 using BenchmarkDotNet.Attributes; using BenchmarkDotNet.Running; BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Tests).Assembly).Run(args); [MemoryDiagnoser(displayGenColumns: false)] [HideColumns("Job", "Error", "StdDev", "Median", "RatioSD")] public partial class Tests { [Benchmark] public string AQN() =&amp;gt; typeof(Dictionary&amp;lt;int, string&amp;gt;).AssemblyQualifiedName!; }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Runtime&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Mean&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Ratio&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Allocated&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Alloc Ratio&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;AQN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.NET 9.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;132.345 ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.007&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;712 B&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.00&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;AQN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.NET 10.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1.218 ns&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.009&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;–&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.00&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whew! After all of that, I hope you’re as excited as I am about .NET 10, and more generally, about the future of .NET.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you’ve seen in this tour (and in those for previous releases), the story of .NET performance is one of relentless iteration, systemic thinking, and the compounding effect of many targeted improvements. While I’ve highlighted micro-benchmarks to show specific gains, the real story isn’t about these benchmarks… it’s about making real-world applications more responsive, more scalable, more sustainable, more economical, and ultimately, more enjoyable to build and use. Whether you’re shipping high-throughput services, interactive desktop apps, or resource-constrained mobile experiences, .NET 10 offers tangible performance benefits to you and your users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best way to appreciate these improvements is to try .NET 10 RC1 yourself. Download it, run your workloads, measure the impact, and share your experiences. See awesome gains? Find a regression that needs fixing? Spot an opportunity for further improvement? Shout it out, open an issue, even send a PR. Every bit of feedback helps make .NET better, and we look forward to continuing to build with you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happy coding!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Scam Called “You Don't Have to Remember Anything”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dear Zettlers,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This scam is decades old now and it is quite surprising that people still fall for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The search engines, old note-taking apps (you know, those with an elephant icon and the like) and AI have something in common: They claim that the effort of remembering things is outdated like using a candle in the age of electric light.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following is, by the way, from my Zettelkasten (2016):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To find what you need online, you require a solid general education and, above all, prior knowledge in the area related to your search.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original in German:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was man braucht, um im Netz fündig zu werden, ist eine solide Grundbildung und vor allem Vorwissen in dem Bereich, in dem sich die Suche bewegt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;—Manfred Spitzer, Digitale Demenz1&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Culturally, it is increasingly the case that the first step is to go online, search for the a desired end result of a thinking process instead of engaging in learning. This means that we are using the internet less and less to our advantage, because we have less and less prior knowledge: We detrain ourselves out of the ability to access the quality of the information and turn it into actual knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rowlands et al. wrote about the so called “digital natives” that they lack the critical and analytical thinking skills to evaluate the information they find on the internet.2 We need a fully developed mental map of the subject in order to derive value from the results of an internet search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short: You need a trained brain to actually benefit from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The advertised benefits of all these tools come with a specific hidden cost: Your ability to think.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’t take a closer look at the digital natives, since this issue is more accessible. They put themselves in a situation in which there is a vastly reduced incentive structure to evaluate the information critically. They use surface level indicators if the information matches the request. This behaviour has some obvious effects (in hindsight):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The reduced engagement with the material reduces the emotional weight of the whole line of action. You mind is an engine that is fuelled by emotion. Without any emotion, you don’t think. Rather, you try to imitate thinking efficiently.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The more you interact with information being emotionally disengaged and keeping it on the surface level, the more you develop the habit to engage with information in a way that it doesn’t change your brain.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the more you work in a superficial way, the more brittle the knowledge foundation in your mind will be on which you base your cognitive actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This drives us to one of the most important conclusions of the entire field of note-taking, knowledge work, critical thinking and alike: You, not AI, not your PKM or whatever need to build the knowledge because only then it is in your brain and you can go the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me try to give you a demonstration of the issue:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I asked ChatGPT to design an optimal weekly training schedule for health span and fitness. This is the answer:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a table outlining the optimal weekly workout schedule for health span and longevity based on the assumption that you should focus on aerobic capacity, muscle strength, mobility/flexibility, and neuromuscular coordination:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Day&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Workout Type&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Focus&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Duration&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Details&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Monday&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Full-Body Strength Training&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Muscle mass, metabolic health&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;45–60 min&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Warm-up: Dynamic stretches (5 min) - Squats, Deadlifts, Push-ups, Pull-ups (3x 8–12 reps) - Core: Plank (3x 30–60 sec) - Cool-down: Static stretches (5 min)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Tuesday&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Low-Intensity Cardio &amp;amp; Mobility&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Heart health, joint function&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;30–60 min&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Brisk walking, cycling, or swimming (30–45 min) - Yoga or joint mobility exercises (15 min)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Wednesday&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Cardiovascular fitness, metabolism&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;20–30 min&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Warm-up: Light jogging (5 min) - 30 sec sprint / 90 sec walk (15–20 min) OR Bodyweight circuit (40 sec on/20 sec rest) - Cool-down: Stretching (5 min)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Thursday&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Active Recovery &amp;amp; Balance&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Recovery, neuromuscular coordination&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;30–45 min&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Easy yoga, tai chi, or a nature walk (20–30 min) - Balance drills: Single-leg stands, heel-to-toe walking (10–15 min)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Friday&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Upper-Body Strength &amp;amp; Core&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Upper-body strength, core stability&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;45–60 min&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Warm-up: Arm/shoulder stretches (5 min) - Overhead Press, Pull-ups, Push-ups, Rows (3x 8–12 reps) - Core: Russian twists or bird-dogs (3 sets) - Cool-down: Static stretches (5 min)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Saturday&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Moderate-Intensity Cardio&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Endurance, cardiovascular health&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;45–60 min&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Steady activity: Jogging, cycling, swimming, rowing, or hiking (60–70% max heart rate) - Cool-down: Easy pace and stretches (5 min)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sunday&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Mobility &amp;amp; Flexibility&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Recovery, flexibility&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;30–60 min&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Yoga session focusing on stretching major muscle groups - Foam rolling or myofascial release&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looks good alright? Or does it? How do you know? You can’t if you don’t have sufficient background knowledge. Here is a little quiz if you have the sufficient background knowledge:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How do volume and intensity factor in strength gains?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What is the difference between aerobic capacity and aerobic power?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How do you weigh each minute spend on flexibility against the minutes spent on aerobic capacity and strength?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you can’t produce a comprehensive answer with confidence and on the whim the second you read the question, you don’t have the sufficient background knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I just ask ChatGPT for that, too!”, the AI generation might ask. Ok, and then what? How can you assess the answers to those three questions (which represent only a fraction of needed knowledge!)?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is going wrong? You are taking on an impossible task, because you can’t use enough of your brain for your cognitive operations. Assuming that you have no comprehensive knowledge in health and fitness, terms like “aerobic capacity” or “core stability” only activate some superficial level associations. But if you are deeply involved with the topic the term “aerobic capacity” activates way more. Here are some examples (just a small fraction):&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;A mental map on the aerobic metabolism.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The tension between peripheral endurance improvements (like mitochondrial biogenesis) central improvements (like improved cardiac output) and their connection (like angiogenesis)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The still ongoing discussion between low intensity exercise and high intensity exercise as the best tool to build aerobic capacity for the non-professional athlete.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The differences between running, cycling, rowing and all the other movements to build aerobic capacity.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An open task to review a paper on interval length that you found in “Textbook of Work Physiology” by Astrand and Rodahl.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a small fraction of what I can observe in my mind and there is a lot more going on unconsciously. Now consider that I might be very well-read in the domain of health and fitness. But multiply this by a factor of 100 if you replace me with an expert like Olaf Alexander Bu when it comes to the term “aerobic capacity”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In knowledge work the bottleneck is not the external availability of information. It is the internal bandwidth of processing power which is determined by your innate abilities and the training status of your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, coming back to the initial starting point that “you don’t have to remember anything”. The opposite is true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have to remember EVERYTHING. Only then you can perform the cognitive tasks necessary to perform meaningful knowledge work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way you train your mind is the way your mind can perform. Simple tools like spaced repetition allow your mind to perform simple tasks, complex tools like the Zettelkasten Method allow your mind to master complex tasks. Remember my mantra of depth of processing? Perhaps, you can rephrase it to train your mind for depth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The field of knowledge work will not advance if we don’t come to terms that we can’t circumvent the work needed to train our minds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Live long and prosper &lt;lb/&gt; Sascha&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From Bors and Homu to Bulldozer, Kodiak, Mergify, and now GitHub and GitLab, merge queues have shaped how we keep main branches green. This article traces their history, why they emerged, and how they became a standard in modern software development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you use GitHub or GitLab today, merge queues feel like a built-in feature of modern development. But their story goes back over a decade, long before "merge queue" was a product term.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It started with a simple problem: How do you keep your main branch green when dozens of developers are merging code simultaneously? Continuous integration clarified that "just merge and hope" wasn't good enough. The solution wasn't a new testing framework but a new workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From early scripts in the Rust project (Bors, Homu) to Shopify's Shipit, to modern SaaS offerings like Mergify and built-in queues from GitHub and GitLab, merge queues evolved out of necessity. What began as side-project bots has become a standard practice for engineering teams at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post walks through that history â the motivations, the people behind it, and how these tools shaped the way we merge code today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The "Not Rocket Science" Rule and Early Experiments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea of a merge queue â automatically ensuring that a main branch is never broken by merged changes â can be traced back over two decades. In the early 2000s, developer Ben Elliston devised a system of cron jobs, multiple repositories, and a database to "automatically maintain a repository of code that always passes all the tests". This approach, later dubbed the "Not Rocket Science Rule of Software Engineering," kept a known-good code branch for developers and customers, preventing the headaches of broken main builds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2013: Graydon Hoare (creator of the Rust language) faced a similar challenge as Rust's contributor base grew. Remembering Elliston's rule, Hoare implemented a small bot named Bors to enforce it. Bors integrated with Rust's build farm and GitHub: it would monitor pull requests, wait for a reviewer's "approve" command, merge the PR into a temporary branch, and run the full test suite. If tests passed, Bors would fast-forward the main branch to that tested merge commit; if not, it would report the failure and leave the main branch untouched. This ensured that Rust's master branch was always green (always passing tests). The motivation was to avoid "merge skew," where changes appear compatible when reviewed in isolation but break once merged into an updated main. (A classic example of merge skew is two PRs that individually pass tests â one renames a function, and another adds a call to the old name, resulting in a broken main after sequential merges). By "testing it first, then promoting it" to main, Bors kept Rust's primary branch stable without human intervention to update or revert commits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust's experience proved the concept's value. As Hoare noted, the approach "is not rocket science" â it's just tedious to do manually, hence ripe for automation. Bors' success meant that by 2014 the Rust and Mozilla Servo projects were using such bots to gate all merges on tests. However, Bors itself was a quick script, and the need for a more extensible solution soon became apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Rust's Homu and the Rise of Merge Bots&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To build a more general tool, Rust contributor Barosl Lee created Homu as a reimplementation and extension of the original Bors bot. Homu was designed to be generic (not Rust-specific) and easier for others to adopt. It implemented the same core idea: maintain a tested integration branch (often called "auto") that includes pending PRs, and only fast-forward &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt; when tests on &lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt; pass. In practice, Homu reversed the usual merge process: instead of merging a PR then testing, it tested the PR before it landed on main by temporarily combining it with the up-to-date main branch. This ensured that "the main branch is always a copy of &lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt; that passed all tests, processing approved PRs one at a time in order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Homu was open source and quickly became integral to Rust's workflow (Rust's own Homu instance was named "bors"). In 2015, Barosl even launched Homu as a service (homu.io), making it easy for other open-source projects to use a hosted merge queue bot. This service gained users in various communities, demonstrating a broader demand for maintaining green main branches. Homu's design was language-agnostic, so projects beyond Rust/Servo could adopt it with their CI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, by around 2018, the original Homu service began to stagnate. The maintainer stopped updating it, the web frontend's source was lost, and eventually the homu.io domain expired. Some projects (like Rust itself) forked and maintained their own Homu instances, but there was clearly room for a modern replacement. This set the stage for the next evolution of merge queue tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bors-NG: Modern Successor to Homu&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter Bors-NG (Bors "Next Generation"), created by Michael Howell. Bors-NG was a complete open-source replacement for Homu, first released around 2017. It was built to be faster, more user-friendly, and easier to host, while preserving the same core idea of tested-then-merged pull requests. Unlike homu.io, Bors-NG had no closed-source components â the public instance at &lt;code&gt;app.bors.tech&lt;/code&gt; ran the same code that anyone could self-host.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bors-NG quickly became popular, especially for teams on GitHub that needed a merge queue before GitHub offered any native solution. Many saw it as the "spiritual successor to Homu, the original Rust merge bot". It integrated with GitHub pull requests and CI services, allowing maintainers to use the familiar &lt;code&gt;bors r+&lt;/code&gt; command to enqueue PRs for merging once tests pass. For years, this combo of Bors-NG + CI filled a critical gap, giving projects large and small a way to avoid merge skew and keep their main branch healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, the Kubernetes project developed a similar concept in parallel â their Prow/Tide system â and other communities like OpenStack had long used a gating bot (Zuul) for Gerrit. These all share the same philosophy pioneered by Bors. Merge queues became recognized as best practice for high-velocity projects where broken merges are unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 2023, however, the landscape changed: GitHub announced its own merge queue feature (more on that later). The author of Bors-NG announced the public Bors-NG service would be deprecated in favor of GitHubâs native Merge Queue. While Bors-NG remains open source for self-hosters, the availability of an official tool signaled a shift. It was a full-circle moment â a concept that started as a community hack had become mainstream enough for GitHub itself to support it out-of-the-box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Industry Solutions: Bulldozer, Mergify, and Kodiak&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In parallel to the Rust community's bots, other engineers and companies were solving the same problem, often "scratching their own itch." This gave rise to several notable merge automation tools in the late 2010s:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bulldozer (2017): Developers at Palantir created Bulldozer as a GitHub App to automate merging and updating PRs. Palantir open-sourced the tool, which could be self-hosted or installed on repos. Bulldozer automatically merges pull requests when all required checks and reviews are satisfied, and it can also auto-update PR branches to keep them in sync with the base branch. Essentially, it removes the manual "update and merge" drudgery in a fast-moving trunk-based development workflow. An example use case is at ACV Auctions, where engineers adopted Palantir's Bulldozer to ensure everyone's feature branch stays up-to-date with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;and merges immediately once tests pass (They noted that for public GitHub usage, Bulldozer could be run as a custom instance, as it wasn't officially listed on the marketplace at the time)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mergify (2018): That's us! Frustration with manual PR management led Julien Danjou and Mehdi Abaakouk to build a small merge automation tool for their team in 2018. That side project struck a chord and soon evolved into Mergify, a full-fledged SaaS product and company. Mergify introduced features to queue, update, and merge PRs with flexible rules, effectively bringing merge queues to any GitHub repository via a cloud service. The founders (long-time open source contributors) initially open-sourced Mergify's code and offered it free for OSS projects. Over the years, Mergify became a popular "CI companion" for teams worldwide, offering advanced queue configurations, priority rules, batch merging, and more on top of GitHub's API. It was essentially "merge queue as a service," well before GitHub's native feature. (As an aside, Mergify's engine was eventually made closed-source in 2022 as the business matured, but it continues to serve thousands of developers.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kodiak (2019): In early 2019, developer Christopher Blump faced constant delays from having to rebase and update PRs in a busy repo with an always-green main policy. He evaluated existing tools like Bulldozer and others, even contributing a patch, but found "none of the existing projectsâ¦ solved the problem of efficiently updating and merging pull requests." So during his college finals in May 2019, he built the first version of Kodiak. Kodiak is an open-source GitHub App that automates the âupdate with latest main and merge if tests pass" dance. It introduced a proper queue to merge PRs in order, eliminating the race condition when multiple developers try to merge at once. The initial version was basic (queue in memory, no persistent state) but solved the pain point. By that summer, Kodiakâs usefulness caught on â it got a considerable boost when Vercelâs CEO tweeted about using it to auto-merge and deploy changes. This endorsement in July 2019 brought a wave of adopters, and Kodiak rapidly grew via word-of-mouth in the open-source community. Kodiak added features like configuration files, persistent queues, and GitHub checks for transparency. It became another popular option for teams wanting a hosted merge bot, though it is not actively maintained anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These tools all shared a common purpose: to safely remove human bottlenecks in merging PRs. They watched for PRs meeting defined conditions (CI passes, approvals present, specific labels, etc.) and then automatically merged them in a controlled way. Many could also keep branches rebased or updated to prevent stale merges. In effect, they implemented merge queues or merge trains outside of the platform â a testament to how universal the need had become by 2018â2019.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that GitLab users were also early to this idea: GitLab introduced an official Merge Trains feature in mid-2019 (GitLab Premium 12.0) to queue merge requests and run "pipelines for merge results" on each in sequence. This was GitLab's integrated solution to guarantee that each MR is tested with all prior changes before landing, much like Bors/Homu's approach. Merge Trains made it easy to auto-merge a series of MRs without breaking the target branch, and even supported batching multiple MR commits into one pipeline run for efficiency. In other words, by 2019 the concept of merge queues had leapt from niche bots to built-in VCS platform features â at least on GitLab.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Internal Merge Queues in Tech Giants&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Large-scale organizations soon recognized that hand-rolling merge queues was often the only way to keep their main branches stable amid heavy developer activity. Uber, for instance, built a system called SubmitQueue to verify and land changes in their monorepo, reducing CI wait times by 74% and dramatically improving merge throughput while keeping the mainline green. Shopify, working on a massive Rails-based monolith, added a merge queue into their deployment tool, Shipit, to prevent accidental merges during backlog surges and maintain pipeline reliability. Similarly, Strava created an internal tool dubbed Butler, a CI-integrated merge queue that enforces orderly merging for their fast-moving engineering teams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Shopify, developers gave positive feedback early on: âBy getting automation involved earlier in the pipeline, we were able to take some of the load off our developers, make them happier, and more productive.â In fact, over 90% of pull requests to Shopifyâs core application now use the Shipit Merge Queue. This demonstrates how merge queues arenât just technical enablersâthey improve engineering experience at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mainstream Adoption: GitHub's Merge Queue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the success of these systems, it was perhaps only a matter of time before GitHub provided native support. Historically, GitHub's stance was more manual: they added a basic "Auto-merge" option in late 2020 that lets a PR merge after checks pass. However, that still didn't handle multiple PRs interacting or ensure rebasing. The true paradigm shift came in 2022â2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHubâs own Merge Queue wasnât born from product planningâit was born from internal necessity. By 2016, GitHub engineers were merging nearly 1,000 pull requests per month into their expansive monorepo. The resulting chaos mandated a smarter system. What emerged was the concept of a "train" â a bundle of PRs tested, deployed, and merged together under human orchestration. This was a precursor to today's fully automated queues. An internal shift began in 2020, when multiple teams pooled efforts to streamline PR merging across internal projects. By mid-2021, GitHub piloted a merge queue in smaller repos and, by 2023, had rolled out an internal system powering thousands of merges monthlyâcutting average wait times by 33% and calling the Merge Queue "one of the best quality-of-life improvements" they'd seen&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, GitHub decided to release its internal merge queue as part of its product. They began experimenting with a first-party Pull Request Merge Queue (PRMQ). After a closed beta, in February 2023, GitHub released its merge queue feature in public beta, and by July 2023, it was generally available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub's Merge Queue closely mirrors the principles established by Bors and others: it maintains a queue of PRs waiting to merge. It ensures each PR is tested in a merged state (often by creating a temporary merge branch for the PR and running CI) before it lands on the base branch. In effect, it automates the formerly tedious process of constantly rebasing or updating PRs and serializing their merges. As GitHub's announcement put it, developers used to have to update their feature branches one-by-one and re-run CI to avoid breaking main; "Merge Queue automates this process" by queuing PRs and testing them with any earlier queued changes. The result is higher velocity and confidence that incompatible changes never break the default branch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The introduction of GitHub's own merge queue was a watershed moment. It validated the approach pioneered by community tools and brought it to a much broader audience. Organizations on GitHub Enterprise Cloud or public open-source projects can now simply toggle on a merge queue in settings, without needing an external bot. The impact was immediately felt: maintainers of Bors-NG announced the phase-out of their hosted service in favor of GitHub's queue, and guidelines for migrating from Bors to GH Merge Queue emerged. Essentially, the ecosystem came full circle â what started as a custom script to enforce an "always-green" rule evolved into a standard platform feature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's important to note that GitHub's initial implementation has some differences in workflow. For example, GH Merge Queue uses a two-phase testing approach (one run on the PR itself, and a second run after queueing when merged into a temporary branch) whereas tools like Bors performed a single integrated test cycle. There are also limitations: among others, GitHub's queue is FIFO only (no priority reordering) and lacks batch merging capabilities. Third-party services like Mergify have pointed out these gaps quickly, since their products offer more advanced queue configurations (multiple queues, priority rules, batching to merge several PRs at once, etc.). In fact, even after GitHub's native queue launch, some teams continued to use or switch to tools like Mergify or others for more flexibility. Nonetheless, the core need is now officially recognized and supported by GitHub, a significant milestone in the history of merge queues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion: From Niche Scripts to Essential Workflow&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a little over a decade, merge queue systems have gone from an obscure hack to an essential part of modern software delivery. The progression tells a story of increasing scale and quality demands:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Early 2010s: Only very large or risk-averse projects (like Rust, Servo, or OpenStack) felt the pain strongly enough to build bespoke solutions (Bors, Homu, Zuul) to guarantee unbreakable main branches. These were novel, community-driven efforts born out of necessity â enforcing the "always passes all tests" rule that was known but rarely automated.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Late 2010s: As continuous integration became ubiquitous and teams adopted trunk-based development, the merge skew problem became more common across the industry. This spurred a wave of tools â some open-source, some commercial â to automate PR merging (Bulldozer, Mergify, Kodiak, and others). They enabled even smaller teams to achieve what only giants could before: continuously integrating code without constantly babysitting CI or worrying about conflicting changes. The fact that a lone developer could write Kodiak in a weekend to solve his team's annoyance, and that it immediately found a user base, speaks to how widespread the need had become.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;2020s: Merge queues became mainstream best practice. Platform support (GitLab's Merge Trains, GitHub's Merge Queue) lowered the barrier to adoption. Today, even teams that never heard of "bors" or "homu" are benefiting from the lessons those tools taught. On GitHub, you can simply enable a branch protection that uses a merge queue, and achieve the same guarantee that âthe main branch is never broken by incompatible changes.â The ecosystem around merge automation is still evolving â with third-party services pushing the envelope on features â but the fundamental approach is here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an academic sense, it's fascinating how a principle from the early 2000s configuration management became a pillar of modern DevOps. The story of merge queue systems is one of increasing automation to support software quality at scale. By eliminating the integration risk of each incremental change, developers can move faster without fear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What began as Graydon Hoare's small Rust bot named after a knight (Bors) has grown into a standard tool in software teams' arsenal, ensuring that code integration is "not rocket science" but a well-engineered process. Merge queues have evolved from niche hacks into an industry standardâbecause as PR velocity increased, they weren't a luxury, they became an operational necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
