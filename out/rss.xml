    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Offline card payments should be possible no later than 1 July 2026&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Press release The Riksbank and representatives from the payment market have today reached an agreement to increase the possibility to make offline card payments for essential goods. The agreement is an important step in the work to strengthen Sweden's payment preparedness and increase resilience to disruptions in the digital payments system. The goal is for the measures to be in place no later than 1 July 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIn Sweden, we pay digitally to a large degree and the use of cash is low. The general public being able to pay by card for example for food and medicines even in the event of a serious breakdown in data communication, that is offline, is a milestone in our intensified efforts to strengthen emergency preparedness‚Äù, says Governor Erik Thed√©en.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agreement describes the measures that participants in Swedish card payments ‚Äì card issuers, card networks, card acquirers, the retail sector and the Riksbank ‚Äì will implement to increase the possibility of offline payments by card. For instance, financial agents will adapt their regulatory frameworks, and the retail trade will introduce technological solutions. The Riksbank is leading this work and is responsible for monitoring its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe are very pleased that all participants involved are taking responsibility for strengthening Sweden's payment readiness. Some are covered by the Riksbank's regulations, but far from all. We regard the fact that so many are nevertheless choosing to contribute as very positive for Sweden's overall civil preparedness‚Äù, concludes Erik Thed√©en.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The online function shall apply to physical payment cards and accompanying PIN code when purchasing essential goods such as food, medicine and fuel. The Riksbank will continue its work on enabling offline payments for other payment methods after 1 July 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Zig Builds Are Getting Faster&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Kelley famously (or infamously, depending on your views) said "the compiler is too damn slow, that's why we have bugs."1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, one of the primary stated goals of Zig for years has been faster compile times. The Zig team has been working on extremely hard problems to make this a reality (such as yeeting LLVM, writing their own code generation backends, building their own linkers, and marching towards incremental compilation in general).2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fruits of this multi-year labor are finally starting to show with Zig 0.15.1. The Ghostty project just completed upgrading to Zig 0.15.1, and I'd like to share some real-world build times.3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Build Script Compilation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zig 0.14: 7sec 167ms&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zig 0.15: 1sec 702ms&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the time it takes to build the &lt;code&gt;build.zig&lt;/code&gt; script itself. The
times above were measured by running &lt;code&gt;zig build --help&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A well-written build script should only rebuild itself rarely. However, this is a cost every new uncached source build will pay (e.g. a user downloading the project to build from source one time). As such, it directly impacts the time to build a usable binary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Full Uncached Ghostty Binary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zig 0.14: 41sec&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zig 0.15: 32sec&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This includes the time to build the build script itself. Given the prior results, Zig 0.15 is building everything else ~2 seconds faster. But, you can still see in wall time the change in this initial build time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important: most of this is still using LLVM. Ghostty still can't fully build and link using the self-hosted x86_64 backend, since the backend still has bugs. So, this just shows the general improvements in the Zig compiler itself, even with LLVM in the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once Ghostty can use the self-hosted x86_64 backend completely, I expect this time to plummet to around 25 seconds or less, fully half the time it would take with Zig 0.14.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Incremental Build (Ghostty Executable)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zig 0.14: 19sec&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zig 0.15: 16sec&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the time it takes to rebuild Ghostty after a one-line change to the most core terminal emulation code (adding a log function call to the escape sequence parser).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This build has a fully cached build script and dependency graph, so it is only rebuilding what it needs to. Incremental compilation in Zig isn't functional yet, so this still recompiles a considerable amount of code. Additionally, as with the prior section, this is still using LLVM. By simply dropping LLVM out of the picture, I expect this time to drop to around 12 seconds or so (less the time LLVM is emitting).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going further, once Zig supports incremental compilation, I expect we'll be able to measure incremental builds like this within milliseconds at worst. But, let's wait and see when that is reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Incremental Build (libghostty-vt)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zig 0.14: 2sec 884ms&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zig 0.15: 975ms&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the time it takes to rebuild only libghostty-vt after a one-line change. Unlike the Ghostty executable, &lt;code&gt;libghostty-vt&lt;/code&gt;
is fully functional with the self-hosted x86_64 backend, so this
shows the differences in build times without LLVM in the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to the Ghostty executable, this is still rebuilding the full Zig module for &lt;code&gt;libghostty-vt&lt;/code&gt;, since incremental compilation isn't
fully functional yet. I expect this to also drop to single-digit milliseconds
at worst once incremental compilation is a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But still, a sub-second build time for a non-trivial library is amazing. This is the library I'm spending most of my time working on right now, and even in a few short days since upgrading to Zig 0.15.1, I've felt a huge difference in my workflow. Previously, I might tab out to read an email between builds or tests, but now its so fast I can stay in flow in my terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This improvement is most indicative of what's to come in the short term. The self-hosted x86_64 backend is already stable enough to build all debug builds by default and the aarch64 backend is getting there, too. We aren't able to build the full Ghostty executable yet, but I bet this will get ironed out within months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Faster Builds Are Here&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see, building Ghostty with Zig 0.15.1 is faster in every single scenario, despite the fact that a lot of Ghostty still can't even take advantage of the self-hosted backend! And despite the fact that incremental compilation isn't functional yet!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've loved betting on Zig for Ghostty, and I love that they're focusing on compile times. These improvements are real, and they're here now. And I suspect in the next couple years, the results posted today will look downright slow. üòú&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Footnotes&lt;/head&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Timestamped link: https://youtu.be/5eL_LcxwwHg?t=565 ‚Ü©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This ignores an astronomical amount of work that has gone into making every aspect of the Zig compiler faster, more parallelizable, etc. ‚Ü©&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All measurements done on the same x86_64 Linux machine. ‚Ü©&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was recently in the market for a new FPGA to start building my upcoming projects on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to the scale of my upcoming projects a Xilinx series 7 UltraScale+ FPGA of the Virtex family would be perfect, but a Kintex series FPGA will be sufficient for early prototyping. Due to not wanting to part ways with the eye watering amounts of money that is required for an Vivado enterprise edition license my choice was effectively narrowed to the FPGA chips available under the WebPack version of Vivado.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly Xilinx are well aware of how top of the range the Virtex series are, and doesn‚Äôt offer any Virtex UltraScale+ chips with the webpack license. That said, they do offer support for two very respectable Kintex UltraScale+ FPGA models, the &lt;code&gt;XCKU3P&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;XCKU5P&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These two chips are far from being small hobbyist toys, with the smaller &lt;code&gt;XCUK3P&lt;/code&gt; already boasting +162K LUTs and
16 GTY transceivers, capable, depending on the physical constraints imposed by the chip packaging of
operating at up to 32.75Gb/s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that the chip selection has been narrowed down I set out to look for a dev board.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My requirements for the board where that it featured :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;at least 2 SFP+ or 1 QSFP connector&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a JTAG interface&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a PCIe interface at least x8 wide&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As to where to get the board from, my options where :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Design the board myself&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Get the AXKU5 or AXKU3 from Alinx&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;See what I could unearth on the second hand market&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although option &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; could have been very interesting, designing a
dev board with both a high speed PCIe and ethernet interface was not the goal of
today‚Äôs project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for option &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;,
Alinx is newer vendor that is still building up its credibility in the west,
their technical documentation is a bit sparse, but the feedback seems to be positive with no major issues being reported.
Most importantly, Alinx provided very fairly priced development boards
in the 900 to 1050 dollar range ( +150$ for the HPC FMC SFP+ extension board ).
Although these are not cheap by any metric, compared to the competitions
price point, they are the best value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Option &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; was coming up ahead until I stumbled upon this ebay listing :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For 200$ this board featured a &lt;code&gt;XCKU3P-FFVB676&lt;/code&gt;, 2 SPF+ connector and a x8 PCIe interface.
On the flip side it came with no documentation whatsoever, no guaranty it worked, and the
faint promise in the listing that there was a JTAG interface.
A sane person would likely have dismissed this as an interesting internet oddity, a remanence
of what happens when a generation of accelerator cards gets phased out in favor of the next,
or maybe just an expensive paperweight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I like a challenge, and the appeal of unlocking the 200$ Kintex UltraScale+ development board was too great to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As such, I aim for this article to become the documentation paving the way to though this mirage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The debugger challenge#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Xilinx‚Äôs UG908 Programming and Debugging User Guide (Appendix D) specifies their blessed JTAG probe ecosystem for FPGA configuration and debug. Rather than dropping $100+ on yet another proprietary dongle that‚Äôll collect dust after the project ends, I‚Äôm exploring alternatives. The obvious tradeoff: abandoning Xilinx‚Äôs toolchain means losing ILA integration. However, the ILA fundamentally just captures samples and streams them via JTAG USER registers, there‚Äôs nothing preventing us from building our own logic analyzer with equivalent functionality and a custom host interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter OpenOCD. While primarily targeting ARM/RISC-V SoCs, it maintains an impressive database of supported probe hardware and provides granular control over JTAG operations. More importantly, it natively supports SVF (Serial Vector Format), a vendor-neutral bitstream format that Vivado can export.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The documentation landscape is admittedly sparse for anything beyond 7-series FPGAs, and the most recent OpenOCD documentation I could unearth was focused on Zynq ARM core debugging rather than fabric configuration. But the fundamentals remain sound: JTAG is JTAG, SVF is standardized, and the boundary scan architecture hasn‚Äôt fundamentally changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The approach should be straightforward: generate SVF from Vivado, feed it through OpenOCD with a commodity JTAG adapter, and validate the configuration. Worst case, we‚Äôll need to patch some adapter-specific quirks or boundary scan chain register addresses. Time to find out if this theory holds up in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The plan#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, to resume, the current plan is to buy a second hand hardware accelerator of eBay at a too good to be true price, and try to configure it with an unofficial probe using open source software without any clear official support.&lt;lb/&gt;The answer to the obvious question you are thinking if you, like me, have been around the block a few times is: many things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As such, we need a plan for approaching this. The goal of this plan is to outline incremental steps that will build upon themselves with the end goal of being able to use this as a dev board.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1 - Confirming the board works#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First order of business will be to confirm the board is showing signs of working as intended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a high probability that the flash wasn‚Äôt wiped before this board was sold off, as such the previous bitstream should still be in the flash. Given this board was used as an accelerator, we should be able to use that to confirm the board is working by either checking if the board is presenting itself as a PCIe endpoint or if the SFP‚Äôs are sending the ethernet PHY idle sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2 - Connecting a debugger to it#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next step is going to be to try and connect the debugger. The eBay listing advertised there is a JTAG interface, but the picture is grainy enough that where that JTAG is and what pins are available is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, we have no indication of what devices are daisy chained together onto the JTAG scan chain. This is an essential question for flashing over JTAG, so it will need to be figured out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, it would also be strategic to try and do some more probing into the FPGA via JTAG. Xilinx FPGAs exposes a handful of useful system registers accessible over JTAG. The most well known of these interfaces is the SYSMON, which allows us, among other things, to get real time temperature and voltage reading from inside the chip. Although openOCD doesn‚Äôt have SYSMON support out of the box it would be worth while to build it, to :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Familiarise myself with openOCD scripting, this might come in handy when building my ILA replacement down the line&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Having an easy side channel to monitor FPGA operating parameters&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make a contribution to openOCD as it have support for the interfacing with XADC but not SYSMON&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3 - Figuring out the Pinout#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hardest part will be figuring out the FPGA‚Äôs pinout and my clock sources. The questions that need answering are :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;what external clocks sources do I have, what are there frequencies and which pins are they connected to&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;which transceivers are the SFPs connected to&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;which transceivers is the PCIe connected to&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4 - Writing a bitstream#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For now I will be focusing on writing a temporary configurations over JTAG to the CCLs and not re-writing the flash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That plan is to trying writing either the bitstream directly though openOCD‚Äôs &lt;code&gt;virtex2&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;pld&lt;/code&gt; drivers, or by replaying the
SVF generated by Vivado.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I believe a low iteration time is paramount to project velocity and getting big things done, I also want automatize all of the Vivado flow from taking the rtl to the SVF generation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simple enough ?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Liveness test#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few days later my prize arrived via express mail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly it even came with a free 25G SFP28 Huawei transceiver rated for a 300m distance and a single 1m long OS2 fiber patch cable. This was likely not intentional as the transceiver was jammed in the SFP cage, but it was still very generous of them to include the fiber patch cable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The board also came with a travel case and half of a PCIe to USB adapter and a 12V power supply that one could use to power the board as a standalone device. Although this standalone configuration will not be of any use to me, for those looking to develop just networking interfaces without any PCIe interface, this could come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall the board looked a little worn, but both the transceiver cages and PCIe connectors didn‚Äôt look to be damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Standalone configuration#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before real testing could start I first did a small power-up test using the PCIe to USB adapter that the seller provided. I was able to do a quick check using the LEDs and the FPGAs dissipated heat that the board seemed to be powering up at a surface level (pun intended).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;PCIe interface#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I didn‚Äôt want to directly plug mystery hardware into my prized build server, I decided to use a Raspberry Pi 5 as my sacrificial test device and got myself an external PCIe adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It just so happened that the latest Raspberry Pi version, the Pi 5, now features an external PCIe Gen 2.0 x1 interface. Though our FPGA can handle up to a PCIe Gen 3.0 and the board had a x8 wide interface, since PCIe standard is backwards compatible and the number of lanes on the interface can be downgraded, plugging our FPGA with this Raspberry Pi will work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After both the Raspberry and the FPGA were booted, I SSHed into my rpi and started looking for the PCIe enumeration sequence logged from the Linux PCIe core subsystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;dmesg&lt;/code&gt; log :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[    0.388790] pci 0000:00:00.0: [14e4:2712] type 01 class 0x060400

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Background information#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since most people might not be intimately as familiar with PCIe terminology, allow me to quickly document what is going on here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;0000:00:00.0&lt;/code&gt;: is the identifier of a specific PCIe device connected through the PCIe network
to the kernel, it read as &lt;code&gt;domain&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;bus&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;device&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;code&gt;function&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[14e4:2712]&lt;/code&gt;: is the device‚Äôs &lt;code&gt;[vendor id:device id]&lt;/code&gt;, these vendor id identifiers are
assigned by the PCI standard body to hardware vendors. Vendors are then free to define there
own vendor id‚Äôs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The full list of official vendor id‚Äôs and released device id can be found : https://admin.pci-ids.ucw.cz/read/PC/14e4 or in the linux kernel code : https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/7aac71907bdea16e2754a782b9d9155449a9d49d/include/linux/pci_ids.h#L160-L3256&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;type 01&lt;/code&gt;: PCIe has two types of devices, bridges allowing the connection of multiple downstream devices to an
upstream device, and endpoints are the leafs.
Bridges are of type &lt;code&gt;01&lt;/code&gt; and endpoints of type &lt;code&gt;00&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;class 0x60400&lt;/code&gt;: is the PCIe device class, it categorizes the kind of function the device performs. It
uses the following format &lt;code&gt;0x[Base Class (8 bits)][Sub Class (8 bits)][Programming Interface (8 bits)]&lt;/code&gt;,
( note : the sub class field might be unused ).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;code&gt;[    0.388790] pci 0000:00:00.0: [14e4:2712] type 01 class 0x060400
[    0.495759] pci 0000:01:00.0: [dabc:1017] type 00 class 0x020000
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firstly the PCIe subsystem logs that at &lt;code&gt;0000:00:00.0&lt;/code&gt; it has discovered a Broadcom BCM2712 PCIe Bridge ( vendor id &lt;code&gt;14e4&lt;/code&gt;, device id &lt;code&gt;0x2712&lt;/code&gt; ).This bridge (type &lt;code&gt;01&lt;/code&gt;) class &lt;code&gt;0x0604xx&lt;/code&gt; tells us it is a PCI-to-PCI bridge, meaning it is essentially creating additional PCIe lanes downstream for endpoint devices or additional bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The subsystem then discovers a second device at &lt;code&gt;0000:01:00.0&lt;/code&gt;, this is an endpoint (type &lt;code&gt;00&lt;/code&gt;), and class &lt;code&gt;0x02000&lt;/code&gt; tells us it is an ethernet networking equipment.&lt;lb/&gt;Of note &lt;code&gt;dabc&lt;/code&gt; doesn‚Äôt correspond to a known vendor id.
When designing a PCIe interface in hardware these
are parameters we can configured. Additionally, among the different ways Linux uses to identify which driver to load for a PCIe device
the vendor id and device id can be used for matching. Supposing we are implementing custom logic, in order to prevent any bug where the wrong driver
might be loaded, it is best to use a separate vendor id.
This also helps identify your custom accelerator at a glance and use it to load your custom driver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As such, it is not surprising to see an unknown vendor id appear for an FPGA, this with the class as an ethernet networking device is a strong hint this is our board.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Full PCIe device status#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dmesg logs have already given us a good indication that our FPGA board and its PCIe interface was working but to confirm with certainty that the device with vendor id &lt;code&gt;dabc&lt;/code&gt; is our FPGA we now turn to &lt;code&gt;lspci&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;lspci -vvv&lt;/code&gt; is the most verbose output and gives us a full overview of the detected PCIe devices capabilities and current configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our board, the following lines are particularly interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;                LnkCap: Port #0, Speed 8GT/s, Width x8, ASPM not supported
                        ClockPM- Surprise- LLActRep- BwNot- ASPMOptComp+

                LnkSta: Speed 5GT/s (downgraded), Width x1 (downgraded)0x060400
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;LnkCap&lt;/code&gt; tells us about the full capabilities of this PCIe device, here we can see that
the current design supports PCIe Gen 3.0 x8.
The &lt;code&gt;LnkSta&lt;/code&gt; tells us the current configuration, here we have been downgraded to PCIe Gen 2.0 at 5GT/s with a width of only x1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During startup of when a new PCIe device is plugged, PCIe performs a link speed and width negotiation where it tries to reach the highest supported stable configuration for the current system. In our current system, though our FPGA is capable of 8GT/s, as it is located downstream of the Broadcom bridge with a maximum link capacity of Gen 2.0 ( 5GT/s ), the FPGA has been downgraded to 5GT/s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for the width of x1, that is expected since the Broadcom bridge is also only x1 wide, and our board‚Äôs other 7 PCIe lanes are literally hanging over the side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, we can finally confirm that this is our board and that the PCIe interface is working. We can now proceed to establishing the JTAG connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;JTAG interface#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Xilinx FPGAs can be configured by writing a bitstream to their internal CMOS Configuration Latches (CCL). CCL is SRAM memory and volatile, thus the configuration is re-done on every power cycle. For devices in the field this bitstream would be read from an external SPI memory during initialization, or written from an external device, such as an embedded controller. But for development purposes overwriting the contents of the CCLs over JTAG is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This configuration is done by shifting in the entire FPGA bitstream into the device‚Äôs configuration logic over the JTAG bus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;FPGA board JTAG interface#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As promised by the original eBay listing the board did come with an accessible JTAG interface, and gloriously enough, this time there wasn‚Äôt even the need for any additional soldering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to a power reference, and ground, conformely to the Xilinx JTAG interface it featured the four mandatory signals comprising the JTAG TAP :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TCK Test Clock&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TMS Test Mode Select&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TDI Test Data Input&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;TDO Test Data Output&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of note, the JTAG interface can also come with an independent reset signal. But since Xilinx JTAG interfaces do not have this independent reset signal, we be using the JTAG FSM reset state for our reset signal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This interface layout doesn‚Äôt follow a standard layout so I cannot just plug in one of my debug probes, it requires some re-wiring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Segger JLINK :heart:#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do not own an AMD approved JTAG programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditionally speaking, the Segger JLink is used for debugging embedded CPUs let them be standalone or in a Zynq, and not for configuring FPGAs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, all we need to do is use JTAG to shift in a bitstream to the CCLs, so technically speaking any programmable device with 4 sufficiently fast GPIOs can be used as a JTAG programmer. Additionally, the JLink is well supported by OpenOCD, the JLink‚Äôs libraries are open source, and I happened to own one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Wiring#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rewiring :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JTAG is a parallel protocol where &lt;code&gt;TDI&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;TMS&lt;/code&gt; will be captured according to &lt;code&gt;TCK&lt;/code&gt;.
Because of this, good JTAG PCB trace length matching is advised in order to minimize skew.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideally a custom connector with length matched traces to work as an interface between the JLink‚Äôs probe and a board specific connector would be used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, here we are shoving breadboard wires between our debugger and the board. Since OpenOCD allows us to easily control the debugger clock speed, we can increase the skew tolerance by slowing down the TCK clock signal. As such there is no immediate need for a custom connector but we will not be able to reach the maximum JTAG speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No issues were encountered at these speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;OpenOCD#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenOCD is a free and open source on-chip debugger software that aims to be compatible with as many probes, boards and chips as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since OpenOCD has support for the standard SVF file format, my plan for my flashing flow will be to use Vivado to generate the SVF and have OpenOCD flash it. Now, some of you might be starting to notice that I am diverging quite far from the well lit path of officially supported tools. Not only am I using a not officially supported debug probe, but I am also using some obscure open source software with questionable support for interfacing with Xilinx UltraScale+ FPGAs. You might be wondering, given that the officially supported tools can already prove themselves to be a headache to get working properly, why am I seemingly making my life even harder?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason is quite simple: when things inevitably start going wrong, as they will, having an entirely open toolchain, allows me to have more visibility as to what is going on and the ability to fix it. I cannot delve into a black box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Building OpenOCD#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default the version of OpenOCD that I got on my server via the official packet manager was outdated and missing features I will need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, since saving the ability to modify OpenOCD‚Äôs source code could come in handy, I decided to re-build it from source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, in the following logs, I will be running OpenOCD version &lt;code&gt;0.12.0+dev-02170-gfcff4b712&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note : I have also re-build the JLink libs from source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Determining the scan chain#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I do not have the schematics for the board I do not know how many devices are daisy-chainned on the board JTAG bus. Also, I want to confirm if the FPGA on the ebay listing is actually the one on the board. In JTAG, each chained device exposes an accessible &lt;code&gt;IDCODE&lt;/code&gt; register used to identify the manufacturer, device type, and revision number.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When setting up the JTAG server, we typically define the scan chain by specifying the expected &lt;code&gt;IDCODE&lt;/code&gt; for each TAP and the corresponding instruction register length, so that instructions can be correctly aligned and routed to the intended device.
Given this is an undocumented board off Ebay, I do not know what the chain looks like.
Fortunately, OpenOCD has an autoprobing functionality, to do a blind interrogation in an attempt to discover
the available devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, my first order of business was doing this autoprobing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In OpenOCD the autoprobing is done when the configuration does not specify any taps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;source [find interface/jlink.cfg]
transport select jtag

set SPEED 1
jtag_rclk $SPEED
adapter speed $SPEED

reset_config none
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The blind interrogation successfully discovered a single device on the chain with an &lt;code&gt;IDCODE&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;0x04a63093&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

precisely with the expected value for the &lt;code&gt;KU3P&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default OpenOCD assumes a JTAG IR length of 2 bits, while our FPGA has an IR length of 6 bits. This is the cause behind the IR capture error encountered during autoprobing. By updating the script with an IR length of 6 bits we can re-detect the FPGA with no errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on the probing, this is the JTAG scan chain for our board :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;System Monitor Registers#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previous generations of Xilinx FPGA had a system called the XADC that, among other features, allowed you to acquire chip temperature and voltage readings. The newer UltraScale and UltraScale+ family have deprecated this XADC module in favor of the SYSMON (and SYSMON4) which allows you to also get these temperature readings, just better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, openOCD didn‚Äôt have support for reading the SYSMON over JTAG out of the box, so I will be adding it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be more precise, the Kintex UltraScale+ has a SYSMON4 and not a SYSMON. For full context, there are 3 flavors of SYSMON:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;SYSMON1&lt;/code&gt;used in the Kintex and Virtex UltraScale series&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;SYSMON4&lt;/code&gt;used in the Kintex, Virtex and in the Zynq programmable logic for the UltraScale+ series&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;SYSMON&lt;/code&gt;used in the Zynq in the processing system of the UltraScale+ series.&lt;lb/&gt;Yes, you read that correctly the Zynq of the UltraScale+ series features not one, but at least two unique SYSMON instances.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the purpose of this article, all these instances are similar enough that I will be using the terms SYSMON4 and SYSMON interchangeably.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order for the JTAG to interact with the SYSMON, we first need to write the &lt;code&gt;SYSMON_DRP&lt;/code&gt; command to the
JTAG Instruction Register (IR).
Based on the documentation, we see that this command has a value of &lt;code&gt;0x37&lt;/code&gt;, which funnily enough,
is the same command code as the XADC, solidifying the SYSMON as the XADC‚Äôs descendant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SYSMON offers a lot more additional functionalities than just being used to read voltage and temperature, but for today‚Äôs use case we will not be using any of that. Rather, we will focus only on reading a subset of the SYSMON status registers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These status registers are located at addresses &lt;code&gt;(00h-3Fh, 80h-BFh)&lt;/code&gt;,
and contain the measurement results of the analog-to-digital conversions, the flag registers,
and the calibration coefficients. We can select which address we wish to read by writing the
address to the Data Register (DR) over JTAG and the data will be read out of &lt;code&gt;TDO&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Global clock#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On high end FPGAs like the UltraScale+ family, high-speed global clocks are typically driven from external sources using differential pairs for better signal integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the pinout we have two such differential pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First I must determine the nature of these external reference clocks to see how I can use them to drive my clocks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These differential pairs are provided over the following pins:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;100MHz : {E18, D18}&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;156.25MHz : {K7, K6}&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Judging by the naming and the frequencies, the 156.25MHz clock is likely my SFP reference clock, and the 100MHz can be used as my global clock.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can confirm by querying the pin properties.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;The differential pairings are correct: {K6, K7}, {E18, D18}&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We can easily use the 100MHz as a source to drive our global clocking network&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The 156.25MHz clock is to be used as the reference clock for our GTY transceivers and lands on bank 227 as indicated by the &lt;code&gt;PIN_FUNC&lt;/code&gt;property&lt;code&gt;MGTREFCLK0N_227&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We cannot directly use the 156.25MHz clock to drive our global clock network&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With all this we have sufficient information to write a constraint file (&lt;code&gt;xdc&lt;/code&gt;) for this board.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Writing the bitstream#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My personal belief is that one of the most important contributors to design quality is iteration cost. The lower your iteration cost, the higher your design quality is going to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As such I will invest the small upfront cost to have the workflow be as streamlined as efficiently feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus, my workflow evolved into doing practically everything over the command line interfaces and only interacting with the tools, Vivado in this case, through tcl scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Vivado flow#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal of this flow is to, given a few verilog design and constraint files produce a SVF file. Our steps are :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;creat the Vivado project &lt;code&gt;setup.tcl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;run the implementation &lt;code&gt;build.tcl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;generate the bitstream and the SVF &lt;code&gt;gen.tcl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will be using &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; to kick off and manage the dependencies between the different steps, though I recognise this isn‚Äôt a widespread practice for hardware projects. &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; is a highly flexible, reliable and powerful tool and I believe its ability to tie together any type of workflow makes it a prime tool for this use case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will be invoking Vivado in batch mode, this allows us to provide a tcl script alongside script arguments, the format is as following :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;vivado -mode batch &amp;lt;path to tcl script&amp;gt; -tclargs &amp;lt;script args&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though this allows us to easily break down our flow into incremental stages, invoking a single script in batch mode has the drawback of restarting Vivado and needing to re-load the project or the project checkpoint on each invocation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the project size grows so will the project load time, so segmenting the flow into a large number of independent scripts comes at an increasing cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Generating the SVF file#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SVF for Serial Vector Format is a human readable, vendor agnostic specification used to specify JTAG bus operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example SVF file, test program:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;! Initialize UUT
STATE RESET;
! End IR scans in DRPAUSE
ENDIR DRPAUSE;
! End DR scans in DRPAUSE

! 16 bit DR scan, check BIST status
SDR 16 TDI (0000) TDO(1234) MASK(FFFF);
! Enter Test-Logic-Reset

! End Test Program
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vivado can generate a hardware aware SVF file containing the configuration sequence for an FPGA board, allowing us to write a bitstream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the SVF file literally contains the bitstream written in clear hexademical, in the file, our first step is to generate our design‚Äôs bitstream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vivado proper isn‚Äôt the software that generates the SVF file, this task is done by the hardware manager which handles all of the configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can launch a new instance &lt;code&gt;open_hw_manager&lt;/code&gt; and connect to it &lt;code&gt;connect_hw_server&lt;/code&gt;.
Since JTAG is a daisy chained bus, and given the SVF file is just a standardised way of specifying
JTAG bus operations, in order to generate a correct JTAG configuration sequence, we must inform the hardware manger
of our scan chain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During our earlier probing of the scan chain, we have established that our FPGA is the only device on the chain. We inform the hardware manager of this by creating a new device configuration ( the term ‚Äúdevice‚Äù refers to the ‚Äúboard‚Äù here ) and add our fpga to the chain using the &lt;code&gt;create_hw_device -part &amp;lt;device name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.When we have multiple
devices we should register them following the order in which they appear on the chain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally to generate the SVF file, we must select the device we wish to program with &lt;code&gt;program_hw_device &amp;lt;hw_device&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;,
then write out the SVF to the file using &lt;code&gt;write_hw_svf &amp;lt;path to svf file&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;gen.tcl&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;set checkpoint_path [lindex $argv 0]
set out_dir [lindex $argv 1]

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Configuring the FPGA using OpenOCD#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although not widespread openOCD has a very nice &lt;code&gt;svf&lt;/code&gt; execution command :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;head&gt;18.1 SVF: Serial Vector Format#&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Serial Vector Format, better known as SVF, is a way to represent JTAG test patterns in text files. In a debug session using JTAG for its transport protocol, OpenOCD supports running such test files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Command]svf filename [-tap tapname] [[-]quiet] [[-]nil] [[-]progress] [[-]ignore_error]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;This issues a JTAG reset (Test-Logic-Reset) and then runs the SVF script from filename. Arguments can be specified in any order; the optional dash doesn‚Äôt affect their se- mantics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Command options:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-tap&lt;/code&gt;tapname ignore IR and DR headers and footers specified by the SVF file with HIR, TIR, HDR and TDR commands; instead, calculate them automatically according to the current JTAG chain configuration, targeting tapname;&lt;code&gt;[-]quiet&lt;/code&gt;do not log every command before execution;&lt;code&gt;[-]nil&lt;/code&gt;‚Äúdry run‚Äù, i.e., do not perform any operations on the real interface;&lt;code&gt;[-]progress&lt;/code&gt;enable progress indication;&lt;code&gt;[-]ignore&lt;/code&gt;_error continue execution despite TDO check errors.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We invoke it in our openOCD script using the &lt;code&gt;-progress&lt;/code&gt; option for additional logging.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Resulting in a successfully configured our FPGA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion#&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For $200 we got a fully working decommissioned Alibaba Cloud accelerator featuring a Kintex UltraScale+ FPGA with an easily accessible debugging/programming interface and enough pinout information to define our own constraint files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also have a fully automated Vivado workflow to implement our designs and the ability to write the bitstream, and interface with the FPGA‚Äôs internal JTAG accessible registers using an open source programming tool without the need for an official Xilinx programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, this project delivered an at least 5x cost savings over commercial boards (compared to the lowest cost $900-1050 Alinx alternatives), making this perhaps the most cost effective entry point for a Kintex UltraScale+ board.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first project that I worked on for Apple after starting in August 1979 was writing low level software for the Silentype printer (see What Hath Woz Wrought), a cute, inexpensive thermal printer for the Apple II, that was based on technology licensed from a local company named Trendcom. In typical Apple fashion, we improved on Trendcom's design by replacing their relatively expensive controller board with a much simpler one that relied on the microprocessor in the Apple II to do most of the dirty work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only other engineer working on the project was Victor Bull, who was the hardware designer and also the project leader. Vic was smart, taciturn and easy to work with, and I learned a lot from him about how thermal printers worked, as well as how things worked at Apple. We finished the project quickly, and the Silentype shipped in November 1979, less than four months after I began working on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In May 1984, during my leave of absence from Apple (see Leave Of Absence), I received a phone call from Victor Bull, who I hadn't heard from in a couple of years. He had left Apple more than a year ago to work with his friend Tom Petrie at a tiny company based in Orinda named Thunderware, that sold a single product called Thunderclock, an inexpensive calendar/clock card for the Apple II. Victor said that he thought that I might be interested in writing software for an exciting, clever new product that Thunderware was developing for the Macintosh, which he refused to describe over the phone. He invited me to come visit them to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In early June, I drove up to Thunderware's office in Orinda, which was about an hour's drive from my house in Palo Alto. After I arrived at their modest headquarters, Vic introduced me to his partner, Tom Petrie, and I signed a non-disclosure agreement before they ushered me into a back room to see their demo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most popular printer for both the Apple II and the Macintosh was the ImageWriter, a $500 dot-matrix printer capable of rendering bitmapped graphics, that was designed and manufactured by Japanese company named C.Itoh Electronics and marketed by Apple. Virtually every Macintosh owner purchased an ImageWriter, since it was the only printer that was supported by Apple. Tom's demo consisted of an ImageWriter printer hooked up to an Apple II, that at first glance appeared to be busily printing away. But when I looked closer, I noticed that instead of blank paper, there was a glossy photograph of a cat threaded through the printer's platen, and the printer's black plastic ribbon cartridge was missing, replaced by a makeshift contraption containing an optical sensing device that trailed an umbilical cord back to the Apple II.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their potential new product, Thunderscan, was a low cost way to temporarily turn an ImageWriter printer into a high resolution scanner, by replacing the ribbon cartridge with an optical sensor and writing some clever software. Since the resolution was determined by the precision of the printer's stepper motors, which had to be very accurate in order to print detailed graphics, Thunderscan, priced at under $200, had better resolution than flat bed scanners costing more than ten times as much. I loved the cleverness of the ingenious concept, and the Woz-like elegance of saving money and adding flexibility by doing everything in software, but there were also a few problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The biggest problem was that Thunderscan could only capture one scan line's worth of data on each pass of the print head, which made it nine times slower than regular printing, since the print head could deposit nine dots at a time. This made for frustratingly slow scanning, often taking over an hour to scan a full page at the highest resolution. Thunderscan was never going to win any races.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another apparent problem was the disappointingly low quality of the image being captured and displayed by Tom Petrie's Apple II application. Tom and Vic said their scanner was capable of capturing up to 32 different levels of light intensity, but both the Apple II (in hi-res mode) and the Macintosh only had one bit per pixel to display, so the software had to simulate gray scales using patterns of black and white dots. It looked like Tom was using a simple threshold algorithm to do the rendering, which threw away most of the gray scale information and made the resulting image look unacceptably blotchy. It was hard to tell if the quality promised by Tom and Vic was there or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tom and Vic proposed to hire me to write Macintosh software for Thunderscan. I knew that a low cost scanner would be a great product for the image hungry Macintosh, but only if it had sufficient quality, and I wasn't sure about that. I told them that I'd think it over during the next few days, and, as I did, I became more excited about the potential of Thunderscan for the Macintosh, realizing that the slow speed wouldn't be that much of an impediment if the quality and resolution was good enough. The low image quality in Tom's prototype was probably caused more by the Apple II software than by anything inherent in the scanner. The Macintosh was almost ten times faster than the Apple II, so it should be able to sample the incoming data better to obtain more horizontal resolution. Plus, I knew a much better algorithm for gray scale rendering that would be fun to try out in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My friend and colleague Bill Atkinson was a talented photographer, and one of his hobbies was playing around with digitized pictures, periodically experimenting to find the best algorithms for rendering them. Bill loved to explain his current work to whoever would listen to him, so I learned a lot about rendering gray scale images over the years simply by being around him. Bill had progressed over the years from using an "ordered dither" algorithm, where varying threshold values are specified in a sliding matrix, to his current favorite, which was a modified version of what was known as the "Floyd-Steinberg" algorithm, where an error term is maintained and distributed proportionally to neighboring pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I called Thunderware and told them I was interested in working on Macintosh software for Thunderscan, in exchange for a per-unit royalty. I drove back up to Orinda, where Tom and Vic gave me lots of documentation about the scanner, and the sample code that Tom had written for the Apple II. For the next couple of months, I drove up to Orinda once a week, usually on Thursday, to meet with Tom and Vic show them my progress, prioritize development issues and discussion various complications as they arose. We would also discuss business terms, but we didn't sign a formal contract until the software was almost finished, when we settled on a royalty of $7.50 per unit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tom and Vic had already encountered and surmounted a number of tough problems just to get scanning going at all. For example, the ImageWriter printer was not really designed to be stepped one scanline at a time, and if you tried that the paper would bunch up against the platen, causing distortion. Tom and Vic solved the problem by commanding the printer to move three steps up and then two steps back, instead of a single step up, which held the paper snugly against the platen as required. There were also various techniques for sensing the beginning and end of the scan line, and some timings that were determined by tedious experimentation for how long it took the printer to respond to a command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took a week or so to get basic scanning working on the Macintosh, and then a few more days to render the gray scale data with Bill's modified Floyd-Steinberg dithering. After shaking out a variety of problems, mostly involving synchronization between the printer and the software, I was surprised and impressed by the consistent high quality of the results. I went through a brief, elated phase of scanning every image in sight that would fit through the printer, just to see how it would turn out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One important design decision that I made early on was to keep the gray scale data around, to allow more flexible image processing. Thunderscan documents were five bits per pixel, before the Macintosh generally supported gray scale, and the user could manipulate the contrast and brightness of selected areas of the image, dodging and burning to reveal detail in the captured image. This also paid off in later versions when we implemented gray scale printing for Postscript printers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My favorite feature that I came up with for Thunderscan had to do with two dimensional scrolling. Thunderscan documents could be quite large, so you could only show a portion of them in the image area of the window. You could scroll the image by dragging with a MacPaint-style "hand" scrolling tool, but you had to drag an awful lot to get to the extremes of a large image. I decided to add what I called "inertial" scrolling, where you gave the image a push and it kept scrolling at a variable speed in the direction of the push, after the mouse button was released. I had to add some hysteresis to keep the image from moving accidentally, and make various other tweaks, but soon I had it working and it felt great to be able to zip around large images by pushing them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hardest feature to perfect was bidirectional scanning. At first, Thunderscan only scanned from left to right, but it wasted time to return the scannner to the left after every scan line. We could almost double the speed if we scanned in both directions, but it was hard to get the adjacent scan lines that were scanned in opposite directions to line up properly. Ultimately, we made bidirectional scanning an optional feature, if you wanted to trade a little quality for greater speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I finished the software in November 1984, after taking a short break to work on something else (see Switcher). Thunderscan shipped in December 1984, and did well from the very beginning, with sales gradually rising from around 1,000 units/month to over 7,500 units/month at its peak in 1987. For a while, it was both the least expensive and highest quality scanning alternative for the Macintosh, although I'm sure it frustrated a lot of users by being too slow. I did three major revisions of the software over the next few years, improving the scan quality and adding features like gray scale printing and eventually gray scale display for the Macintosh II.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually, the flat bed scanners caught up to Thunderscan, and then surpassed it, in both cost, quality and convenience. Over its lifetime, Thunderscan sold approximately 100,000 units and improved countless documents by providing users with an inexpensive way to capture high resolution graphics with their Macintoshes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Self-hosting an email server is useful for automating tasks like mailing lists, newsletters, or email verification APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The elephant in the room is real-world deliverability. With self-hosting you risk not receiving mail or someone missing your mail. I accept this for my personal projects, but you may not. Keep this in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me the selling point of self-hosting is that it√¢s practically free. If you√¢re already self-hosting a website, installing some extra packages on your server and just a bit of your time is all that√¢s required. Mail takes very little storage and the software is light, so you√¢re unlikely to significantly change energy consumption or disk usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the longest time, I perceived self-hosting email as too difficult, but after doing it for one of my projects, I can say it√¢s not much harder or more time-consuming than configuring some email SaaS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I changed my goals a bit to make the setup easier though. Self-hosting a multi-user webmail looks heavy and is more involved than I was willing to get into, so I just skipped it. That way, I didn√¢t have to bother with user accounts, databases, or the web at all, and the task became easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With my config, manually sending and receiving email is possible if you SSH to your mail server and use the minimal sendmail or mailx commands, or Mutt if you like TUI. I've been semi-comfortably using mailx for a month already (with its ancient user interface!), so the setup is enough for me now, but I could expand it in the future, and multi-user webmail isn√¢t completely off the table. Maybe I√¢ll even write a simple webmail package myself!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Setting up Postfix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You just need to open port 25, and install and configure Postfix and OpenDKIM on your machine. Postfix is a complete SMTP server, and is enough for basic mail alone, but in practice you also need OpenDKIM to get your mail delivered to popular services like Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's my Postfix config to show how easy it is. I left the master.cf file as it was, because I√¢m always submitting email locally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The default alias and header check config files are practically self-explanatory (just open them and read the comments!).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;/etc/postfix/main.cf&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;compatibility_level = 3.8 mail_owner = postfix myhostname = mx.idx.cy myorigin = idx.cy mydestination = localhost, idx.cy, maxadamski.com, localchat.cc inet_interfaces = all inet_protocols = ipv4 # Addresses alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/aliases alias_database = $alias_maps recipient_delimiter = + # I'm the only user on my machine, so I send from whichever address I want. #smtpd_sender_login_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sender_login_maps #smtpd_sender_restrictions = reject_authenticated_sender_login_mismatch # spam #in_flow_delay = 1s header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/header_checks setgid_group = postdrop # TLS (strict) smtpd_tls_cert_file = /etc/ssl/tls/mx.idx.cy.crt smtpd_tls_key_file = /etc/ssl/tls/mx.idx.cy.key smtpd_tls_security_level = encrypt smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3, !TLSv1, !TLSv1.1 smtpd_tls_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3, !TLSv1, !TLSv1.1 smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3, !TLSv1, !TLSv1.1 smtp_tls_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3, !TLSv1, !TLSv1.1 # DKIM smtpd_milters = inet:localhost:8891 non_smtpd_milters = inet:localhost:8891 milter_default_action = accept&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that there's no mention of POP3 or IMAP! I did waste some time trying to set them up with Dovecot (because they changed their config format too much, so guides became outdated, and their web docs were just hard to read for me). Ultimately I can just SSH to my server and I feel comfortable with mailx, so I skipped Dovecot. One package less in my system :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TLS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will also need an SSL certificate for encryption in transit. I hate getting and renewing SSL certificates, because the tools are bulky and automation is yet another moving part in your system (I used the lego package, with the manual DNS challenge for simplicity, but I√¢m not too happy about it). I won√¢t give you a tutorial on getting SSL certificates, but note that you don√¢t have to get and renew a certificate for each of your custom domains!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You just need one SSL certificate for your machine to encrypt data in transit to other SMTP servers. If you create an A record mx.example.com pointing to your email machine√¢s IP address, then grab a free certificate for mx.example.com from Let√¢s Encrypt. Then point to it in the Postfix configuration, and you√¢ve got transport encryption! In short, only the MX hostname needs a cert for STARTTLS to be used for encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why no certificates for your actual email domains like example.com? Because the email domain has little to do with transport encryption. TLS only secures the connection between servers. You can still set whatever you want in the From header.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;DKIM, SPF, and DMARC&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You should prove that your emails actually come from your domain to make your mail trustworthy and deliver to Gmail and co. That√¢s what DKIM is for, and fortunately it√¢s a one-time deal per email domain. First you generate a key pair for each domain with OpenDKIM, and then you publish the public key in a TXT record in DNS. The keys don√¢t expire automatically, but it√¢s best practice to rotate them periodically. My config uses a naming scheme that allows smooth rotation, but it doesn√¢t complicate things if you skip it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two more TXT records that you need to publish in DNS: the SPF and DMARC records. You say which hosts are allowed to send mail from your email domain, and give instructions to other email servers about what to do with mail that fails DKIM checks. In my case I told others to reject mail that can√¢t be verified as coming from my domains, and send reports to my postmaster address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take a look at my OpenDKIM config to understand how things come together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;/etc/opendkim.conf&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;UserID opendkim:opendkim Socket inet:8891@localhost KeyTable refile:/etc/opendkim/KeyTable SigningTable refile:/etc/opendkim/SigningTable ExternalIgnoreList refile:/etc/opendkim/TrustedHosts InternalHosts refile:/etc/opendkim/TrustedHosts Canonicalization relaxed/relaxed ReportAddress postmaster@idx.cy SendReports no LogWhy yes Syslog yes SyslogSuccess no&lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;127.0.0.1 localhost&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I generate DKIM keys with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;opendkim-genkey -D /etc/opendkim/keys/example.com -d example.com -s key1&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And for each email domain I have the following records in DNS:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Type&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Name&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Value&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;MX&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;example.com&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;mx.idx.cy&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;TXT&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;example.com&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;v=spf1 mx a -all&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;TXT&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;key1._domainkey&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;v=DKIM1; k=rsa; s=email; p=&amp;lt;public-key&amp;gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;TXT&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;_dmarc&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:postmaster@idx.cy&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Reverse DNS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One more thing about self-hosted email deliverability. I've read that reverse DNS (PTR record) will boost the reputation of your email server. The thing is that your ISP has to set it up, and I suspect my ISP to reply with a polite "no", so I didn't do it yet. As you'll see in the next section, my email gets delivered to Gmail just fine. GMX and Outlook also didn't mark my mail as spam. Maybe my IP is lucky :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in general, if you want wide deliverability, PTR isn't optional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Testing with Gmail&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To try it out, let's send a test mail to Gmail with the sendmail command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;sendmail -vt &amp;lt; test.mail&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;test.mail&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Content-Type: text/html From: max@idx.cy To: myaddress@gmail.com Subject: DKIM test Test message from idx.cy!&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got the mail instantly and Gmail confirmed TLS encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click "Show original" in Gmail to see the raw mail. There's lots of text in the headers, so let's just focus on passing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You'll also get a mail with a report because of the -v option. I receive mail with Heirloom Mail like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;You have new mail in /var/mail/max fool ~ | mailx Heirloom Mail version 12.5 7/5/10. Type ? for help. "/var/mail/max": 1 message 1 new &amp;gt;N 1 Mail Delivery System Sat Oct 4 15:40 74/2437 "Mail Delivery Status Report"&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use the p command to print the mail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;&amp;amp; p&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Message 1: From MAILER-DAEMON Sat Oct 4 15:40:50 2025 X-Original-To: max@idx.cy Delivered-To: max@idx.cy Date: Sat, 4 Oct 2025 15:40:50 +0200 (CEST) From: Mail Delivery System &amp;lt;MAILER-DAEMON@idx.cy&amp;gt; Subject: Mail Delivery Status Report To: max@idx.cy Auto-Submitted: auto-replied Content-Type: multipart/report; report-type=delivery-status; boundary="3C311BFF8D.1759585250/mx.idx.cy" Status: R Part 1: Content-Description: Notification Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8 This is the mail system at host mx.idx.cy.

    &lt;p&gt;Great, everything is working!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If something isn't working for you, please double-check your DNS records, and triple-check that TLS certificates are readable by the Postfix user, and that DKIM keys are readable by the OpenDKIM user. Postfix and OpenDKIM logs will also be useful. The OpenDKIM config file is especially unforgiving of typos, so watch out for small mistakes!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Next steps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my next post on email, I'll show you how to use Python to build useful email applications. Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How I influence tech company politics as a staff software engineer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many software engineers are fatalistic about company politics. They believe that it‚Äôs pointless to get involved, because1:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Technical decisions are often made for completely selfish reasons that cannot be influenced by a well-meaning engineer&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Powerful stakeholders are typically so stupid and dysfunctional that it‚Äôs effectively impossible for you to identify their needs and deliver solutions to them&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The political game being played depends on private information that software engineers do not have, so any attempt to get involved will result in just blundering around&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Managers and executives spend most of their time playing politics, while engineers spend most of their time doing engineering, so engineers are at a serious political disadvantage before they even start&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The general idea here is that software engineers are simply not equipped to play the game at the same level as real political operators. This is true! It would be a terrible mistake for a software engineer to think that you ought to start scheming and plotting like you‚Äôre in Game of Thrones. Your schemes will be immediately uncovered and repurposed to your disadvantage and other people‚Äôs gain. Scheming takes practice and power, and neither of those things are available to software engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is simply a fact that software engineers are tools in the political game being played at large companies, not players in their own right. However, there are many ways to get involved in politics without scheming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The easiest way is to actively work to make a high-profile project successful. This is more or less what you ought to be doing anyway, just as part of your ordinary job. If your company is heavily investing in some new project - these days, likely an AI project - using your engineering skill to make it successful2 is a politically advantageous move for whatever VP or executive is spearheading that project. In return, you‚Äôll get the rewards that executives can give at tech companies: bonuses, help with promotions, and positions on future high-profile projects. I wrote about this almost a year ago in Ratchet effects determine engineer reputation at large companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A slightly harder way (but one that gives you more control) is to make your pet idea available for an existing political campaign. Suppose you‚Äôve wanted for a while to pull out some existing functionality into its own service. There are two ways to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hard way is to expend your own political capital: drum up support, let your manager know how important it is to you, and slowly wear doubters down until you can get the project formally approved. The easy way is to allow some executive to spend their (much greater) political capital on your project. You wait until there‚Äôs a company-wide mandate for some goal that aligns with your project (say, a push for reliability, which often happens in the wake of a high-profile incident). Then you suggest to your manager that your project might be a good fit for this. If you‚Äôve gauged it correctly, your org will get behind your project. Not only that, but it‚Äôll increase your political capital instead of you having to spend it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Organizational interest comes in waves. When it‚Äôs reliability time, VPs are desperate to be doing something. They want to come up with plausible-sounding reliability projects that they can fund, because they need to go to their bosses and point at what they‚Äôre doing for reliability, but they don‚Äôt have the skillset to do it on their own. They‚Äôre typically happy to fund anything that the engineering team suggests. On the other hand, when the organization‚Äôs attention is focused somewhere else - say, on a big new product ship - the last thing they want is for engineers to spend their time on an internal reliability-focused refactor that‚Äôs invisible to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if you want to get something technical done in a tech company, you ought to wait for the appropriate wave. It‚Äôs a good idea to prepare multiple technical programs of work, all along different lines. Strong engineers will do some of this kind of thing as an automatic process, simply by noticing things in the normal line of work. For instance, you might have rough plans:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;to migrate the billing code to stored-data-updated-by-webhooks instead of cached API calls&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;to rip out the ancient hand-rolled build pipeline and replace it with Vite&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;to rewrite a crufty high-volume Python service in Golang&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;to replace the slow CMS frontend that backs your public documentation with a fast static site&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When executives are concerned about billing, you can offer the billing refactor as a reliability improvement. When they‚Äôre concerned about developer experience, you can suggest replacing the build pipeline. When customers are complaining about performance, you can point to the Golang rewrite as a good option. When the CEO checks the state of the public documentation and is embarrassed, you can make the case for rebuilding it as a static site. The important thing is to have a detailed, effective program of work ready to go for whatever the flavor of the month is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some program of work will be funded whether you do this or not. However, if you don‚Äôt do this, you have no control over what that program is. In my experience, this is where companies make their worst technical decisions: when the political need to do something collides with a lack of any good ideas. When there are no good ideas, a bad idea will do, in a pinch. But nobody prefers this outcome. It‚Äôs bad for the executives, who then have to sell a disappointing technical outcome as if it were a success4, and it‚Äôs bad for the engineers, who have to spend their time and effort building the wrong idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre a very senior engineer, the VPs (or whoever) will quietly blame you for this. They‚Äôll be right to! Having the right idea handy at the right time is your responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can view all this in two different ways. Cynically, you can read this as a suggestion to make yourself a convenient tool for the sociopaths who run your company to use in their endless internecine power struggles. Optimistically, you can read this as a suggestion to let executives set the overall priorities for the company - that‚Äôs their job, after all - and to tailor your own technical plans to fit3. Either way, you‚Äôll achieve more of your technical goals if you push the right plan at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;edit: this post got some attention on Hacker News. The comments were much more positive than on my other posts about politics, for reasons I don‚Äôt quite understand. This comment is an excellent statement of what I write about here (but targeted at more junior engineers). This comment (echoed here) references a Milton Friedman quote that applies the idea in this post to political policy in general, which I‚Äôd never thought of but sounds correct:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Only a crisis‚Äîactual or perceived‚Äîproduces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a few comments calling this approach overly game-playing and self-serving. I think this depends on the goal you‚Äôre aiming at. The ones I referenced above seem pretty beneficial to me! Finally, this comment is a good summary of what I was trying to say:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Instead of waiting to be told what to do and being cynical about bad ideas coming up when there‚Äôs a vacumn and not doing what he wants to do, the author keeps a back log of good and important ideas that he waits to bring up for when someone important says something is priority. He gets what he wants done, compromising on timing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was prompted to write this after reading Terrible Software‚Äôs article Don‚Äôt avoid workplace politics and its comments on Hacker News. Disclaimer: I am talking here about broadly functional tech companies (i.e. ones that are making money). If you‚Äôre working somewhere that‚Äôs completely dysfunctional, I have no idea whether this advice would apply at all.&lt;/p&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;What it takes to make a project successful is itself a complex political question that every senior+ engineer is eventually forced to grapple with (or to deliberately avoid, with consequences for their career). For more on that, see How I ship projects at large tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more along these lines, see Is it cynical to do what your manager wants?&lt;/p&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because they can do this doesn‚Äôt mean they want to.&lt;/p&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/item&gt;

Knowledge Infusion Scaling Law for Pre-training Large Language Models&lt;/head&gt;View PDF HTML (experimental)&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention due to their impressive general capabilities across diverse downstream tasks. However, without domain-specific optimization, they often underperform on specialized knowledge benchmarks and even produce hallucination. Recent studies show that strategically infusing domain knowledge during pretraining can substantially improve downstream performance. A critical challenge lies in balancing this infusion trade-off: injecting too little domain-specific data yields insufficient specialization, whereas excessive infusion triggers catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. In this work, we focus on the phenomenon of memory collapse induced by over-infusion. Through systematic experiments, we make two key observations, i.e. 1) Critical collapse point: each model exhibits a threshold beyond which its knowledge retention capabilities sharply degrade. 2) Scale correlation: these collapse points scale consistently with the model's size. Building on these insights, we propose a knowledge infusion scaling law that predicts the optimal amount of domain knowledge to inject into large LLMs by analyzing their smaller counterparts. Extensive experiments across different model sizes and pertaining token budgets validate both the effectiveness and generalizability of our scaling law.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Computer Science &amp;gt; Machine Learning&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Submitted on 25 Sep 2025 (v1), last revised 30 Sep 2025 (this version, v3)]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Title:Provable Scaling Laws of Feature Emergence from Learning Dynamics of Grokking&lt;/head&gt;View PDF HTML (experimental)&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been studied extensively, it remains an open problem whether there is a mathematical framework that characterizes what kind of features will emerge, how and in which conditions it happens, and is closely related to the gradient dynamics of the training, for complex structured inputs. We propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) \underline{\textbf{L}}azy learning, (II) \underline{\textbf{i}}ndependent feature learning and (III) \underline{\textbf{i}}nteractive feature learning. At the lazy learning stage, top layer overfits to random hidden representation and the model appears to memorize. Thanks to lazy learning and weight decay, the \emph{backpropagated gradient} $G_F$ from the top layer now carries information about the target label, with a specific structure that enables each hidden node to learn their representation \emph{independently}. Interestingly, the independent dynamics follows exactly the \emph{gradient ascent} of an energy function $E$, and its local maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. When hidden nodes start to interact in the later stage of learning, we provably show how $G_F$ changes to focus on missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of feature emergence, memorization and generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our analysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Submission history&lt;/head&gt;From: Yuandong Tian [view email]&lt;p&gt;[v1] Thu, 25 Sep 2025 20:08:09 UTC (349 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v2] Mon, 29 Sep 2025 17:29:44 UTC (404 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v3] Tue, 30 Sep 2025 17:43:09 UTC (405 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt; shells out to real toolchains under the hood. Each &lt;code&gt;LanguageEngine&lt;/code&gt; implements a small trait that knows how to:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Detect whether the toolchain is available (e.g. &lt;code&gt;python3&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;go&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;rustc&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prepare a temporary workspace (compilation for compiled languages, transient scripts for interpreters).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Execute snippets, files, or stdin streams and surface stdout/stderr consistently.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Tired of social media?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep doom scrolling through addicting feeds?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Miss the days when the web was just about connecting with people and their thoughts or ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe there's an answer to that problem, and it's called&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting a blog is actually a lot simpler than what you're probably thinking. This doesn't have to be some well polished highly viewed monetization machine, or even something professional or formal. It's just a simple website where you can casually talk about whatever you want to talk about! It can be long, short, a list of small things, or just a quote. It should be how you talk with other people in your own life, or how you communicate with the outside world. It should be you on a page. Here's a few places you can make a blog that are RSS enabled:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are great if you are not quite a technical person and need everything to be simple and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RSS is actually already familiar to you if you have ever subscribed to a newsletter. You put your email into someone√¢s website, and when they have updates, they send you emails to your inbox so you can stay in the loop. In the case of RSS, you have a dedicated app, called an RSS reader usually, and you can put in someone√¢s website into the app to subscribe. When they make a new post, just open your news reader app, and their posts will be retrieved and ready to read. Some reader apps even let you make folders and tags to organize blogs you are subscribed to, similar to how an email app lets you make folders to sort mail. Would highly recommend trying a few of the apps or services and seeing which works best!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This takes us to our final point: Feeds. You can probably get away with just the first two items and then sharing it with people you already know, but what about meeting or talking to people you don't know? That's where Feeds come in. The idea is to create another page on your blog that has all the RSS feeds you're subscribed to. By keeping this public and always up to date, someone can visit your page, find someone new and follow them. Perhaps that person also has a feeds page, and the cycle continues until there is a natural and organic network of people all sharing with each other. So if you have a blog, consider making a feeds page and sharing it! If your RSS reader supports OPML file exports and imports, perhaps you can share that file as well to make it easier to share your feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's an example Feeds Page which should help get the idea across!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best part about blog feeds? It's just an idea. There's no central authority. There's no platform. No massive tech giant trying to take your data. It's just you, basic web standards, and the people you care about.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Financial Times reports that the U.K. is once again demanding that Apple create a backdoor into its encrypted backup services. The only change since the last time they demanded this is that the order is allegedly limited to only apply to British users. That doesn‚Äôt make it any better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The demand uses a power called a ‚ÄúTechnical Capability Notice‚Äù (TCN) in the U.K.‚Äôs Investigatory Powers Act. At the time of its signing we noted this law would likely be used to demand Apple spy on its users. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the U.K. government first issued the TCN in January, Apple was forced to either create a backdoor or block its Advanced Data Protection feature‚Äîwhich turns on end-to-end encryption for iCloud‚Äîfor all U.K. users. The company decided to remove the feature in the U.K. instead of creating the backdoor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The initial order from January targeted the data of all Apple users. In August, the US claimed the U.K. withdrew the demand, but Apple did not re-enable Advanced Data Protection. The new order provides insight into why: the U.K. was just rewriting it to only apply to British users. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is still an unsettling overreach that makes U.K. users less safe and less free. As we‚Äôve said time and time again, any backdoor built for the government puts everyone at greater risk of hacking, identity theft, and fraud. It sets a dangerous precedent to demand similar data from other companies, and provides a runway for other authoritarian governments to issue comparable orders. The news of continued server-side access to users' data comes just days after the UK government announced an intrusive mandatory digital ID scheme, framed as a measure against illegal migration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A tribunal hearing was initially set to take place in January 2026, though it‚Äôs currently unclear if that will proceed or if the new order changes the legal process. Apple must continue to refuse these types of backdoors. Breaking end-to-end encryption for one country breaks it for everyone. These repeated attempts to weaken encryption violates fundamental human rights and destroys our right to private spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Designers should look to Demis Hassabis. Not Jony Ive.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Oct 01, 2025

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The World Before Ive&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The world before Jony Ive was beige.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not metaphorically. Literally beige. Computers in the 1990s came in one color: the pale, institutional tan of filing cabinets and government offices. They squatted under desks like appliances. Humming, hot, hostile. Thick cables snaked across floors. Fans whirred. Monitors flickered with the sickly glow of cathode rays. The interface was a command line: green text on black, cryptic strings of code that demanded fluency before granting access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Design wasn't just absent. It was deliberately excluded. These machines were built by engineers for other engineers, and the aesthetic language was purely functional: beige boxes, sharp edges, screws visible on every surface. If you wanted to use a computer, you had to accept its ugliness as the cost of entry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, on a stage in Cupertino in 1998, everything changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A soft-spoken British designer with an unmistakable soothing voice stepped into a spotlight and unveiled a machine that shouldn't have been possible. The iMac gleamed like a jellyfish under studio lights. Translucent, playful, impossibly colorful. Bondi Blue. It had curves. It had a handle. It looked like it had been pulled from the future and dropped into the present as a gift.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It wasn't just a computer. It was an invitation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the first time, a machine said: you are welcome here. It even said, ‚Äúhello.‚Äù You didn't need to know DOS commands or IRQ settings. You didn't need to apologize for wanting something beautiful. The iMac made technology feel joyful, and in doing so, it gave millions of people permission to care about how things looked, how they felt, how they fit into their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That moment marked the beginning of Jony Ive's reign. A three-decade long era that redefined what it meant to design technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With his team, Ive sculpted devices from aluminum and glass as if each one were a sculpture destined for a museum. Every curve was obsessively considered. Every corner perfectly radiused. Inspired by Dieter Rams and Braun's minimalist philosophy, Ive elevated form to poetry. The click of a MacBook's lid. The chamfered edge of an iPhone. The satisfying weight of an Apple Watch. These weren't just design decisions. They were statements about what technology could be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the world listened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before Ive, most people never thought about design. After Ive, they couldn't stop thinking about it. His work raised the global baseline of taste. Consumers began to expect craft in everything they touched: the harmony of packaging, the elegance of installation, the invisible details that made something feel just right. Not just in hardware, but in software too. When Ive transitioned Apple from Scott Forstall's skeuomorphic richness to the spare simplicity of iOS 7's flat design, he wasn't just updating an interface. He was teaching the world a new visual language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designers went from niche artisans to cultural icons. Apple became not just a company, but a symbol of design perfection. For thirty years, this was the pinnacle of what it meant to "design technology." Ive's era gave us the form language of the modern world: clean, minimal, achingly precise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that world is now dissolving beneath our feet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new force is rising. One that doesn't care about curves or chamfers, about translucent shells or perfectly radiused corners. It doesn't live on surfaces at all. It hums in the invisible layers beneath them, rewriting the rules of what technology is and who gets to shape it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The future of design will still be shaped‚Äîjust not by designers like Jony Ive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A New Kind of Canvas&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not as a new surface to design, but as a force that will erase the very notion of surfaces altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strip away the hype cycle, the speculative bubbles, the breathless proclamations from venture capitalists, or how ‚ÄúAgents will change the world.‚Äù What remains is still staggering: AI is doing to thinking what Ive once did to seeing. It is fundamentally reframing how humans interact with computers. Not through better pixels or smarter layouts, but by dissolving the interface itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soon, every digital surface will have a large language model humming beneath it. Your phone. Your car's dashboard. Your child's homework assistant. Invisible agents will run in the background of your life, mediating your calendar, drafting your emails, making small decisions on your behalf without ever asking permission. We are shifting, rapidly and irreversibly, from a world defined by pixels and layouts to a world defined by weights, prompts, context, and policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn't a minor evolution. It's a phase change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this new paradigm, the placement of buttons matters less. The elegance of an animation matters less. These elements aren't unimportant. But they're no longer where the gravity lies. The real design work is happening in layers most designers have never seen:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The conversations between humans and machines.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The rules that govern how an AI system acts.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The alignment between a user's intent and the model's hidden reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are the new materials of experience. And if designers don't learn to shape them, someone else will.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designers who remain focused only on surfaces are already finding themselves sidelined. The center of gravity has shifted overnight. The leaders of tomorrow will not just craft how a product looks. They will shape how intelligence itself behaves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And you can't influence intelligence if you don't understand how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can't shape this shift if you're not deep into the model layer. If you don't speak the language of context windows, retrieval systems, and policy boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where the lineage of Jony Ive-like design leaders ends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next archetype of design leadership will not emerge from the industrial design studios of Cupertino. It will come from an entirely different world. One most designers have never entered, and one that doesn't particularly care whether they ever do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Birth of a New Kind of Design Leader&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Demis Hassabis's story begins not with product launches or design studios, but with play.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a child in North London, Hassabis was the kind of prodigy adults whisper about. At age four, he learned chess. By eight, he was beating adults at his local club. By thirteen, he was ranked second in the world for his age group, a grandmaster-in-waiting who could see patterns emerge on the board like constellations forming in the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But chess was just the beginning. What Hassabis really wanted was to create worlds, not just master them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At seventeen, an age when most teenagers are figuring out college applications, Hassabis became the lead AI programmer for Theme Park, a hit simulation game published by Bullfrog Productions. The game wasn't just about building roller coasters. It was about designing behaviors: how virtual visitors moved through space, what made them happy or frustrated, how systems interacted to create emergent complexity. To anyone trained in design, this will feel familiar. Hassabis wasn't writing code. He was designing interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his twenties, he co-founded Elixir Studios and created Republic: The Revolution and Evil Genius. Games that blended narrative, strategy, and adaptive AI. These weren't static artifacts you played through once. They were living systems that evolved in response to player choices, powered by behavioral algorithms Hassabis designed himself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then, at the peak of his success in gaming, he did something almost no one does: he walked away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hassabis wanted to understand something deeper. Not just how to simulate intelligence, but what intelligence actually is. How does the brain create memory? How does imagination work? How do neurons encode the patterns that let us recognize a face, compose a symphony, or predict the next move in a game we've never seen before?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So he went back to school. Cambridge, then University College London, studying neuroscience and cognitive science. He published papers on memory and imagination that are still cited today. He wasn't dabbling. He was building a foundation. Fusing three disciplines that had rarely spoken to each other: games, systems thinking, and the structure of the mind itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2010, he founded DeepMind with a mission so audacious it bordered on absurd: to build artificial general intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not a chatbot. Not a recommendation engine. True intelligence. The kind that could learn, reason, and create in ways no programmer explicitly designed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The iPhone Moment of the Intelligence Era&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;March 2016. Seoul, South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A match is about to begin that will change everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On one side of the board sits Lee Sedol, one of the greatest Go players in history. Eighteen international titles. A man who has dedicated his entire life to mastering a game that has existed for 2,500 years. A game so complex that the number of possible board positions exceeds the number of atoms in the observable universe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other side sits a machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AlphaGo. DeepMind's creation. Trained on millions of historical games, then refined through countless matches against itself, evolving strategies no human had ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most experts believed this moment wouldn't come for at least another decade. Go was supposed to be different from chess. Too intuitive, too reliant on pattern recognition and gut feeling. Computers were good at brute force calculation, but Go required something else. Something human.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The match begins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Game one: AlphaGo wins. Sedol looks calm but surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Game two: AlphaGo wins again. Now Sedol looks unsettled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then comes Move 37.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early in the second game, AlphaGo places a stone in a position so unusual, so alien, that the commentators go silent. It violates conventional wisdom. It looks like a mistake. The kind of move a beginner might make.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lee Sedol stares at the board. Then he stands up and leaves the room.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He doesn't storm out. He's not angry. He needs to think. Because that move. The one that looked wrong. Is starting to look brilliant. It's a move that will only reveal its genius fifteen moves later, a choice so creative and strange that no human player in 2,500 years had ever considered it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Sedol returns, he plays on, but something has shifted. The match continues, and AlphaGo wins decisively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sedol would later say: "I thought AlphaGo was based on probability calculation, and that it was merely a machine. But when I saw this move, I changed my mind. Surely, AlphaGo is creative."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the moment. The iPhone keynote of the Intelligence Era. Not a product unveiling, but a revelation: machines could now demonstrate not just logic, but intuition. Not just calculation, but creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The world was watching. And the world understood: something fundamental had changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Moving from Virtual to Real Impact&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for Hassabis, this was never about winning games. It was about proving that intelligence could be designed. Not hardcoded, but learned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2020, DeepMind turned its attention to one of biology's deepest mysteries: protein folding. Every protein in your body is a chain of amino acids that folds into a specific 3D shape, and that shape determines everything. How enzymes catalyze reactions, how antibodies recognize invaders, how diseases take hold. Scientists had been trying to predict these shapes for fifty years. The problem was so hard that researchers held a biennial competition (CASP) just to measure incremental progress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DeepMind's AlphaFold didn't make incremental progress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It solved the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 2020 CASP competition, AlphaFold predicted protein structures with an accuracy that stunned the scientific community. Structures that would have taken years to determine experimentally were now solvable in hours. The breakthrough was so profound that it's been called one of the most important scientific achievements of the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2024, Demis Hassabis and his team were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not for designing a product. Not for building a better interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For designing a new kind of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the future of design leadership. Not someone who perfects the curve of a phone or the gradient of an icon anymore, but someone who shapes how intelligence itself behaves. We are, after all, entering the Era of Intelligence. And it needs a whole new kind of design leader. One who understands systems, behaviors, and the substrate of thought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hassabis is not a designer in the traditional sense. But he has done what the greatest designers have always done: he has changed how we see the world and what we believe is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And he has done it by going deeper than surfaces, deeper than pixels, into the invisible architecture of intelligence itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚Üí Continue to Part II: Designers Will Move From The Surface to the Substrate&lt;lb/&gt; (dropping Oct 7th, 2025)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the next part: Why every AI product looks the same. The five paradigm inversions the designers of today refuse to see. And the technical layers where designers are completely absent. The new "pixels" of intelligent systems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In summary&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Millions of California residents could get a break if they violate HOA rules under a new state law that caps fees at $100, without late fees or accumulating penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An ornate balcony or quirky garage door might be in reach for more Californians as homeowners associations across the state are being forced to govern without the power of exorbitant fees to enforce regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Millions of California residents could get a break if they violate their homeowners association rules due to a new law that caps fines at $100, down from hundreds to thousands of dollars. Amid an affordability crisis, lawmakers and groups that represent homeowners have characterized the cap, which took effect July 1, as protecting the pocketbooks of middle- and low-income residents. However, HOA boards worry the new restriction will limit their authority to enforce rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attorneys for homeowners and HOAs say it will get rid of extreme cases where board members impose unfair and egregious fines to retaliate against homeowners they dislike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI have seen the worst of the worst and HOAs fine thousands of dollars and foreclose on those homes,‚Äù said Edward Susolik, CEO and president of Callahan &amp;amp; Blaine, who represents both homeowners and HOAs. ‚ÄúGenerally speaking, that seems reasonable to bring that down because that is one of the biggest issues living in California, because HOAs have very broad powers to enforce their rules.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cap on HOA fines was quietly inserted into unrelated major housing reform legislation, Assembly Bill 130, that exempts most new housing from environmental review and was led by Democratic Assemblymember Buffy Wicks of Oakland. The language of a separate bill by Democratic Sen. Aisha Wahab of Fremont, Senate Bill 681, capping the HOA fee was included in the housing reform bill just days before the governor signed it into law, drawing little attention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe were in active negotiations with Sen. Wahab‚Äôs staff and actually provided amendments to the pro tem‚Äôs office as well. What we were promoting was greater transparency and notice when fines take place at associations and avoiding a cap at all,‚Äù said Louis Brown, an attorney who represents HOAs with the Community Associations Institute. ‚ÄúWe were very surprised when the language showed up in AB 130.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;HOAs are proliferating nationwide&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HOAs are a nearly inescapable reality for home buyers. Their rise continues to skyrocket as 67% of all new single-family homes built in 2024 nationwide were in communities with HOAs, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, up from 46% in 2009. In California, more than 50,000 HOAs govern around 65% of the state‚Äôs homeowners, according to the California Association of Homeowners Associations. California residents paid a median of $278 in monthly fees ‚Äì‚Äì among the steepest in the nation, according to data from the Census Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They create and enforce rules for home, apartment and condominium owners and are controlled by the residents themselves, who elect and can recall board members. HOAs have faced the ire and frustration of some Californians for decades, and lawmakers have proposed legislation seeking more transparency on governing boards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most neighborhood disputes are resolved through casual conversation and end cordially without a fine needing to be imposed, according to David Zepponi, chief executive of the Executive Council of Homeowners and a lobbyist for HOA boards. In cases that require more formality, the board must hold a hearing where residents can explain themselves before a fine is levied. But there are extreme instances where situations escalate and devolve into expensive disputes between residents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new state law bans HOAs from charging late fees or interest in addition to the $100 cap, with the exception of rules that affect public health or safety. It also gives residents more leeway to absolve fees after they‚Äôve been charged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lawmakers said it is a step toward addressing exorbitant fees prevalent in some HOAs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWith nearly 65% of California homeowners living in HOAs, excessive fees have quietly drained family finances for too long,‚Äù said Wahab, who heralded the effort, in an emailed statement. ‚ÄúBy capping fines ‚Äî except for health and safety ‚Äî we set fair standards, protect generational wealth, and finally put homeowners and HOA boards on equal footing.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‚ÄòThey‚Äôre guilty until the homeowner proves their innocence‚Äô&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some homeowners also see the new restrictions as a necessary check on boards that misuse their power over superfluous violations, such as painting a home a bold color.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúOur concern about violation fines in the past are that there has been no procedure for determining if a violation has occurred,‚Äù said Marjorie Murray, an advocate for homeowners with the Center for California Homeowner Association Law. ‚ÄúThe board tells the homeowner they‚Äôre guilty until the homeowner proves their innocence.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many board members are fearful of the consequences of their diminished power and worry how it will affect their ability to enforce neighborhood rules, Zepponi said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have the leverage anymore to get people to change bad behavior,‚Äù Zepponi said. A neighbor who leaves their RV parked on the driveway in violation of association rules might just eat the $100 rather than pay for RV storage that is more expensive, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúIt takes a tool away from a board to make behavioral changes that are needed,‚Äù he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Board members have also argued that the lower fine could cost the entire community more if a neighbor continues to break the rules and refuses to pay their fees, forcing boards to pursue the only available alternative ‚Äî costly litigation ‚Äî more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The change is not expected to affect HOAs financially, as fines are not a significant amount of their revenue stream, according to Community Associations Institute lawyer Louis Brown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe days of homeowners associations telling you that your garage door needs to be painted might be over,‚Äù said Susolik, the attorney who has represented homeowners and HOA boards. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs probably a good thing.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This story has been corrected to say that Assemblymember Buffy Wicks authored AB 130, not Sen. Scott Wiener.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How to guide&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coming soon, for now refer to Will Prowse‚Äôs wiring guide on his very-similar 48V 3000W off-grid solar system which I followed and works great for me!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Financial Payback &amp;amp; Embodied Energy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Financial payback period for 3000W
System cost : $1,124 on Amazon in 2024 (now $912)
Yearly energy creation: 365d * 4.26hsun/d * 1.280kW = 2,000kWh/y (but more like 1,000kWh/year after losses)
Yearly value creation: 1,000kWh/y * $0.55/kWh in SF = $550/y energy created
100W system payback period: $1,124 / $550 = 2 years until payback
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How green is it:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Production footprint PV (source): &lt;code&gt;2,900kWhee/kW * 1.28kW = 3,712kWh embodied energy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Production footprint LiFePo4 battery (source): &lt;code&gt;106kWhee/kWh * 2.4kWh = 254kWh embodied energy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Annual energy production system: 1100kWh/y &lt;code&gt;Payback period: 3966kWh / 1100kWh/y = 3.5 year footprint payback&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;FAQ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What‚Äôs the catch? Seems to good to be true? Well, this thing sits between your devices and the wall. So you need to neatly run extension cables from every room in the house to the ‚Äúsun box‚Äù, and then run one cable from the box to the panels, and another to the wall (optional, just so it can fall back to pulling power from the wall). Photos of this are coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will it ever push power back into the wall? Nope! It‚Äôll only ever draw from the wall in the event that both the sun is down and the battery is dead (so your fridge won‚Äôt go off overnight for example).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this legal? Yes, see above. No difference to plugging your fridge into your wall, as far as the utility is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
