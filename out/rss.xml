    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I have been struggling with a bot– 'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; crawler)' coming from AWS Singapore – and sending an absurd number of requests to a domain of mine, averaging over 700 requests/second for several months now. Thankfully, CloudFlare is able to handle the traffic with a simple WAF rule and 444 response to reduce the outbound traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I've submitted several complaints to AWS to get this traffic to stop, their typical followup is: We have engaged with our customer, and based on this engagement have determined that the reported activity does not require further action from AWS at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I've tried various 4XX responses to see if the bot will back off, I've tried 30X redirects (which it follows) to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The traffic is hitting numbers that require me to re-negotiate my contract with CloudFlare and is otherwise a nuisance when reviewing analytics/logs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I've considered redirecting the entirety of the traffic to aws abuse report page, but at this scall, it's essentially a small DDoS network and sending it anywhere could be considered abuse in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Are there others that have similar experience?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;New computer model helps reveal how the brain both adapts and misfires, laying the groundwork for more precise treatments for mental health disorders&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A ‘Flight Simulator’ for the Brain Reveals How We Learn—and Why Minds Sometimes Go Off Course&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every day, your brain makes thousands of decisions under uncertainty. Most of the time, you guess right. When you don’t, you learn. But when the brain’s ability to judge context or assign meaning falters, thoughts and behavior can go astray. In psychiatric disorders ranging from attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder to schizophrenia, the brain may misjudge how much evidence to gather before acting—or fail to adjust when the rules of the world change based on new information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Uncertainty is built into the brain’s wiring,” says Michael Halassa, a professor of neuroscience at Tufts University School of Medicine. “Picture groups of neurons casting votes—some optimistic, some pessimistic. Your decisions reflect the average.” When that balance skews, the brain can misread the world: assigning too much meaning to random events, as in schizophrenia, or becoming stuck in rigid patterns, as in obsessive-compulsive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding those misfires has long challenged scientists, says Halassa. “The brain speaks the language of single neurons. But fMRI—the tool we use to study brain activity in people—tracks blood flow, not the electrical chatter of individual brain cells.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bridging that gap means combining insights from single-cell studies in animals, human brain imaging, and behavior. Now, a new kind of computer model—grounded in real biology—lets researchers simulate how brain circuits make decisions and adapt when the rules change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Called CogLinks, the model builds biological realism into its design, mirroring how real brain cells are connected and coding for how they assign value to often ambiguous and incomplete observations about the external environment. Unlike many artificial intelligence systems that act like “black boxes,” CogLinks shows researchers exactly how its virtual neurons link structure to function. As a result, scientists can map how this virtual brain learns from experience and pivots based on new information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a study published October 16 in Nature Communications, senior author Halassa and colleagues at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) used CogLinks to explore how brain circuits coordinate flexible thinking. Like a flight simulator for the brain, CogLinks let the researchers test what happens when key decision-making circuits go off course. When they weakened the virtual connection between two simulated brain regions—the prefrontal cortex and the mediodorsal thalamus—the system defaulted to slower, habit-driven learning. That result suggests this pathway is essential for adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To see if those predictions held true in people, the team then conducted a companion fMRI study, which was supervised by both Burkhard Pleger from the Ruhr-University Bochum and Halassa. Volunteers played a game in which the rules unexpectedly changed. As expected, the prefrontal cortex handled planning and the deep, central region of the brain known as the striatum guided habits—but the mediodorsal thalamus lit up when players realized the rules had shifted and adjusted their strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The imaging confirmed what the model had forecast: the mediodorsal thalamus acts as a switchboard linking the brain’s two main learning systems—flexible and habitual—helping the brain infer when context has changed and switch strategies accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Halassa hopes the research helps lay the groundwork for a new kind of “algorithmic psychiatry,” in which computer models help reveal how mental illness emerges from changes in brain circuits, identifying biological markers to precisely target treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“One of the big questions in psychiatry is how to connect what we know about genetics to cognitive symptoms,” says Mien Brabeeba Wang, the lead author of the CogLinks study, a co-author of the fMRI study, and an MIT doctoral student in Halassa’s lab.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Many schizophrenia-linked mutations affect chemical receptors found throughout the brain,” says Wang. “Future uses of CogLinks may help us see how those widespread molecular changes could make it harder for the brain to organize information for flexible thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ofcom â driven by the letter of British law that they are bound to follow, but still Ofcom â are quietly making Britain look (a) very silly and (b) as if we haven’t yet shucked-off the American Revolution, let alone colonialism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What’s Happened Now?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preston Byrne, lawyer for 4Chan, has published the (apparently full) correspondence between himself and Ofcom from the past few months, the smoking gun of which is the Ofcom Confirmation Decision, where Ofcom notes: (to summarise)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Act explicitly grants Ofcom the legal authority to regulate online safety for individuals in the United Kingdom, and this expressly includes conducting investigations into, and imposing penalties for, non-compliance by providers of online services with their duties under the Act. [â¦] The Act expressly anticipates that it will have extra-territorial effect, stating at section 204(1) of the Act [â¦] This does not mean that the Act extends to all use of in-scope services globally. [â¦] âThe duties extend only to the design, operation and use of the service in the UK and, for duties expressed to apply in relation to âusersâ, as it affects the UK users of the serviceâ&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My lived experience of Ofcom people makes me believe that this is a reflection of what they actually think they can and should be doing â I would love to be generous and suggest that this boilerplate reflects them politely throwing parliament under a bus for passing such a prima-facie dreadfully drafted and over-reaching law as the Online Safety Actâ¦ but I’m not convinced that Ofcom don’t actually believe some form of “we can do this! we are the little regulator who can bring law to the internet!” â hoping that smooth patter and soft power will provide them with outsize leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, andâ¦ having declared British jurisdictional powers to enforce against an American company in America thereby flouting American law, they then demand that American law protects them from counter-lawsuits, not to mention also claiming that 4Chan does not have jurisdiction over Ofcom:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What happens next?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alas, global politics are a very big pond, and Ofcom (and Britain in general) is a much smaller fish than it likes to imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I have written previously, this will not end well: I cannot imagine the US judiciary nor administration supporting so flagrant a flouting of US sovereignty, although Britain will be spinning hard to minimise the noise in the media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However: when eventually / having been proven not to be able to enforce against 4Chan and the Global Internet, the minds behind the Online Safety Act will start to press for a Great Firewall of Britain to protect our children from these profane and insufficiently regulated websites â which is curious if you think about it for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not as if 4Chan is stealing across our borders in the dead of night to infect delicate British childrens’ minds with shitposting, porn and badly-drawn cartoons of frogs. From my perspective more damage has been wrought to British culture by the Disneyification of Winnie-the-Pooh (big fan of EH Shephard here) than by 4Chan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And of course once/if the Great British Firewall (“White Cliffs of Cyber?”) is built, then we’ll be rediscovering that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The kids already know how to use VPNs to circumvent firewalls&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Streisand Effect dictates that more kids will have gone to look at 4Chan because the Government is trying to stop them&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The impotent child-protection (and national security) interests will be demanding even more loudly that digital identity be required to even look at the pot of filth that is the internet&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Investing in regulation rather than education will have made everything much, much worse&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way we protect British kids from the Internet is to make better and more capable Britons, rather than to try and kidproof the entire internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The least bad thing that Ofcom and the Government could do is to quietly let the matter drop whilst focusing on education.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon’s surveillance camera maker Ring announced a partnership on Thursday with Flock, a maker of AI-powered surveillance cameras that share footage with law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now agencies that use Flock can request that Ring doorbell users share footage to help with “evidence collection and investigative work.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flock cameras work by scanning the license plates and other identifying information about cars they see. Flock’s government and police customers can also make natural language searches of their video footage to find people who match specific descriptions. However, AI-powered technology used by law enforcement has been proven to exacerbate racial biases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the same day that Ring announced this partnership, 404 Media reported that ICE, the Secret Service, and the Navy had access to Flock’s network of cameras. By partnering with Ring, Flock could potentially access footage from millions more cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ring has long had a poor track record with keeping customers’ videos safe and secure. In 2023, the FTC ordered the company to pay $5.8 million over claims that employees and contractors had unrestricted access to customers’ videos for years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Migrating to Hetzner&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;02/10/2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We saved 76% on our cloud bills while tripling our capacity by migrating to Hetzner from AWS and DigitalOcean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the software we build at DigitalSociety runs in the cloud. Prior to the migration we ran workloads on two platforms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use AWS for some of our core hosting needs (DNS via Route53 and sending emails via SES).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also chose AWS to host tap, our first SaaS product, using a variety of AWS services (ECS for container orchestration, RDS for relational databases, ALB for ingress, and a long tail of peripheral services, as is the AWS way).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We chose AWS for familiarity since we have worked with it for nearly 15 years. We also prize their reliability, particularly when it comes to API stability. We automate as much of our infrastructure management as possible, and don't want to spend time chasing API breaking changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used DigitalOcean Kubernetes to host several lightweight services, such as epcdata.scot, and monitoring services (Umami for web analytics, OpenObserve for telemetry, and Uptime Kuma for availability monitoring).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We chose DigitalOcean for its relatively simple and cost-effective managed Kubernetes offering, where you pay for the cluster's resources (nodes, block storage, load balancers) but the controlplane is free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We chose Kubernetes for familiarity since we have worked with it for nearly 10 years. Although it requires a lot of boilerplate configuration, once it has been set up Kubernetes enables a frictionless developer experience for deploying applications quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why two cloud providers? Initially we used only DigitalOcean, but a data intensive SaaS like tap needs a lot of cloud resources and AWS have a generous $1,000 credit package for self-funded startups. Building tap with AWS credits let us experiment with our infrastructure needs without worrying about the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Credits don't last forever&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of minimising our operational costs we opted to use AWS' serverless container runtime, Fargate. This lets us pay per-second for the CPU and memory used by our application. Fargate's monthly pricing scales down fairly well, with a minimal workload (0.25 CPU, 0.5 GiB RAM) costing around $10/month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, tap is a data-intensive SaaS that needs to be able to execute complex queries over gigabytes of data in seconds. Even though we use the blazingly fast Rust programming language and modern, efficient data technologies like Apache Arrow and DataFusion, we have found the minimum resource requirements for good performance to be around 2x CPUs and 4 GiB RAM â ideally even more to get a good experience for demanding queries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much does a 2x CPU, 4 GiB RAM container cost on AWS Fargate? Just over $70/month. We run two worker instances, which need these higher resources, along with smaller web instances and all the other infrastructure needed to host an application on AWS (load balancer, relational DB, NAT gateway, ...). All together, our total costs for two environments of tap grew to $449.50/month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end we used up our free credits in less than 6 months, and as a bootstrapped startup absorbing that kind of running cost is painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Investigating alternatives&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faced with these high running costs we started to investigate alternative cloud providers. Around the same time, tariff wars and the growth of AI-powered technofeudalism made us look specifically for UK or EU based cloud providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We quickly came across Hetzner, and while their offering is geared towards self-managed VPS, meaning additional maintenance compared to managed solutions, we were sold on their pricing (more detail later). So much so that we decided to migrate our DigitalOcean infrastructure as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since most of our services were already running in Kubernetes, and tap was already container-based, we decided we would run Kubernetes. Having operated Kubernetes clusters before this wasn't a decision taken lightly, but we discovered Talos Linux which promised to simplify the cluster setup and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our existing Kubernetes clusters in DigitalOcean used a runtime that we created to cover basic infrastructure needs for web applications. Combined with Kubernetes' native container orchestration features, these covered all the functionality we were using in AWS and DigitalOcean except for managed PostgreSQL databases. Given that these are critical pieces of infrastructure, we wanted a robust solution that included detailed monitoring, automated failover, seamless upgrades, and scheduled backups. We found CloudNativePG which ticks all our boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The new stack&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, this is the stack we landed on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Hetzner as the core infrastructure provider. We use their ARM shared vCPU cloud servers, block storage volumes, load balancers, networks, firewalls, and S3-compatible object storage.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Talos Linux as the operating system for cloud servers. Talos lets you manage Kubernetes nodes in a similar way to Kubernetes resources, by applying declarative configuration from which the OS figures out the actual changes (if any) to make on the node.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;CloudNativePG fills the role of a managed database service (e.g. RDS) for the cluster. PostgreSQL clusters can be declared in Kubernetes manifests alongside the workload(s) using them, and can be configured with scheduled backups, failover replicas, configuration overrides, etc.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Ingress NGINX Controller fills the role of a managed load balancer or API gateway for the cluster, consolidating and making available the ingress routes declared by workloads.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;ExternalDNS allows DNS names to be associated with ingress resources. Roughly, Ingress NGINX Controller manages HTTP routing in the cluster while ExternalDNS handles routing to the cluster.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;cert-manager creates TLS certificates to secure workload routes with HTTPS.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;All infrastructure is codified using Terraform and Helm with deployments automated through GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What a savings&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not easy to do a strictly apples-to-apples comparison between cloud providers since they tend to differ in features (technical or contractual, e.g. SLAs), but an easy point of comparison is our monthly bill:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS and DigitalOcean*&lt;/p&gt;$559.36&lt;p&gt;Hetzner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;$132.96 -76%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Based on peak invoice amount. Technically DigitalOcean peaked in July ($109.86) before we started our migration. AWS peaked in August ($449.50) since we migrated tap later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We get a lot more capacity for this price as well:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AWS and DigitalOcean&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12 vCPUs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;24 GiB RAM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hetzner*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;44 vCPUs +367%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;88 GiB RAM +367%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* This is just the capacity available for workloads, with controlplanes excluded (an additional 6 vCPUs and 12 GiB RAM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Challenges&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;So much for the upsides, but the migration wasn't always straightforward. Our cloud estate is small in the grand scheme of things but inevitably there were challenges.&lt;/p&gt;Hetzner's network zones are not equivalent to AWS' availability zones.&lt;p&gt;AWS's topology is based on regions and availability zones. Typically your infrastructure will live in a single region, but be split across availability zones for fault tolerance. Notably, private networking is region-wide (i.e. servers in different availability zones can easily communicate over private networks).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hetzner's topology is based on locations and network zones. There is only one EU network zone, &lt;code&gt;eu-central&lt;/code&gt;, which has 3 locations. Since servers in different locations in the same network zone can communicate over private networks, we equivalated them to AWS' availability zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, there is significant latency between Hetzner locations that make running multi-location workloads challenging, and potentially harmful to performance as we discovered through our post-deployment monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, we opted to use a single location (Nuremberg) and use placement groups to improve resilience. Placement groups ensure that virtual servers in the same group run on different physical servers, significantly reducing the likelihood that they will fail together.&lt;/p&gt;A service being docker-based doesn't mean it will be trivial to migrate.&lt;p&gt;On AWS we deployed our SaaS product, tap, to the Elastic Container Service (ECS) container runtime. This meant we were already building and push containers as part of the automated build and we had expected that migrating the rest of the configuration from ECS CloudFormation to Kubernetes manifests wouldn't be too laborious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately hadn't considered the deployment automation around the configuration. In particular, we had scripts to gather the right configuration from GitHub and pass it along to CloudFormation. The difficulty wasn't in adapting the scripts to Kubernetes, but rather that we hadn't anticipated the work and so that part of the migration took longer than we expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end we used Kustomize as the glue between sensitive configuration in GitHub and our Kubernetes manifests. We moved our non-sensitive configuration out of GitHub settings and into config files in the repo itself since this works more easily with Kustomize. It also makes tracking and reviewing changes to these settings easier, so we are happy with the result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hetzner is an incredibly cost-effective cloud provider. While their offerings are less expansive and hands-off than AWS or DigitalOcean's, it's possible to mitigate this with your stack if you don't mind getting your hands dirty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're particularly happy that this will allow us to keep tap running cheaply and performantly while we develop and launch it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

        &lt;code&gt;    JS frameworks move really quickly, and when we're working on a large, long-term project, it sucks when big breaking changes are introduced after only a couple of years. Sticking to slow-moving web standards (which are quite mature by now) increases the longevity of a project.

    And the stability also means that more time is spent on delivering features, rather than on fixing compatibility issues.

    There is also the benefit of independence. The project's success is not tied to the framework's success. And it also makes the project more secure, from supply chain attacks and such.

    Because there is no "abstraction layer" of a framework, you also have greater control over your project, and can make performance optimizations at a lower level.

    I feel not using a framework can even make us a better developer. Because we know more of what's going on.
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; There are benefits to using frameworks too, I'm not here to challenge that.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But this alternative of using none... it seems rarely talked about. I want to learn more about building large (preferably web-based) software projects with few dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Do you have any suggestions on how to learn more about it? Are there any open source projects you know which are built this way? It needs to be large, complex, app-like, and browser based. I'm more interested in the frontend side.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The resale value of electric vehicles is collapsing worldwide, hurting private owners and fleet operators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The crisis became especially apparent when BluSmart, India’s pioneering all-electric ride-hailing service, collapsed in April amid financial fraud allegations. The Delhi-based company’s fleet of thousands of cars, originally worth over $12,000 each, suddenly flooded the market at about $3,000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Tesla owners in the U.S., their 2023 Model Ys are worth 42% less than what they paid two years ago, while a Ford F-150 truck bought the same year depreciated just 20%. Older EV models depreciate even faster than newer ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The crisis exposes the fundamental problem that nobody really knows what electric cars are worth in the secondhand market, as their value is largely tied to batteries with uncertain lifespans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“For gas cars, there’s a 100-year process behind them based on odometer and major maintenance schedules and the expected life of combustion engine parts,” said Andrew Garberson, head of growth and research at Recurrent, a Seattle-based startup that evaluates the wear and tear on used EVs to bring transparency to the secondhand market. “Electric cars have fewer moving parts, and a lot of the value of the car is tied up in one component — the battery.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A U.K.-based study found 3-year-old EVs lost more than half of their value compared with 39% for gas cars. Another study conducted by Boucar Diouf, an EV researcher and professor at Kyung Hee University in Seoul, found EVs in the U.S. can lose as much as 60% of their value over three to five years, compared with less than half for traditional vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For fleet owners and operators — across sectors from ride-hailing to rentals to logistics — pledging to go green, this value disaster is threatening to derail the sustainability movement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Florida-based car rental company Hertz, which bought 100,000 Teslas in 2021, reported a $2.9 billion loss in 2024, driven largely by plummeting EV value, according to its February 2025 earnings call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company was hemorrhaging more than $530 a car monthly by late 2024, due to high upfront costs, steep insurance premiums, and long repair and restoration lead times, according to EV news publication InsideEVs. Hertz dumped 30,000 EVs — Teslas bought for more than $40,000 ended up on its website for resale at prices under $20,000. As of October 8, it listed a Model Y for $27,000. A new Model Y cost $45,000 in the U.S. until earlier this month, when Tesla launched a more affordable version at just under $40,000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Fleets feel EV residual risk the most because they model total cost of ownership to the decimal and have to remarket thousands of units,” Jack Carlson, CEO of Carvai.ai, an AI-powered vehicle research and shopping platform, told Rest of World. “Retail buyers worry too, but mostly about battery health and charging. Fleets worry about the exit price.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ironically, Tesla still represents the best-case scenario, holding on to resale value better given its years of experience and brand-building. Chinese newcomers like BYD, Nio, and XPeng tend to have lower resale value in comparison, Mariusz Sawula, CEO of Poland-based autoDNA, a provider of vehicle history reports, told Rest of World.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Premium brands consistently retain higher resale value than mass-market brands, for both ICE [internal combustion engine] vehicles and EVs. No one knows what entirely new Chinese marques will cost in the secondary market — for instance, what a 5-year-old Omoda will fetch,” Sawula said, comparing the likes of Tesla to a sub-brand of Chinese carmaker Chery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The depreciation crisis also varies by region. While Japanese and U.S. consumers remain skeptical, more EV-friendly markets support strong resale prices, according to Justin Fischer, an automotive expert at vehicle-trading company CarEdge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“In markets where consumers are open to the idea of going electric, like China, Norway, and Costa Rica, resale values are supported by this higher demand,” Fischer told Rest of World.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;North America’s vast highways and sprawling distances create a tough environment for used EVs, Karl Brauer, who has reviewed thousands of vehicles since the mid-1990s, told Rest of World. Europe, with its denser cities and shorter commutes, offers more stability in the used EV market compared to the U.S. or Canada. Distance is just one of several limitations, which also include climate sensitivity and charging downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“While an electric vehicle is ideal for shorter trips in urban areas with moderate temperatures, they aren’t as effective as traditional cars for long-distance travel or when the temperature is very high or very low,” Brauer said. “Even electric vehicles with larger batteries and longer ranges still require more time to replenish their energy compared to gasoline and hybrid vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consumer confidence is also buoyed by favourable policies and extensive public fast-charging networks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Greater demand and a more secure supply side helps stabilize resale values there, compared to what we see here in North America,” Johnny T. Beckett, vice president of sales at Canadian multibrand electric car dealer EVNet, told Rest of World.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uber walked away from buying 5,000 used BluSmart vehicles, while local rivals like Evara Cabs wouldn’t touch them because of battery and warranty concerns. BluSmart’s fire-sales in the cities of New Delhi and Bengaluru showed exactly how fast EVs can become worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A family car drives modest distances yearly, but Indian fleet vehicles rack up three to four times their mileage, destroying resale value faster, according to Anirudh Damani, managing director at Artha Venture Fund, which backs Uber partner Everest Fleet in India.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“For individual consumers, the resale value is an inconvenience; for fleet operators, it’s an existential problem,” Damani told Rest of World. “Their vehicles are financial assets, not lifestyle products. Without a predictable residual value, even a profitable fleet can become unviable once replacement cycles begin.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Battery-as-a-service models are emerging as a potential lifeline as they give fleet operators the predictable costs and stable values they desperately need, offering a path forward where battery risk no longer threatens entire business models, Damani said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An April 2025 McKinsey report shows one in five Europeans and just one in 10 U.S. consumers are considering going electric. Fleet operators, though, are making massive bets globally, with companies such as Uber, Bolt, and Lyft pledging full electrification — despite vehicles potentially becoming worthless before the loans are even paid off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Battery tech is also proving more resilient than expected. Research from Recurrent shows batteries deteriorate just 1%–2% annually, with only 1% of cars built after 2016 needing replacements versus 13% for older EVs. Most of the recent replacements are also covered by warranties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The data is helping people have confidence in used EV batteries,” Garberson said. “As confidence rises, so will resale prices.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the back of these quantifiable indicators, there’s been a rise in certified pre-owned EV programs and state-of-health reports that aid informed decision-making. It’s now also easier to keep up with these cars. The pace of innovation that initially scared buyers has slowed, with manufacturers prioritizing longevity over rapid changes, according to EVNet’s Beckett, who is also the co-founder of the Electric Vehicle Association of Atlantic Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Beckett, 2026 “will be a year of industry and market readjustments to both lower supply and demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cybercriminals are abusing a widespread lack of authentication in the customer service platform Zendesk to flood targeted email inboxes with menacing messages that come from hundreds of Zendesk corporate customers simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zendesk is an automated help desk service designed to make it simple for people to contact companies for customer support issues. Earlier this week, KrebsOnSecurity started receiving thousands of ticket creation notification messages through Zendesk in rapid succession, each bearing the name of different Zendesk customers, such as CapCom, CompTIA, Discord, GMAC, NordVPN, The Washington Post, and Tinder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The abusive missives sent via Zendesk’s platform can include any subject line chosen by the abusers. In my case, the messages variously warned about a supposed law enforcement investigation involving KrebsOnSecurity.com, or else contained personal insults.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the automated messages that are sent out from this type of abuse all come from customer domain names — not from Zendesk. In the example below, replying to any of the junk customer support responses from The Washington Post’s Zendesk installation shows the reply-to address is help@washpost.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notified about the mass abuse of their platform, Zendesk said the emails were ticket creation notifications from customer accounts that configured their Zendesk instance to allow anyone to submit support requests — including anonymous users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“These types of support tickets can be part of a customer’s workflow, where a prior verification is not required to allow them to engage and make use of the Support capabilities,” said Carolyn Camoens, communications director at Zendesk. “Although we recommend our customers to permit only verified users to submit tickets, some Zendesk customers prefer to use an anonymous environment to allow for tickets to be created due to various business reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Camoens said requests that can be submitted in an anonymous manner can also make use of an email address of the submitter’s choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“However, this method can also be used for spam requests to be created on behalf of third party email addresses,” Camoens said. “If an account has enabled the auto-responder trigger based on ticket creation, then this allows for the ticket notification email to be sent from our customer’s accounts to these third parties. The notification will also include the Subject added by the creator of these tickets.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zendesk claims it uses rate limits to prevent a high volume of requests from being created at once, but those limits did not stop Zendesk customers from flooding my inbox with thousands of messages in just a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We recognize that our systems were leveraged against you in a distributed, many-against-one manner,” Camoens said. “We are actively investigating additional preventive measures. We are also advising customers experiencing this type of activity to follow our general security best practices and configure an authenticated ticket creation workflow.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all of the cases above, the messaging abuse would not have been possible if Zendesk customers validated support request email addresses prior to sending responses. Failing to do so may make it easier for Zendesk clients to handle customer support requests, but it also allows ne’er-do-wells to sully the sender’s brand in service of disruptive and malicious email floods.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How We Estimate Carbon&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Smaller files mean every future download uses less energy. We estimate potential reduction using the Sustainable Web Design model: data-transfer energy Ã grid carbon intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Energy intensity (SWDM v3): 0.81 kWh per GB transferred.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Global default grid intensity: 442 g COâe per kWh.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This reflects data-transfer only and excludes the one-time CPU cost to compress on your device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Your Privacy &amp;amp; Our Stats&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your images stay on your device. All compression happens locally in your browser. We donât upload or store files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To show impact, we collect anonymous counts (image totals, bandwidth saved). To prevent spam, IPs are used for short-lived rate-limits and are never stored with stats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Youâre in control. Opt out right hereâor use the settings panel (gear above) any time:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A classified network of SpaceX satellites is emitting a mysterious signal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A constellation of classified defense satellites built by the commercial company SpaceX is emitting a mysterious signal that may violate international standards, NPR has learned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Satellites associated with the Starshield satellite network appear to be transmitting to the Earth's surface on frequencies normally used for doing the exact opposite: sending commands from Earth to satellites in space. The use of those frequencies to "downlink" data runs counter to standards set by the International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations agency that seeks to coordinate the use of radio spectrum globally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starshield's unusual transmissions have the potential to interfere with other scientific and commercial satellites, warns Scott Tilley, an amateur satellite tracker in Canada who first spotted the signals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Nearby satellites could receive radio-frequency interference and could perhaps not respond properly to commands — or ignore commands — from Earth," he told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outside experts agree there's the potential for radio interference. "I think it is definitely happening," said Kevin Gifford, a computer science professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder who specializes in radio interference from spacecraft. But he said the issue of whether the interference is truly disruptive remains unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SpaceX and the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office, which operates the satellites for the government, did not respond to NPR's request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Caught by the wrong antenna&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The discovery of the signal happened purely by chance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tilley regularly monitors satellites from his home in British Columbia as a hobby. He was working on another project when he accidentally triggered a scan of radio frequencies that are normally quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It was just a clumsy move at the keyboard," he said. "I was resetting some stuff and then all of a sudden I'm looking at the wrong antenna, the wrong band."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The band of the radio spectrum he found himself looking at, between 2025-2110 MHz, is reserved for "uplinking" data to orbiting satellites. That means there shouldn't be any signals coming from space in that range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Tilley's experienced eye noticed there appeared to be a signal coming down from the sky. It was in a part of the band "that should have nothing there," he said. "I got a hold of my mouse and hit the record button and let it record for a few minutes."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tilley then took the data and compared it to a catalog of observations made by other amateur satellite trackers. These amateurs, located around the world, use telescopes to track satellites as they move across the sky and then share their positions in a database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Bang, up came an unusual identification that I wasn't expecting at all," he said. "Starshield."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starshield is a classified version of SpaceX's Starlink satellites, which provide internet service around the world. The U.S. has reportedly paid more than $1.8 billion so far for the network, though little is known about it. According to SpaceX, Starshield conducts both Earth observation and communications missions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since May of 2024, the National Reconnaissance Office has conducted 11 launches of Starshield satellites in what it describes as its "proliferated system."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The NRO's proliferated system will increase timeliness of access, diversify communications pathways, and enhance resilience," the agency says of the system. "With hundreds of small satellites on orbit, data will be delivered in minutes or even seconds."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tilley says he's detected signals from 170 of the Starshield satellites so far. All appear in the 2025-2110 MHz range, though the precise frequencies of the signals move around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Signal's purpose in question&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's unclear what the satellite constellation is up to. Starlink, SpaceX's public satellite internet network, operates at much higher frequencies to enable the transmission of broadband data. Starshield, by contrast, is using a much lower frequency range that probably only allows for the transmission of data at rates closer to 3G cellular, Tilley says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tilley says he believes the decision to downlink in a band typically reserved for uplinking data could also be designed to hide Starshield's operations. The frequent shift in specific frequencies used could prevent outsiders from finding the signal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gifford says another possibility is that SpaceX was just taking advantage of a quiet part of the radio spectrum. Uplink transmissions from Earth to satellites are usually rare and brief, so these frequencies probably remain dark most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"SpaceX is smart and savvy," he says. It's possible they decided to just "do it and ask forgiveness later."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He notes it's unlikely the signals from Starshield have caused significant disruptions so far, otherwise other satellite operators would have complained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tilley told NPR he has decided to go public with his discovery because the world's satellite operators should be aware of what's happening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"These are objects in classified orbits, which could potentially disturb other legitimate uses of space," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dear Ruby community,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RubyGems and Bundler are essential official clients for rubygems.org and the Ruby ecosystem, bundled with the Ruby language for many years and functioning as part of the standard library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite this crucial role, RubyGems and Bundler have historically been developed outside the Ruby organization on GitHub, unlike other major components of the Ruby ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To provide the community with long-term stability and continuity, the Ruby core team, led by Matz, has decided to assume stewardship of these projects from Ruby Central. We will continue their development in close collaboration with Ruby Central and the broader community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to emphasize the following important points:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Repository ownership will transition to the Ruby core team to ensure long-term stability and alignment with the broader Ruby ecosystem. It will continue being managed by Ruby Central, now jointly with the Ruby core team.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RubyGems and Bundler will remain open source under their current licenses, with no changes to licensing terms.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All existing contributors retain full copyright and authorship of their code contributions. This transition does not affect any contributor’s intellectual property rights.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The collaborative, community-driven development process will continue as before, and we welcome contributions from all community members.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This transition represents our commitment to ensuring the continued health, stability, and growth of the Ruby ecosystem for years to come. We are grateful to Ruby Central for their years of dedicated stewardship, and we look forward to working together with all members of the Ruby community to build an even brighter future for Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your continued support and contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yukihiro Matsumoto, a.k.a. Matz&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago I happened on this live streaming camera near a water hole in the Namib Desert and it's now my first stop every morning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Namibia is 6 hours ahead of my U.S. Eastern Time Zone so it's really hot there when I visit and almost always there are lots of creatures hydrating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zebras, ostriches (which wait as a family at a safe distance), oryx, warthogs, wildebeest, jackal, bat-eared fox, spotted hyena, cape hare, red hartebeest, giraffes, springbok, elephants, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I were an elementary school teacher I'd place a big-screen TV in my classroom and turn it on to this camera's feed on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Naming a game must be incredibly hard. How many more Dark Fallen Journeys and Noun: Verb of the Noun games can fit into the market? And yet certain games just appear with a near-perfect, properly descriptive label.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Metropolis 1998 is just such a game, telling you what you’ll be doing, how it will look and feel, and what era it harkens back to. You can verify this with its “pre-alpha” demo on Steam and Itch.io. There’s plenty more to come, but what is already in place is impressive. And it’s simply pleasant to play, especially if you’re the type who wants to make something entirely yours. Not just “put the park inside the commercial district,” but The Sims-style “choose which wood color for the dining room table in a living room you framed up yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You start out in a big field with no features (yet) and the sounds of birds chirping. Once you lay down a road, you can add things at a few different levels. You can, SimCity-style, simply plot out colored zones and let the people figure it out themselves. You can add pre-made buildings individually. Or you can really get in there, spacing out individual rooms, choosing the doors and windows and objects inside, and realizing how hard it is to shape multi-floor houses so the roof doesn’t look grotesque. You can save the filled-out house for later reuse or just hold on to its core aspects as a blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game is still early in development, so its mechanics are not introduced in tutorials, and the interface requires a lot of clicking, reading, and wondering. I got a reasonable feel for it after about 30 minutes of tentative placing and bulldoze-deletion. You can save your game and come back to it, though the developers note that your saves may not transfer to future versions. You’re putting your time in now, so you’ll be ready to start fresh when the game releases into early access (“ETA sometime between Q4 2024 and Q2 2025”). If you’re into this kind of fine-toothed builder, a fresh start is a gift, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm neither a journalist nor a professional fact checker but, the thing is, it's has never been easier to check basic facts. Yeah, sure, there's a world of misinformation out there, but it doesn't take much effort to determine if something is likely to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are brilliant tools like reverse Image Search which give you a good indicator of when an image first appeared on the web, and whether it was published by a reputable source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use Google Books to check whether a quote is true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use social-media searches to easily check the origin of memes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are vast archives of printed material to help you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The World Wide Web has a million sites which allow you to cross-reference any citations to see if they're spurious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, perhaps all that is a bit too much effort for someone casually doomscrolling and hitting "repost" for an instant dopamine hit. But it shouldn't be. And it certainly shouldn't be for people who write for trusted sources like newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently, the beloved actor Patricia Routledge died. Several newspapers reposted a piece of viral slop which I had debunked a month previously. Let's go through the piece and see just how easy it is to prove false.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's that "viral" story. I've kept to the parts which contain easily verifiable / falsifiable claims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wikpedia says that her birthday was 17 February 1929. She would have turned 95 in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open up your calendar app. Scroll back to February 2024. What date was 17 February 2024? Saturday. Not Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, OK, maybe at 95 she's forgotten her birthday. What else does the rest of the piece say?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1968, Patricia Routledge won Best Actress (Musical) at the Tony Awards - she was 39. I don't know if I'd consider appearing on Broadway as provincial stages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keeping Up Appearances was first broadcast in 1990. Patricia was around 60, not 50, when she was cast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While she may have thought it would only be a small series - even though it was by the creator of Open All Hours and Last of the Summer Wine - there's no way that being the lead character could be described as a "small part". She wasn't a breakout character - she was the star.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wikipedia isn't always accurate, but it does list lots of her stage work. She was working steadily on stage from 1999 - when she hit 70 - but none of it Shakespeare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was able to do that fact checking in 10 minutes while laying in bed waiting for the bathroom to become free. It wasn't onerous. It didn't require subscriptions to professional journals. I didn't need a team of fact-checkers. It took a bit of web-sleuthing and, dare I say it, a smidgen of common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, a couple of newspapers ran with this utter drivel as though it were the truth. The Independent published it as part of their tribute - although they took the piece down after I emailed them. Similarly The Express ran it without any basic fact-checking (and didn't take it down after being contacted).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both of them say their primary source is the "Jay Speak" blog. There's nothing on that blog post to say that the author interviewed Patricia Routledge. A quick check of the other posts on the site don't make it obvious that it is a reputable source of exclusive interviews with notable actors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The date on that blog post is August 2nd, 2025. Is there anything earlier? Typing a few of the phrases into a search engine found a bunch of posts which pre-date it. The earliest I can find was this Instagram post and this Facebook post both from the 24th of July - a week early than the Jay Speaks post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, I don't think Jay Speaks was deliberately trying to fool journalists or hoax anyone. They simply saw an interesting looking post and re-shared it. I also suspect the Facebook and Instagram posts were copied from other sources - but I've been unable to find anything definitive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would expect that professional journalists at well-established newspapers to be able to call an actor's agent to fact-check a piece before running it. If they can't, I would have thought they'd do a cursory fact check.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, no. I presume the rush to publish is so great that it over-rides any sense of whether a piece should be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is irresponsible. Last week saw the BBC air an outright lie on Have I Got News For You. A professional TV company, with a budget for lawyers, fact checkers, and researchers - and they just broadcast easily disproven lies. Why? Maybe hubris, maybe laziness, maybe deliberate rabble-rousing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The media have comprehensively failed us. They will repeat any tawdry nonsense as long as it keeps people clicking. It's up to us to defend ourselves and our friends against this unending tsunami of low-grade slurry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope I've demonstrated that it takes almost no effort to perform a basic fact check. It isn't a professional skill. It doesn't require anything more than an Internet connection and a curious mind. If you see something online, take a moment to check it before sharing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stopping misinformation starts with you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why do some people endorse claims that can easily be disproved? It’s one thing to believe false information, but another to actively stick with something that’s obviously wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our new research, published in the Journal of Social Psychology, suggests that some people consider it a “win” to lean in to known falsehoods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are social psychologists who study political psychology and how people reason about reality. During the pandemic, we surveyed 5,535 people across eight countries to investigate why people believed COVID-19 misinformation, like false claims that 5G networks cause the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The strongest predictor of whether someone believed in COVID-19-related misinformation and risks related to the vaccine was whether they viewed COVID-19 prevention efforts in terms of symbolic strength and weakness. In other words, this group focused on whether an action would make them appear to fend off or “give in” to untoward influence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This factor outweighed how people felt about COVID-19 in general, their thinking style and even their political beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our survey measured it on a scale of how much people agreed with sentences including “Following coronavirus prevention guidelines means you have backed down” and “Continuous coronavirus coverage in the media is a sign we are losing.” Our interpretation is that people who responded positively to these statements would feel they “win” by endorsing misinformation – doing so can show “the enemy” that it will not gain any ground over people’s views.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When meaning is symbolic, not factual&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather than consider issues in light of actual facts, we suggest people with this mindset prioritize being independent from outside influence. It means you can justify espousing pretty much anything – the easier a statement is to disprove, the more of a power move it is to say it, as it symbolizes how far you’re willing to go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When people think symbolically this way, the literal issue – here, fighting COVID-19 – is secondary to a psychological war over people’s minds. In the minds of those who think they’re engaged in them, psychological wars are waged over opinions and attitudes, and are won via control of belief and messaging. The U.S. government at various times has used the concept of psychological war to try to limit the influence of foreign powers, pushing people to think that literal battles are less important than psychological independence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By that same token, vaccination, masking or other COVID-19 prevention efforts could be seen as a symbolic risk that could “weaken” one psychologically even if they provide literal physical benefits. If this seems like an extreme stance, it is – the majority of participants in our studies did not hold this mindset. But those who did were especially likely to also believe in misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an additional study we ran that focused on attitudes around cryptocurrency, we measured whether people saw crypto investment in terms of signaling independence from traditional finance. These participants, who, like those in our COVID-19 study, prioritized a symbolic show of strength, were more likely to believe in other kinds of misinformation and conspiracies, too, such as that the government is concealing evidence of alien contact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all of our studies, this mindset was also strongly associated with authoritarian attitudes, including beliefs that some groups should dominate others and support for autocratic government. These links help explain why strongman leaders often use misinformation symbolically to impress and control a population.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why people endorse misinformation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our findings highlight the limits of countering misinformation directly, because for some people, literal truth is not the point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, President Donald Trump incorrectly claimed in August 2025 that crime in Washington D.C. was at an all-time high, generating countless fact-checks of his premise and think pieces about his dissociation from reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we believe that to someone with a symbolic mindset, debunkers merely demonstrate that they’re the ones reacting, and are therefore weak. The correct information is easily available, but is irrelevant to someone who prioritizes a symbolic show of strength. What matters is signaling one isn’t listening and won’t be swayed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, for symbolic thinkers, nearly any statement should be justifiable. The more outlandish or easily disproved something is, the more powerful one might seem when standing by it. Being an edgelord – a contrarian online provocateur – or outright lying can, in their own odd way, appear “authentic.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some people may also view their favorite dissembler’s claims as provocative trolling, but, given the link between this mindset and authoritarianism, they want those far-fetched claims acted on anyway. The deployment of National Guard troops to Washington, for example, can be the desired end goal, even if the offered justification is a transparent farce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Is this really 5-D chess?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is possible that symbolic, but not exactly true, beliefs have some downstream benefit, such as serving as negotiation tactics, loyalty tests, or a fake-it-till-you-make-it long game that somehow, eventually, becomes a reality. Political theorist Murray Edelman, known for his work on political symbolism, noted that politicians often prefer scoring symbolic points over delivering results – it’s easier. Leaders can offer symbolism when they have little tangible to provide.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Former Tecmo game director Tomonobu Itagaki has passed away at age 58.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Word of the veteran developer's passing comes from a statement shared by his family on his Facebook page with one last message from the veteran developer. Itagaki was best known for creating and directing Tecmo's Dead or Alive series starting in 1996, and reviving Ninja Gaidan franchise with the 2004 game Ninja Gaidan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The light of my life is about to run out," Itagaki wrote in his final post (translated from Japanese via Google Translate). He called his life a "series of battles" that he kept winning, and that despite the trials he stayed by his beliefs and has "no regrets." He expressed remorse for not being able to share his "new work" with fans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He concluded his last message with a phrase in English: "so it goes."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itagaki's peers from across the video game industry have shared messages mourning his loss. Tekken series director and producer Katsuhiro Harada called his passing "too soon" in a post on X. "Didn't you say you were going to defeat me someday? Didn't you come to my wedding, wearing your usual black leather jacket and sunglasses, and call me your comrade-in-arms? Didn't you tell me to come to you whenever I was in trouble?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I never even got the chance to consult you about anything."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Itagaki's was a raucous—and sometimes inappropriate creative&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As noted by many game industry professionals celebrating Itagaki's legacy, the famed game director and producer was a big personally known for his trademark leather jacket and sunglasses. Contemporaneous coverage of his career shows that he had a habit of showing up inebriated to industry events and sometimes making inappropriate comments about the (often sexualized, sometimes underage) characters in his games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itagaki began his career at Tecmo in 1992 as a graphics programmer on the Super Famicon version of Tecmo Super Bowl, and would spend another 16 years at the company, taking over leadership of Ninja Gaidan development team Team Ninja in 2001 and rising to the rank of executive officer in 2004. But in 2006 he was removed from that position after being accused of sexual harassment that began in 2003. A Tokyo court cleared him of the charges in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He left Tecmo in 2008, suing the company and for ¥148 million (about $1.4 million) for unpaid bonuses. He also filed suit against then-company president Yoshimi Yasuda for "unreasonable and disingenuous statements" made in the workplace. He went on to form Valhalla Entertainment, which would release Wii U exclusive Devil's Third in 2015. He left the company in 2017 and returned to game development in 2021 with the founding of Itagaki Games. It's unclear if any game he worked on at the studio will ever see the light of day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Not everyone has to be living on the edge like I am. I think that would be a problem too, if that was the case," Itagaki said in a 2011 interview with Game Developer (then Gamasutra) discussing the types of creative personalities he wanted to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In it he shared a philosophy that—for better or worse—seems to embody his roller coaster of a career. "Being confident is something that comes internally," he said. "It has to come from your past. Something that you know you can do, and you can do it for the future, and you can back it up."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itagaki is survived by his wife and a 28-year-old daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
