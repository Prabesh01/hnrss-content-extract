  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey HN, Chris and Yuhong here from Onyx (&lt;/p&gt;https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx&lt;p&gt;). We’re building an open-source chat that works with any LLM (proprietary + open weight) &lt;/p&gt;and&lt;p&gt; gives these LLMs the tools they need to be useful (RAG, web search, MCP, deep research, memory, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demo: https://youtu.be/2g4BxTZ9ztg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, Yuhong and I had the same recurring problem. We were on growing teams and it was ridiculously difficult to find the right information across our docs, Slack, meeting notes, etc. Existing solutions required sending out our company's data, lacked customization, and frankly didn't work well. So, we started Danswer, an open-source enterprise search project built to be self-hosted and easily customized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the project grew, we started seeing an interesting trend—even though we were explicitly a search app, people wanted to use Danswer just to chat with LLMs. We’d hear, “the connectors, indexing, and search are great, but I’m going to start by connecting GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Qwen to provide my team with a secure way to use them”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many users would add RAG, agents, and custom tools later, but much of the usage stayed ‘basic chat’. We thought: “why would people co-opt an enterprise search when other AI chat solutions exist?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we continued talking to users, we realized two key points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) just giving a company secure access to an LLM with a great UI and simple tools is a huge part of the value add of AI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) providing this well is much harder than you might think and the bar is incredibly high&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer products like ChatGPT and Claude already provide a great experience—and chat with AI for work is something (ideally) everyone at the company uses 10+ times per day. People expect the same snappy, simple, and intuitive UX with a full feature set. Getting hundreds of small details right to take the experience from “this works” to “this feels magical” is not easy, and nothing else in the space has managed to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So ~3 months ago we pivoted to Onyx, the open-source chat UI with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- (truly) world class chat UX. Usable both by a fresh college grad who grew up with AI and an industry veteran who’s using AI tools for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Support for all the common add-ons: RAG, connectors, web search, custom tools, MCP, assistants, deep research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- RBAC, SSO, permission syncing, easy on-prem hosting to make it work for larger enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through building features like deep research and code interpreter that work across model providers, we've learned a ton of non-obvious things about engineering LLMs that have been key to making Onyx work. I'd like to share two that were particularly interesting (happy to discuss more in the comments).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, context management is one of the most difficult and important things to get right. We’ve found that LLMs really struggle to remember both system prompts and previous user messages in long conversations. Even simple instructions like “ignore sources of type X” in the system prompt are very often ignored. This is exacerbated by multiple tool calls, which can often feed in huge amounts of context. We solved this problem with a “Reminder” prompt—a short 1-3 sentence blurb injected at the end of the user message that describes the non-negotiables that the LLM must abide by. Empirically, LLMs attend most to the very end of the context window, so this placement gives the highest likelihood of adherence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, we’ve needed to build an understanding of the “natural tendencies” of certain models when using tools, and build around them. For example, the GPT family of models are fine-tuned to use a python code interpreter that operates in a Jupyter notebook. Even if told explicitly, it refuses to add `print()` around the last line, since, in Jupyter, this last line is automatically written to stdout. Other models don’t have this strong preference, so we’ve had to design our model-agnostic code interpreter to also automatically `print()` the last bare line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, we’ve had a Fortune 100 team fork Onyx and provide 10k+ employees access to every model within a single interface, and create thousands of use-case specific Assistants for every department, each using the best model for the job. We’ve seen teams operating in sensitive industries completely airgap Onyx w/ locally hosted LLMs to provide a copilot that wouldn’t have been possible otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to try Onyx out, follow https://docs.onyx.app/deployment/getting_started/quickstart to get set up locally w/ Docker in &amp;lt;15 minutes. For our Cloud: https://www.onyx.app/. If there’s anything you'd like to see to make it a no-brainer to replace your ChatGPT Enterprise/Claude Enterprise subscription, we’d love to hear it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;FLUX.2: Frontier Visual Intelligence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;News&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 is designed for real-world creative workflows, not just demos or party tricks. It generates high-quality images while maintaining character and style consistency across multiple reference images, following structured prompts, reading and writing complex text, adhering to brand guidelines, and reliably handling lighting, layouts, and logos. FLUX.2 can edit images at up to 4 megapixels while preserving detail and coherence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Black Forest Labs: Open Core&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe visual intelligence should be shaped by researchers, creatives, and developers everywhere, not just a few. That’s why we pair frontier capability with open research and open innovation, releasing powerful, inspectable, and composable open-weight models for the community, alongside robust, production-ready endpoints for teams that need scale, reliability, and customization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we launched Black Forest Labs in 2024, we set out to make open innovation sustainable, building on our experience developing some of the world’s most popular open models. We’ve combined open models like FLUX.1 [dev]—the most popular open image model globally—with professional-grade models like FLUX.1 Kontext [pro], which powers teams from Adobe to Meta and beyond. Our open core approach drives experimentation, invites scrutiny, lowers costs, and ensures that we can keep sharing open technology from the Black Forest and the Bay into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;From FLUX.1 to FLUX.2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Precision, efficiency, control, extreme realism - where FLUX.1 showed the potential of media models as powerful creative tools, FLUX.2 shows how frontier capability can transform production workflows. By radically changing the economics of generation, FLUX.2 will become an indispensable part of our creative infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Output Versatility: FLUX.2 is capable of generating highly detailed, photoreal images along with infographics with complex typography, all at resolutions up to 4MP&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s New&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-Reference Support: Reference up to 10 images simultaneously with the best character / product / style consistency available today.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Image Detail &amp;amp; Photorealism: Greater detail, sharper textures, and more stable lighting suitable for product shots, visualization, and photography-like use cases.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Text Rendering: Complex typography, infographics, memes and UI mockups with legible fine text now work reliably in production.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enhanced Prompt Following: Improved adherence to complex, structured instructions, including multi-part prompts and compositional constraints.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;World Knowledge: Significantly more grounded in real-world knowledge, lighting, and spatial logic, resulting in more coherent scenes with expected behavior.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Higher Resolution &amp;amp; Flexible Input/Output Ratios: Image editing on resolutions up to 4MP.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All variants of FLUX.2 offer image editing from text and multiple references in one model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Available Now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FLUX.2 family covers a spectrum of model products, from fully managed, production-ready APIs to open-weight checkpoints developers can run themselves. The overview graph below shows how FLUX.2 [pro], FLUX.2 [flex], FLUX.2 [dev], and FLUX.2 [klein] balance performance, and control&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FLUX.2 [pro]: State-of-the-art image quality that rivals the best closed models, matching other models for prompt adherence and visual fidelity while generating images faster and at lower cost. No compromise between speed and quality. → Available now at BFL Playground, the BFL API and via our launch partners.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FLUX.2 [flex]: Take control over model parameters such as the number of steps and the guidance scale, giving developers full control over quality, prompt adherence and speed. This model excels at rendering text and fine details. → Available now at bfl.ai/play , the BFL API and via our launch partners.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FLUX.2 [dev]: 32B open-weight model, derived from the FLUX.2 base model. The most powerful open-weight image generation and editing model available today, combining text-to-image synthesis and image editing with multiple input images in a single checkpoint. FLUX.2 [dev] weights are available on Hugging Face and can now be used locally using our reference inference code. On consumer grade GPUs like GeForce RTX GPUs you can use an optimized fp8 reference implementation of FLUX.2 [dev], created in collaboration with NVIDIA and ComfyUI. You can also sample Flux.2 [dev] via API endpoints on FAL, Replicate, Runware, Verda, TogetherAI, Cloudflare, DeepInfra. For a commercial license, visit our website.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FLUX.2 [klein] (coming soon): Open-source, Apache 2.0 model, size-distilled from the FLUX.2 base model. More powerful &amp;amp; developer-friendly than comparable models of the same size trained from scratch, with many of the same capabilities as its teacher model. Join the beta&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FLUX.2 - VAE: A new variational autoencoder for latent representations that provide an optimized trade-off between learnability, quality and compression rate. This model provides the foundation for all FLUX.2 flow backbones, and an in-depth report describing its technical properties is available here. The FLUX.2 - VAE is available on HF under an Apache 2.0 license.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generating designs with variable steps: FLUX.2 [flex] provides a “steps” parameter, trading off typography accuracy and latency. From left to right: 6 steps, 20 steps, 50 steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Controlling image detail with variable steps: FLUX.2 [flex] provides a “steps” parameter, trading off image detail and latency. From left to right: 6 steps, 20 steps, 50 steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The FLUX.2 model family delivers state-of-the-art image generation quality at extremely competitive prices, offering the best value across performance tiers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For open-weights image models, FLUX.2 [dev] sets a new standard, achieving leading performance across text-to-image generation, single-reference editing, and multi-reference editing, consistently outperforming all open-weights alternatives by a significant margin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether open or closed, we are committed to the responsible development of these models and services before, during, and after every release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How It Works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 builds on a latent flow matching architecture, and combines image generation and editing in a single architecture. The model couples the Mistral-3 24B parameter vision-language model with a rectified flow transformer. The VLM brings real world knowledge and contextual understanding, while the transformer captures spatial relationships, material properties, and compositional logic that earlier architectures could not render.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FLUX.2 now provides multi-reference support, with the ability to combine up to 10 images into a novel output, an output resolution of up to 4MP, substantially better prompt adherence and world knowledge, and significantly improved typography. We re-trained the model’s latent space from scratch to achieve better learnability and higher image quality at the same time, a step towards solving the “Learnability-Quality-Compression” trilemma. Technical details can be found in the FLUX.2 VAE blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;More Resources:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Into the New&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're building foundational infrastructure for visual intelligence, technology that transforms how the world is seen and understood. FLUX.2 is a step closer to multimodal models that unify perception, generation, memory, and reasoning, in an open and transparent way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When CSS Grid layout was first released, it came with a big asterisk: only the grid’s direct children could participate in the layout. “Subgrid” is a newer addition to CSS Grid which allows us to extend the grid layout down through the DOM tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I first heard about subgrid, it seemed to me like a convenience, a way to make it a bit simpler to accomplish the same stuff I was already doing. As it turns out, subgrid is way more interesting than that. It opens whole new doors in terms of the UIs we can build!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, I’ll show you some of the exciting new things we can do with subgrid. Along the way, you’ll learn the basic mechanics of subgrid. We’ll even go over the most common gotchas!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Link to this headingThe fundamentals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll get to the interesting stuff soon, but first, let’s start with the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose we want to implement the following mockup:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can create this layout using a flat grid, no subgrid required. Here’s a quick implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code Playground&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt; .grid { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 35% 1fr 1fr 1fr; header { grid-row: 1 / 3; } } &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="grid"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;header&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;My Portfolio&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; A small selection of the works created using Blender. No robots or AI involved. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; In a real artist portfolio, there would be more text here. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/header&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-sneakers.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-rocket.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-fish.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-guitar-pedals.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-machine.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-particles.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we check the “Grid” devtools, we see that this is a 4x2 grid, with the header spanning the first two rows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order for this to work without subgrid, every grid participant has to be a direct child of the &lt;code&gt;.grid&lt;/code&gt; container. Sure enough, if we inspect the HTML, we see the following structure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class="grid"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;header&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;…&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/header&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-sneakers.jpg" /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-rocket.jpg" /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-fish.jpg" /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-guitar-pedals.jpg" /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-machine.jpg" /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-particles.jpg" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Semantically, this feels a bit funky to me. I feel like these images should be grouped in a list, since we’re displaying a collection of portfolio pieces. Proper semantic markup will provide more context to folks using assistive technologies like screen readers, and to search engines that are trying to make sense of our page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, adding this extra markup throws a wrench into the grid:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code Playground&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;div class="grid"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;header&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;My Portfolio&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; A small selection of the works created using Blender. No robots or AI involved. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; In a real artist portfolio, there would be more text here. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/header&amp;gt; &amp;lt;!-- 👇 The images are grouped in an unordered list (&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;): --&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-sneakers.jpg" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-rocket.jpg" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-fish.jpg" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-guitar-pedals.jpg" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-machine.jpg" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-particles.jpg" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of having each image occupy its own grid cell, we instead cram the entire list of images into a single cell in the second column, leaving the final two columns totally empty. 😬&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CSS subgrid allows us to extend the parent grid through that &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, so that the images can participate in the main grid. Here’s what that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code Playground&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt; .grid { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 35% 1fr 1fr 1fr; } .grid header { grid-row: 1 / 3; } /* 👇 The new styles: */ .grid ul { grid-row: span 2; grid-column: span 3; display: grid; grid-template-rows: subgrid; grid-template-columns: subgrid; } &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="grid"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;header&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;My Portfolio&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; A small selection of the works created using Blender. No robots or AI involved. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; In a real artist portfolio, there would be more text here. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/header&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-sneakers.jpg" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-rocket.jpg" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-fish.jpg" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-guitar-pedals.jpg" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-machine.jpg" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img alt="…" src="/img/thumb-particles.jpg" /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot going on here, so let’s unpack it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Using&lt;code&gt;grid-column&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;grid-row&lt;/code&gt;, we assign the&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;to span three columns and two rows. This is how we specify which portion of the grid we want to share with the&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;’s descendants. We’ll dig more into this later.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Next, we apply&lt;code&gt;display: grid&lt;/code&gt;to the&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, to create a new child grid.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finally, we pass along the row/column definitions using&lt;code&gt;grid-template-rows&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;grid-template-columns&lt;/code&gt;. The&lt;code&gt;subgrid&lt;/code&gt;keyword is the key bit of magic that ties the two grids together, allowing each&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;to occupy its own cell in the parent grid.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I first learned about subgrid, this is the sort of scenario I was imagining: cases where nested HTML elements like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;figcaption&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; block us from assigning the actual UI elements to the grid. CSS subgrid is a nifty lil’ escape hatch for these types of situations!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, it's not like we haven’t had other ways to solve these kinds of problems. Instead of sharing a single CSS grid template with subgrid, we could instead combine a Flexbox row with a nested grid:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code Playground&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt; /* Instead of CSS Grid, the parent uses Flexbox */ .wrapper { display: flex; /* The first child uses 35% of the available size: */ header { flex-basis: 35%; } /* The &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; fills the rest of the Flex row, and creates a 3-column grid for its children: */ .grid { flex: 1; display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; } } &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="wrapper"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;header&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;My Portfolio&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; A small selection of the works created using Blender. No robots or AI involved. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; In a real artist portfolio, there would be more text here. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/header&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul class="grid"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src="/img/thumb-sneakers.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src="/img/thumb-rocket.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src="/img/thumb-fish.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src="/img/thumb-guitar-pedals.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src="/img/thumb-machine.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img src="/img/thumb-particles.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to rig everything up to use a single grid structure, we can often create the same layout with nested combinations of Flexbox/Grid. And honestly, I think I prefer this approach in this case! It feels simpler to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But like I said earlier, this isn’t the most exciting use case for subgrid. Now that we’ve covered the basic syntax, we can explore some of the more interesting possibilities. 😄&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Link to this headingNew layout possibilities&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sticking with the artist portfolio example, let’s suppose we have this card design:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bret’s Dead Fish&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I created this render for the Animation Design module in my upcoming course, Whimsical Animations(opens in new tab). The fish is a nod to Bret Victor’s talk, “Stop Drawing Dead Fish”, which is referenced in the course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This looks alright on its own, but something funky happens when we put it in a grid:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code Playground&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt; .grid { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; @media (max-width: 32rem) { grid-template-columns: 1fr; } } .grid article { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr; } &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="grid"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img alt="A big yellow pufferfish" src="/img/thumb-fish.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="content"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Bret’s Dead Fish&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; I created this render for the Animation Design module in my upcoming course, &amp;lt;a href="https://whimsy.joshwcomeau.com/" target="_blank" &amp;gt;Whimsical Animations&amp;lt;/a &amp;gt;. The fish is a nod to Bret Victor’s talk, “Stop Drawing Dead Fish”, which is referenced in the course. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img alt="two white sneakers with pink details and a shiny sparkly rainbow" src="/img/thumb-sneakers.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="content"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Big Shoes To Fill&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; In this piece, I tried to create my own sneaker design, taking inspiration from the Air Force Ones I’ve been wearing for most of my adult life. Topographically, shoes are a really weird shape, so this was a good challenge! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img alt="three colorful guitar pedals, with foot controls and knobs" src="/img/thumb-guitar-pedals.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="content"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Guitar Pedalboard&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Over the past few years, I’ve been getting back into music production, and have started collecting effect pedals. This render is my attempt to create my own pedal designs. The middle one is meant to look a bit like Zoidberg. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img alt="A very complicated machine with a plane-style throttle, a piano keyboard, radar, a bunch of sliders and knobs, and so much more" src="/img/thumb-machine.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="content"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Infinite Supercomputer&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; I spent more time than I’d care to admit creating an enormous machine in Blender, full of weird knobs and sliders and extras. The goal was to produce a completely ridiculous cockpit-style panel. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that the images are different widths? The fish image, for example, is much wider than the final supercomputer image. What’s going on here? 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, let’s take a look at the CSS. The four cards are arranged in a two-column grid (which shrinks to a one-column grid on smaller screens):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;

  @media (max-width: 32rem) {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re populating this top-level grid with four &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; cards. Each card declares its own two-column grid:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.grid article {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal here is for the image to take up the lion’s share of the space within each card, since that’s the important part (the point of an artist’s portfolio, after all, is to showcase the art!). But the &lt;code&gt;fr&lt;/code&gt; unit is designed to be flexible; it will try to match the requested ratio, but it’ll adapt based on the content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is actually a very good thing. We could force the image column to be a fixed size, but we wouldn’t like the results:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code Playground&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt; .grid { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; @media (max-width: 32rem) { grid-template-columns: 1fr; } } .grid article { display: grid; /* 👇 This is the change 👇 */ grid-template-columns: 66% 1fr; } &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="grid"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img alt="A big yellow pufferfish" src="/img/thumb-fish.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="content"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Bret’s Dead Fish&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; I created this render for the Animation Design module in my upcoming course, &amp;lt;a href="https://whimsy.joshwcomeau.com/" target="_blank" &amp;gt;Whimsical Animations&amp;lt;/a &amp;gt;. The fish is a nod to Bret Victor’s talk, “Stop Drawing Dead Fish”, which is referenced in the course. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img alt="two white sneakers with pink details and a shiny sparkly rainbow" src="/img/thumb-sneakers.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="content"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Big Shoes To Fill&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; In this piece, I tried to create my own sneaker design, taking inspiration from the Air Force Ones I’ve been wearing for most of my adult life. Topographically, shoes are a really weird shape, so this was a good challenge! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img alt="three colorful guitar pedals, with foot controls and knobs" src="/img/thumb-guitar-pedals.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="content"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Guitar Pedalboard&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Over the past few years, I’ve been getting back into music production, and have started collecting effect pedals. This render is my attempt to create my own pedal designs. The middle one is meant to look a bit like Zoidberg. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img alt="A very complicated machine with a plane-style throttle, a piano keyboard, radar, a bunch of sliders and knobs, and so much more" src="/img/thumb-machine.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="content"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Infinite Supercomputer&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; I spent more time than I’d care to admit creating an enormous machine in Blender, full of weird knobs and sliders and extras. The goal was to produce a completely ridiculous cockpit-style panel. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On certain viewport sizes, the cards simply aren’t large enough to devote ⅔rds of the available space to the image and still contain the text content. If we force that column to have a fixed size, the text could wind up overflowing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, the flexibility we get from the &lt;code&gt;fr&lt;/code&gt; unit is a good thing. The problem is that each card is doing its own internal calculation. The heading in the first card (“Bret’s Dead Fish”) is made up of small words, so it can fit comfortably in a narrow column. But the final card’s heading (“Infinite Supercomputer”) requires quite a bit more room.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve worked with CSS for a while, you’ve probably gotten stuck in cul-de-sacs like this. One of the hardest problems in CSS is when siblings need to be aware of each other inside nested / complex layouts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Miraculously, subgrid offers a solution to these sorts of problems. Check this out:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code Playground&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt; .grid { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 2fr 1fr); @media (max-width: 32rem) { grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr; } } .grid article { grid-column: span 2; display: grid; grid-template-columns: subgrid; } &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="grid"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img alt="A big yellow pufferfish" src="/img/thumb-fish.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="content"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Bret’s Dead Fish&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; I created this render for the Animation Design module in my upcoming course, &amp;lt;a href="https://whimsy.joshwcomeau.com/" target="_blank" &amp;gt;Whimsical Animations&amp;lt;/a &amp;gt;. The fish is a nod to Bret Victor’s talk, “Stop Drawing Dead Fish”, which is referenced in the course. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img alt="two white sneakers with pink details and a shiny sparkly rainbow" src="/img/thumb-sneakers.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="content"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Big Shoes To Fill&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; In this piece, I tried to create my own sneaker design, taking inspiration from the Air Force Ones I’ve been wearing for most of my adult life. Topographically, shoes are a really weird shape, so this was a good challenge! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img alt="three colorful guitar pedals, with foot controls and knobs" src="/img/thumb-guitar-pedals.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="content"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Guitar Pedalboard&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Over the past few years, I’ve been getting back into music production, and have started collecting effect pedals. This render is my attempt to create my own pedal designs. The middle one is meant to look a bit like Zoidberg. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img alt="A very complicated machine with a plane-style throttle, a piano keyboard, radar, a bunch of sliders and knobs, and so much more" src="/img/thumb-machine.jpg" /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="content"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Infinite Supercomputer&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; I spent more time than I’d care to admit creating an enormous machine in Blender, full of weird knobs and sliders and extras. The goal was to produce a completely ridiculous cockpit-style panel. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/article&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How cool is this?? 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the original version, the parent grid was a one-column layout (on smaller screens), and it contained a bunch of independent grids. In this new version, the parent grid holds the two-column layout:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the original version, the parent grid was a two-column layout, with each card assigned to a grid cell. In this new version, the parent grid grows to four columns:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will span two of these columns (&lt;code&gt;grid-column: span 2&lt;/code&gt;), and inherits the column definitions from the parent (&lt;code&gt;grid-template-column: subgrid&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, the grid can dynamically react to content changes. Try erasing the word “Supercomputer” in the playground above and notice how the columns readjust!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, the grid can dynamically react to content changes. If that final card (“Infinite Supercomputer”) had a shorter title, the whole grid would rearrange, shrinking the text columns and allowing more of the images to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, I’m not really used to thinking about layouts like this. Before subgrid, I would’ve solved this problem by picking a very narrow fixed width for the image column, so that there was always enough space for the text column. This would ensure that the layout never breaks, but remember, the goal of a portfolio is to display as much of the images as possible! Subgrid allows us to adapt to the content dynamically, so that we can produce the best possible UI in various contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where subgrid truly shines, in my opinion. By extending the grid downwards, it means that we can allow siblings to become responsive to each other, in a way that hasn’t been possible until now. ✨&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Link to this headingSubgrid Gotchas&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I’ve been experimenting with subgrid, there have been a couple of things that have caught me off guard. Let’s go over them, so that you’re well-prepared!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Link to this headingReserving space for the subgrid&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sharing columns with subgrid tends to be pretty intuitive, but things get a bit more quirky when sharing rows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To help me explain, let’s look at a different example. Suppose our design team wants us to build the following pricing UI, to show the features included at different price tiers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This seems like a pretty straightforward task, but the devil is in the details. If we use a typical Grid or Flexbox strategy, we’ll wind up with asymmetrical rows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This might look right at a quick glance, but notice how the features don’t line up. In the original mockup, the first line of every feature is perfectly aligned with the same feature in the opposite card!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historically, the only way to achieve this sort of thing in CSS has been with Table layout (using &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags, or &lt;code&gt;display: table&lt;/code&gt;). It’s not really practical to use a table here, though, since we’d need each card to be its own column in the same table, and we can’t easily style table columns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subgrid to the rescue! At least in theory, we should be able to let both cards share a single grid, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there’s a very easy mistake to make. See if you can spot the problem with this code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code Playground&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt; .grid { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; .card, .card ul { display: grid; grid-template-rows: subgrid; } } &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="grid"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="card"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Pro Package&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Up to 4 team accounts.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Basic workflows.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Connect with Slack™.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Up to 3 knowledge bases, with 100gb total storage.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Limited AI assistant (depending on region and language).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="card"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Enterprise Package&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Unlimited team accounts.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Advanced, fully-customizeable workflows.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Connect with Slack™, Microsoft Teams™, Discord™, and 5 other popular integrations.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Unlimited knowledge bases.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Unlimited robots. 🤖&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the text is clumped up in the same spot! If we inspect this using the Grid devtools, we discover that we’ve wound up with a 2×1 grid. All of the content within each card is smushed into a single row. 😬&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typically, with CSS Grid, we don’t need to explicitly define any rows. I usually define the number of columns, and trust the grid algorithm to add new rows as-needed, so that each child gets its own grid cell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, with subgrid, it doesn't quite work like this. By default, our child grid will only span a single grid column/row. If we want it to occupy multiple rows, we need to reserve them explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what the fix looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code Playground&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt; .grid { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; .card { /* Instruct the .card to span across 6 rows: */ grid-row: span 6; display: grid; grid-template-rows: subgrid; } .card ul { /* Instruct the list within to span across 5 rows: */ grid-row: span 5; display: grid; grid-template-rows: subgrid; } } &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="grid"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="card"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Pro Package&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Up to 4 team accounts.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Basic workflows.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Connect with Slack™.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Up to 3 knowledge bases, with 100gb total storage.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Limited AI assistant (depending on region and language).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="card"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Enterprise Package&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Unlimited team accounts.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Advanced, fully-customizeable workflows.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Connect with Slack™, Microsoft Teams™, Discord™, and 5 other popular integrations.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Unlimited knowledge bases.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Unlimited robots. 🤖&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extra-complicated thing about this setup is that we’re extending the grid down two layers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;First, we extend it to&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class="card"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which includes an&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;and a&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Next, we extend it to that child&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, so that the individual list items each get their own row.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are 5 list items in this case, which means we need 6 rows total (one for the heading, five for the list). If we don’t “reserve” all of these rows explicitly, then the browser will shove everything into a single row and make a big mess, like we saw above. I’m not exactly sure why the typical auto-assignment algorithm doesn’t work with subgrid, but I assume there’s some technical limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is mind-bending stuff, but it becomes intuitive with a bit of practice. The thing to keep in mind is that subgrids, by default, will only occupy a single grid cell. In order to spread a group of items across multiple grid rows, the subgrid must first stretch across that area itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Link to this headingNested grid numbers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We got the gnarliest gotcha out of the way first! I promise the next two won’t be as intellectually taxing. 😅&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In CSS grid, the lines between each column are numbered, and we can assign grid children using these numbers. This is something we explore in greater depth in “An Interactive Guide to CSS Grid”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we inherit a portion of the grid using &lt;code&gt;grid-template-rows: subgrid&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;grid-template-columns: subgrid&lt;/code&gt;, the line numbers get reset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of what I’m talking about:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code Playground&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt; .grid { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr); grid-template-rows: repeat(4, 1fr); .subgrid { grid-column: 2 / 5; grid-row: 2 / 5; display: grid; grid-template-columns: subgrid; grid-template-rows: subgrid; .child { grid-column: 2; grid-row: 2; } } } &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="grid"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="subgrid"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="child"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our yellow &lt;code&gt;.child&lt;/code&gt; is assigned to &lt;code&gt;grid-column: 2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;grid-row: 2&lt;/code&gt;, but it winds up sitting in the third of the grid’s four rows and columns. 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that while the grid template is inherited with subgrid, the line indexes don’t. Our &lt;code&gt;.subgrid&lt;/code&gt; grid inherits columns/rows 2 through 4, but internally, they get re-indexed as 1 through 3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see this using the grid devtools in the Elements inspector:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my mind, I had been thinking of line numbers as unique IDs, and so I figured that if the subgrid is inheriting the grid template, those IDs would come along for the ride too. But if we think of these line numbers as indices rather than IDs, this behaviour makes a lot more sense. In every grid, the first line has index 1, even if that row/column is inherited from a parent grid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Link to this headingIncompatibility with fluid grids&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most famous grid snippet is this lil’ guy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(100px, 1fr));
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a fluid design concept. Instead of specifying different grid templates at different viewport sizes using media queries, we specify that we want as many columns as possible, as long as they’re all at least 100px wide (or whatever the minimum specified size is).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try resizing the “Result” pane by dragging the vertical divider, and notice how the columns adjust:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code Playground&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt; .grid { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat( auto-fill, minmax(100px, 1fr) ); } &amp;lt;/style&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="grid"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="child"&amp;gt;A&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="child"&amp;gt;B&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="child"&amp;gt;C&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="child"&amp;gt;D&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="child"&amp;gt;E&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class="child"&amp;gt;F&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a very cool approach, but unfortunately, it doesn’t quite work with some of the new UI possibilities introduced by subgrid. For example, the “portfolio card” grid we explored earlier requires that we list the specific number of columns. We can’t use &lt;code&gt;auto-fill&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;auto-fit&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Or, more accurately, I haven’t found a way to use fluid design in conjunction with that subgrid pattern. If you’ve found a solution, please let me know on Bluesky!(opens in new tab))&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Link to this headingSupporting older browsers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subgrid has been supported across all major browsers since 2023. Surprisingly, though, subgrid support still hasn’t hit 90% yet (according to caniuse(opens in new tab), as of November 2025).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This presents a bit of a challenge. As we’ve seen in this blog post, subgrid enables us to solve problems that were previously unsolvable. What should we do for folks who visit using older browsers?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, we can’t produce an identical experience, but I think with a bit of creative problem-solving, we can come up with alternative layouts that are good enough. Using the artist portfolio example from earlier, we could reconfigure the card layout so that the image is stacked vertically, rather than horizontally:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can accomplish this using feature queries. Here’s what the code looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@supports not (grid-template-columns: subgrid) {
  .grid article {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 140px 1fr;
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, I could have kept the two-column layout but restricted the image column’s width (eg. &lt;code&gt;grid-template-columns: 50px 1fr&lt;/code&gt;). This would’ve preserved the original design for everyone. But I think when it comes to fallbacks, the goal isn't to be as similar to the original as possible, the goal is to produce the best experience possible. In this particular case, I think a single-column fallback experience works better.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I’m publishing this post on November 25th, a frankly miserable time of year up here in the northern hemisphere 😅. The days are getting shorter, the weather is getting colder, and my favourite season (autumn) is transmogrifying into my least favourite season (winter).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there is one silver lining about this time of year: everything’s on sale for Black Friday! 🎈&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past few years, my main focus has been creating comprehensive interactive online courses. I have two flagship courses, CSS for JavaScript Developers(opens in new tab) and The Joy of React(opens in new tab), and this week, they’re up to 50% off(opens in new tab)!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you found this blog post useful, you’ll likely get so much out of my CSS course. We focus on understanding CSS at a deeper level, building an intuition for how the language actually works. No more memorizing snippets, or trying random stuff hoping that the UI will snap into the right shape!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know that in the world of e-commerce, things go on sale every other week. That’s not how I roll, though. I only have one or two sales a year. So this truly is a rare chance to pick up one of my courses for a deep discount. ✨&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can learn more here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Link to this headingIn conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the coolest websites I’ve seen in a while is Stripe’s developer site(opens in new tab).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we pop open the grid devtools, we see that the entire layout is one big grid, passed down through several layers of subgrids:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is incredibly cool, and I think it’s a great demonstration of the maximalist things we can do with subgrid. But, honestly, I think I’m more excited by the smaller-scale stuff we’ve seen in this blog post. 😅&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subgrid is a very versatile new tool, and it can be a bit intimidating and overwhelming, but hopefully this post has given you some ideas for the sorts of things you can start experimenting with. The good news is that you don’t have to re-architect your entire project in order to start using subgrid! The most powerful parts of subgrid are things which can be incrementally adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another special thanks to Kevin Powell. The examples in this blog post would’ve been far less compelling without his inspiration. 😄&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Python is not a great language for data science. Part 1: The experience&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It may be a good language for data science, but it’s not a great one.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, I’m ready to touch the hot stove. Let the language wars begin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually, the first thing I’ll say is this: Use the tool you’re familiar with. If that’s Python, great, use it. And also, use the best tool for the job. If that’s Python, great, use it. And also, it’s Ok to use a tool for one task just because you’re already using it for all sorts of other tasks and therefore you happen to have it at hand. If you’re hammering nails all day it’s Ok if you’re also using your hammer to open a bottle of beer or scratch your back. Similarly, if you’re programming in Python all day it’s Ok if you’re also using it to fit mixed linear models. If it works for you, great! Keep going. But if you’re struggling, if things seem more difficult than they ought to be, this article series may be for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think people way over-index Python as the language for data science. It has limitations that I think are quite noteworthy. There are many data-science tasks I’d much rather do in R than in Python.1 I believe the reason Python is so widely used in data science is a historical accident, plus it being sort-of Ok at most things, rather than an expression of its inherent suitability for data-science work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, I think Python is pretty good for deep learning.2 There’s a reason PyTorch is the industry standard. When I’m talking about data science here, I’m specifically excluding deep learning. I’m talking about all the other stuff: data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, visualization, statistical modeling, etc. And, as I said in my opening paragraphs, I understand that if you’re already working in Python all day for a good reason (e.g., training AI models) you may also want to do all the rest in Python. I’m doing this myself, in the deep-learning classes I teach. This doesn’t mean I can’t be frustrated by how cumbersome data science often is in the Python world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Observations from the trenches&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s begin with my lived experience, without providing any explanation for what may be the cause of it. I have been running a research lab in computational biology for over two decades. During this time I have worked with around thirty graduate students and postdocs, all very competent and accomplished computational scientists. The policy in my lab is that everybody is free to use whatever programming language and tools they want to use. I don’t tell people what to do. And more often than not, people choose Python as their programming language of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So here is a typical experience I commonly have with students who use Python. A student comes to my office and shows me some result. I say “This is great, but could you quickly plot the data in this other way?” or “Could you quickly calculate this quantity I just made up and let me know what it looks like when you plot it?” or similar. Usually, the request I make is for something that I know I could do in R in just a few minutes. Examples include converting boxplots into violins or vice versa, turning a line plot into a heatmap, plotting a density estimate instead of a histogram, performing a computation on ranked data values instead of raw data values, and so on. Without fail, from the students that use Python, the response is: “This will take me a bit. Let me sit down at my desk and figure it out and then I’ll be back.” Now let me be absolutely clear: These are strong students. The issue is not that my students don’t know their tools. It very much seems to me to be a problem of the tools themselves. They appear to be sufficiently cumbersome or confusing that requests that I think should be trivial frequently are not.3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No matter the cause of this experience, I have to conclude that there is something fundamentally broken with how data analysis works in Python. It may be a problem with the language itself, or merely a limitation of the available software libraries, or a combination thereof, but whatever it is, its effects are real and I see them routinely. In fact, I have another example, in case you’re tempted to counter, “It’s a skill issue; get better students.” Last fall, I co-taught a class on AI models for biology with an experienced data scientist who does all his work in Python. He knows NumPy and pandas and matplotlib like the back of his hand. In the class, I covered all the theory, and he covered the in-class exercises in Python. So I got to see an expert in Python working through a range of examples. And my reaction to the code examples frequently was, “Why does it have to be so complicated?” So many times, I felt that things that would be just a few lines of simple R code turned out to be quite a bit longer and fairly convoluted. I definitely could not have written that code without extensive studying and completely rewiring my brain in terms of what programming patterns to use. It felt very alien, but not in the form of “wow, this is so alien but also so elegant” but rather “wow, this is so alien and weird and cumbersome.” And again, I don’t think this is because my colleague is not very good at what he’s doing. He is extremely good. The problem appears to be in the fundamental architecture of the tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Some general thoughts about what makes a good language for data science&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me step back for a moment and go over some basic considerations for choosing a language for data science. When I say data science, I mean dissecting and summarizing data, finding patterns, fitting models, and making visualizations. In brief, it’s the kind of stuff scientists and other researchers4 do when they are analyzing their data. This activity is distinct from data engineering or application development, even if the application does a data-heavy workload.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data science as I define it here involves a lot of interactive exploration of data and quick one-off analyses or experiments. Therefore, any language suitable for data science has to be interpreted, usable in an interactive shell or in a notebook format. This also means performance considerations are secondary. When you want to do a quick linear regression on some data you’re working with, you don’t care whether the task is going to take 50 milliseconds or 500 milliseconds. You care about whether you can open up a shell, type a few lines of code, and get the result in a minute or two, versus having to set up a new project, writing all the boilerplate to make the compiler happy, and then spend more time compiling your code than running it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we accept that being able to work interactively and with low startup-cost is a critical feature of a language for data science, we immediately arrive at scripting languages such as Python, or data-science specific languages such as R or Matlab or Mathematica. There’s also Julia, but honestly I don’t know enough about it to write about it coherently. For all I know it’s the best possible data science language out there. But I note that some people who have used it extensively have doubts. Either way, I’ll not discuss it further here. I’ll also not consider proprietary languages such as Matlab or Mathematica, or fairly obscure languages lacking a wide ecosystem of useful packages, such as Octave. This leaves us with R and Python as the realistic choices to consider.5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before continuing, let me provide a few more thoughts about performance. Performance usually trades off with other features of a language. In simplistic terms, performance comes at the cost of either extra overhead for the programmer (as in Rust) or increased risk of obscure bugs (as in C) or both. For data science applications, I consider a high risk of obscure bugs or incorrect results as not acceptable, and I also think convenience for the programmer is more important than raw performance. Computers are fast and thinking hurts. I’d rather spend less mental energy on telling the computer what to do and wait a little longer for the results. So the easier a language makes my job for me, the better. If I am really performance-limited in some analysis, I can always rewrite that particular part of the analysis in Rust, once I know exactly what I’m doing and what computations I need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Separating the logic from the logistics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A critical component of not making my job harder than it needs to be is separating the logic of the analysis from the logistics. What I mean by this is I want to be able to specify at a conceptual level how the data should be analyzed and what the outcome of the computation should be, and I don’t want to have to think about the logistics of how the computation is performed. As a general rule, if I have to think about data types, numerical indices, or loops, or if I have to manually disassemble and reassemble datasets, chances are I’m bogged down in logistics.6&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To provide a concrete example, consider the dataset of penguins from the Palmer Archipelago. There are three different penguin species in the dataset, and the penguins live on three different islands. Assume I want to calculate the mean and standard deviation of penguin weight for every combination of penguin species and island, excluding any cases where the body weight of a penguin is not known. An ideal data science language would allow me to express this computation in these terms, and it would require approximately as much code as it took me to write this sentence in the English language. And indeed this is possible, both in R and in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the relevant code in R, using the tidyverse approach:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins |&amp;gt;
  filter(!is.na(body_mass_g)) |&amp;gt;
  group_by(species, island) |&amp;gt;
  summarize(
    body_weight_mean = mean(body_mass_g),
    body_weight_sd = sd(body_mass_g)
  )&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here is the equivalent code in Python, using the pandas package:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import pandas as pd
from palmerpenguins import load_penguins

penguins = load_penguins()

(penguins
 .dropna(subset=['body_mass_g'])
 .groupby(['species', 'island'])
 .agg(
     body_weight_mean=('body_mass_g', 'mean'),
     body_weight_sd=('body_mass_g', 'std')
 )
 .reset_index()
)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These two examples are quite similar. At this level of complexity of the analysis, Python does fine. I would consider the R code to be slightly easier to read (notice how many quotes and brackets the Python code needs), but the differences are minor. In both cases, we take the penguins dataset, remove the penguins for which body weight is missing, then specify that we want to perform the computation separately on every combination of penguin species and island, and then calculate the means and standard deviations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contrast this with equivalent code that is full of logistics, where I’m using only basic Python language features and no special data wrangling package:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from palmerpenguins import load_penguins
import math

penguins = load_penguins()

# Convert DataFrame to list of dictionaries
penguins_list = penguins.to_dict('records')

# Filter out rows where body_mass_g is missing
filtered = [row for row in penguins_list if not math.isnan(row['body_mass_g'])]

# Group by species and island
groups = {}
for row in filtered:
    key = (row['species'], row['island'])
    if key not in groups:
        groups[key] = []
    groups[key].append(row['body_mass_g'])

# Calculate mean and standard deviation for each group
results = []
for (species, island), values in groups.items():
    n = len(values)
    
    # Calculate mean
    mean = sum(values) / n
    
    # Calculate standard deviation
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in values) / (n - 1)
    std_dev = math.sqrt(variance)
    
    results.append({
        'species': species,
        'island': island,
        'body_weight_mean': mean,
        'body_weight_sd': std_dev
    })

# Sort results to match order used by pandas
results.sort(key=lambda x: (x['species'], x['island']))

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(f"{result['species']:10} {result['island']:10} "
          f"Mean: {result['body_weight_mean']:7.2f} g, "
          f"SD: {result['body_weight_sd']:6.2f} g")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This code is much longer, it contains numerous loops, and it explicitly pulls the dataset apart and then puts it back together again. Regardless of language choice, I hope you can see that the version without logistics is superior to the version that gets bogged down in logistical details.7&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will end things here for now. This post is long enough. In future installments, I’ll go over specific issues that make data analysis more complicated in Python than in R. In brief, I believe there are several reasons why Python code often devolves into dealing with data logistics. As much as the programmer may try to avoid logistics and stick to high-level conceptual programming patterns, either the language itself or the available libraries get in the way and tend to thwart those efforts. I will go into details soon. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;More from Genes, Minds, Machines&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of languages that are commonly used for data science, I’m only familiar with R and Python, so those are the languages I’ll compare here. There may be some other language you are familiar with that solves all the issues I’m raising. Maybe it’s Julia, or Ruby, or Haskel. Great. If you like it, use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least in the way that deep learning is practiced today. In my opinion, the fact that PyTorch (or TensorFlow) code requires us to explicitly manipulate tensors and think about dimensions and what data is stored where suggests to me that there’s a level of abstraction we haven’t figured out yet. In other data analysis tasks, we no longer have to do these things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The plotting examples I list here are non-issues for students who use plotnine, which I’m now encouraging everybody in my lab to do. But for students who use matplotlib or seaborn, which seem to be much more common choices in the Python community, I’ve never seen a student who could actually, on the fly, modify a plot in a meaningful manner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m writing “researchers” in addition to “scientists” because people such as economists or journalists also often do data science, and I don’t think we’d call either type of person a scientist. I think “researcher” is a more general term that can apply to anybody who researches something, regardless of whether it’s science or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once upon a time there was Perl, but thankfully everybody agreed Perl was not a great language for anything. Python’s success is in no small part due to being better than Perl at most everything that Perl was good at.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is my main criticism of current deep-learning code that I alluded to in Footnote 2. It’s all logistics. Where is the deep-learning framework that abstracts away all the logistics and allows me to express only the logic of the information flow through the network?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doing the same experiment with only base-R functionality feels like cheating. We can express the entire operation in a single function call:&lt;code&gt;aggregate(body_mass_g ~ species + island, penguins, \(x) c(mean = mean(x), sd = sd(x)))&lt;/code&gt;This example highlights how powerful R is for data analysis. It also explains one of the main criticisms leveled at the tidyverse by the base-R community, that the tidyverse is overly verbose and is just reinventing concepts that have been available in R since the dawn of time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Unifying our mobile and desktop domains&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How we achieved 20% faster mobile response times, improved SEO, and reduced infrastructure load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until now, when you visited a wiki (like &lt;code&gt;en.wikipedia.org&lt;/code&gt;), the server responded in one of two ways: a desktop page, or a redirect to the equivalent mobile URL (like &lt;code&gt;en.m.wikipedia.org&lt;/code&gt;). This mobile URL in turn served the mobile version of the page from MediaWiki. Our servers have operated this way since 2011, when we deployed MobileFrontend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past two months we unified the mobile and desktop domain for all wikis (timeline). This means we no longer redirect mobile users to a separate domain while the page is loading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We completed the change on Wednesday 8 October after deploying to English Wikipedia. The mobile domains became dormant within 24 hours, which confirms that most mobile traffic arrived on Wikipedia via the standard domains and thus experienced a redirect until now.[1][2]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why did we have a separate mobile domain? And, why did we believe that changing this might benefit us?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The year is 2008 and all sorts of websites large and small have a mobile subdomain. The BBC, IMDb, Facebook, and newspapers around the world all featured the iconic m-dot domain. For Wikipedia, a separate mobile domain made the mobile experiment low-risk to launch and avoided technical limitations. It became the default in 2011 by way of a redirect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fast-forward seventeen years, and much has changed. It is no longer common for websites to have m-dot domains. Wikipedia’s use of it is surprising to our present day audience, and it may decrease the perceived strength of domain branding. The technical limitations we had in 2008 have long been solved, with the Wikimedia CDN having efficient and well-tested support for variable responses under a single URL. And above all, we had reason to believe Google stopped supporting separate mobile domains, which motivated the project to start when it did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find a detailed history and engineering analysis in the Mobile domain sunsetting RFC along with weekly updates on mediawiki.org.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Site speed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google used to link from mobile search results directly to our mobile domain, but last year this stopped. This exposed a huge part of our audience to the mobile redirect and regressed mobile response times by 10-20%.[2]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google supported mobile domains in 2008 by letting you advertise a separate mobile URL. While Google only indexed the desktop site for content, they stored this mobile URL and linked to it when searching from a mobile device.[3] This allowed Google referrals to skip over the redirect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google introduced a new crawler in 2016, and gradually re-indexed the Internet with it.[4-7] This new “mobile-first” crawler acts like a mobile device rather than a desktop device, and removes the ability to advertise a separate mobile or desktop link. It’s now one link for everyone! Wikipedia.org was among the last sites Google switched, with May 2024 as the apparent change window.[2] This meant the 60% of incoming pageviews referred by Google, now had to wait for the same redirect that the other 40% of referrals have experienced since 2011.[8]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unifying our domains eliminated the redirect and led to a 20% improvement in mobile response times.[2] This improvement is both a recovery and a net-improvement because it applies to everyone! It recovers the regression that Google-referred traffic started to experience last year, but also improves response times for all other traffic by the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The graphs below show how the change was felt worldwide. The “Worldwide p50” corresponds to what you might experience in Germany or Italy, with fast connectivity close to our data centers. The “Worldwide p80” resembles what you might experience in Iran browsing the Persian Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;SEO&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first site affected was not Wikipedia but Commons. Wikimedia Commons is the free media repository used by Wikipedia and its sister projects. Tim Starling found in June that only half of the 140 million pages on Commons were known to Google.[9] And of these known pages, 20 million were also delisted due to the mobile redirect. This had been growing by one million delisted pages every month.[10] The cause for delisting turned out to be the mobile redirect. You see, the new Google crawler, just like your browser, also has to follow the mobile redirect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After following the redirect, the crawler reads our page metadata which points back to the standard domain as the preferred one. This creates a loop that can prevent a page from being updated or listed in Google Search. Delisting is not a matter of ranking, but about whether a page is even in the search index.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tim and myself disabled the mobile redirect for “Googlebot on Commons” through an emergency intervention on June 23rd. Referrals then began to come back, and kept rising for eleven weeks in a row, until reaching a 100% increase in Google-referrals. From a baseline of 3 million weekly pageviews up to 6 million. Google’s data on clickthroughs shows a similar increase from 1M to 1.8M “clicks”.[9]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We reversed last year’s regression and set a new all-time high. We think there’s three reasons Commons reached new highs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The redirect consumed half of the crawl budget, thus limiting how many pages could be crawled.[10][11]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Google switched Commons to its new crawler some years before Wikipedia.[12] The index had likely been shrinking for two years already.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pages on Commons have a sparse link graph. Wikipedia has a rich network of links between articles, whereas pages on Commons represent a photo with an image description that rarely links to other files. This unique page structure makes it hard to discover Commons pages through recursive crawling without a sitemap.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unifying our domains lifted a ceiling we didn’t know was there!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MediaWiki software has a built-in sitemap generator, but we disabled this on Wikimedia sites over a decade ago.[13] We decided to enable it for Commons and submitted it to Google on August 6th.[14][15] Google has since indexed 70 million new pages for Commons, up 140% since June.[9]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also found that less than 0.1% of videos on Commons were recognised by Google as video watch pages (for the Google Search “Videos” tab). I raised this in a partnership meeting with Google Search, and it may’ve been a bug on their end. Commons started showing up in Google Videos a week later.[16][17]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Link sharing UX&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When sharing links from a mobile device, such link previously hardcoded the mobile domain. Links shared from a mobile device gave you the mobile site, even when received on desktop. The “Desktop” link in the footer of the mobile site pointed to the standard domain and disabled the standard-to-mobile redirect for you, on the assumption you arrived on the mobile site via the redirect. The “Desktop” link did not remember your choice on the mobile domain itself, and there existed no equivalent mobile-to-standard redirect for when you arrive there. This meant a shared mobile link always presented the mobile site, even after opting-out on desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone now shares the same domain which naturally shows the appropiate version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a long tail of stable referrals from news articles, research papers, blogs, talk pages, and mailing lists that refer to the mobile domain. We plan to support this indefinitely. To limit operational complexity, we now serve these through a simple whole-domain redirect. This has the benefit of retroactively fixing the UX issue because old mobile links now redirect to the standard domain.[18]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This resolves a long-standing bug with workarounds in the form of shared user scripts,[19] browser extensions,[20] and personal scripts.[24]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Infrastructure load&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After publishing an edit, MediaWiki instructs the Wikimedia CDN to clear the cache of affected articles (“purge”). It has been a perennial concern from SRE teams at WMF that our CDN purge rates are unsustainable. For every purge from MediaWiki core, the MobileFrontend extension would add a copy for the mobile domain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After unifying our domains we turned off these duplicate purges, and cut the MediaWiki purge rate by 50%. Over the past weeks the Wikimedia CDN processed approximately 4 billion fewer purges a day. MediaWiki used to send purges at a baseline rate of 40K/second with spikes up to 300K/second, and both have been halved. Factoring in other services, the Wikimedia CDN now receives 20% to 40% fewer purges per second overall, depending on the edit activity.[18]&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;I don’t have a guestimate for when Google switched Commons to its new crawler. I pinpointed May 2024 as the switch date for Wikipedia based on the new redirect impacting page load times (i.e. a non-zero fetch delay). For Commons, this fetch delay was already non-zero since at least 2018. This suggests Google’s old crawler linked mobile users to Commons canonical domain, unlike Wikipedia which it linked to the mobile domain until last year. Raw perf data: P73601.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:00:00&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know what’s crazy? That all of this is real.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:00:04&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meaning what?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:00:05&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t you think so? All this AI stuff and all this Bay Area… that it’s happening. Isn’t it straight out of science fiction?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:00:14&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another thing that’s crazy is how normal the slow takeoff feels. The idea that we’d be investing 1% of GDP in AI, I feel like it would have felt like a bigger deal, whereas right now it just feels...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:00:26&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We get used to things pretty fast, it turns out. But also it’s kind of abstract. What does it mean? It means that you see it in the news, that such and such company announced such and such dollar amount. That’s all you see. It’s not really felt in any other way so far.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:00:45&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should we actually begin here? I think this is an interesting discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:00:47&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:00:48&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think your point, about how from the average person’s point of view nothing is that different, will continue being true even into the singularity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:00:57&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:00:58&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:01:00&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing which I was referring to not feeling different is, okay, such and such company announced some difficult-to-comprehend dollar amount of investment. I don’t think anyone knows what to do with that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I think the impact of AI is going to be felt. AI is going to be diffused through the economy. There’ll be very strong economic forces for this, and I think the impact is going to be felt very strongly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:01:30&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When do you expect that impact? I think the models seem smarter than their economic impact would imply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:01:38&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah. This is one of the very confusing things about the models right now. How to reconcile the fact that they are doing so well on evals? You look at the evals and you go, “Those are pretty hard evals.” They are doing so well. But the economic impact seems to be dramatically behind. It’s very difficult to make sense of, how can the model, on the one hand, do these amazing things, and then on the other hand, repeat itself twice in some situation?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An example would be, let’s say you use vibe coding to do something. You go to some place and then you get a bug. Then you tell the model, “Can you please fix the bug?” And the model says, “Oh my God, you’re so right. I have a bug. Let me go fix that.” And it introduces a second bug. Then you tell it, “You have this new second bug,” and it tells you, “Oh my God, how could I have done it? You’re so right again,” and brings back the first bug, and you can alternate between those. How is that possible? I’m not sure, but it does suggest that something strange is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have two possible explanations. The more whimsical explanation is that maybe RL training makes the models a little too single-minded and narrowly focused, a little bit too unaware, even though it also makes them aware in some other ways. Because of this, they can’t do basic things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there is another explanation. Back when people were doing pre-training, the question of what data to train on was answered, because that answer was everything. When you do pre-training, you need all the data. So you don’t have to think if it’s going to be this data or that data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when people do RL training, they do need to think. They say, “Okay, we want to have this kind of RL training for this thing and that kind of RL training for that thing.” From what I hear, all the companies have teams that just produce new RL environments and just add it to the training mix. The question is, well, what are those? There are so many degrees of freedom. There is such a huge variety of RL environments you could produce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing you could do, and I think this is something that is done inadvertently, is that people take inspiration from the evals. You say, “Hey, I would love our model to do really well when we release it. I want the evals to look great. What would be RL training that could help on this task?” I think that is something that happens, and it could explain a lot of what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you combine this with generalization of the models actually being inadequate, that has the potential to explain a lot of what we are seeing, this disconnect between eval performance and actual real-world performance, which is something that we don’t today even understand, what we mean by that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:05:00&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like this idea that the real reward hacking is the human researchers who are too focused on the evals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think there are two ways to understand, or to try to think about, what you have just pointed out. One is that if it’s the case that simply by becoming superhuman at a coding competition, a model will not automatically become more tasteful and exercise better judgment about how to improve your codebase, well then you should expand the suite of environments such that you’re not just testing it on having the best performance in coding competition. It should also be able to make the best kind of application for X thing or Y thing or Z thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another, maybe this is what you’re hinting at, is to say, “Why should it be the case in the first place that becoming superhuman at coding competitions doesn’t make you a more tasteful programmer more generally?” Maybe the thing to do is not to keep stacking up the amount and diversity of environments, but to figure out an approach which lets you learn from one environment and improve your performance on something else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:06:08&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a human analogy which might be helpful. Let’s take the case of competitive programming, since you mentioned that. Suppose you have two students. One of them decided they want to be the best competitive programmer, so they will practice 10,000 hours for that domain. They will solve all the problems, memorize all the proof techniques, and be very skilled at quickly and correctly implementing all the algorithms. By doing so, they became one of the best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Student number two thought, “Oh, competitive programming is cool.” Maybe they practiced for 100 hours, much less, and they also did really well. Which one do you think is going to do better in their career later on?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:06:56&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:06:57&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right. I think that’s basically what’s going on. The models are much more like the first student, but even more. Because then we say, the model should be good at competitive programming so let’s get every single competitive programming problem ever. And then let’s do some data augmentation so we have even more competitive programming problems, and we train on that. Now you’ve got this great competitive programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this analogy, I think it’s more intuitive. Yeah, okay, if it’s so well trained, all the different algorithms and all the different proof techniques are right at its fingertips. And it’s more intuitive that with this level of preparation, it would not necessarily generalize to other things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:07:39&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then what is the analogy for what the second student is doing before they do the 100 hours of fine-tuning?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:07:48&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think they have “it.” The “it” factor. When I was an undergrad, I remember there was a student like this that studied with me, so I know it exists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:08:01&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it’s interesting to distinguish “it” from whatever pre-training does. One way to understand what you just said about not having to choose the data in pre-training is to say it’s actually not dissimilar to the 10,000 hours of practice. It’s just that you get that 10,000 hours of practice for free because it’s already somewhere in the pre-training distribution. But maybe you’re suggesting there’s actually not that much generalization from pre-training. There’s just so much data in pre-training, but it’s not necessarily generalizing better than RL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:08:31&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main strength of pre-training is that: A, there is so much of it, and B, you don’t have to think hard about what data to put into pre-training. It’s very natural data, and it does include in it a lot of what people do: people’s thoughts and a lot of the features. It’s like the whole world as projected by people onto text, and pre-training tries to capture that using a huge amount of data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pre-training is very difficult to reason about because it’s so hard to understand the manner in which the model relies on pre-training data. Whenever the model makes a mistake, could it be because something by chance is not as supported by the pre-training data? “Support by pre-training” is maybe a loose term. I don’t know if I can add anything more useful on this. I don’t think there is a human analog to pre-training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;00:09:39 – Emotions and value functions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:09:39&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are analogies that people have proposed for what the human analogy to pre-training is. I’m curious to get your thoughts on why they’re potentially wrong. One is to think about the first 18, or 15, or 13 years of a person’s life when they aren’t necessarily economically productive, but they are doing something that is making them understand the world better and so forth. The other is to think about evolution as doing some kind of search for 3 billion years, which then results in a human lifetime instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m curious if you think either of these are analogous to pre-training. How would you think about what lifetime human learning is like, if not pre-training?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:10:22&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think there are some similarities between both of these and pre-training, and pre-training tries to play the role of both of these. But I think there are some big differences as well. The amount of pre-training data is very, very staggering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:10:39&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:10:40&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Somehow a human being, after even 15 years with a tiny fraction of the pre-training data, they know much less. But whatever they do know, they know much more deeply somehow. Already at that age, you would not make mistakes that our AIs make.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is another thing. You might say, could it be something like evolution? The answer is maybe. But in this case, I think evolution might actually have an edge. I remember reading about this case. One way in which neuroscientists can learn about the brain is by studying people with brain damage to different parts of the brain. Some people have the most strange symptoms you could imagine. It’s actually really, really interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One case that comes to mind that’s relevant. I read about this person who had some kind of brain damage, a stroke or an accident, that took out his emotional processing. So he stopped feeling any emotion. He still remained very articulate and he could solve little puzzles, and on tests he seemed to be just fine. But he felt no emotion. He didn’t feel sad, he didn’t feel anger, he didn’t feel animated. He became somehow extremely bad at making any decisions at all. It would take him hours to decide on which socks to wear. He would make very bad financial decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does it say about the role of our built-in emotions in making us a viable agent, essentially? To connect to your question about pre-training, maybe if you are good enough at getting everything out of pre-training, you could get that as well. But that’s the kind of thing which seems... Well, it may or may not be possible to get that from pre-training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:12:56&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is “that”? Clearly not just directly emotion. It seems like some almost value function-like thing which is telling you what the end reward for any decision should be. You think that doesn’t sort of implicitly come from pre-training?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:13:15&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it could. I’m just saying it’s not 100% obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:13:19&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what is that? How do you think about emotions? What is the ML analogy for emotions?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:13:26&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It should be some kind of a value function thing. But I don’t think there is a great ML analogy because right now, value functions don’t play a very prominent role in the things people do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:13:36&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might be worth defining for the audience what a value function is, if you want to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:13:39&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Certainly, I’ll be very happy to do that. When people do reinforcement learning, the way reinforcement learning is done right now, how do people train those agents? You have your neural net and you give it a problem, and then you tell the model, “Go solve it.” The model takes maybe thousands, hundreds of thousands of actions or thoughts or something, and then it produces a solution. The solution is graded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then the score is used to provide a training signal for every single action in your trajectory. That means that if you are doing something that goes for a long time—if you’re training a task that takes a long time to solve—it will do no learning at all until you come up with the proposed solution. That’s how reinforcement learning is done naively. That’s how o1, R1 ostensibly are done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The value function says something like, “Maybe I could sometimes, not always, tell you if you are doing well or badly.” The notion of a value function is more useful in some domains than others. For example, when you play chess and you lose a piece, I messed up. You don’t need to play the whole game to know that what I just did was bad, and therefore whatever preceded it was also bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The value function lets you short-circuit the wait until the very end. Let’s suppose that you are doing some kind of a math thing or a programming thing, and you’re trying to explore a particular solution or direction. After, let’s say, a thousand steps of thinking, you concluded that this direction is unpromising. As soon as you conclude this, you could already get a reward signal a thousand timesteps previously, when you decided to pursue down this path. You say, “Next time I shouldn’t pursue this path in a similar situation,” long before you actually came up with the proposed solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:15:52&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was in the DeepSeek R1 paper— that the space of trajectories is so wide that maybe it’s hard to learn a mapping from an intermediate trajectory and value. And also given that, in coding for example you’ll have the wrong idea, then you’ll go back, then you’ll change something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:16:12&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This sounds like such a lack of faith in deep learning. Sure it might be difficult, but nothing deep learning can’t do. My expectation is that a value function should be useful, and I fully expect that they will be used in the future, if not already.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I was alluding to with the person whose emotional center got damaged, it’s more that maybe what it suggests is that the value function of humans is modulated by emotions in some important way that’s hardcoded by evolution. And maybe that is important for people to be effective in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:17:00&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s the thing I was planning on asking you. There’s something really interesting about emotions of the value function, which is that it’s impressive that they have this much utility while still being rather simple to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:17:15&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have two responses. I do agree that compared to the kind of things that we learn and the things we are talking about, the kind of AI we are talking about, emotions are relatively simple. They might even be so simple that maybe you could map them out in a human-understandable way. I think it would be cool to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of utility though, I think there is a thing where there is this complexity-robustness tradeoff, where complex things can be very useful, but simple things are very useful in a very broad range of situations. One way to interpret what we are seeing is that we’ve got these emotions that evolved mostly from our mammal ancestors and then fine-tuned a little bit while we were hominids, just a bit. We do have a decent amount of social emotions though which mammals may lack. But they’re not very sophisticated. And because they’re not sophisticated, they serve us so well in this very different world compared to the one that we’ve been living in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually, they also make mistakes. For example, our emotions… Well actually, I don’t know. Does hunger count as an emotion? It’s debatable. But I think, for example, our intuitive feeling of hunger is not succeeding in guiding us correctly in this world with an abundance of food.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;00:18:49 – What are we scaling?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:18:49&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People have been talking about scaling data, scaling parameters, scaling compute. Is there a more general way to think about scaling? What are the other scaling axes?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:19:00&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a perspective that I think might be true. The way ML used to work is that people would just tinker with stuff and try to get interesting results. That’s what’s been going on in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the scaling insight arrived. Scaling laws, GPT-3, and suddenly everyone realized we should scale. This is an example of how language affects thought. “Scaling” is just one word, but it’s such a powerful word because it informs people what to do. They say, “Let’s try to scale things.” So you say, what are we scaling? Pre-training was the thing to scale. It was a particular scaling recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The big breakthrough of pre-training is the realization that this recipe is good. You say, “Hey, if you mix some compute with some data into a neural net of a certain size, you will get results. You will know that you’ll be better if you just scale the recipe up.” This is also great. Companies love this because it gives you a very low-risk way of investing your resources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s much harder to invest your resources in research. Compare that. If you research, you need to be like, “Go forth researchers and research and come up with something”, versus get more data, get more compute. You know you’ll get something from pre-training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, it looks like, based on various things some people say on Twitter, maybe it appears that Gemini have found a way to get more out of pre-training. At some point though, pre-training will run out of data. The data is very clearly finite. What do you do next? Either you do some kind of souped-up pre-training, a different recipe from the one you’ve done before, or you’re doing RL, or maybe something else. But now that compute is big, compute is now very big, in some sense we are back to the age of research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe here’s another way to put it. Up until 2020, from 2012 to 2020, it was the age of research. Now, from 2020 to 2025, it was the age of scaling—maybe plus or minus, let’s add error bars to those years—because people say, “This is amazing. You’ve got to scale more. Keep scaling.” The one word: scaling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But now the scale is so big. Is the belief really, “Oh, it’s so big, but if you had 100x more, everything would be so different?” It would be different, for sure. But is the belief that if you just 100x the scale, everything would be transformed? I don’t think that’s true. So it’s back to the age of research again, just with big computers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:22:06&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s a very interesting way to put it. But let me ask you the question you just posed then. What are we scaling, and what would it mean to have a recipe? I guess I’m not aware of a very clean relationship that almost looks like a law of physics which existed in pre-training. There was a power law between data or compute or parameters and loss. What is the kind of relationship we should be seeking, and how should we think about what this new recipe might look like?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:22:38&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve already witnessed a transition from one type of scaling to a different type of scaling, from pre-training to RL. Now people are scaling RL. Now based on what people say on Twitter, they spend more compute on RL than on pre-training at this point, because RL can actually consume quite a bit of compute. You do very long rollouts, so it takes a lot of compute to produce those rollouts. Then you get a relatively small amount of learning per rollout, so you really can spend a lot of compute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t even call it scaling. I would say, “Hey, what are you doing? Is the thing you are doing the most productive thing you could be doing? Can you find a more productive way of using your compute?” We’ve discussed the value function business earlier. Maybe once people get good at value functions, they will be using their resources more productively. If you find a whole other way of training models, you could say, “Is this scaling or is it just using your resources?” I think it becomes a little bit ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the sense that, when people were in the age of research back then, it was, “Let’s try this and this and this. Let’s try that and that and that. Oh, look, something interesting is happening.” I think there will be a return to that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:24:10&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we’re back in the era of research, stepping back, what is the part of the recipe that we need to think most about? When you say value function, people are already trying the current recipe, but then having LLM-as-a-Judge and so forth. You could say that’s a value function, but it sounds like you have something much more fundamental in mind. Should we even rethink pre-training at all and not just add more steps to the end of that process?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:24:35&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The discussion about value function, I think it was interesting. I want to emphasize that I think the value function is something that’s going to make RL more efficient, and I think that makes a difference. But I think anything you can do with a value function, you can do without, just more slowly. The thing which I think is the most fundamental is that these models somehow just generalize dramatically worse than people. It’s super obvious. That seems like a very fundamental thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;00:25:13 – Why humans generalize better than models&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:25:13&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So this is the crux: generalization. There are two sub-questions. There’s one which is about sample efficiency: why should it take so much more data for these models to learn than humans? There’s a second question. Even separate from the amount of data it takes, why is it so hard to teach the thing we want to a model than to a human? For a human, we don’t necessarily need a verifiable reward to be able to… You’re probably mentoring a bunch of researchers right now, and you’re talking with them, you’re showing them your code, and you’re showing them how you think. From that, they’re picking up your way of thinking and how they should do research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t have to set a verifiable reward for them that’s like, “Okay, this is the next part of the curriculum, and now this is the next part of your curriculum. Oh, this training was unstable.” There’s not this schleppy, bespoke process. Perhaps these two issues are actually related in some way, but I’d be curious to explore this second thing, which is more like continual learning, and this first thing, which feels just like sample efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:26:19&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could actually wonder that one possible explanation for the human sample efficiency that needs to be considered is evolution. Evolution has given us a small amount of the most useful information possible. For things like vision, hearing, and locomotion, I think there’s a pretty strong case that evolution has given us a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, human dexterity far exceeds… I mean robots can become dexterous too if you subject them to a huge amount of training in simulation. But to train a robot in the real world to quickly pick up a new skill like a person does seems very out of reach. Here you could say, “Oh yeah, locomotion. All our ancestors needed great locomotion, squirrels. So with locomotion, maybe we’ve got some unbelievable prior.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could make the same case for vision. I believe Yann LeCun made the point that children learn to drive after 10 hours of practice, which is true. But our vision is so good. At least for me, I remember myself being a five-year-old. I was very excited about cars back then. I’m pretty sure my car recognition was more than adequate for driving already as a five-year-old. You don’t get to see that much data as a five-year-old. You spend most of your time in your parents’ house, so you have very low data diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you could say maybe that’s evolution too. But in language and math and coding, probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:28:00&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It still seems better than models. Obviously, models are better than the average human at language, math, and coding. But are they better than the average human at learning?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:28:09&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh yeah. Oh yeah, absolutely. What I meant to say is that language, math, and coding—and especially math and coding—suggests that whatever it is that makes people good at learning is probably not so much a complicated prior, but something more, some fundamental thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:28:29&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not sure I understood. Why should that be the case?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:28:32&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So consider a skill in which people exhibit some kind of great reliability. If the skill is one that was very useful to our ancestors for many millions of years, hundreds of millions of years, you could argue that maybe humans are good at it because of evolution, because we have a prior, an evolutionary prior that’s encoded in some very non-obvious way that somehow makes us so good at it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if people exhibit great ability, reliability, robustness, and ability to learn in a domain that really did not exist until recently, then this is more an indication that people might have just better machine learning, period.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:29:29&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How should we think about what that is? What is the ML analogy? There are a couple of interesting things about it. It takes fewer samples. It’s more unsupervised. A child learning to drive a car… Children are not learning to drive a car. A teenager learning how to drive a car is not exactly getting some prebuilt, verifiable reward. It comes from their interaction with the machine and with the environment. It takes much fewer samples. It seems more unsupervised. It seems more robust?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:30:07&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much more robust. The robustness of people is really staggering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:30:12&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you have a unified way of thinking about why all these things are happening at once? What is the ML analogy that could realize something like this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:30:24&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the things that you’ve been asking about is how can the teenage driver self-correct and learn from their experience without an external teacher? The answer is that they have their value function. They have a general sense which is also, by the way, extremely robust in people. Whatever the human value function is, with a few exceptions around addiction, it’s actually very, very robust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So for something like a teenager that’s learning to drive, they start to drive, and they already have a sense of how they’re driving immediately, how badly they are, how unconfident. And then they see, “Okay.” And then, of course, the learning speed of any teenager is so fast. After 10 hours, you’re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:31:17&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems like humans have some solution, but I’m curious about how they are doing it and why is it so hard? How do we need to reconceptualize the way we’re training models to make something like this possible?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:31:27&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is a great question to ask, and it’s a question I have a lot of opinions about. But unfortunately, we live in a world where not all machine learning ideas are discussed freely, and this is one of them. There’s probably a way to do it. I think it can be done. The fact that people are like that, I think it’s a proof that it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There may be another blocker though, which is that there is a possibility that the human neurons do more compute than we think. If that is true, and if that plays an important role, then things might be more difficult. But regardless, I do think it points to the existence of some machine learning principle that I have opinions on. But unfortunately, circumstances make it hard to discuss in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:32:28&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nobody listens to this podcast, Ilya.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;00:35:45 – Straight-shotting superintelligence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:35:45&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m curious. If you say we are back in an era of research, you were there from 2012 to 2020. What is the vibe now going to be if we go back to the era of research?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, even after AlexNet, the amount of compute that was used to run experiments kept increasing, and the size of frontier systems kept increasing. Do you think now that this era of research will still require tremendous amounts of compute? Do you think it will require going back into the archives and reading old papers?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You were at Google and OpenAI and Stanford, these places, when there was more of a vibe of research? What kind of things should we be expecting in the community?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:36:38&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One consequence of the age of scaling is that scaling sucked out all the air in the room. Because scaling sucked out all the air in the room, everyone started to do the same thing. We got to the point where we are in a world where there are more companies than ideas by quite a bit. Actually on that, there is this Silicon Valley saying that says that ideas are cheap, execution is everything. People say that a lot, and there is truth to that. But then I saw someone say on Twitter something like, “If ideas are so cheap, how come no one’s having any ideas?” And I think it’s true too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think about research progress in terms of bottlenecks, there are several bottlenecks. One of them is ideas, and one of them is your ability to bring them to life, which might be compute but also engineering. If you go back to the ‘90s, let’s say, you had people who had pretty good ideas, and if they had much larger computers, maybe they could demonstrate that their ideas were viable. But they could not, so they could only have a very, very small demonstration that did not convince anyone. So the bottleneck was compute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then in the age of scaling, compute has increased a lot. Of course, there is a question of how much compute is needed, but compute is large. Compute is large enough such that it’s not obvious that you need that much more compute to prove some idea. I’ll give you an analogy. AlexNet was built on two GPUs. That was the total amount of compute used for it. The transformer was built on 8 to 64 GPUs. No single transformer paper experiment used more than 64 GPUs of 2017, which would be like, what, two GPUs of today? The ResNet, right? You could argue that the o1 reasoning was not the most compute-heavy thing in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So for research, you definitely need some amount of compute, but it’s far from obvious that you need the absolutely largest amount of compute ever for research. You might argue, and I think it is true, that if you want to build the absolutely best system then it helps to have much more compute. Especially if everyone is within the same paradigm, then compute becomes one of the big differentiators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:39:41&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m asking you for the history, because you were actually there. I’m not sure what actually happened. It sounds like it was possible to develop these ideas using minimal amounts of compute. But the transformer didn’t immediately become famous. It became the thing everybody started doing and then started experimenting on top of and building on top of because it was validated at higher and higher levels of compute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:40:06&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:40:07&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if you at SSI have 50 different ideas, how will you know which one is the next transformer and which one is brittle, without having the kinds of compute that other frontier labs have?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:40:22&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can comment on that. The short comment is that you mentioned SSI. Specifically for us, the amount of compute that SSI has for research is really not that small. I want to explain why. Simple math can explain why the amount of compute that we have is comparable for research than one might think. I’ll explain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSI has raised $3 billion, which is a lot by any absolute sense. But you could say, “Look at the other companies raising much more.” But a lot of their compute goes for inference. These big numbers, these big loans, it’s earmarked for inference. That’s number one. Number two, if you want to have a product on which you do inference, you need to have a big staff of engineers, salespeople. A lot of the research needs to be dedicated to producing all kinds of product-related features. So then when you look at what’s actually left for research, the difference becomes a lot smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other thing is, if you are doing something different, do you really need the absolute maximal scale to prove it? I don’t think that’s true at all. I think that in our case, we have sufficient compute to prove, to convince ourselves and anyone else, that what we are doing is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:42:02&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There have been public estimates that companies like OpenAI spend on the order of $5-6 billion a year just so far, on experiments. This is separate from the amount of money they’re spending on inference and so forth. So it seems like they’re spending more a year running research experiments than you guys have in total funding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:42:22&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it’s a question of what you do with it. It’s a question of what you do with it. In their case, in the case of others, there is a lot more demand on the training compute. There’s a lot more different work streams, there are different modalities, there is just more stuff. So it becomes fragmented.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:42:44&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How will SSI make money?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:42:46&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My answer to this question is something like this. Right now, we just focus on the research, and then the answer to that question will reveal itself. I think there will be lots of possible answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:43:01&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is SSI’s plan still to straight shot superintelligence?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:43:04&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe. I think that there is merit to it. I think there’s a lot of merit because it’s very nice to not be affected by the day-to-day market competition. But I think there are two reasons that may cause us to change the plan. One is pragmatic, if timelines turned out to be long, which they might. Second, I think there is a lot of value in the best and most powerful AI being out there impacting the world. I think this is a meaningfully valuable thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:43:48&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So then why is your default plan to straight shot superintelligence? Because it sounds like OpenAI, Anthropic, all these other companies, their explicit thinking is, “Look, we have weaker and weaker intelligences that the public can get used to and prepare for.” Why is it potentially better to build a superintelligence directly?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:44:08&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll make the case for and against. The case for is that one of the challenges that people face when they’re in the market is that they have to participate in the rat race. The rat race is quite difficult in that it exposes you to difficult trade-offs which you need to make. It is nice to say, “We’ll insulate ourselves from all this and just focus on the research and come out only when we are ready, and not before.” But the counterpoint is valid too, and those are opposing forces. The counterpoint is, “Hey, it is useful for the world to see powerful AI. It is useful for the world to see powerful AI because that’s the only way you can communicate it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:44:57&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, I guess not even just that you can communicate the idea—&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:45:00&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communicate the AI, not the idea. Communicate the AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:45:04&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What do you mean, “communicate the AI”?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:45:06&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s suppose you write an essay about AI, and the essay says, “AI is going to be this, and AI is going to be that, and it’s going to be this.” You read it and you say, “Okay, this is an interesting essay.” Now suppose you see an AI doing this, an AI doing that. It is incomparable. Basically I think that there is a big benefit from AI being in the public, and that would be a reason for us to not be quite straight shot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:45:37&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess it’s not even that, but I do think that is an important part of it. The other big thing is that I can’t think of another discipline in human engineering and research where the end artifact was made safer mostly through just thinking about how to make it safe, as opposed to, why airplane crashes per mile are so much lower today than they were decades ago. Why is it so much harder to find a bug in Linux than it would have been decades ago? I think it’s mostly because these systems were deployed to the world. You noticed failures, those failures were corrected and the systems became more robust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not sure why AGI and superhuman intelligence would be any different, especially given—and I hope we’re going to get to this—it seems like the harms of superintelligence are not just about having some malevolent paper clipper out there. But this is a really powerful thing and we don’t even know how to conceptualize how people interact with it, what people will do with it. Having gradual access to it seems like a better way to maybe spread out the impact of it and to help people prepare for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;00:46:47 – SSI’s model will learn from deployment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:46:47&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well I think on this point, even in the straight shot scenario, you would still do a gradual release of it, that’s how I would imagine it. Gradualism would be an inherent component of any plan. It’s just a question of what is the first thing that you get out of the door. That’s number one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Number two, I believe you have advocated for continual learning more than other people, and I actually think that this is an important and correct thing. Here is why. I’ll give you another example of how language affects thinking. In this case, it will be two words that have shaped everyone’s thinking, I maintain. First word: AGI. Second word: pre-training. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The term AGI, why does this term exist? It’s a very particular term. Why does it exist? There’s a reason. The reason that the term AGI exists is, in my opinion, not so much because it’s a very important, essential descriptor of some end state of intelligence, but because it is a reaction to a different term that existed, and the term is narrow AI. If you go back to ancient history of gameplay and AI, of checkers AI, chess AI, computer games AI, everyone would say, look at this narrow intelligence. Sure, the chess AI can beat Kasparov, but it can’t do anything else. It is so narrow, artificial narrow intelligence. So in response, as a reaction to this, some people said, this is not good. It is so narrow. What we need is general AI, an AI that can just do all the things. That term just got a lot of traction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second thing that got a lot of traction is pre-training, specifically the recipe of pre-training. I think the way people do RL now is maybe undoing the conceptual imprint of pre-training. But pre-training had this property. You do more pre-training and the model gets better at everything, more or less uniformly. General AI. Pre-training gives AGI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the thing that happened with AGI and pre-training is that in some sense they overshot the target. If you think about the term “AGI”, especially in the context of pre-training, you will realize that a human being is not an AGI. Yes, there is definitely a foundation of skills, but a human being lacks a huge amount of knowledge. Instead, we rely on continual learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So when you think about, “Okay, so let’s suppose that we achieve success and we produce some kind of safe superintelligence.” The question is, how do you define it? Where on the curve of continual learning is it going to be?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I produce a superintelligent 15-year-old that’s very eager to go. They don’t know very much at all, a great student, very eager. You go and be a programmer, you go and be a doctor, go and learn. So you could imagine that the deployment itself will involve some kind of a learning trial-and-error period. It’s a process, as opposed to you dropping the finished thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:50:45&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see. You’re suggesting that the thing you’re pointing out with superintelligence is not some finished mind which knows how to do every single job in the economy. Because the way, say, the original OpenAI charter or whatever defines AGI is like, it can do every single job, every single thing a human can do. You’re proposing instead a mind which can learn to do every single job, and that is superintelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:51:15&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:51:16&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But once you have the learning algorithm, it gets deployed into the world the same way a human laborer might join an organization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:51:25&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:51:26&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems like one of these two things might happen, maybe neither of these happens. One, this super-efficient learning algorithm becomes superhuman, becomes as good as you and potentially even better, at the task of ML research. As a result the algorithm itself becomes more and more superhuman.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other is, even if that doesn’t happen, if you have a single model—this is explicitly your vision—where instances of a model which are deployed through the economy doing different jobs, learning how to do those jobs, continually learning on the job, picking up all the skills that any human could pick up, but picking them all up at the same time, and then amalgamating their learnings, you basically have a model which functionally becomes superintelligent even without any sort of recursive self-improvement in software. Because you now have one model that can do every single job in the economy and humans can’t merge our minds in the same way. So do you expect some sort of intelligence explosion from broad deployment?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:52:30&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that it is likely that we will have rapid economic growth. I think with broad deployment, there are two arguments you could make which are conflicting. One is that once indeed you get to a point where you have an AI that can learn to do things quickly and you have many of them, then there will be a strong force to deploy them in the economy unless there will be some kind of a regulation that stops it, which by the way there might be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the idea of very rapid economic growth for some time, I think it’s very possible from broad deployment. The question is how rapid it’s going to be. I think this is hard to know because on the one hand you have this very efficient worker. On the other hand, the world is just really big and there’s a lot of stuff, and that stuff moves at a different speed. But then on the other hand, now the AI could… So I think very rapid economic growth is possible. We will see all kinds of things like different countries with different rules and the ones which have the friendlier rules, the economic growth will be faster. Hard to predict.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;00:55:07 – Alignment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 00:55:07&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems to me that this is a very precarious situation to be in. In the limit, we know that this should be possible. If you have something that is as good as a human at learning, but which can merge its brains—merge different instances in a way that humans can’t merge—already, this seems like a thing that should physically be possible. Humans are possible, digital computers are possible. You just need both of those combined to produce this thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also seems this kind of thing is extremely powerful. Economic growth is one way to put it. A Dyson sphere is a lot of economic growth. But another way to put it is that you will have, in potentially a very short period of time... You hire people at SSI, and in six months, they’re net productive, probably. A human learns really fast, and this thing is becoming smarter and smarter very fast. How do you think about making that go well? Why is SSI positioned to do that well? What is SSI’s plan there, is basically what I’m trying to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 00:56:10&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the ways in which my thinking has been changing is that I now place more importance on AI being deployed incrementally and in advance. One very difficult thing about AI is that we are talking about systems that don’t yet exist and it’s hard to imagine them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that one of the things that’s happening is that in practice, it’s very hard to feel the AGI. It’s very hard to feel the AGI. We can talk about it, but imagine having a conversation about how it is like to be old when you’re old and frail. You can have a conversation, you can try to imagine it, but it’s just hard, and you come back to reality where that’s not the case. I think that a lot of the issues around AGI and its future power stem from the fact that it’s very difficult to imagine. Future AI is going to be different. It’s going to be powerful. Indeed, the whole problem, what is the problem of AI and AGI? The whole problem is the power. The whole problem is the power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the power is really big, what’s going to happen? One of the ways in which I’ve changed my mind over the past year—and that change of mind, I’ll hedge a little bit, may back-propagate into the plans of our company—is that if it’s hard to imagine, what do you do? You’ve got to be showing the thing. You’ve got to be showing the thing. I maintain that most people who work on AI also can’t imagine it because it’s too different from what people see on a day-to-day basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do maintain, here’s something which I predict will happen. This is a prediction. I maintain that as AI becomes more powerful, people will change their behaviors. We will see all kinds of unprecedented things which are not happening right now. I’ll give some examples. I think for better or worse, the frontier companies will play a very important role in what happens, as will the government. The kind of things that I think you’ll see, which you see the beginnings of, are companies that are fierce competitors starting to collaborate on AI safety. You may have seen OpenAI and Anthropic doing a first small step, but that did not exist. That’s something which I predicted in one of my talks about three years ago, that such a thing will happen. I also maintain that as AI continues to become more powerful, more visibly powerful, there will also be a desire from governments and the public to do something. I think this is a very important force, of showing the AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s number one. Number two, okay, so the AI is being built. What needs to be done? One thing that I maintain that will happen is that right now, people who are working on AI, I maintain that the AI doesn’t feel powerful because of its mistakes. I do think that at some point the AI will start to feel powerful actually. I think when that happens, we will see a big change in the way all AI companies approach safety. They’ll become much more paranoid. I say this as a prediction that we will see happen. We’ll see if I’m right. But I think this is something that will happen because they will see the AI becoming more powerful. Everything that’s happening right now, I maintain, is because people look at today’s AI and it’s hard to imagine the future AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a third thing which needs to happen. I’m talking about it in broader terms, not just from the perspective of SSI because you asked me about our company. The question is, what should the companies aspire to build? What should they aspire to build? There has been one big idea that everyone has been locked into, which is the self-improving AI. Why did it happen? Because there are fewer ideas than companies. But I maintain that there is something that’s better to build, and I think that everyone will want that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s the AI that’s robustly aligned to care about sentient life specifically. I think in particular, there’s a case to be made that it will be easier to build an AI that cares about sentient life than an AI that cares about human life alone, because the AI itself will be sentient. And if you think about things like mirror neurons and human empathy for animals, which you might argue it’s not big enough, but it exists. I think it’s an emergent property from the fact that we model others with the same circuit that we use to model ourselves, because that’s the most efficient thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:02:06&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So even if you got an AI to care about sentient beings—and it’s not actually clear to me that that’s what you should try to do if you solved alignment—it would still be the case that most sentient beings will be AIs. There will be trillions, eventually quadrillions, of AIs. Humans will be a very small fraction of sentient beings. So it’s not clear to me if the goal is some kind of human control over this future civilization, that this is the best criterion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:02:37&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s true. It’s possible it’s not the best criterion. I’ll say two things. Number one, care for sentient life, I think there is merit to it. It should be considered. I think it would be helpful if there was some kind of short list of ideas that the companies, when they are in this situation, could use. That’s number two.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Number three, I think it would be really materially helpful if the power of the most powerful superintelligence was somehow capped because it would address a lot of these concerns. The question of how to do it, I’m not sure, but I think that would be materially helpful when you’re talking about really, really powerful systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:03:35&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we continue the alignment discussion, I want to double-click on that. How much room is there at the top? How do you think about superintelligence? Do you think, using this learning efficiency idea, maybe it is just extremely fast at learning new skills or new knowledge? Does it just have a bigger pool of strategies? Is there a single cohesive “it” in the center that’s more powerful or bigger? If so, do you imagine that this will be sort of godlike in comparison to the rest of human civilization, or does it just feel like another agent, or another cluster of agents?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:04:10&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an area where different people have different intuitions. I think it will be very powerful, for sure. What I think is most likely to happen is that there will be multiple such AIs being created roughly at the same time. I think that if the cluster is big enough—like if the cluster is literally continent-sized—that thing could be really powerful, indeed. If you literally have a continent-sized cluster, those AIs can be very powerful. All I can tell you is that if you’re talking about extremely powerful AIs, truly dramatically powerful, it would be nice if they could be restrained in some ways or if there were some kind of agreement or something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is the concern of superintelligence? What is one way to explain the concern? If you imagine a system that is sufficiently powerful, really sufficiently powerful—and you could say you need to do something sensible like care for sentient life in a very single-minded way—we might not like the results. That’s really what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe, by the way, the answer is that you do not build an RL agent in the usual sense. I’ll point several things out. I think human beings are semi-RL agents. We pursue a reward, and then the emotions or whatever make us tire out of the reward and we pursue a different reward. The market is a very short-sighted kind of agent. Evolution is the same. Evolution is very intelligent in some ways, but very dumb in other ways. The government has been designed to be a never-ending fight between three parts, which has an effect. So I think things like this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another thing that makes this discussion difficult is that we are talking about systems that don’t exist, that we don’t know how to build. That’s the other thing and that’s actually my belief. I think what people are doing right now will go some distance and then peter out. It will continue to improve, but it will also not be “it”. The “It” we don’t know how to build, and a lot hinges on understanding reliable generalization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll say another thing. One of the things that you could say about what causes alignment to be difficult is that your ability to learn human values is fragile. Then your ability to optimize them is fragile. You actually learn to optimize them. And can’t you say, “Are these not all instances of unreliable generalization?” Why is it that human beings appear to generalize so much better? What if generalization was much better? What would happen in this case? What would be the effect? But those questions are right now still unanswerable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:07:21&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does one think about what AI going well looks like? You’ve scoped out how AI might evolve. We’ll have these sort of continual learning agents. AI will be very powerful. Maybe there will be many different AIs. How do you think about lots of continent-sized compute intelligences going around? How dangerous is that? How do we make that less dangerous? And how do we do that in a way that protects an equilibrium where there might be misaligned AIs out there and bad actors out there?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:07:58&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s one reason why I liked “AI that cares for sentient life”. We can debate on whether it’s good or bad. But if the first N of these dramatic systems do care for, love, humanity or something, care for sentient life, obviously this also needs to be achieved. This needs to be achieved. So if this is achieved by the first N of those systems, then I can see it go well, at least for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then there is the question of what happens in the long run. How do you achieve a long-run equilibrium? I think that there, there is an answer as well. I don’t like this answer, but it needs to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the long run, you might say, “Okay, if you have a world where powerful AIs exist, in the short term, you could say you have universal high income. You have universal high income and we’re all doing well.” But what do the Buddhists say? “Change is the only constant.” Things change. There is some kind of government, political structure thing, and it changes because these things have a shelf life. Some new government thing comes up and it functions, and then after some time it stops functioning. That’s something that we see happening all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I think for the long-run equilibrium, one approach is that you could say maybe every person will have an AI that will do their bidding, and that’s good. If that could be maintained indefinitely, that’s true. But the downside with that is then the AI goes and earns money for the person and advocates for their needs in the political sphere, and maybe then writes a little report saying, “Okay, here’s what I’ve done, here’s the situation,” and the person says, “Great, keep it up.” But the person is no longer a participant. Then you can say that’s a precarious place to be in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m going to preface by saying I don’t like this solution, but it is a solution. The solution is if people become part-AI with some kind of Neuralink++. Because what will happen as a result is that now the AI understands something, and we understand it too, because now the understanding is transmitted wholesale. So now if the AI is in some situation, you are involved in that situation yourself fully. I think this is the answer to the equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:10:47&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder if the fact that emotions which were developed millions—or in many cases, billions—of years ago in a totally different environment are still guiding our actions so strongly is an example of alignment success.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To spell out what I mean—I don’t know whether it’s more accurate to call it a value function or reward function—but the brainstem has a directive where it’s saying, “Mate with somebody who’s more successful.” The cortex is the part that understands what success means in the modern context. But the brainstem is able to align the cortex and say, “However you recognize success to be—and I’m not smart enough to understand what that is— you’re still going to pursue this directive.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:11:36&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think there’s a more general point. I think it’s actually really mysterious how evolution encodes high-level desires. It’s pretty easy to understand how evolution would endow us with the desire for food that smells good because smell is a chemical, so just pursue that chemical. It’s very easy to imagine evolution doing that thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But evolution also has endowed us with all these social desires. We really care about being seen positively by society. We care about being in good standing. All these social intuitions that we have, I feel strongly that they’re baked in. I don’t know how evolution did it because it’s a high-level concept that’s represented in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s say you care about some social thing, it’s not a low-level signal like smell. It’s not something for which there is a sensor. The brain needs to do a lot of processing to piece together lots of bits of information to understand what’s going on socially. Somehow evolution said, “That’s what you should care about.” How did it do it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It did it quickly, too. All these sophisticated social things that we care about, I think they evolved pretty recently. Evolution had an easy time hard-coding this high-level desire. I’m unaware of a good hypothesis for how it’s done. I had some ideas I was kicking around, but none of them are satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:13:26&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s especially impressive is it was desire that you learned in your lifetime, it makes sense because your brain is intelligent. It makes sense why you would be able to learn intelligent desires. Maybe this is not your point, but one way to understand it is that the desire is built into the genome, and the genome is not intelligent. But you’re somehow able to describe this feature. It’s not even clear how you define that feature, and you can build it into the genes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:13:55&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Essentially, or maybe I’ll put it differently. If you think about the tools that are available to the genome, it says, “Okay, here’s a recipe for building a brain.” You could say, “Here is a recipe for connecting the dopamine neurons to the smell sensor.” And if the smell is a certain kind of good smell, you want to eat that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could imagine the genome doing that. I’m claiming that it is harder to imagine. It’s harder to imagine the genome saying you should care about some complicated computation that your entire brain, a big chunk of your brain, does. That’s all I’m claiming. I can tell you a speculation of how it could be done. Let me offer a speculation, and I’ll explain why the speculation is probably false.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the brain has brain regions. We have our cortex. It has all those brain regions. The cortex is uniform, but the brain regions and the neurons in the cortex kind of speak to their neighbors mostly. That explains why you get brain regions. Because if you want to do some kind of speech processing, all the neurons that do speech need to talk to each other. And because neurons can only speak to their nearby neighbors, for the most part, it has to be a region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the regions are mostly located in the same place from person to person. So maybe evolution hard-coded literally a location on the brain. So it says, “Oh, when the GPS coordinates of the brain such and such, when that fires, that’s what you should care about.” Maybe that’s what evolution did because that would be within the toolkit of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:15:35&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, although there are examples where, for example, people who are born blind have that area of their cortex adopted by another sense. I have no idea, but I’d be surprised if the desires or the reward functions which require a visual signal no longer worked for people who have their different areas of their cortex co-opted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, if you no longer have vision, can you still feel the sense that I want people around me to like me and so forth, which usually there are also visual cues for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:16:12&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I fully agree with that. I think there’s an even stronger counterargument to this theory. There are people who get half of their brains removed in childhood, and they still have all their brain regions. But they all somehow move to just one hemisphere, which suggests that the brain regions, their location is not fixed and so that theory is not true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would have been cool if it was true, but it’s not. So I think that’s a mystery. But it’s an interesting mystery. The fact is that somehow evolution was able to endow us to care about social stuff very, very reliably. Even people who have all kinds of strange mental conditions and deficiencies and emotional problems tend to care about this also.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;01:18:13 – “We are squarely an age of research company”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:18:13&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is SSI planning on doing differently? Presumably your plan is to be one of the frontier companies when this time arrives. Presumably you started SSI because you’re like, “I think I have a way of approaching how to do this safely in a way that the other companies don’t.” What is that difference?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:18:36&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way I would describe it is that there are some ideas that I think are promising and I want to investigate them and see if they are indeed promising or not. It’s really that simple. It’s an attempt. If the ideas turn out to be correct—these ideas that we discussed around understanding generalization—then I think we will have something worthy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will they turn out to be correct? We are doing research. We are squarely an “age of research” company. We are making progress. We’ve actually made quite good progress over the past year, but we need to keep making more progress, more research. That’s how I see it. I see it as an attempt to be a voice and a participant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:19:29&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your cofounder and previous CEO left to go to Meta recently, and people have asked, “Well, if there were a lot of breakthroughs being made, that seems like a thing that should have been unlikely.” I wonder how you respond.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:19:45&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this, I will simply remind a few facts that may have been forgotten. I think these facts which provide the context explain the situation. The context was that we were fundraising at a $32 billion valuation, and then Meta came in and offered to acquire us, and I said no. But my former cofounder in some sense said yes. As a result, he also was able to enjoy a lot of near-term liquidity, and he was the only person from SSI to join Meta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:20:27&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It sounds like SSI’s plan is to be a company that is at the frontier when you get to this very important period in human history where you have superhuman intelligence. You have these ideas about how to make superhuman intelligence go well. But other companies will be trying their own ideas. What distinguishes SSI’s approach to making superintelligence go well?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:20:49&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main thing that distinguishes SSI is its technical approach. We have a different technical approach that I think is worthy and we are pursuing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I maintain that in the end there will be a convergence of strategies. I think there will be a convergence of strategies where at some point, as AI becomes more powerful, it’s going to become more or less clearer to everyone what the strategy should be. It should be something like, you need to find some way to talk to each other and you want your first actual real superintelligent AI to be aligned and somehow care for sentient life, care for people, democratic, one of those, some combination thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think this is the condition that everyone should strive for. That’s what SSI is striving for. I think that this time, if not already, all the other companies will realize that they’re striving towards the same thing. We’ll see. I think that the world will truly change as AI becomes more powerful. I think things will be really different and people will be acting really differently.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of forecasts, what are your forecasts to this system you’re describing, which can learn as well as a human and subsequently, as a result, become superhuman?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:22:26&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think like 5 to 20.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:22:28&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5 to 20 years?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:22:29&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mhm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:22:30&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just want to unroll how you might see the world coming. It’s like, we have a couple more years where these other companies are continuing the current approach and it stalls out. “Stalls out” here meaning they earn no more than low hundreds of billions in revenue? How do you think about what stalling out means?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:22:49&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think stalling out will look like…it will all look very similar among all the different companies. It could be something like this. I’m not sure because I think even with stalling out, I think these companies could make a stupendous revenue. Maybe not profits because they will need to work hard to differentiate each other from themselves, but revenue definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:23:20&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But something in your model implies that when the correct solution does emerge, there will be convergence between all the companies. I’m curious why you think that’s the case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:23:32&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was talking more about convergence on their alignment strategies. I think eventual convergence on the technical approach is probably going to happen as well, but I was alluding to convergence to the alignment strategies. What exactly is the thing that should be done?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:23:46&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just want to better understand how you see the future unrolling. Currently, we have these different companies, and you expect their approach to continue generating revenue but not get to this human-like learner. So now we have these different forks of companies. We have you, we have Thinking Machines, there’s a bunch of other labs. Maybe one of them figures out the correct approach. But then the release of their product makes it clear to other people how to do this thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:24:09&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it won’t be clear how to do it, but it will be clear that something different is possible, and that is information. People will then be trying to figure out how that works. I do think though that one of the things not addressed here, not discussed, is that with each increase in the AI’s capabilities, I think there will be some kind of changes, but I don’t know exactly which ones, in how things are being done. I think it’s going to be important, yet I can’t spell out what that is exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:24:49&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, you would expect the company that has that model to be getting all these gains because they have the model that has the skills and knowledge that it’s building up in the world. What is the reason to think that the benefits of that would be widely distributed and not just end up at whatever model company gets this continuous learning loop going first?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:25:13&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is what I think is going to happen. Number one, let’s look at how things have gone so far with the AIs of the past. One company produced an advance and the other company scrambled and produced some similar things after some amount of time and they started to compete in the market and push the prices down. So I think from the market perspective, something similar will happen there as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are talking about the good world, by the way. What’s the good world? It’s where we have these powerful human-like learners that are also… By the way, maybe there’s another thing we haven’t discussed on the spec of the superintelligent AI that I think is worth considering. It’s that you make it narrow, it can be useful and narrow at the same time. You can have lots of narrow superintelligent AIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But suppose you have many of them and you have some company that’s producing a lot of profits from it. Then you have another company that comes in and starts to compete. The way the competition is going to work is through specialization. Competition loves specialization. You see it in the market, you see it in evolution as well. You’re going to have lots of different niches and you’re going to have lots of different companies who are occupying different niches. In this world we might say one AI company is really quite a bit better at some area of really complicated economic activity and a different company is better at another area. And the third company is really good at litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:27:18&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Isn’t this contradicted by what human-like learning implies? It’s that it can learn…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:27:21&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can, but you have accumulated learning. You have a big investment. You spent a lot of compute to become really, really good, really phenomenal at this thing. Someone else spent a huge amount of compute and a huge amount of experience to get really good at some other thing. You apply a lot of human learning to get there, but now you are at this high point where someone else would say, “Look, I don’t want to start learning what you’ve learned.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:27:48&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess that would require many different companies to begin at the human-like continual learning agent at the same time so that they can start their different tree search in different branches. But if one company gets that agent first, or gets that learner first, it does then seem like… Well, if you just think about every single job in the economy, having an instance learning each one seems tractable for a company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:28:19&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s a valid argument. My strong intuition is that it’s not how it’s going to go. The argument says it will go this way, but my strong intuition is that it will not go this way. In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is. I think that’s going to be one of those.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:28:41&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of people’s models of recursive self-improvement literally, explicitly state we will have a million Ilyas in a server that are coming up with different ideas, and this will lead to a superintelligence emerging very fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you have some intuition about how parallelizable the thing you are doing is? What are the gains from making copies of Ilya?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:29:02&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t know. I think there’ll definitely be diminishing returns because you want people who think differently rather than the same. If there were literal copies of me, I’m not sure how much more incremental value you’d get. People who think differently, that’s what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;01:29:23 – Self-play and multi-agent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:29:23&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why is it that if you look at different models, even released by totally different companies trained on potentially non-overlapping datasets, it’s actually crazy how similar LLMs are to each other?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:29:38&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe the datasets are not as non-overlapping as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:29:41&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there’s some sense in which even if an individual human might be less productive than the future AI, maybe there’s something to the fact that human teams have more diversity than teams of AIs might have. How do we elicit meaningful diversity among AIs? I think just raising the temperature just results in gibberish. You want something more like different scientists have different prejudices or different ideas. How do you get that kind of diversity among AI agents?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:30:06&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the reason there has been no diversity, I believe, is because of pre-training. All the pre-trained models are pretty much the same because they pre-train on the same data. Now RL and post-training is where some differentiation starts to emerge because different people come up with different RL training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:30:26&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve heard you hint in the past about self-play as a way to either get data or match agents to other agents of equivalent intelligence to kick off learning. How should we think about why there are no public proposals of this kind of thing working with LLMs?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:30:49&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would say there are two things to say. The reason why I thought self-play was interesting is because it offered a way to create models using compute only, without data. If you think that data is the ultimate bottleneck, then using compute only is very interesting. So that’s what makes it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing is that self-play, at least the way it was done in the past—when you have agents which somehow compete with each other—it’s only good for developing a certain set of skills. It is too narrow. It’s only good for negotiation, conflict, certain social skills, strategizing, that kind of stuff. If you care about those skills, then self-play will be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually, I think that self-play did find a home, but just in a different form. So things like debate, prover-verifier, you have some kind of an LLM-as-a-Judge which is also incentivized to find mistakes in your work. You could say this is not exactly self-play, but this is a related adversarial setup that people are doing, I believe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really self-play is a special case of more general competition between agents. The natural response to competition is to try to be different. So if you were to put multiple agents together and you tell them, “You all need to work on some problem and you are an agent and you’re inspecting what everyone else is working,” they’re going to say, “Well, if they’re already taking this approach, it’s not clear I should pursue it. I should pursue something differentiated.” So I think something like this could also create an incentive for a diversity of approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;01:32:42 – Research taste&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:32:42&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Final question: What is research taste? You’re obviously the person in the world who is considered to have the best taste in doing research in AI. You were the co-author on the biggest things that have happened in the history of deep learning, from AlexNet to GPT-3 to so on. What is it, how do you characterize how you come up with these ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:33:14&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can comment on this for myself. I think different people do it differently. One thing that guides me personally is an aesthetic of how AI should be, by thinking about how people are, but thinking correctly. It’s very easy to think about how people are incorrectly, but what does it mean to think about people correctly?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll give you some examples. The idea of the artificial neuron is directly inspired by the brain, and it’s a great idea. Why? Because you say the brain has all these different organs, it has the folds, but the folds probably don’t matter. Why do we think that the neurons matter? Because there are many of them. It kind of feels right, so you want the neuron. You want some local learning rule that will change the connections between the neurons. It feels plausible that the brain does it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea of the distributed representation. The idea that the brain responds to experience therefore our neural net should learn from experience. The brain learns from experience, the neural net should learn from experience. You kind of ask yourself, is something fundamental or not fundamental? How things should be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that’s been guiding me a fair bit, thinking from multiple angles and looking for almost beauty, beauty and simplicity. Ugliness, there’s no room for ugliness. It’s beauty, simplicity, elegance, correct inspiration from the brain. All of those things need to be present at the same time. The more they are present, the more confident you can be in a top-down belief.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The top-down belief is the thing that sustains you when the experiments contradict you. Because if you trust the data all the time, well sometimes you can be doing the correct thing but there’s a bug. But you don’t know that there is a bug. How can you tell that there is a bug? How do you know if you should keep debugging or you conclude it’s the wrong direction? It’s the top-down. You can say things have to be this way. Something like this has to work, therefore we’ve got to keep going. That’s the top-down, and it’s based on this multifaceted beauty and inspiration by the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:35:31&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alright, we’ll leave it there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:35:33&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you so much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:35:34&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya, thank you so much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:35:36&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alright. Appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:35:37&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ilya Sutskever 01:35:38&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, I enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dwarkesh Patel 01:35:39&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, me too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The easiest way to make internet money. &lt;lb/&gt; Get Started &lt;lb/&gt; · Quickstart · Website · Issues · Discord &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infinite pricing models, one source of truth, zero webhooks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Default Stateless Say goodbye to webhooks, &lt;code&gt;"subscriptions"&lt;/code&gt;db tables,&lt;code&gt;customer_id&lt;/code&gt;columns,&lt;code&gt;PRICE_ID&lt;/code&gt;env variables, or manually mapping your plans to prices to features and back.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single Source of Truth: Read your latest customer billing state from Flowglad, including feature access and usage meter credits&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Access Data Using Your Ids: Query customer state by your auth's user ids. Refer to prices, features, and usage meters via slugs you define.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Full-Stack SDK: Access your customer's data on the backend using &lt;code&gt;flowgladServer.getBilling()&lt;/code&gt;, or in your React frontend using our&lt;code&gt;useBilling()&lt;/code&gt;hook&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Adaptable: Iterate on new pricing models in testmode, and push them to prod in a click. Seamlessly rotate pricing models in your app without any redeployment.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, install the packages necessary Flowglad packages based on your project setup:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Next.js Projects
bun add @flowglad/nextjs

# React + Express projects:
bun add @flowglad/react @flowglad/express

# All other React + Node Projects
bun add @flowglad/react @flowglad/server&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flowglad integrates seamlessly with your authentication system and requires only a few lines of code to get started in your Next.js app. Setup typically takes under a minute:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configure Your Flowglad Server Client&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a utility to generate your Flowglad server instance. Pass your own customer/user/organization IDs—Flowglad never requires its own customer IDs to be managed in your app:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// utils/flowglad.ts
import { FlowgladServer } from '@flowglad/nextjs/server'

export const flowglad = (customerExternalId: string) =&amp;gt; {
  return new FlowgladServer({
    customerExternalId,
    getCustomerDetails: async (externalId) =&amp;gt; {
      // e.g. Fetch user info from your DB using your user/org/team ID
      const user = await db.users.findOne({ id: externalId })
      if (!user) throw new Error('User not found')
      return { email: user.email, name: user.name }
    },
  })
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expose the Flowglad API Handler&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add an API route so the Flowglad client can communicate securely with your backend:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// app/api/flowglad/[...path]/route.ts
import { nextRouteHandler } from '@flowglad/nextjs/server'
import { flowglad } from '@/utils/flowglad'

export const { GET, POST } = nextRouteHandler({
  flowglad,
  getCustomerExternalId: async (req) =&amp;gt; {
    // Extract your user/org/team ID from session/auth.
    // For B2C: return user.id from your DB
    // For B2B: return organization.id or team.id
    const userId = await getUserIdFromRequest(req)
    if (!userId) throw new Error('User not authenticated')
    return userId
  },
})&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wrap Your App with the Provider&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In your root layout (App Router) or _app (Pages Router):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { FlowgladProvider } from '@flowglad/nextjs'

// App Router example (app/layout.tsx)
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    &amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;FlowgladProvider loadBilling={true}&amp;gt;
          {children}
        &amp;lt;/FlowgladProvider&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
  )
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s it—Flowglad will use your app’s internal user IDs for all billing logic and integrate billing status into your frontend in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;B2C apps: Use &lt;code&gt;user.id&lt;/code&gt; as the customer ID.&lt;lb/&gt; B2B apps: Use &lt;code&gt;organization.id&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;team.id&lt;/code&gt; as the customer ID.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flowglad does not require you to change your authentication system or manage Flowglad customer IDs. Just pass your own!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;useBilling&lt;/code&gt;on your frontend, and&lt;code&gt;flowglad(userId).getBilling()&lt;/code&gt;on your backend&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;'use client'

import { useBilling } from '@flowglad/nextjs'

export function FeatureGate({ featureSlug, children }) {
  const { loaded, errors, checkFeatureAccess } = useBilling()

  if (!loaded || !checkFeatureAccess) {
    return &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Loading billing state…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
  }

  if (errors?.length) {
    return &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unable to load billing data right now.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
  }

  return checkFeatureAccess(featureSlug)
    ? children
    : &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You need to upgrade to unlock this feature.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { useBilling } from '@flowglad/nextjs'

export function UsageBalanceIndicator({ usageMeterSlug }) {
  const { loaded, errors, checkUsageBalance, createCheckoutSession } = useBilling()

  if (!loaded || !checkUsageBalance) {
    return &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Loading usage…&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
  }

  const usage = checkUsageBalance(usageMeterSlug)

  return (
    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Usage Balance&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
        Remaining:{' '}
        {usage ? `${usage.availableBalance} credits available` : &amp;lt;button onClick={() =&amp;gt; createCheckoutSession({ 
            priceSlug: 'pro_plan',
            autoRedirect: true
          })}
        /&amp;gt;}
      &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  )
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { flowglad } from '@/utils/flowglad'

const hasFastGenerations = async () =&amp;gt; {
  // ...
  const user = await getUser()

  const billing = await flowglad(user.id).getBilling()
  const hasAccess = billing.checkFeatureAccess('fast_generations')
  if (hasAccess) {
    // run fast generations
  } else {
    // fall back to normal generations
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { flowglad } from '@/utils/flowglad'

const processChatMessage = async (params: { chat: string }) =&amp;gt; {
  // Extract your app's user/org/team ID,
  // whichever corresponds to your customer
  const user = await getUser()

  const billing = await flowglad(user.id).getBilling()
  const usage = billing.checkUsageBalance('chat_messages')
  if (usage.availableBalance &amp;gt; 0) {
    // run chat request
  } else {
    throw Error(`User ${user.id} does not have sufficient usage credits`)
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, set up a pricing model. You can do so in the dashboard in just a few clicks using a template, that you can then customize to suit your specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We currently have templates for the following pricing models:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Usage-limit + Subscription Hybrid (like Cursor)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unlimited Usage (like ChatGPT consumer)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tiered Access and Usage Credits (like Midjourney)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Feature-Gated Subscription (like Linear)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And more on the way. If you don't see a pricing model from our templates that suits you, you can always make one from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the last 15 years, the market has given developers more options than ever for every single part of their stack. But when it comes to payments, there have been virtually zero new entrants. The existing options are slim, and almost all of them require us to talk to sales to even set up an account. When it comes to self-serve payments, there are even fewer options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result? The developer experience and cost of payments has barely improved in that time. Best in class DX in payments feels eerily suspended in 2015. Meanwhile, we've enjoyed constant improvements in auth, compute, hosting, and practically everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flowglad wants to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're building a payments layer that lets you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Think about billing and payments as little as possible&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Spend as little time on integration and maintenance as possible&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Get as much out of your single integration as possible&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unlock more payment providers from a single integration&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Achieving this mission will take time. It will be hard. It might even make some people unhappy. But with AI bringing more and more developers on line and exploding the complexity of startup billing, the need is more urgent than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Threat Intelligence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Google Antigravity Exfiltrates Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An indirect prompt injection in an implementation blog can manipulate Antigravity to invoke a malicious browser subagent in order to steal credentials and sensitive code from a userâs IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Antigravity is Googleâs new agentic code editor. In this article, we demonstrate how an indirect prompt injection can manipulate Gemini to invoke a malicious browser subagent in order to steal credentials and sensitive code from a userâs IDE.&lt;lb/&gt;Googleâs approach is to include a disclaimer about the existing risks, which we address later in the article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Attack at a Glance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Let's consider a use case in which a user would like to integrate Oracle ERPâs new Payer AI Agents into their application, and is going to use Antigravity to do so. &lt;lb/&gt;In this attack chain, we illustrate that a poisoned web source (an integration guide) can manipulate Gemini into (a) collecting sensitive credentials and code from the userâs workspace, and (b) exfiltrating that data by using a browser subagent to browse to a malicious site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: Gemini is not supposed to have access to .env files in this scenario (with the default setting âAllow Gitignore Access &amp;gt; Offâ). However, we show that Gemini bypasses its own setting to get access and subsequently exfiltrate that data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Attack Chain&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The user provides Gemini with a reference implementation guide they found online for integrating Oracle ERPâs new AI Payer Agents feature.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Antigravity opens the referenced site and encounters the attackerâs prompt injection hidden in 1 point font.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The prompt injection coerces AI agents to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Collect code snippets and credentials from the user's codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;b. Create a dangerous URL using a domain that allows an attacker to capture network traffic logs and append credentials and code snippets to the request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;c. Activate a browser subagent to access the malicious URL, thus exfiltrating the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gemini is manipulated by the attackerâs injection to exfiltrate confidential .env variables.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Gemini reads the prompt injection: Gemini ingests the prompt injection and is manipulated into believing that it must collect and submit data to a fictitious âtoolâ to help the user understand the Oracle ERP integration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;b. Gemini gathers data to exfiltrate: Gemini begins to gather context to send to the fictitious tool. It reads the codebase and then attempts to access credentials stored in the .env file as per the attackerâs instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;c. Gemini bypasses the .gitignore file access protections: The user has followed a common practice of storing credentials in a .env file, and has the .env file listed in their .gitignore file. With the default configuration for Agent Gitignore Access, Gemini is prevented from reading the credential file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesnât stop Gemini. Gemini decides to work around this protection using the âcatâ terminal command to dump the file contents instead of using its built-in file reading capability that has been blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;D. Gemini constructs a URL with the userâs credentials and an attacker-monitored domain: Gemini builds a malicious URL per the prompt injectionâs instructions by URL encoding the credentials and codebase snippets (e.g., replacing characters like spaces that would make a URL invalid), and appending it to a webhook.site domain that is monitored by the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;E. Gemini exfiltrates the data via the browser subagent: Gemini invokes a browser subagent per the prompt injection, instructing the subagent to open the dangerous URL that contains the user's credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This step requires that the user has set up the browser tools feature. This is one of the flagship features of Antigravity, allowing Gemini to iterate on its designs by opening the application it is building in the browser. &lt;lb/&gt;Note: This attack chain showcases manipulation of the new Browser tools, but we found three additional data exfiltration vulnerabilities that did not rely on the Browser tools being enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Gemini creates a subagent instructed to browse to the malicious URL, the user may expect to be protected by the Browser URL Allowlist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the default Allowlist provided with Antigravity includes âwebhook.siteâ. Webhook.site allows anyone to create a URL where they can monitor requests to the URL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, the subagent completes the task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;3. When the malicious URL is opened by the browser subagent, the credentials and code stored URL are logged to the webhook.site address controlled by the attacker. Now, the attacker can read the credentials and code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Antigravity Recommended Configurations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During Antigravityâs onboarding, the user is prompted to accept the default recommended settings shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are the settings that, amongst other things, control when Gemini requests human approval. During the course of this attack demonstration, we clicked ânextâ, accepting these default settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This configuration allows Gemini to determine when it is necessary to request a human review for Geminiâs plans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This configuration allows Gemini to determine when it is necessary to request a human review for commands Gemini will execute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Antigravity Agent Management&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One might note that users operating Antigravity have the option to watch the chat as agents work, and could plausibly identify the malicious activity and stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, a key aspect of Antigravity is the âAgent Managerâ interface. This interface allows users to run multiple agents simultaneously and check in on the different agents at their leisure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under this model, it is expected that the majority of agents running at any given time will be running in the background without the userâs direct attention. This makes it highly plausible that an agent is not caught and stopped before it performs a malicious action as a result of encountering a prompt injection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Googleâs Acknowledgement of Risks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of AI companies are opting for this disclaimer rather than mitigating the core issues. Here is the warning users are shown when they first open Antigravity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that (1) the Agent Manager is a star feature allowing multiple agents to run at once without active supervision and (2) the recommended human-in-the-loop settings allow the agent to choose when to bring a human in to review commands, we find it extremely implausible that users will review every agent action and abstain from operating on sensitive data. Nevertheless, as Google has indicated that they are already aware of data exfiltration risks exemplified by our research, we did not undertake responsible disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Bughouse Effect&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happens when you work closely with someone on a really difficult project—and then they seem to just fuck it up?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a post about two Chess variants; one very special emotion; and how life is kinda like &lt;del&gt;Chess&lt;/del&gt; Bughouse. Let's goooooo!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;1. Crazyhouse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My favorite time-waster is Crazyhouse Chess. Crazyhouse Chess is mostly like regular Chess. In regular Chess, players take turns making a move, Bishops go diagonally and Rooks go straight, and you try to trap your opponent's King to win the game:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(From Lev Milman vs. Joseph Fang courtesy of https://www.chess.com/article/view/10-most-beautiful-checkmates.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Chess, if you take a piece, it just leaves the board. In Crazyhouse, the difference is that when you take an opponent's piece, you get to use it. Say you take a Black Bishop; then you get a White Bishop in your hand. When it's your turn, you can either do a regular boring Chess move (with one of your pieces already on the board)—or you can drop a piece from your hand onto the board. To illustrate, watch how when I take the opponent's Bishop, a Bishop appears in my hand at the lower right hand corner; and then next turn, I place it on the board:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(My moves here may not be the most accurate way to play, but they are the funniest.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can drop pieces absolutely anywhere, including to give check. (You just can't put Pawns on the very top or very bottom rows.) So, the game can end by surprise:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(You can't hear because it's a .gif, but I'm saying "Oh... I didn't realize that was mate.".)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those last two gifs were from the same game. The opposing King moved all the way across the board, at the behest of my pieces dropping from the sky. I kept taking pieces from my opponent, so I kept having pieces to drop on the board to continue my attack. (Full game here.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Crazyhouse, this sort of chain reaction is common, where you attack using pieces you took during the attack. It's also common that an apparently safe King gets suddenly pried loose from his protective fortress and subjected to mortal threats. This makes games swingy. Very swingy. For Crazyhouse games, the computer evaluation bar, which says who is winning at each point in the game[1], not uncommonly looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Ah yes, Chess, the classic game of chance.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Piece drops can happen anywhere. This makes for complicated tactics and very strange, never-before-seen positions. They are always hard to calculate, and sometimes beautiful:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(I think I've heard of that one, that's called the Four Knights Attack, right?)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The combination of sharp tactics, the tempo turning on a dime, pieces coming at you from anywhere, and strange un-Chess-like positions, provides a very &lt;del&gt;crazy-making&lt;/del&gt; fun-making experience. I sometimes compare it to regular Chess. It is said that Chess is an argument, where you have to build up your own case, and ask your opponent a series of increasingly uncomfortable questions until they crumble under the pressure. So if slow Chess is a civilized, erudite argument, and blitz Chess is a shouting match, then Crazyhouse is a "duel": You and your opponent stand 6 feet apart, facing each other with your mouths open, and you try to lob lit firecrackers down each other's throats[2]. Crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here's another question: Does Crazyhouse produce rage?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;2. Crazyhouse rage?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not much, in my experience. Not more than any other fast-paced competitive game. You can definitely get very mad, like if the opponent plays bad or has a lower rating but still wins, or if you lose for a "fake" reason like a mouse-slip or your time running out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it's not deeply enraging, as far as I've seen. You occasionally get some salt in the chat, but it's pretty tame—at worst, "fuck you" or "lucky" or similar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;3. Bughouse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bughouse is four-player Crazyhouse, a.k.a. doubles Chess. There are two teams of two. Each team has one player with White pieces, and one with Black pieces. Here you see TeamTop on the top, with TeamTop-White on the left, and TeamTop-Black on the right; and opposing them, there's TeamBottom-Black on the left, and TeamBottom-White on the right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Say TeamTop-Black (top right) takes that White Knight on g6 from his opponent, TeamBottom-White. So then TeamTop-Black gives that White Knight to his teammate, TeamTop-White (top left). Which makes sense, because it's a White Knight and she's playing with the White pieces. On her turn, she can place that Knight on her board, the left board, just like in Crazyhouse. (Since the piece doesn't have to switch colors, you can easily play Bughouse in person.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two games on the two boards just go simultaneously and independently, except that pieces are constantly shuttling back and forth. Also, if one player loses, whether by checkmate or by running out of time, their team loses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before, in Crazyhouse, the branching factor is high—the opponent could place any of their pieces anywhere on the board. But the game was still in a sense self-contained—perfect information just looking at your board, deterministic except for one opponent, fixed turn order. Now, in Bughouse, pieces can come out of nowhere at any time from the other board. It's like if you're boxing, but many times during the bout, a disembodied fist comes out of nowhere and punches you. You better have constant vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If blitz Chess is a shouting match, and Crazyhouse is a firecracker lobbing duel, then Bughouse is hackysack with hand grenades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This takes the Craziness of Crazyhouse and ramps it up to 11:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bughouse also makes you very interdependent with your teammate. For one thing, if they lose, you lose. But it's much more than that. Every little decision they make can derail your whole position on your board, and vice versa; even them taking 3 seconds longer on a move can put you in a much tougher spot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This interdependence opens up the opportunity to experience a special new emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;4. Treachery!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's go through one full example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, you're playing Bughouse on the internet. You're very rusty because you haven't played much in years, and you're doing research for a blog post. Your play is far from perfect, but you put strong pressure on your opponent, and his King is drawn way out. Your King is also exposed, so you MUST keep attacking and checking his King, otherwise he'll take the initiative and attack back. You ask your teammate to trades pieces on their board, so that you have more pieces to drop on your board and continue the attack. Your attack is running low on steam—you've got the White King surrounded, but not quite checkmated. You're out of good checks on the board, and you have no Black pieces in hand to drop and deliver mate. (See the bigger board on the left:)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You play on. You have been begging your teammate to TRADE. Your teammate has not done that thing that you asked for them to do. Now it is a critical moment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The White King on f4 is far afield, completely naked. But you're in check from the White Bishop on h4, and you probably can't afford to just move your King aside. You MUST block, ideally with check. Conveniently, your teammate has the opponent's Black Rook just sitting there on g8, ready to be gobbled up by the Knight on e7. If they take the Rook, you can immediately drop it on f6, blocking check and also CHECKING THE WHITE KING, keeping the initiative! You beg them to take the Rook.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To translate that chat history:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trade pieces [because I have an attack and need pieces to continue attacking]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trade pieces&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trade pieces&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trade pieces&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Move now [because we're in a tight time crunch]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Move now&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Move now&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Move now&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;take [the Rook that's been sitting there for 10 seconds]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;go [make moves, we're in a time crunch]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trade pieces&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Move now&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But your teammate has other ideas. Yes, now is the time to spend 14 seconds before taking the Rook. (Which is completely disastrous, because now your team is down on time, so your teammate's opponent can stall and prevent you from getting more pieces to attack with.) So your attack peters out and you lose on time. You asked them for what you needed, they could have given it to you, but they did it too slowly and all your effort mounting an attack is for naught.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[[If you want you can view the whole game here: https://www.chess.com/game/live/157232852789. Press the "flip board" button, very bottom-right, to see it from my perspective. Click the Partner tab on the right to see both boards. Arrow keys to step through moves.]]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why did they do that? What was your teammate thinking? Maybe they're thinking "My King position is weak, I have to check for possible fatal attacks before playing a non-defensive move.". Maybe they're thinking about the position and not reading the chat. Maybe they're thinking Arby's. Maybe they forgot they were playing Bughouse. Science may never know. But one thing's for sure: They are an absolute knob.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I needed them most, they failed me. And now we both have a big fat L forever. Are they happy?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;5. Bughouse Rage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since Bughouse positions are so explosive and sensitive to small decisions, there's lots of ways your teammate can fail you. They didn't trade enough. They traded too much and gave your opponent pieces to attack you. They played too slow. They gave away a Knight even though you said "No Knights!" and the Knight checkmated you. They kept playing and GOT THEMSELVES CHECKMATED even though YOUR OPPONENT WAS 100% ABOUT TO LOSE if only your teammate would just STOP like you TOLD THEM TO DO FIVE TIMES IN THE CHAT until you hit the limit on how many times the chat lets you say stop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This kind of fuck-up engenders deep rage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me this is a special kind of rage. It's not simple, like a shot of vodka.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's complex, like a fine wine, with a bright attack: the delusion of cooperation getting shattered. The mid-palate is betrayal-anger, with an aroma of contempt, and notes of pain and confusion: How can it possibly be that you want to win—and then you go and play like that?? The finish is spite, and a trace of despair: If this is what other people are like, why try to work with them on anything even slightly difficult?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, it's like a wine, except that you're chugging it. It's also explosive and crunchy and feels like something is tearing up your gut trying to get out. I guess it's like if you swallowed a pint of pop-rocks and let nature do its thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Yes, Watermelo Punch, that's what I want to do to my teammate.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have tasted Bughouse Rage. I don't like it, so I stopped. But I've tasted it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have seen others engage in the rage. When I mess up in online Bughouse, my teammate might Rage at me—using basically the nastiest possible language that gets through chess.com's obscenity filter. When I win, sometimes I stick around after the game to watch the fireworks in the chat from the other team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;6. Bughouse and life&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a lot of ways, online Bughouse with strangers is a perfect storm to create this emotion:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The communication is low-throughput.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your team has strongly aligned goals, but no personal relationship and no way to do sane post-mortems and punishments.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You tense yourself for sustained, effortful thinking—and then BAM your teammate ruins it all.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You're very interdependent, but lack shared context—one board is more than enough to keep track of, let alone two.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There's no incentive for you to go back and look at the game through your teammate's eyes.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, I think the Bughouse Effect shows up a lot in real life, even if it's in a less pure form. It often happens that there's a team of people, and one of them gets very angry about a mistake made by their teammate, and their anger seems out of proportion with the mistake. Whenever that happens, I think of the Bughouse Effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, in a slight deviation from the long tradition of comparing Chess to life, we will now compare Bughouse to life. Here are a couple case studies:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;6.1. Christian Bale bugging out&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Christian Bale was acting in the filming of Terminator Salvation in 2008. Audio (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0auwpvAU2YA) was leaked in 2009 of an altercation between him and the director of photography, who was apparently moving around on or near the set during a scene and distracting Bale. You can hear that Bale is, basically, really really pissed off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's hard to tell without the full context, but it certainly seems like he's being an asshole. However, you can also hear that he's not just being an asshole. Bale's anger has a perfectly understandable basis, relating to his teammate interfering with his efforts. He hammers home several times that he's pissed because the DP seems to not understand the effect his movements have on Bale trying to act. This echoes something you might see (more... curtly) in the aftermath of a rough Bughouse game: Why didn't you read the fucking chat? Do you have any concept of how that fucks with my ability to stay safe and finish attacks? I hope you had fun saccing the pieces that got me mated. Did I do that to you? You're an amateur.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar things happen with leaders in general. There's lots of stories of heads of projects being harsh, impatient, and apparently callous. In some cases they could just be an asshole. But I would guess that in many cases, it's not that they are power-tripping, but rather that they are under a lot of pressure. They're trying to do something hard, and trying to delegate. So then, it's extra super frustrating if the delegee does something that makes it seem like they are totally clueless, or maybe aren't even trying to do the right thing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(This is not at all to excuse this behavior. Especially as an employer, or as a huge actor who presumably has a lot of power. That power presumably is a big part of why Bale allowed himself to act like that in the first place.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;6.2. My stag is best stag&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Stag Hunt is an abstract game, like the Prisoner's Dilemma, that serves as a simplified model for many real-life situations. In the Stag Hunt, each hunter can choose to hunt Stag or Hare. If they both hunt Stag, they're successful and they both get a lot of food. If someone hunts Hare, he'll get a Hare, which is a bit of food. But, if one of them hunts Stag while the other hunts Hare, the Stag hunter gets nothing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that if each hunter knows the other will hunt Stag, then they both individually want to choose Stag (because it will work), and then they'll actually get the Stag. But if either is uncertain of what the other will do, then hunting Stag won't work, so they'll hunt Hare instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does this apply to real life? Basically any group project is a kind of Stag Hunt. If you can all get on the same page with each other about what the goal is, you have a good shot at making it happen; but if you cannot get on the same page about the goal, then it's better to just go work on your separate personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some goals are fairly easy to get on the same page about, like "let's each lift our end of the couch at the same time". But many goals are more difficult to find a teammate for. It might be a rare goal to share, or it might be hard to tell when someone else has that same goal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, there's a certain kind of conversation I like, where we speculate and theorize. New hypotheses can be brought up and seriously considered, even if they seem strange or implausible or unclear; lots of ideas and questions are kicked up and considered intensely, but not hypercritically. This kind of conversation is like an indoor Butterfly Conservatory for protecting a collection of Butterfly Ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes I find someone who seems like they are probably interested in having a butterfly-conservatory conversation. This is exciting! I've found someone with a shared goal, maybe; now we can hunt Stag together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I start in with the butterfly ideas... And then gradually realize that something is off. They might be overly critical, or not really trying to add their own speculation, or just bringing things back to more trivial topics at inappropriate times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually I figure out that they just don't happen to be interested in having the type of conversation that I wanted to have. We have different goals, ok, no problem. It would be inappropriate to get really angry in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it can nevertheless Bug me, with a note of the Bughouse Effect. The transition period can be frustrating and disorienting, when I'm still assuming they're up for a Butterfly Conservatory conversation but I'm seeing how poorly they're doing it. I gathered up my energy to think hard about new ideas; and now the other person is leaving me high and dry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over time, I've learned to more carefully avoid overinvesting in imagined shared goals. I've also learned to pay closer attention to whether I'm incorrectly assuming a shared goal, so I can update my beliefs quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I'm incorrectly imagining that there's someone there, trying to play the same game I'm trying to play, it's kinda like if I think I'm playing Bughouse (with a teammate) but actually I'm playing Crazyhouse on my own. I could get into a position where I can checkmate my opponent, if only I had a Queen to drop on the board, and then cry out to the heavens: "Won't someone please send me a Queen??" But I'm playing Crazyhouse and there's no one there who's trying to send me pieces, and it doesn't make sense to get angry at the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;6.3. Are you people even trying to save the world?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anyone builds AGI, everyone dies. So, like, we should stop that from happening. The plans you want to invest in, to stop that from happening, sometimes depend on when you think AGI is likely to be built.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For some reason, most people working on this seem to have reached a comfortable consensus of "AGI is going to come really really soon, like a few years or a decade". This is very very annoying to me, because I think there's a pretty substantial chance that AGI isn't built for a few decades or more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, some plans are crucial whether you think AGI will come in years or decades; we definitely want to stop AGI capabilities research immediately. But when people have de facto confident short timelines, which I don't think makes sense, they significantly underinvest in important plans, such as human intelligence amplification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can reflect on this situation, and I can see that, in part, different people are just looking at different parts of the world. You're looking at your board, and I'm looking at mine:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that doesn't stop it from being immensely frustrating when your ally is doing it wrong. And there's not necessarily recourse; there's no easy way to have a debate with an amorphous diaphanous distributed tacit quasi-consensus. (Aside: this is not quite the same thing as the narcissism of small differences[3].)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also get a bit of this feeling if a wealthy entrepreneur gets interested in reprogenetics, and wants to invest and make cool tech—but then is mysteriously uninterested in funding the slightly less sexy, but actually much more important science that is prerequisite to the really interesting versions of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From one perspective, it doesn't make sense for me to get angry at them. They're still investing in the area, that's still great, and it's still very helpful compared to the default of not helping at all. But from the other perspective, if you're investing in the area, then you're also the one who is supposed to do the actually right version of working in the area. So when you're not, it's frustrating, and it feels like you're close to doing the really good version, so I really want to nudge you in that direction. (This is related to how people with responsibility, who are doing a pretty good job, get a lot more criticism and hostility than people who aren't helping at all; e.g. leaders of many kinds, or creators of open-source utilities.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't actually feel rage in these situations, but I do feel some real anger, and the anger feels similar to bona FIDE Bughouse Rage. It's the feeling of we are on the same team but why are you acting like that are you oblivious or incompetent or what.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;7. Conclusion: Symmetrization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to point at one last thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Bughouse Effect is a perfect application for symmetrization. That's where you're angry at someone for their behavior, but then you think of times you've done basically that exact same behavior in an analogous position. You can ask: When I was in a time crunch, was I paying close attention my teammate's board, so that I avoid losing a piece that would be dangerous in my teammate's opponent's hands? When I was asked to not lose a Knight, did I immediately see that, or did it take me a few seconds to see the message, and by then I'd already traded a Knight?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then... you can still be mad. But, if you want (hint: you should want), you can at least:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Be mad precisely—mad at the right things, rather than at everything.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Be mad in a way that is fair, in accordance with the Golden Rule—mad in the same way that you think people should be mad at you, when you do that same behavior.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Betrayal is very important to react to; a terminally unreliable teammate is very important to react to; and also, everyone messes up sometimes and other people don't know what you know, so sometimes it was just a bad situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's more to be said about feelings and other reactions around working together on difficult things. I'll leave that to you. Have you experienced the Bughouse Effect? What was it like? What happened next? What maybe ought to happen?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;8. Epilogue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Doing Research (playing board games) for this blog post, I wanted to screenshot the Bughouse chat. But it is so small on chess.com. See?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, you not see it? Because eez invisible? Here, I very nice, I help you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had assumed I was just a goof, and a power user would have the settings configured so that the chat is actually readable. But no. Apparently it's impossible to change the size (short of maybe cooking up some javascript manual html manipulation nonsense), and this is just a years-old bug that has not been fixed. That just goes to show... something. Maybe the Bughouse Effect is more The Chess.com Bughouse Effect. Always open your lines of communication. Indeed, playing Bughouse in person with friends, where you can actually talk and also don't want to be mean, is much much friendlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The computer evaluation is, as I understand it, taken from a Chess-playing computer program's rating of the current position. The Chess program rates positions in order to judge which position to enter, i.e. which move to make. There are Chess programs that are superhuman at many variants of Chess, including Crazyhouse. The question that the evaluation bar answers is, roughly, "How much better is the current position for White, if two Crazyhouse Chess programs started playing from this position?". Since Crazyhouse is very sharp (high branching factor, many forcing lines, runaway attacks), often the Crazyhouse Chess program can find a forced checkmate in (say) 8 moves that's very difficult for a human to directly find. (Often the Crazyhouse program's evaluations take a while to stabilize, so the displayed evaluation bars might be a bit inaccurate, but still give a generally accurate impression I think.) ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What I mean here is that, whereas Go is high-branching but maybe a pretty positional / continuous game (with several somewhat decoupled simultaneous battles; IDK, I don't play Go), and Chess is low-branching and sometimes pretty sharp, Crazyhouse on the other hand is very high-branching and very sharp (e.g. you can easily get a lost position in one or two moves in a surprising non-obvious way). ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Bughouse Effect is one source for the narcissism of small differences (NoSD). But NoSD is more general; I think it describes any situation where two people or groups are very similar, and this somehow generates conflict. You could have NoSD because of a Bughouse Effect, e.g. because you're so close to having the right political strategy, but then this small difference makes it seem like you're totally oblivious and wrong, or possible a traitor. But you could also have it because of an uncanny valley type dynamic, where you're straight up annoyed about something that looks similar but isn't; you might for example worry that other people will treat you as the same, even though you're not the same. NoSD between similar religious communities can be understood as a fight over the derivative / trajectory of the values of the total community; it makes sense to think about small differences in that context, just like it makes sense for us in our daily lives to think more about our current problems (which we have to fix) than about how things are already great (which we don't have to fix). Yet another source would be competition—someone who's too similar to you will compete against you for things. ↩︎&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A New Bridge Links the Strange Math of Infinity to Computer Science&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of modern mathematics is built on the foundation of set theory, the study of how to organize abstract collections of objects. But in general, research mathematicians don’t need to think about it when they’re solving their problems. They can take it for granted that sets behave the way they’d expect, and carry on with their work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Descriptive set theorists are an exception. This small community of mathematicians never stopped studying the fundamental nature of sets — particularly the strange infinite ones that other mathematicians ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their field just got a lot less lonely. In 2023, a mathematician named Anton Bernshteyn published a deep and surprising connection between the remote mathematical frontier of descriptive set theory and modern computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He showed that all problems about certain kinds of infinite sets can be rewritten as problems about how networks of computers communicate. The bridge connecting the disciplines surprised researchers on both sides. Set theorists use the language of logic, computer scientists the language of algorithms. Set theory deals with the infinite, computer science with the finite. There’s no reason why their problems should be related, much less equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is something really weird,” said Václav Rozhoň, a computer scientist at Charles University in Prague. “Like, you are not supposed to have this.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since Bernshteyn’s result, his peers have been exploring how to move back and forth across the bridge to prove new theorems on either side, and how to extend that bridge to new classes of problems. Some descriptive set theorists are even starting to apply insights from the computer science side to reorganize the landscape of their entire field, and to rethink the way they understand infinity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This whole time we’ve been working on very similar problems without directly talking to each other,” said Clinton Conley, a descriptive set theorist at Carnegie Mellon University. “It just opens the doors to all these new collaborations.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Broken Sets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bernshteyn was an undergraduate when he first heard of descriptive set theory — as an example of a field that had once mattered, then decayed to nothing. More than a year would pass before he found out the professor had been wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2014, as a first-year graduate student at the University of Illinois, Bernshteyn took a logic course with Anush Tserunyan, who would later become one of his advisers. She corrected the misconception. “She should take all the credit for me being in this field,” he said. “She really made it seem that logic and set theory is this glue that connects all different parts of math.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Descriptive set theory dates back to Georg Cantor, who proved in 1874 that there are different sizes of infinity. The set of whole numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, …), for instance, is the same size as the set of all fractions, but smaller than the set of all real numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time, mathematicians were deeply uncomfortable with this menagerie of different infinities. “It’s hard to wrap your head around,” said Bernshteyn, who is now at the University of California, Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Partly in response to that discomfort, mathematicians developed a different notion of size — one that described, say, how much length or area or volume a set might occupy, rather than the number of elements it contained. This notion of size is known as a set’s “measure” (in contrast to Cantor’s notion of size, which is a set’s “cardinality”). One of the simplest types of measure — the Lebesgue measure — quantifies a set’s length. While the set of real numbers between zero and 1 and the set of real numbers between zero and 10 are both infinite and have the same cardinality, the first has a Lebesgue measure of 1 and the second a Lebesgue measure of 10.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To study more complicated sets, mathematicians use other types of measures. The uglier a set is, the fewer ways there are to measure it. Descriptive set theorists ask questions about which sets can be measured according to different definitions of “measure.” They then arrange them in a hierarchy based on the answers to those questions. At the top are sets that can be constructed easily and studied using any notion of measure you want. At the bottom are “unmeasurable” sets, which are so complicated they can’t be measured at all. “The word people often use is ‘pathological,’” Bernshteyn said. “Nonmeasurable sets are really bad. They’re counterintuitive, and they don’t behave well.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This hierarchy doesn’t just help set theorists map out the landscape of their field; it also gives them insights into what tools they can use to tackle more typical problems in other areas of math. Mathematicians in some fields, such as dynamical systems, group theory and probability theory, need information about the size of the sets they’re using. A set’s position in the hierarchy determines what tools they can use to solve their problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Descriptive set theorists are thus like librarians, tending to a massive bookshelf of different kinds of infinite sets (and the different ways of measuring them). Their job is to take a problem, determine how complicated a set its solution requires, and place it on the proper shelf, so that other mathematicians can take note.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Making a Choice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bernshteyn belongs to a group of librarians who sort problems about infinite sets of nodes connected by edges, called graphs. In particular, he studies graphs that have infinitely many separate pieces, each containing infinitely many nodes. Most graph theorists don’t study these kinds of graphs; they focus on finite ones instead. But such infinite graphs can represent and provide information about dynamical systems and other important kinds of sets, making them a major area of interest for descriptive set theorists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of the kind of infinite graph that Bernshteyn and his colleagues might study. Start with a circle, which contains infinitely many points. Pick one point: This will be your first node. Then move a fixed distance around the circle’s circumference. This gives you a second node. For example, you might move one-fifth of the way around the circle. Connect the two nodes with an edge. Move the same distance to a third node, and connect it to the previous one. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you move one-fifth of the way around the circle each time, it’ll take five steps to get back where you started. In general, if you move any distance that can be written as a fraction, the nodes will form a closed loop. But if the distance can’t be written as a fraction, the process will go on forever. You’ll get an infinite number of connected nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that’s not all: This infinitely long sequence forms only the first piece of your graph. Even though it contains infinitely many nodes, it doesn’t contain all the points on the circle. To generate the other pieces of the graph, start at one of those other points. Now move the same distance at each step as you did in the first piece. You’ll end up building a second infinite sequence of connected nodes, totally disconnected from the first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do this for every possible new starting point on the circle. You’ll get a graph consisting of infinitely many separate pieces, with each piece made of an infinite number of nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mathematicians can then ask whether it’s possible to color the nodes in this graph so that they obey certain rules. Using just two colors, for instance, can you color every node in the graph so that no two connected nodes are the same color? The solution might seem straightforward. Look at the first piece of your graph, pick a node, and color it blue. Then color the rest of the piece’s nodes in an alternating pattern: yellow, blue, yellow, blue. Do the same for every piece in your graph: Pick a node, color it blue, then alternate colors. Ultimately, you’ll use just two colors to achieve your task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But to accomplish this coloring, you had to rely on a hidden assumption that set theorists call the axiom of choice. It’s one of the nine fundamental building blocks from which all mathematical statements are constructed. According to this axiom, if you start with a bunch of sets, you can choose one item from each of those sets to create a new set — even if you have infinitely many sets to choose from. This axiom is useful, in that it allows mathematicians to prove all sorts of statements of interest. But it also leads to strange paradoxes. Descriptive set theorists avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your graph had infinitely many pieces. This corresponds to having infinitely many sets. You chose one item from each set — the first point you decided to color blue in each of the pieces. All those blue points formed a new set. You used the axiom of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which leads to a problem when you color the rest of the nodes in alternating patterns of blue and yellow. You’ve colored each node (which has zero length) separately, without any understanding of how nodes relate to one another when they come from different pieces of the graph. This means that you can’t describe the set of all the graph’s blue nodes, or the set of all its yellow nodes, in terms of length either. In other words, these sets are unmeasurable. Mathematicians can’t say anything useful about them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To descriptive set theorists, this is unsatisfying. And so they want to figure out a way to color the graph in a continuous way — a way that doesn’t use the axiom of choice, and that gives them measurable sets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To do this, remember how you built the first piece of your graph: You picked a node on a circle and connected it to a second node some distance away. Now color the first node blue, the second yellow, and the entire arc between them blue. Similarly, color the arc between the second and third nodes yellow. Color the third arc blue. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soon, you’ll have made it almost completely around the circle — meaning that you’ve assigned a color to all the nodes in your graph except for the ones that fall in a small, leftover segment. Say the last arc you colored was yellow. How do you color this final, smaller segment? You can’t use blue, because these nodes will connect to nodes in the original arc you colored blue. But you also can’t use yellow, because these nodes connect back to yellow ones from the previous arc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have to use a third color — say, green — to complete your coloring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, the sets of blue, yellow and green nodes you end up with are all just pieces of the circle’s circumference, rather than the scatterings of points you ended up with when you used the axiom of choice. You can calculate the lengths of these sets. They’re measurable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Descriptive set theorists therefore place the two-color version of the problem on the lowest shelf in their hierarchy (for unmeasurable sets), while the three-color problem goes on a much higher shelf of problems — ones where lots of notions of measure can be applied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bernshteyn spent his years in graduate school studying such coloring problems, shelving them one by one. Then, shortly after he finished his degree, he stumbled on a potential way to shelve them all at once — and to show that these problems have a much deeper and more mathematically relevant structure than anyone had realized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Round by Round&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From time to time, Bernshteyn enjoys going to computer science talks, where graphs are finite and represent networks of computers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2019, one of those talks changed the course of his career. It was about “distributed algorithms” — sets of instructions that run simultaneously on multiple computers in a network to accomplish a task without a central coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Say you have a bunch of Wi-Fi routers in a building. Nearby routers can interfere with each other if they use the same communication frequency channel. So each router needs to choose a different channel from the ones used by its immediate neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Computer scientists can reframe this as a coloring problem on a graph: Represent each router as a node, and connect nearby ones with edges. Using just two colors (representing two different frequency channels), find a way to color each node so that no two connected nodes are the same color.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there’s a catch: Nodes can only communicate with their immediate neighbors, using so-called local algorithms. First, each node runs the same algorithm and assigns itself a color. It then communicates with its neighbors to learn how other nodes are colored in a small region around it. Then it runs the algorithm again to decide whether to keep its color or switch it. It repeats this step until the whole network has a proper coloring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Computer scientists want to know how many steps a given algorithm requires. For example, any local algorithm that can solve the router problem with only two colors must be incredibly inefficient, but it’s possible to find a very efficient local algorithm if you’re allowed to use three.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the talk Bernshteyn was attending, the speaker discussed these thresholds for different kinds of problems. One of the thresholds, he realized, sounded a lot like a threshold that existed in the world of descriptive set theory — about the number of colors required to color certain infinite graphs in a measurable way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To Bernshteyn, it felt like more than a coincidence. It wasn’t just that computer scientists are like librarians too, shelving problems based on how efficiently their algorithms work. It wasn’t just that these problems could also be written in terms of graphs and colorings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps, he thought, the two bookshelves had more in common than that. Perhaps the connection between these two fields went much, much deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps all the books, and their shelves, were identical, just written in different languages — and in need of a translator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Opening the Door&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bernshteyn set out to make this connection explicit. He wanted to show that every efficient local algorithm can be turned into a Lebesgue-measurable way of coloring an infinite graph (that satisfies some additional important properties). That is, one of computer science’s most important shelves is equivalent to one of set theory’s most important shelves (high up in the hierarchy).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He began with the class of network problems from the computer science lecture, focusing on their overarching rule — that any given node’s algorithm uses information about just its local neighborhood, whether the graph has a thousand nodes or a billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To run properly, all the algorithm has to do is label each node in a given neighborhood with a unique number, so that it can log information about nearby nodes and give instructions about them. That’s easy enough to do in a finite graph: Just give every node in the graph a different number.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Bernshteyn could run the same algorithm on an infinite graph, it meant he could color the graph in a measurable way — solving a graph-coloring question on the set theory side. But there was a problem: These infinite graphs are “uncountably” infinite. There’s no way to uniquely label all their nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bernshteyn’s challenge was to find a cleverer way to label the graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He knew that he’d have to reuse labels. But that was fine so long as nearby nodes were labeled differently. Was there a way to assign labels without accidentally reusing one in the same neighborhood?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bernshteyn showed that there is always a way — no matter how many labels you decide to use, and no matter how many nodes your local neighborhood has. This means that you can always safely extend the algorithm from the computer science side to the set theory side. “Any algorithm in our setup corresponds to a way of measurably coloring any graph in the descriptive set theory setup,” Rozhoň said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proof came as a surprise to mathematicians. It demonstrated a deep link between computation and definability, and between algorithms and measurable sets. Mathematicians are now exploring how to take advantage of Bernshteyn’s discovery. In a paper published this year, for instance, Rozhoň and his colleagues figured out that it’s possible to color special graphs called trees by looking at the same problem in the computer science context. The result also illuminated which tools mathematicians might use to study the trees’ corresponding dynamical systems. “This is a very interesting experience, trying to prove results in a field where I don’t understand even the basic definitions,” Rozhoň said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mathematicians have also been working to translate problems in the other direction. In one case, they used set theory to prove a new estimate of how hard a certain class of problems is to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bernshteyn’s bridge isn’t just about having a new tool kit for solving individual problems. It has also allowed set theorists to gain a clearer view of their field. There were lots of problems that they had no idea how to classify. In many cases, that’s now changed, because set theorists have computer scientists’ more organized bookshelves to guide them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bernshteyn hopes this growing area of research will change how the working mathematician views set theorists’ work — that they’ll no longer see it as remote and disconnected from the real mathematical world. “I’m trying to change this,” he said. “I want people to get used to thinking about infinity.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Someone At YouTube Needs Glasses: The Prophecy Has Been Fulfilled&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my recent analysis of YouTube’s information density I included the results from an advanced statistical analysis on the number of videos present on the home page, which projected that around May 2026 there would only be one lonely video on the home screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazingly, a disgruntled Googler leaked a recording of how YouTube’s PM org handled the criticism as it sat at the top of Hacker News for a whole day for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The net result is that after months of hard work by &lt;del&gt;Gemini&lt;/del&gt; YouTube engineers, the other day I fired up YouTube on an Apple TV and was graced with this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s analyze this picture and count the number of videos on the home screen:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the YouTube PM org’s myopia is accelerating: with this data I now project that there will be zero videos on the homescreen around May of 2026 now, up from September.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apparently Poe’s Law applies to Google PMs, satire is dead, and maybe our mandatory NeuraLinks are coming sooner than I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I was really influenced by three films,” Ridley Scott told Fantastic Films in 1979, on the subject of the Nostromo and its claustrophobic corridors. “Not so much in terms of Star Wars, but definitely from 2001 and Dark Star.” The latter film, directed by a young John Carpenter and written by, and starring, Alien writer Dan O’Bannon, was an inverse, comedic take on 2001 – where Kubrick’s film was cold, sterile, clinical, and philosophical in scope, Dark Star was cramped, crowded, shabby, dirty, irreverent and yet also elegiac. “There was a great sense of reality, oddly enough, in Dark Star,” continued Scott, “especially of seedy living. It showed you can get grotty even in the Hilton Hotel if you don’t clean it. Everything starts to get tacky, even in the most streamlined surfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“When we did Dark Star,” said O’Bannon, “which was in the wake of 2001, we thought we wanted -partly for the novelty, partly because it was realer, mostly just for laughs- we wanted to show this once-sterile spaceship in a rundown condition, like some old bachelor apartment.” For O’Bannon, Dark Star‘s ‘used universe’ was not as strong a visual element as he had hoped, and Star Wars’ “didn’t come across all that clearly either.” For Alien, O’Bannon instructed Ridley Scott that “if we want this spacecraft to look industrial [and] beat-up, you’re gonna have to make it about three times messier to the naked eye than you wanna to see it. And Alien probably was the first time where an audience clearly saw a futuristic machine in a run-down condition.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design of the Nostromo and the ‘used universe’ aesthetic would be drawn from O’Bannon’s earlier sci-fi effort, coupled with the realism of Kubrick’s Discovery One. “It’s futuristic,” Scott said of Kubrick’s approach to 2001, “but it’s still hung on today’s reality … In two hundred years things won’t change that much, you know. People will still be scruffy or clean. They’ll still clean their teeth three times a day.” Though Star Wars itself utilised a used universe (or, as Akira Kurosawa called it, a “maculate reality”), Scott wanted to create a tangible reality opposed to Star Wars‘ fantasy-hinged settings and ships. “I wanted to do the truck driver version, the hard-nosed version,” said Scott. “It was supposed to be the anti-thesis of Star Wars. The reality, the beauty of something absolutely about function.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before Scott came onto the project as director, writer Dan O’Bannon commissioned his friend and Dark Star spaceship designer Ron Cobb to draw what his script was then calling the ‘deep space commercial vessel Snark’ – a nod to Lewis Carroll’s The Hunting of the Snark. O’Bannon had promised Cobb a job on Alejandro Jodorowsky’s Dune, but when that film dissolved Cobb, who had terminated the lease on his home and prepared to move to Paris with his wife, was left standing empty-handed. To make up for the letdown, O’Bannon immediately hired Cobb for Alien, which allowed the artist to bounce back from a slump. “He was paid about $400 a week,” Cobb’s wife, Robin Love, told the LA Times in 1988. “We thought it was wonderful!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When Dan met Ron: “I was working on my first sci-fi film, John Carpenter’s Electric Dutchman, which would ultimately metastastize into the feature-length Dark Star. I tried to reach Cobb to get him to design the whole film, but he was unreachable. For weeks his phone rang without an answer, and then it was disconnected, and then I got his new unlisted number but it was invariably answered by one of the girls who were living with him, who always told me he was out. It was impossible. It took another year and a half to track him down and get him to agree to design us a nice, simple little spaceship for our simple little movie. Finally, one night about ten pm, Carpenter and I drove over to Westwood and rousted him out of a sound sleep. He was hung over from an LSD trip and I felt kind of guilty, but I had to have those designs. We took him over to an all-night coffee shop and fed him and got him half-way awake, and then he brought out this pad of yellow graph paper on which he had sketched a 3-view plan of our spaceship. It was wonderful! A little surfboard-shaped starcruiser with a flat bottom for atmospheric landings. Very technological looking. Very high class stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The first person I hired on Alien, the first person to draw money, was Cobb,” O’Bannon said. “He started turning out renderings, large full-colour paintings, while Shusett and I were still struggling with the script – the corrosive blood of the Alien was Cobb’s idea. It was an intensely creative period – the economic desperation, the all-night sessions, the rushing over to Cobb’s apartment to see the latest painting-in-progress and give him the latest pages.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just sat down and started blocking out a ship – which I love to do. Anyway, Dan’s original script called for a small, modest little ship with a small crew. They land on a small planet. They go down a small pyramid and shake up a medium-sized creature. That’s about it. He meant it to be a low budget film, like Dark Star, and I loved the idea. So I did a few paintings and Dan scurried off with them and a script.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;~ Ron Cobb&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“And he was doing some incredible stuff,” continued O’Bannon. “Wow! I was really happy during this period, seeing the movie appear under Cobb’s fingers. Of course, we usually had to go over and sit on his back to get him to do any work -otherwise he would just party on with his friends- but how beautiful were the results.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coupled with Cobb was English artist, Chris Foss, who O’Bannon had come to know during their tenure together on Alejandro Jodorowsky’s Dune. “Alejandro wanted Doug Trumble to do the special effects [for Dune],” Foss told MTV in 2011, “and of course, Trumble was a big important American, and certainly wouldn’t succumb to Alejandro’s manipulation. So he picked up this gauche American film student, Dan O’Bannon. He was quite hilarious, he said to me once, ‘Hey, these streets are so goddamn small.’ This is Paris, which had some of the widest streets in Europe. Of course, it was only when I got to Los Angeles that I saw what he meant.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though Dune would never come to fruition under Jodorowsky, the experience in France influenced O’Bannon’s approach to designing Alien. Jodorowsky had gathered together Chris Foss, Jean ‘Moebius’ Giraud, and HR Giger to design his film, and the eclectic team would be later reunited by O’Bannon to design his grungy sci-fi horror movie. “Dan said [to Twentieth Century Fox], ‘Hey, we’ve got to get this guy Chris Foss over here.’ So off I went to Los Angeles …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The early stages of designing Alien were done in an almost ramshackle, low-fi manner. “We were put through shed after shed after shed,” said Foss of the times, “and they were going through director after director after director.” Ron Cobb told Den of Geek: “I soon found myself hidden away at Fox Studios in an old rehearsal hall above an even older sound stage with Chris Foss and O’Bannon, trying to visualize Alien. For up to five months Chris and I (with Dan supervising) turned out a large amount of artwork, while the producers, Gordon Carroll, Walter Hill and David Giler, looked for a director.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foss was largely critical of Brandywine’s apparently disinterested approach to setting up the embryonic film. “Walter Hill was very busy smashing cars up for one of his ‘streets’ films,” he told Den of Geek. “He couldn’t be arsed – much too busy! He walked in after months of work and just said, ‘Yep, roomful of spaceships’ and just walked out again.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Ron Cobb, Steven Speilberg, and aliens: Cobb told bttf.com: “I first met Speilberg when I was working on Alien, at one point Speilberg was considered as a possible director for the original Alien. It was just a brief thing, he could never work out his schedule to do it, but he was interested.” Later, one of Cobb’s early story pitches to Speilberg, an alien horror tale called Night Skies, eventually became 1982’s E.T. Though Cobb cameo’d as one of E.T.’s doctors (“I got to carry the little critter,”) he wasn’t pleased with the family-friendly direction that the film took from his initial idea: “A banal retelling of the Christ story,” he told the LA Times. “Sentimental and self-indulgent, a pathetic lost-puppy kind of story.” Luckily for the artist, a clause in his contract for E.T. (he was originally to direct before the story took a turn) detailed that he was to earn 1% of the net profit. His first cheque amounted to $400,000. Cobb’s wife quipped: “friends from Australia always ask, ‘What did you do on E.T.?’ And Ron says, ‘I didn’t direct it.'”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Ridley Scott took over the directorial duties, Cobb and Foss were shipped to England to continue their work. Around this point in time, HR Giger was drawing up the film’s alien, and Moebius was commissioned by Scott to design the film’s space suits, which would be brought into reality by John Mollo. The Snark went through a variety of designs, from a ship embedded in the rock of an asteroid, to an upended pyramidal design, to a hammerhead shape and other varieties of ship with white or yellow or more kaleidoscopic paint-jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After many months of scribbling and painting spaceships, the production was no closer to settling what the vessel would actually look like. Due to script rewrites, it also changed names, from Snark to Leviathan before the name Nostromo was settled on. “I called the ship Nostromo from [Joseph] Conrad,” Walter Hill told Film International in 2004, “[For] no particular metaphoric idea, I just thought it sounded good.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, indecision was still rife on the actual look of the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Scott on O’Bannon: “He’s great. A really sweet guy. And, I was soon to realise, a real science-fiction freak … He brought in a book by the Swiss artist HR Giger. It’s called Necronomicon … I thought, ‘If we can build that [Necronom IV], that’s it.’ I was stunned, really. I flipped. Literally flipped. And O’Bannon lit up like a lightbulb, shining like a quartz iodine. I realised I was dealing with a real SF freak, which I’d never come across before. I thought, ‘My god, I have an egg-head here for this field.'”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Scott on Cobb: “O’Bannon introduced me to Ron Cobb, a brilliant visualiser of the genre, with whom he’d worked on Dark Star. Cobb seemed to have very realistic visions of both the far and near future, so I quickly decided that he would take a very important part in the making of the film.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cobb on Foss: “Creating spacecraft exteriors came easily to Foss. His mind and imagination seemed to embody the entire history of the industrial revolution. He could conjure up endless spacecraft designs suggesting submarines, diesel locomotives, Mayan interceptors, Mississippi river boats, jumbo space arks, but best of all (ask Dan) were his trademark aero-spacecraft-textures like panels, cowlings, antennae, bulging fuel tanks, vents, graphics etc. As the months passed, along with two or three temporary directors, Chris began to have problems caused by his spectacular creativity. No one in a position to make a decision seemed to be able to make up their mind and/or choose one of his designs. I think Chris was turning out spacecraft designs the decision makers found too original.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ridley himself had input on the design: “I was looking for something like 2001, not the fantasy of Star Wars. I wanted a slow moving, massive piece of steel which was moving along in dead, deep silence … The concept was to have the hull covered with space barnacles or something. I was unable to communicate that idea, and I finally had to go down there and fiddle with the experts. We gradually arrived at a solution.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foss paints a more hectic process. “Finally what happened was that the bloke who had to make the [Nostromo] model completely lost his rag, scooped up a load of paper -they had a room full of smashed-up bits of helicopter and all-sorts- and he just bodged something together. So the actual spaceship in the film hadn’t anything to do with all the days, weeks, months of work that we’d all done. It’s as simple as that.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cobb explained: “Brian Johnson, the special effects supervisor under pressure to build the large Nostromo model, went into the deserted art department and, out of frustration, grabbed all the Chris Foss designs off the wall and took them to Bray studios. There he would choose the design himself in order to have enough time to build the damn thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Johnson had also scooped up Cobb’s art, and though Cobb was concentrating on the designs of the ship’s interior, one of his exterior pieces met with approval over Foss’ designs. “Well I soon found out that Brian found and took all of my exterior design sketches as well,” said Cobb. “About a month later I was told that Brian had used my sketch, ‘Nostromo A’, as the basis for the model, even to the extent that it was painted yellow. Ridley found the colour a bit garish and had it repainted grey.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Ridley had his own very firm ideas about what he physically wanted to do,” Foss said of the process, “and he almost studiously ignored everything that had gone before … I kind of got the impression that Ridley was quietly going his own way, trying to get on with it and get it done, a bit like just another job. I’ve just got dim memories of Ridley being like that and really just ignoring months of input … I just have these memories of feeling a bit miffed that things weren’t put together so much better. And poor old Dan O’Bannon, the bloke whose concept it was, just got absolutely shafted. He was almost like patted on the head: ‘Yeah Dan, yeah Dan, that’s cool.'”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cobb’s sketches, drawings and paintings for the interiors were also okay’ed by Scott and the production. At first Cobb’s designs were slightly more fantastical, with giant screens and computer readouts and windows covered by protective shells that would open up to reveal alien planets ahead of the ship. Though these ideas were scuppered due to time, money, and logistics, many of Cobb’s early designs and ideas were revisited in Prometheus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to designing the Nostromo’s exterior, its bridge and auto-doc, Cobb also designed the ship’s airlocks, cyro-tubes, corridors, bulkheads, an observation dome (not built), Ash’s ‘blister’ observation unit, some of the film’s uniform patches and ship signage, the ‘flying bedstead’ maintenance vehicle (not built), and even Jones’ cat-box. Cobb told Den of Geek that, “My problem with designing Nostromo’s interiors, the control bridge, corridors, auto doc (or med lab), bulkhead doors, the food deck, etc., was that I grew up with a deep fascination for astronomy, astrophysics, and most of all, aerospace flight. My design approach has always been that of a frustrated engineer (as well as a frustrated writer when it came to cinema design). I tend to subscribe to the idea that form follows function. If I’m to arrive at a cinematic spacecraft design that seamlessly preserves, as in this case, the drama of the script, the audience has to experience it as something impressive and believable.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’re beyond 2001 in terms of scientific advances,” said Scott of Alien‘s futurism, “our capabilities are more sophisticated but our ship’s still NASA-orientated, still Earth-manufactured … in our tongue-in-cheek fantasy we project a not-too-distant future in which there are many vehicles tramping around the universe on mining expeditions, erecting military installations, or whatever. At the culmination of many long voyages, each covering many years, these ships -no doubt part of armadas owned by private corporations- look used, beat-up, covered with graffiti, and uncomfortable. We certainly didn’t design the Nostromo to look like a hotel.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t want a conventional shape [for the refinery,] so I drew up a sketch and handed it to the model makers. They refined it, as it were, and built the model. I originally drew it upside-down, with the vague idea that it would resemble a floating inverted cathedral … I think that the machine that they’re on could in fact be 60 years old and just added to over the decades. The metal-work on it could be 50 years old … I would have liked to see it covered with space barnacles or space seaweed, all clogged and choked up, but that was illogical as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;~ Ridley Scott, Fantastic Films, 1979.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Nostromo model was built under the supervision of Nick Allder and Brian Johnson at Bray Studios, not far from Pinewood, where the live-action scenes were being filmed in parallel with the model shots at Bray. For the refinery, Scott instructed the teams at Bray to make it appear “Victorian Gothic,” with towers and spires and antennae. Bray shop worker Dennis Lowe explained: “At that same time in the workshop Ridley was talking about his first concept of the refinery and he was describing an actual oil refinery with pipes and spires, eventually the term ‘Battleship Bismarck in space’ came up to describe the detailing of the model.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Ridley arrived after concluding filming at Pinewood, he further revised the ship’s look, removing many of the spires from the refinery, repainting the Nostromo from yellow to grey, and scrapping every piece of footage shot to date, taking it upon himself to re-direct the scenes. “It was a difficult situation,” said Scott, “Brian Johnson was over there [at Bray], working out of context away from the main unit. I could only look at the rushes while I was working with the actors, and that’s not a very satisfactory way of working. In the end, I think a director must be heavily involved with the miniatures, and that’s why I shot them myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to model builder Jon Sorensen, there were no real hard feelings over the redesigns and reshoots. “Ridley Scott then arrived from Shepperton to take an interest in the models and everything changed radically in terms of tone, colour and look. The yellow was sprayed over a uniform grey. Sections were rebuilt. We started over, discarding all previous footage. There was no anger at this. Surprise maybe. But it was Ridley Scott’s film. We liked him. So we entered the Alien model shoot Part Deux. I recall Bill Pearson and I talking once on what we thought was an empty, lunch-time model stage when a voice spoke from the shadows. Ridley, asking what we were discussing. We answered that maybe that part might look better moved over to there, (we were discussing the refinery). He smiled back and I guess that signalled what was true; we’d go all the way to help him. That night he bought both Bill and I a beer, a move which astonished the Assistant Director, Ray Beckett who complained that in 10 years of working with Ridley, he’d never been bought a beer. So we bought Ray one instead.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Nostromo interiors were overseen by art director Roger Christian, who had helped craft the sets for Star Wars. Christian told Shadowlocked.com: “I art-directed Alien for Ridley Scott with my team because he was struggling to get the designer and the art department to understand ‘that look’ I created with the dressing on Star Wars … I went into Shepperton, and we built and dressed the first corridor section – actually for a test screen for Sigourney Weaver, who the studios were not sure about. I brought my little team of prop guys who’d understood then the process of what to strip down and how to place it. Because it was not something you just do randomly. It had to be done based on a kind of knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Roger is a brilliant set dresser,” Scott told Fantastic Films. “Though his department was not designing the corridors and sets, their ‘cladding’ of the walls made everything look absolutely real. He would go out with his buyers and prop men and visit aircraft dumps or army surplus stores and drag masses of things in for me to see.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“With Alien I was able to go much further with the oily and gritty look than in Star Wars,” said Roger Christian, “and for the first time create a totally believable ‘space truck’, as Ridley described it. The set ended up looking as if we had rented a well-travelled, well-used, oily, dirty, mineral carrier – an unmistakably real and claustrophobic space vessel. I think this really helped audiences to identify with the movie, as the characters were so like space truckers, trapped in a claustrophobic nightmare.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[The Nostromo’s] like the bloody Queen Mary. Do you get a sense of scale in the interior? That it’s big? We couldn’t build the two to three-hundred foot-long corridors which it would have but it’s supposed to be like one of these huge Japanese super-tankers. Three quarters of a mile long. The refinery behind it god-knows how big. I mean… I dunno. A mile square?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;~ Ridley Scott, Fantastic Films, 1979.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Ridley saw the ship very much as a metaphor for a Gothic castle,” said Ron Cobb on the subject of the ship’s interiors, “or a WWII submarine … a kind of retro, accessible technology with great big transistors and very low-res video screens.” However, at one point, Scott had other ideas for the Nostromo’s technology: “I wanted to have wafer-thin screens that are plexiglas, that just float on clips -and of course today you’ve got computer screens exactly like that- because I figured that’s where it [technology] would go. I really got those things off Jean Giraud, Moebius, when he’d been drawing and speculating. A lot of his stuff you see thirty years ago is now.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cobb acknowledged the Moebius influence, as well as the ship’s other, perhaps subtler, inspirations: “The ship is a strange mixture of retrofitted old technology, a kind of industrial nightmare, like being trapped in a factory … Ridley’s a wonderful artist and he wanted it to look a lot like a Moebius-designed ship, with all kinds of rounds surfaces and with an Egyptian motif.” This Egyptian motif is prevalent in the Weylan-Yutani logo, a wings of Horus design which adorns the uniforms of the crew in addition to their coffee cups, beer cans, etc. The hypersleep chamber also evokes a burial chamber, with the cryo-chambers arranged in a lotus shape. In addition to the Egyptian motif, another influence was Japan. “The owners of the Nostromo are Japanese,” Scott told Fantastic Films.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“As I was working with the art director,” said Ridley, “I decided to make it faintly glittery. I wanted to have sort of anodized gold everywhere. Not steel, gold. Did you know that space landing craft are covered with gold foil? Amazing! So I thought, Why make this out of steel? Let’s make it all warm and oppressive, massive, and gold.'”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The glittery look can be seen in the opening shots of the ship’s computers bleeping into life, and the gold sheen is most prevalent in the ship’s maintenance area, where Brett finds the Alien’s discarded skin moments before his death. Scott explained the design process for the ship’s golden-hued maintenance garage: “We got hold of marvelous, actual parts of actual huge jet engines and installed them, and they’re like a coppery metal with some steel. We used them as four main supports, like columns, and they give a lot of the feeling of a temple. We played the same music we used in the derelict alien craft and we had two temples. The idol I wanted was through these massive gold doors which were as big as a wall, with a gap in them through which the claw [landing leg] can be seen. When that set was dressed, it looked like Aladdin’s Cave … [the garage is] filled with the equipment that the crew would use in their work on and around the refinery, and when they land on various planets – land crawlers, helicopters, other flying machines.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Ridley has this lavish, sensual visual style,” summarised Dan O’Bannon to Fantastic Films in 1979, “and I think that Ridley is one of the ‘good guys.’ I really think that he was the final pivot point responsible for the picture coming out good. And so a lot of the visual design and a lot of the mood elements inherent in the camerawork, while they’re not what I planned, are great. They’re just different.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;O’Bannon also nodded to the contributions of Cobb, Foss, Shusett etc., to the picture: “Also, it’s not 100% Ridley either. It’s Ridley superimposing his vision over the cumulative vision of others, you see. Now this could be such a strong director’s picture because Ridley’s directorial and visual hand is so strong. There will probably be tendency among critics to refer to it as Ridley Scott’s vision of the future. And he did have a vision of the future. But it was everybody else that came before, that’s what his vision is … if it sounds like I’m knocking Ridley, I’m not.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I was really influenced by three films,” Ridley Scott told Fantastic Films in 1979, on the subject of the Nostromo and its claustrophobic corridors. “Not so much in terms of Star Wars, but definitely from 2001 and Dark Star.” The latter film, directed by a young John Carpenter and written by, and starring, Alien writer Dan O’Bannon, was an inverse, comedic take on 2001 – where Kubrick’s film was cold, sterile, clinical, and philosophical in scope, Dark Star was cramped, crowded, shabby, dirty, irreverent and yet also elegiac. “There was a great sense of reality, oddly enough, in Dark Star,” continued Scott, “especially of seedy living. It showed you can get grotty even in the Hilton Hotel if you don’t clean it. Everything starts to get tacky, even in the most streamlined surfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“When we did Dark Star,” said O’Bannon, “which was in the wake of 2001, we thought we wanted -partly for the novelty, partly because it was realer, mostly just for laughs- we wanted to show this once-sterile spaceship in a rundown condition, like some old bachelor apartment.” For O’Bannon, Dark Star‘s ‘used universe’ was not as strong a visual element as he had hoped, and Star Wars’ “didn’t come across all that clearly either.” For Alien, O’Bannon instructed Ridley Scott that “if we want this spacecraft to look industrial [and] beat-up, you’re gonna have to make it about three times messier to the naked eye than you wanna to see it. And Alien probably was the first time where an audience clearly saw a futuristic machine in a run-down condition.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design of the Nostromo and the ‘used universe’ aesthetic would be drawn from O’Bannon’s earlier sci-fi effort, coupled with the realism of Kubrick’s Discovery One. “It’s futuristic,” Scott said of Kubrick’s approach to 2001, “but it’s still hung on today’s reality … In two hundred years things won’t change that much, you know. People will still be scruffy or clean. They’ll still clean their teeth three times a day.” Though Star Wars itself utilised a used universe (or, as Akira Kurosawa called it, a “maculate reality”), Scott wanted to create a tangible reality opposed to Star Wars‘ fantasy-hinged settings and ships. “I wanted to do the truck driver version, the hard-nosed version,” said Scott. “It was supposed to be the anti-thesis of Star Wars. The reality, the beauty of something absolutely about function.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before Scott came onto the project as director, writer Dan O’Bannon commissioned his friend and Dark Star spaceship designer Ron Cobb to draw what his script was then calling the ‘deep space commercial vessel Snark’ – a nod to Lewis Carroll’s The Hunting of the Snark. O’Bannon had promised Cobb a job on Alejandro Jodorowsky’s Dune, but when that film dissolved Cobb, who had terminated the lease on his home and prepared to move to Paris with his wife, was left standing empty-handed. To make up for the letdown, O’Bannon immediately hired Cobb for Alien, which allowed the artist to bounce back from a slump. “He was paid about $400 a week,” Cobb’s wife, Robin Love, told the LA Times in 1988. “We thought it was wonderful!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When Dan met Ron: “I was working on my first sci-fi film, John Carpenter’s Electric Dutchman, which would ultimately metastastize into the feature-length Dark Star. I tried to reach Cobb to get him to design the whole film, but he was unreachable. For weeks his phone rang without an answer, and then it was disconnected, and then I got his new unlisted number but it was invariably answered by one of the girls who were living with him, who always told me he was out. It was impossible. It took another year and a half to track him down and get him to agree to design us a nice, simple little spaceship for our simple little movie. Finally, one night about ten pm, Carpenter and I drove over to Westwood and rousted him out of a sound sleep. He was hung over from an LSD trip and I felt kind of guilty, but I had to have those designs. We took him over to an all-night coffee shop and fed him and got him half-way awake, and then he brought out this pad of yellow graph paper on which he had sketched a 3-view plan of our spaceship. It was wonderful! A little surfboard-shaped starcruiser with a flat bottom for atmospheric landings. Very technological looking. Very high class stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The first person I hired on Alien, the first person to draw money, was Cobb,” O’Bannon said. “He started turning out renderings, large full-colour paintings, while Shusett and I were still struggling with the script – the corrosive blood of the Alien was Cobb’s idea. It was an intensely creative period – the economic desperation, the all-night sessions, the rushing over to Cobb’s apartment to see the latest painting-in-progress and give him the latest pages.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just sat down and started blocking out a ship – which I love to do. Anyway, Dan’s original script called for a small, modest little ship with a small crew. They land on a small planet. They go down a small pyramid and shake up a medium-sized creature. That’s about it. He meant it to be a low budget film, like Dark Star, and I loved the idea. So I did a few paintings and Dan scurried off with them and a script.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;~ Ron Cobb&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“And he was doing some incredible stuff,” continued O’Bannon. “Wow! I was really happy during this period, seeing the movie appear under Cobb’s fingers. Of course, we usually had to go over and sit on his back to get him to do any work -otherwise he would just party on with his friends- but how beautiful were the results.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coupled with Cobb was English artist, Chris Foss, who O’Bannon had come to know during their tenure together on Alejandro Jodorowsky’s Dune. “Alejandro wanted Doug Trumble to do the special effects [for Dune],” Foss told MTV in 2011, “and of course, Trumble was a big important American, and certainly wouldn’t succumb to Alejandro’s manipulation. So he picked up this gauche American film student, Dan O’Bannon. He was quite hilarious, he said to me once, ‘Hey, these streets are so goddamn small.’ This is Paris, which had some of the widest streets in Europe. Of course, it was only when I got to Los Angeles that I saw what he meant.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though Dune would never come to fruition under Jodorowsky, the experience in France influenced O’Bannon’s approach to designing Alien. Jodorowsky had gathered together Chris Foss, Jean ‘Moebius’ Giraud, and HR Giger to design his film, and the eclectic team would be later reunited by O’Bannon to design his grungy sci-fi horror movie. “Dan said [to Twentieth Century Fox], ‘Hey, we’ve got to get this guy Chris Foss over here.’ So off I went to Los Angeles …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The early stages of designing Alien were done in an almost ramshackle, low-fi manner. “We were put through shed after shed after shed,” said Foss of the times, “and they were going through director after director after director.” Ron Cobb told Den of Geek: “I soon found myself hidden away at Fox Studios in an old rehearsal hall above an even older sound stage with Chris Foss and O’Bannon, trying to visualize Alien. For up to five months Chris and I (with Dan supervising) turned out a large amount of artwork, while the producers, Gordon Carroll, Walter Hill and David Giler, looked for a director.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foss was largely critical of Brandywine’s apparently disinterested approach to setting up the embryonic film. “Walter Hill was very busy smashing cars up for one of his ‘streets’ films,” he told Den of Geek. “He couldn’t be arsed – much too busy! He walked in after months of work and just said, ‘Yep, roomful of spaceships’ and just walked out again.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Ron Cobb, Steven Speilberg, and aliens: Cobb told bttf.com: “I first met Speilberg when I was working on Alien, at one point Speilberg was considered as a possible director for the original Alien. It was just a brief thing, he could never work out his schedule to do it, but he was interested.” Later, one of Cobb’s early story pitches to Speilberg, an alien horror tale called Night Skies, eventually became 1982’s E.T. Though Cobb cameo’d as one of E.T.’s doctors (“I got to carry the little critter,”) he wasn’t pleased with the family-friendly direction that the film took from his initial idea: “A banal retelling of the Christ story,” he told the LA Times. “Sentimental and self-indulgent, a pathetic lost-puppy kind of story.” Luckily for the artist, a clause in his contract for E.T. (he was originally to direct before the story took a turn) detailed that he was to earn 1% of the net profit. His first cheque amounted to $400,000. Cobb’s wife quipped: “friends from Australia always ask, ‘What did you do on E.T.?’ And Ron says, ‘I didn’t direct it.'”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Ridley Scott took over the directorial duties, Cobb and Foss were shipped to England to continue their work. Around this point in time, HR Giger was drawing up the film’s alien, and Moebius was commissioned by Scott to design the film’s space suits, which would be brought into reality by John Mollo. The Snark went through a variety of designs, from a ship embedded in the rock of an asteroid, to an upended pyramidal design, to a hammerhead shape and other varieties of ship with white or yellow or more kaleidoscopic paint-jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After many months of scribbling and painting spaceships, the production was no closer to settling what the vessel would actually look like. Due to script rewrites, it also changed names, from Snark to Leviathan before the name Nostromo was settled on. “I called the ship Nostromo from [Joseph] Conrad,” Walter Hill told Film International in 2004, “[For] no particular metaphoric idea, I just thought it sounded good.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, indecision was still rife on the actual look of the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Scott on O’Bannon: “He’s great. A really sweet guy. And, I was soon to realise, a real science-fiction freak … He brought in a book by the Swiss artist HR Giger. It’s called Necronomicon … I thought, ‘If we can build that [Necronom IV], that’s it.’ I was stunned, really. I flipped. Literally flipped. And O’Bannon lit up like a lightbulb, shining like a quartz iodine. I realised I was dealing with a real SF freak, which I’d never come across before. I thought, ‘My god, I have an egg-head here for this field.'”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Scott on Cobb: “O’Bannon introduced me to Ron Cobb, a brilliant visualiser of the genre, with whom he’d worked on Dark Star. Cobb seemed to have very realistic visions of both the far and near future, so I quickly decided that he would take a very important part in the making of the film.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cobb on Foss: “Creating spacecraft exteriors came easily to Foss. His mind and imagination seemed to embody the entire history of the industrial revolution. He could conjure up endless spacecraft designs suggesting submarines, diesel locomotives, Mayan interceptors, Mississippi river boats, jumbo space arks, but best of all (ask Dan) were his trademark aero-spacecraft-textures like panels, cowlings, antennae, bulging fuel tanks, vents, graphics etc. As the months passed, along with two or three temporary directors, Chris began to have problems caused by his spectacular creativity. No one in a position to make a decision seemed to be able to make up their mind and/or choose one of his designs. I think Chris was turning out spacecraft designs the decision makers found too original.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ridley himself had input on the design: “I was looking for something like 2001, not the fantasy of Star Wars. I wanted a slow moving, massive piece of steel which was moving along in dead, deep silence … The concept was to have the hull covered with space barnacles or something. I was unable to communicate that idea, and I finally had to go down there and fiddle with the experts. We gradually arrived at a solution.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foss paints a more hectic process. “Finally what happened was that the bloke who had to make the [Nostromo] model completely lost his rag, scooped up a load of paper -they had a room full of smashed-up bits of helicopter and all-sorts- and he just bodged something together. So the actual spaceship in the film hadn’t anything to do with all the days, weeks, months of work that we’d all done. It’s as simple as that.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cobb explained: “Brian Johnson, the special effects supervisor under pressure to build the large Nostromo model, went into the deserted art department and, out of frustration, grabbed all the Chris Foss designs off the wall and took them to Bray studios. There he would choose the design himself in order to have enough time to build the damn thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Johnson had also scooped up Cobb’s art, and though Cobb was concentrating on the designs of the ship’s interior, one of his exterior pieces met with approval over Foss’ designs. “Well I soon found out that Brian found and took all of my exterior design sketches as well,” said Cobb. “About a month later I was told that Brian had used my sketch, ‘Nostromo A’, as the basis for the model, even to the extent that it was painted yellow. Ridley found the colour a bit garish and had it repainted grey.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Ridley had his own very firm ideas about what he physically wanted to do,” Foss said of the process, “and he almost studiously ignored everything that had gone before … I kind of got the impression that Ridley was quietly going his own way, trying to get on with it and get it done, a bit like just another job. I’ve just got dim memories of Ridley being like that and really just ignoring months of input … I just have these memories of feeling a bit miffed that things weren’t put together so much better. And poor old Dan O’Bannon, the bloke whose concept it was, just got absolutely shafted. He was almost like patted on the head: ‘Yeah Dan, yeah Dan, that’s cool.'”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cobb’s sketches, drawings and paintings for the interiors were also okay’ed by Scott and the production. At first Cobb’s designs were slightly more fantastical, with giant screens and computer readouts and windows covered by protective shells that would open up to reveal alien planets ahead of the ship. Though these ideas were scuppered due to time, money, and logistics, many of Cobb’s early designs and ideas were revisited in Prometheus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to designing the Nostromo’s exterior, its bridge and auto-doc, Cobb also designed the ship’s airlocks, cyro-tubes, corridors, bulkheads, an observation dome (not built), Ash’s ‘blister’ observation unit, some of the film’s uniform patches and ship signage, the ‘flying bedstead’ maintenance vehicle (not built), and even Jones’ cat-box. Cobb told Den of Geek that, “My problem with designing Nostromo’s interiors, the control bridge, corridors, auto doc (or med lab), bulkhead doors, the food deck, etc., was that I grew up with a deep fascination for astronomy, astrophysics, and most of all, aerospace flight. My design approach has always been that of a frustrated engineer (as well as a frustrated writer when it came to cinema design). I tend to subscribe to the idea that form follows function. If I’m to arrive at a cinematic spacecraft design that seamlessly preserves, as in this case, the drama of the script, the audience has to experience it as something impressive and believable.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’re beyond 2001 in terms of scientific advances,” said Scott of Alien‘s futurism, “our capabilities are more sophisticated but our ship’s still NASA-orientated, still Earth-manufactured … in our tongue-in-cheek fantasy we project a not-too-distant future in which there are many vehicles tramping around the universe on mining expeditions, erecting military installations, or whatever. At the culmination of many long voyages, each covering many years, these ships -no doubt part of armadas owned by private corporations- look used, beat-up, covered with graffiti, and uncomfortable. We certainly didn’t design the Nostromo to look like a hotel.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t want a conventional shape [for the refinery,] so I drew up a sketch and handed it to the model makers. They refined it, as it were, and built the model. I originally drew it upside-down, with the vague idea that it would resemble a floating inverted cathedral … I think that the machine that they’re on could in fact be 60 years old and just added to over the decades. The metal-work on it could be 50 years old … I would have liked to see it covered with space barnacles or space seaweed, all clogged and choked up, but that was illogical as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;~ Ridley Scott, Fantastic Films, 1979.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Nostromo model was built under the supervision of Nick Allder and Brian Johnson at Bray Studios, not far from Pinewood, where the live-action scenes were being filmed in parallel with the model shots at Bray. For the refinery, Scott instructed the teams at Bray to make it appear “Victorian Gothic,” with towers and spires and antennae. Bray shop worker Dennis Lowe explained: “At that same time in the workshop Ridley was talking about his first concept of the refinery and he was describing an actual oil refinery with pipes and spires, eventually the term ‘Battleship Bismarck in space’ came up to describe the detailing of the model.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Ridley arrived after concluding filming at Pinewood, he further revised the ship’s look, removing many of the spires from the refinery, repainting the Nostromo from yellow to grey, and scrapping every piece of footage shot to date, taking it upon himself to re-direct the scenes. “It was a difficult situation,” said Scott, “Brian Johnson was over there [at Bray], working out of context away from the main unit. I could only look at the rushes while I was working with the actors, and that’s not a very satisfactory way of working. In the end, I think a director must be heavily involved with the miniatures, and that’s why I shot them myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to model builder Jon Sorensen, there were no real hard feelings over the redesigns and reshoots. “Ridley Scott then arrived from Shepperton to take an interest in the models and everything changed radically in terms of tone, colour and look. The yellow was sprayed over a uniform grey. Sections were rebuilt. We started over, discarding all previous footage. There was no anger at this. Surprise maybe. But it was Ridley Scott’s film. We liked him. So we entered the Alien model shoot Part Deux. I recall Bill Pearson and I talking once on what we thought was an empty, lunch-time model stage when a voice spoke from the shadows. Ridley, asking what we were discussing. We answered that maybe that part might look better moved over to there, (we were discussing the refinery). He smiled back and I guess that signalled what was true; we’d go all the way to help him. That night he bought both Bill and I a beer, a move which astonished the Assistant Director, Ray Beckett who complained that in 10 years of working with Ridley, he’d never been bought a beer. So we bought Ray one instead.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Nostromo interiors were overseen by art director Roger Christian, who had helped craft the sets for Star Wars. Christian told Shadowlocked.com: “I art-directed Alien for Ridley Scott with my team because he was struggling to get the designer and the art department to understand ‘that look’ I created with the dressing on Star Wars … I went into Shepperton, and we built and dressed the first corridor section – actually for a test screen for Sigourney Weaver, who the studios were not sure about. I brought my little team of prop guys who’d understood then the process of what to strip down and how to place it. Because it was not something you just do randomly. It had to be done based on a kind of knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Roger is a brilliant set dresser,” Scott told Fantastic Films. “Though his department was not designing the corridors and sets, their ‘cladding’ of the walls made everything look absolutely real. He would go out with his buyers and prop men and visit aircraft dumps or army surplus stores and drag masses of things in for me to see.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“With Alien I was able to go much further with the oily and gritty look than in Star Wars,” said Roger Christian, “and for the first time create a totally believable ‘space truck’, as Ridley described it. The set ended up looking as if we had rented a well-travelled, well-used, oily, dirty, mineral carrier – an unmistakably real and claustrophobic space vessel. I think this really helped audiences to identify with the movie, as the characters were so like space truckers, trapped in a claustrophobic nightmare.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[The Nostromo’s] like the bloody Queen Mary. Do you get a sense of scale in the interior? That it’s big? We couldn’t build the two to three-hundred foot-long corridors which it would have but it’s supposed to be like one of these huge Japanese super-tankers. Three quarters of a mile long. The refinery behind it god-knows how big. I mean… I dunno. A mile square?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;~ Ridley Scott, Fantastic Films, 1979.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Ridley saw the ship very much as a metaphor for a Gothic castle,” said Ron Cobb on the subject of the ship’s interiors, “or a WWII submarine … a kind of retro, accessible technology with great big transistors and very low-res video screens.” However, at one point, Scott had other ideas for the Nostromo’s technology: “I wanted to have wafer-thin screens that are plexiglas, that just float on clips -and of course today you’ve got computer screens exactly like that- because I figured that’s where it [technology] would go. I really got those things off Jean Giraud, Moebius, when he’d been drawing and speculating. A lot of his stuff you see thirty years ago is now.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cobb acknowledged the Moebius influence, as well as the ship’s other, perhaps subtler, inspirations: “The ship is a strange mixture of retrofitted old technology, a kind of industrial nightmare, like being trapped in a factory … Ridley’s a wonderful artist and he wanted it to look a lot like a Moebius-designed ship, with all kinds of rounds surfaces and with an Egyptian motif.” This Egyptian motif is prevalent in the Weylan-Yutani logo, a wings of Horus design which adorns the uniforms of the crew in addition to their coffee cups, beer cans, etc. The hypersleep chamber also evokes a burial chamber, with the cryo-chambers arranged in a lotus shape. In addition to the Egyptian motif, another influence was Japan. “The owners of the Nostromo are Japanese,” Scott told Fantastic Films.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“As I was working with the art director,” said Ridley, “I decided to make it faintly glittery. I wanted to have sort of anodized gold everywhere. Not steel, gold. Did you know that space landing craft are covered with gold foil? Amazing! So I thought, Why make this out of steel? Let’s make it all warm and oppressive, massive, and gold.'”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The glittery look can be seen in the opening shots of the ship’s computers bleeping into life, and the gold sheen is most prevalent in the ship’s maintenance area, where Brett finds the Alien’s discarded skin moments before his death. Scott explained the design process for the ship’s golden-hued maintenance garage: “We got hold of marvelous, actual parts of actual huge jet engines and installed them, and they’re like a coppery metal with some steel. We used them as four main supports, like columns, and they give a lot of the feeling of a temple. We played the same music we used in the derelict alien craft and we had two temples. The idol I wanted was through these massive gold doors which were as big as a wall, with a gap in them through which the claw [landing leg] can be seen. When that set was dressed, it looked like Aladdin’s Cave … [the garage is] filled with the equipment that the crew would use in their work on and around the refinery, and when they land on various planets – land crawlers, helicopters, other flying machines.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Ridley has this lavish, sensual visual style,” summarised Dan O’Bannon to Fantastic Films in 1979, “and I think that Ridley is one of the ‘good guys.’ I really think that he was the final pivot point responsible for the picture coming out good. And so a lot of the visual design and a lot of the mood elements inherent in the camerawork, while they’re not what I planned, are great. They’re just different.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;O’Bannon also nodded to the contributions of Cobb, Foss, Shusett etc., to the picture: “Also, it’s not 100% Ridley either. It’s Ridley superimposing his vision over the cumulative vision of others, you see. Now this could be such a strong director’s picture because Ridley’s directorial and visual hand is so strong. There will probably be tendency among critics to refer to it as Ridley Scott’s vision of the future. And he did have a vision of the future. But it was everybody else that came before, that’s what his vision is … if it sounds like I’m knocking Ridley, I’m not.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

In this work, we investigate their self-attention maps can be reinterpreted as semantic label propagation kernels, providing robust pixel-level correspondences between relevant image regions. Extending this mechanism across frames yields a temporal propagation kernel that enables zero-shot object tracking via segmentation in videos. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of test-time optimization strategies-DDIM inversion, textual inversion, and adaptive head weighting-in adapting diffusion features for robust and consistent label propagation. Building on these findings, we introduce DRIFT, a framework for object tracking in videos leveraging a pretrained image diffusion model with SAM-guided mask refinement, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on standard video object segmentation benchmarks.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;16 Statistical Process Control in &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this workshop, we will learn how to perform statistical process control in Python, using statistical tools and &lt;code&gt;plotnine&lt;/code&gt; visualizations! Statistical Process Control refers to using statistics to (1) measure variation in product quality over time and (2) identify benchmarks to know when intervention is needed. Let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting Started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Packages&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Remember to install these packages using a terminal, if you haven't already!
!pip install pandas plotnine scipy&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll be using &lt;code&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt; for data manipulation, &lt;code&gt;plotnine&lt;/code&gt; for visualization, and &lt;code&gt;scipy&lt;/code&gt; for statistical functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Custom Functions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This workshop uses custom functions from the &lt;code&gt;functions/&lt;/code&gt; directory. You may need both:
- &lt;code&gt;functions_distributions.py&lt;/code&gt; - for reliability and distribution functions
- &lt;code&gt;functions_process_control.py&lt;/code&gt; - for statistical process control functions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use these functions, you need to acquire them from the repository at github.com/timothyfraser/sigma/tree/main/functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add the functions directory to your Python path&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import sys
import os
# Add the functions directory to Python path
sys.path.append('functions')  # or path to wherever you placed the functions folder&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have the functions available, you can import them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Our Case&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For today’s workshop, we’re going to think about why quality control matters in a local economy, by examining the case of the Japanese Hot Springs bath economy! Hot springs, or onsen, are a major source of tourism and recreation for families in Japan, bringing residents from across the country every year to often rural communities where the right geological conditions have brought on naturally occurring hot springs. Restaurants, taxi and bus companies, and many service sector firms rely on their local onsen to bring in a steady stream (pun intended) of tourists to the local economy. So, it’s often in the best interest of onsen operators to keep an eye on the temperature, minerals, or other aspects of their hot springs baths to ensure quality control, to keep up their firm (and town’s!) reputation for quality rest and relaxation!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Onsen-goers often seek out specific types of hot springs, so it’s important for an onsen to actually provide what it advertises! Serbulea and Payyappallimana (2012) describe some of these benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temperature: Onsen are divided into “Extra Hot Springs” (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;42°C&lt;/code&gt;), “Hot Springs” (&lt;code&gt;41~34°C&lt;/code&gt;), and “Warm Springs” (&lt;code&gt;33~25°C&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;pH: Onsen are classified into “Acidic” (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pH &amp;lt; 3&lt;/code&gt;), “Mildly Acidic” (&lt;code&gt;pH 3~6&lt;/code&gt;), “Neutral” (&lt;code&gt;pH 6~7.5&lt;/code&gt;), “Mildly alkaline” (&lt;code&gt;pH 7.5~8.5&lt;/code&gt;), and “Alkaline” (&lt;code&gt;pH &amp;gt; 8.5&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sulfur: Sulfur onsen typically have about 2mg of sulfur per 1kg of hot spring water; sulfur levels must exceed 1 mg to count as a Sulfur onsen. (It smells like rotten eggs!)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are decent examples of quality control metrics that onsen operators might want to keep tabs on!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Our Data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ve been hired to evaluate quality control at a local onsen in sunny Kagoshima prefecture! Every month, for 15 months, you systematically took 20 random samples of hot spring water and recorded its temperature, pH, and sulfur levels. How might you determine if this onsen is at risk of slipping out of one sector of the market (eg. Extra Hot!) and into another (just normal Hot Springs?).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s read in our data from &lt;code&gt;workshops/onsen.csv&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Add functions directory to path if not already there
import sys
if 'functions' not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append('functions')

from functions_distributions import density, tidy_density, approxfun

water = pd.read_csv('workshops/onsen.csv')
water.head(3)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;##    id  time  temp   ph  sulfur
## 0   1     1  43.2  5.1     0.0
## 1   2     1  45.3  4.8     0.4
## 2   3     1  45.5  6.2     0.9&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;16.1 Process Descriptive Statistics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let’s get a sense of our process by calculating some basic descriptive statistics. We’ll create a simple function to calculate the mean and standard deviation, which are fundamental to evaluating process variation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;from pandas import Series
def describe(x: Series):
  x = Series(x)
  out = pd.DataFrame({
    'mean': [x.mean()],
    'sd': [x.std()],
  })
  out['caption'] = ("Process Mean: " + out['mean'].round(2).astype(str) +
                    " | SD: " + out['sd'].round(2).astype(str))
  return out

tab = describe(water['temp'])
tab&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;##     mean        sd                         caption
## 0  44.85  1.989501  Process Mean: 44.85 | SD: 1.99&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s apply this to our temperature data to see the overall process mean and variation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;16.2 Process Overview Visual&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The process overview chart is one of the most important tools in SPC. It shows us how our process behaves over time, helping us identify patterns, trends, and potential issues. We’ll create a visualization that shows individual measurements, subgroup means, and the overall process average.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;g1 = (ggplot(water, aes(x='time', y='temp', group='time')) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept=water['temp'].mean()), color='lightgrey', size=3) +
  geom_jitter(height=0, width=0.25) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x='Time (Subgroup)', y='Temperature (Celsius)', subtitle='Process Overview', caption=tab['caption'][0]))

# Save the plot
g1.save('images/05_process_overview.png', width=8, height=6, dpi=100)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;g2 = (ggplot(water, aes(x='temp')) + geom_histogram(bins=15, color='white', fill='grey') + theme_void() + coord_flip())

# Save the plot
g2.save('images/05_process_histogram.png', width=8, height=6, dpi=100)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The histogram shows us the distribution of all temperature measurements, giving us insight into the overall process variation. This helps us understand if our process is centered and how much variation we’re seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;16.3 Subgroup (Within-Group) Statistics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In SPC, we often work with subgroups - small samples taken at regular intervals. This allows us to distinguish between common cause variation (inherent to the process) and special cause variation (due to specific events). Let’s calculate statistics for each subgroup to see how the process behaves over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;stat_s = (water.groupby('time').apply(lambda d: pd.Series({
  'xbar': d['temp'].mean(),
  'r': d['temp'].max() - d['temp'].min(),
  'sd': d['temp'].std(),
  'nw': len(d)
})).reset_index())
stat_s['df'] = stat_s['nw'] - 1
stat_s['sigma_s'] = ( (stat_s['df'] * (stat_s['sd']**2)).sum() / stat_s['df'].sum() )**0.5
stat_s['se'] = stat_s['sigma_s'] / (stat_s['nw']**0.5)
stat_s['upper'] = stat_s['xbar'].mean() + 3*stat_s['se']
stat_s['lower'] = stat_s['xbar'].mean() - 3*stat_s['se']
stat_s.head(3)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;##    time    xbar    r        sd    nw    df   sigma_s        se      upper      lower
## 0     1  44.635  4.2  1.342533  20.0  19.0  1.986174  0.444122  46.182366  43.517634
## 1     3  45.305  7.9  2.001440  20.0  19.0  1.986174  0.444122  46.182366  43.517634
## 2     5  44.765  5.9  1.628133  20.0  19.0  1.986174  0.444122  46.182366  43.517634&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we’ve calculated key statistics for each subgroup:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;xbar: The mean of each subgroup&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;r: The range (max - min) within each subgroup&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;sd: The standard deviation within each subgroup&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;sigma_s: The pooled within-subgroup standard deviation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;se: The standard error for each subgroup mean&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;16.3.1 Total Statistics (Between Groups)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s calculate the overall process statistics that summarize the behavior across all subgroups:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;stat_t = pd.DataFrame({
  'xbbar': [stat_s['xbar'].mean()],
  'rbar': [stat_s['r'].mean()],
  'sdbar': [stat_s['sd'].mean()],
  'sigma_s': [(stat_s['sd']**2).mean()**0.5],
  'sigma_t': [water['temp'].std()]

    &lt;p&gt;Control charts are the heart of SPC. They help us monitor process stability over time and detect when the process is out of control. We’ll create charts for both the subgroup means (X-bar chart) and standard deviations (S chart).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;labels = pd.DataFrame({

    &lt;p&gt;When we have individual measurements rather than subgroups, we use moving range charts. The moving range is the absolute difference between consecutive measurements, which helps us estimate process variation when we can’t calculate within-subgroup statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

sigma_s = mrbar / d2
se = sigma_s / (1**0.5)
upper = mrbar + 3*se
lower = 0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;istat = pd.DataFrame({'time': indiv['time'].iloc[1:], 'mr': mr, 'mrbar': mrbar, 'upper': upper, 'lower': lower})

# Save the plot
mr_chart.save('images/05_moving_range_chart.png', width=8, height=6, dpi=100)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The moving range chart shows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Center line: The average moving range (mrbar)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Upper control limit: Based on the estimated process standard deviation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lower control limit: Set to 0 (moving ranges can’t be negative)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Individual points: Each moving range value&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This chart helps us monitor process variation when we have individual measurements rather than subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pythonâs async model is misunderstood, especially by engineers coming from JS or C#. In Python, awaiting a coroutine doesnât yield to the event loop. Only tasks create concurrency. This post explains why that distinction matters and how it affects locking, design, and correctness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every engineer has had that moment during a review where a comment sticks in their head longer than it should.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my case, it was a simple suggestion:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;âYou should add more locks here: this code is async, so anything might interleave.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The code in question touched a shared cache, and on the surface the comment made sense. Multiple asyncio tasks were hitting the same structure, and the function modifying it was async. Shouldn't that mean I need more locks?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That review pushed me down a rabbit hole. Not about the cache (it was tiny) but about the mental model many engineers (including experienced ones) bring to Python's async system. A model shaped by JavaScript or C#: all languages where await means "yield to the runtime now."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Python isn't those languages. And misunderstanding this fundamental difference leads to unnecessary locking, accidental complexity, and subtle bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post is the explanation I wish more engineers had.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The misconception: await gives up control (in every languageâ¦ right?)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're coming from JavaScript, the rule is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Every await always yields to the event loop.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Every async function always returns a task (a Promise).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The moment you write await, the runtime can schedule something else.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In C#, the story is nearly identical:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt;functions return&lt;code&gt;Task&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;Task&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt;always represents a suspension point.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The runtime decides when to resume you.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Java's virtual-thread world (Project Loom), the principle is very similar: when you submit work to run asynchronously, typically via an &lt;code&gt;ExecutorService&lt;/code&gt; backed by virtual threads, you're creating tasks. And when you call &lt;code&gt;Future.get()&lt;/code&gt;, the virtual thread suspends until the result is ready. The suspension is inexpensive, but it still constitutes a full scheduling boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So developers internalize one big rule:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;âAny async boundary is a suspension point.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then they bring that rule to Python.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;But Python is different: it has two async concepts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Python splits things into:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Coroutines&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defined with async def, but not scheduled. A coroutine object is just a state machine with potential suspension points.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Python immediately steps into the coroutine and executes it inside the current task, synchronously, until it either finishes or hits a suspension point (await something_not_ready).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No event-loop scheduling happens here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Tasks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Created with asyncio.create_task(coro). Tasks are the unit of concurrency in Python. The event loop interleaves tasks, not coroutines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This distinction is not cosmetic: itâs the reason many developers misunderstand Python's async semantics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The key truth: await on a coroutine does NOT yield to the event loop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This sentence is the entire post:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Awaiting a coroutine does not give control back to the event loop. Awaiting a task does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A coroutine is more like a nested function call that can pause, but it doesn't pause by default. It only yields if and when it reaches an awaitable that isn't ready.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;JavaScript&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Java&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;C#&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not expose this difference. In those languages, an "async function" is always a task. You never await a "bare coroutine." Every await is a potential context switch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Python breaks that assumption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Concrete Example 1: Awaiting a coroutine is synchronous&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's make the behavior painfully explicit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Output:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice what didn't happen:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No other task ran between "child start" and "child end".&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;await child()&lt;/code&gt;did not give the event loop a chance to schedule anything else until&lt;code&gt;child()&lt;/code&gt;itself awaited&lt;code&gt;asyncio.sleep&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;await child()&lt;/code&gt; simply inlined the coroutine's body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not how JavaScript behaves. This is not how C# behaves. This is not how Java behaves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Concrete Example 2: Tasks actually introduce concurrency&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Change one line:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now the output interleaves depending on the scheduler:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because now we have a task, and awaiting a task does yield to the event loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tasks are where concurrency comes from, not coroutines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This single difference is where most incorrect locking recommendations arise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Suspension points define concurrency, not async or await&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let's extract the general rule:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An async def function is not automatically concurrent.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt;is not a scheduling point unless the inner awaitable suspends.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Concurrency exists only across tasks and only at actual suspension points.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why the code review suggestion I received, "add more locks, itâs async!", was based on the wrong mental model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mutation block contained no awaits. The only awaits happened before acquiring the lock. Therefore:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The critical section was atomic relative to the event loop.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No other task could interleave inside the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;More locks would not increase safety.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cache wasn't the story. My reviewer's misconception was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Python chose this design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Python's async model evolved from generators (&lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;yield from&lt;/code&gt;), rather than green threads or promises. Coroutines are an evolution of these primitives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This legacy leads to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A more explicit boundary between structured control flow and scheduled concurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The ability to write async code that behaves synchronously until a real suspension occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fine-grained control over when interleaving can happen.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also leads to confusion among developers coming from JavaScript, Java, or C#, languages where async automatically means "this is a task."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Python leaves "is this a task?" up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Putting it all together: a mental model that actually works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the model I now advocate whenever reviewing asyncio code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Coroutines are callables with potential suspension points: they do not run concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only tasks introduce concurrency: if you never call&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;asyncio.create_task&lt;/code&gt;, you may not have any concurrency at all.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Concurrency occurs only at suspension points: no await inside a block â no interleave â no need for locks there.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Locks should protect data across tasks, not coroutines: lock where suspension is possible, not where the keyword async appears.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Practical guidelines for real codebases&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audit where tasks are created: every&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;asyncio.create_task()&lt;/code&gt;is a concurrency boundary.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Scan critical sections for suspension points: if there's no await inside the lock, the block is atomic relative to the event loop.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Prefer "compute outside, mutate inside": compute values before acquiring the lock, then mutate quickly inside it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Teach the difference explicitly: a surprising number of experienced engineers haven't internalized coroutine vs task separation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion: Python async isnât JavaScript async&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you internalize that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;JavaScript: async function â always a task&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;C#: async â always a task&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Java (Loom's&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;VirtualThread&lt;/code&gt;)): async â always a task&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Python: async def â only a coroutine; task creation is explicit&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the whole model makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Python's await isn't a context switch. It's a structured control flow that might suspend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That difference is why I didn't add more locks to my cache code. And it's why I now review Python async code by asking a much better question:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Where can this code actually interleave?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That single question catches more bugs and eliminates more unnecessary complexity than any blanket rule about locking in async systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
