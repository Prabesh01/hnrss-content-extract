  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AWS CEO Matt Garman outlined 3 solid reasons why companies should not focus on cutting junior developer roles, noting that they âare actually the most experienced with the AI toolsâ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3 Reasons AI Should Not Replace Junior Developers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a tech world obsessed with AI replacing human workers, Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS), is pushing back against one of the industryâs most popular cost-cutting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking on WIREDâs The Big Interview podcast, Garman has a bold message for companies racing to cut costs with AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He was asked to explain why he once called replacing junior employees with AI âone of the dumbest ideasâ heâd ever heard, and to expand on how he believes agentic AI will actually change the workplace in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1) Junior Devs Often Know AI Tools Better&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, junior employees are often better with AI tools than senior staff.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;âNumber one, my experience is that many of the most junior folks are actually the most experienced with the AI tools. So they're actually most able to get the most out of them.â&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fresh grads have grown up with new technology, so they can adapt quickly. Many of them learn AI-powered tools while studying or during internships. They tend to explore new features, find quick methods to write code, and figure out how to get the best results from AI agents.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to the 2025 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 55.5% of early-career developers reported using AI tools daily in their development process, higher than for the experienced folks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This comfort with new tools allows them to work more efficiently. In contrast, senior developers have established workflows and may take more time to adopt. Recent research shows that over half of Gen Z employees are actually helping senior colleagues upskill in AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2) Junior Developers Shouldnât Be The Default Cost-Saving Move&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, junior staff are usually the least expensive employees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;âNumber two, they're usually the least expensive because they're right out of college, and they generally make less. So if you're thinking about cost optimization, they're not the only people you would want to optimize around.â&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Junior employees usually get much less in salary and benefits, so removing them does not deliver huge savings. If a company is trying to save money, it doesnât make that much financial sense.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, when companies talk about increasing profit margins, junior employees should not be the default or only target. True optimization, Real cost-cutting means looking at the whole company because there are plenty of other places where expenses can be trimmed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, 30% of companies that laid off workers expecting savings ended up increasing expenses, and many had to rehire later.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3) Removing Juniors Breaks the Talent Pipeline&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, companies need fresh talent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;âThree, at some point, that whole thing explodes on itself. If you have no talent pipeline that you're building and no junior people that you're mentoring and bringing up through the company, we often find that that's where we get some of the best ideas.â&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of a company like a sports team. If you only keep veteran players and never recruit rookies, what happens when those veterans retire? You are left with no one who knows how to play the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, hiring people straight out of college brings new ways of thinking into the workplace. They have fresh ideas shaped by the latest trends, motivation to innovate.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More importantly, they form the foundation of a companyâs future workforce. If a company decides to stop hiring junior employees altogether, it cuts off its own talent pipeline. Over time, that leads to fewer leaders to promote from within.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Deloitte report also notes that the tech workforce is expected to grow at roughly twice the rate of the overall U.S. workforce, highlighting the demand for tech talent. Without a strong pipeline of junior developers coming in, companies might face a tech talent shortage.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When there are not enough junior hires being trained today, teams struggle to fill roles tomorrow, especially as projects scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isnât just corporate talk. As the leader of one of the worldâs largest cloud computing platforms, serving everyone from Netflix to the U.S. intelligence agencies, Garman has a front-row seat to how companies are actually using AI.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And what he is seeing makes him worried that short-term thinking could damage businesses for years to come. Garmanâs point is grounded in long-term strategy. A company that relies solely on AI to handle tasks without training new talent could find itself short of people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, Garman admits the next few years will be bumpy. âYour job is going to change,â he said. He believes AI will make companies more productive as well as the employees.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When technology makes something easier, people want more of it. AI enables the creation of software faster, allowing companies to develop more products, enter new markets, and serve more customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developers will be responsible for more than just writing code, with faster adaptation to new technologies becoming essential. But he has a hopeful message in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thatâs why Geoffrey Hinton has advised that Computer Science degrees remain essential. This directly supports Matt Garmanâs point. Fresh talent with a strong understanding of core fundamentals becomes crucial for filling these higher-value roles of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;âIâm very confident in the medium to longer term that AI will definitely create more jobs than it removes at first,â Garman said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Containers are the universal path to production for most developers, and Docker has always been the steward of the ecosystem. Docker Hub has over 20 billion monthly pulls, with nearly 90% of organizations now relying on containers in their software delivery workflows. That gives us a responsibility: to help secure the software supply chain for the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? Supply-chain attacks are exploding. In 2025, they caused more than $60 billion in damage, tripling from 2021. No one is safe. Every language, every ecosystem, every build and distribution step is a target.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this reason, we launched Docker Hardened Images (DHI), a secure, minimal, production-ready set of images, in May 2025, and since then have hardened over 1,000 images and helm charts in our catalog. Today, we are establishing a new industry standard by making DHI freely available and open source to everyone who builds software. All 26 Million+ developers in the container ecosystem. DHI is fully open and free to use, share, and build on with no licensing surprises, backed by an Apache 2.0 license. DHI now gives the world a secure, minimal, production-ready foundation from the very first pull.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it sounds too good to be true, here’s the bottom line up front: every developer and every application can (and should!) use DHI without restrictions. When you need continuous security patching, applied in under 7 days, images for regulated industries (e.g., FIPS, FedRAMP), you want to build customized images on our secure build infrastructure, or you need security patches beyond end-of-life, DHI has commercial offerings. Simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the introduction of DHI, enterprises like Adobe and Qualcomm have bet on Docker for securing their entire enterprise to achieve the most stringent levels of compliance, while startups like Attentive and Octopus Deploy have accelerated their ability to get compliance and sell to larger businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now everyone and every application can build securely from the first &lt;code&gt;docker build&lt;/code&gt;. Unlike other opaque or proprietary hardened images, DHI is compatible with Alpine and Debian, trusted and familiar open source foundations teams already know and can adopt with minimal change. And while some vendors suppress CVEs in their feed to maintain a green scanner, Docker is always transparent, even when we’re still working on patches, because we fundamentally believe you should always know what your security posture is. The result: dramatically reduced CVEs (guaranteed near zero in DHI Enterprise), images up to 95 percent smaller, and secure defaults without ever compromising transparency or trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s more. We’ve already built Hardened Helm Charts to leverage DHI images in Kubernetes environments; those are open source too. And today, we’re expanding that foundation with Hardened MCP Servers. We’re bringing DHI’s security principles to the MCP interface layer, the backbone of every agentic app. And starting now, you can run hardened versions of the MCP servers developers rely on most: Mongo, Grafana, GitHub, and more. And this is just the beginning. In the coming months, we will extend this hardened foundation across the entire software stack with hardened libraries, hardened system packages, and other secure components everyone depends on. The goal is simple: be able to secure your application from &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; down. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The philosophy of Docker Hardened Images&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Base images define your application’s security from the very first layer, so it’s critical to know exactly what goes into them. Here’s how we approach it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First: total transparency in every part of our minimal, opinionated, secure images.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DHI uses a distroless runtime to shrink the attack surface while keeping the tools developers rely on. But security is more than minimalism; it requires full transparency. Too many vendors blur the truth with proprietary CVE scoring, downgraded vulnerabilities, or vague promises about reaching SLSA Build Level 3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DHI takes a different path. Every image includes a complete and verifiable SBOM. Every build provides SLSA Build Level 3 provenance. Every vulnerability is assessed using transparent public CVE data; we won’t hide vulnerabilities when we haven’t fixed them. Every image comes with proof of authenticity. The result: a secure foundation you can trust, built with clarity, verified with evidence, and delivered without compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second: Migrating to secure images takes real work, and no one should pretend otherwise. But as you’d expect from Docker, we’ve focused on making the DX incredibly easy to use. As we mentioned before, DHI is built on the open source foundations the world already trusts, Debian and Alpine, so teams can adopt it with minimal friction. We’re reducing that friction even more: Docker’s AI assistant can scan your existing containers and recommend or even apply equivalent hardened images; the feature is experimental as this is day one, but we’ll quickly GA it as we learn from real world migrations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly: we think about the most aggressive SLAs and longest support times and make certain that every piece of DHI can support that when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DHI Enterprise, the commercial offering of DHI, includes a 7-day commitment for critical CVE remediation, with a roadmap toward one day or less. For regulated industries and mission-critical systems, this level of trust is mandatory. Achieving it is hard. It demands deep test automation and the ability to maintain patches that diverge from upstream until they are accepted. That is why most organizations cannot do this on their own. In addition, DHI Enterprise allows organizations to easily customize DHI images, leveraging Docker’s build infrastructure which takes care of the full image lifecycle management for you, ensuring that build provenance and compliance is maintained. For example, typically organizations need to add certificates and keys, system packages, scripts, and so on. DHI’s build service makes this trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because our patching SLAs and our build service carry real operational cost, DHI has historically been one commercial offering. But our vision has always been broader. This level of security should be available to everyone, and the timing matters. Now that the evidence, infrastructure, and industry partnerships are in place, we are delivering on that vision. That is why today we are making Docker Hardened Images free and open source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This move carries the same spirit that defined Docker Official Images over a decade ago. We made them free, kept them free, and backed them with clear docs, best practices, and consistent maintenance. That foundation became the starting point for millions of developers and partners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we’re doing it again. DHI being free is powered by a rapidly growing ecosystem of partners, from Google, MongoDB, and the CNCF delivering hardened images to security platforms like Snyk and JFrog Xray integrating DHI directly into their scanners. Together, we are building a unified, end-to-end supply chain that raises the security bar for the entire industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;“Docker’s move to make its hardened images freely available under Apache 2.0 underscores its strong commitment to the open source ecosystem. Many CNCF projects can already be found in the DHI catalog, and giving the broader community access to secure, well-maintained building blocks helps us strengthen the software supply chain together. It’s exciting to see Docker continue to invest in open collaboration and secure container infrastructure.”&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Executive Director at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;“Software supply chain attacks are a severe industry problem. Making Docker Hardened Images free and pervasive should underpin faster, more secure software delivery across the industry by making the right thing the easy thing for developers.”&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Analyst and Co-founder, RedMonk&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;“Security shouldn’t be a premium feature. By making hardened images free, Docker is letting every developer, not just big enterprises, start with a safer foundation. We love seeing tools that reduce noise and toil, and we’re ready to run these secure workloads on Google Cloud from day one”&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;“At MongoDB, we believe open source plays a central role in how modern software is built, enabling flexibility, choice, and developer productivity. That’s why we’re excited about free Docker Hardened Images for MongoDB. These images provide trusted, ready-to-deploy building blocks on proven Linux foundations such as Alpine and Debian, and with an Apache 2.0 license, they remain fully open source and free for anyone to use. With Docker Hub’s global reach and MongoDB’s commitment to reliability and safety, we are making it easier to build with confidence on a secure and open foundation for the future”&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Chief Technology Officer, MongoDB&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;“We’re excited to partner with Docker to deliver secure, enterprise-grade AI workloads from development to production. With over 50 million users and the majority of Fortune 500 trusting Anaconda to help them operate at enterprise scale securely, this partnership with Docker brings that same foundation to Docker Hardened Images. This enables teams to spend less time managing risk and more time innovating, while reducing the time from idea to production.”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David DeSanto&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer, Anaconda&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;“Socket stops malicious packages at install time, and Docker Hardened Images (DHI) give those packages a trustworthy place to run. With free DHI, teams get both layers of protection without lifting a finger. Pull a hardened image, run npm install, and the Socket firewall embedded in the DHI is already working for you. That is what true secure-by-default should look like, and we’re excited to partner with Docker and make it happen at their scale.”&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Founder and CEO, Socket&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;“Teams building with Temporal orchestrate mission-critical workflows, and Docker is how they deploy those services in production. Making Docker Hardened Images freely available gives our users a very strong foundation for those workflows from day one, and Extended Lifecycle Support helps them keep long running systems secure without constant replatforming.”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maxim Fateev&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chief Technology Officer, Temporal&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;“At CircleCI, we know teams need to validate code as fast as they can generate it—and that starts with a trusted foundation. Docker Hardened Images eliminate a critical validation bottleneck by providing pre-secured, continuously verified components right from the start, helping teams ship fast, with confidence.”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rob Zuber&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chief Technology Officer, CircleCI&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;“We evaluated multiple options for hardened base images and chose Docker Hardened Images (DHI) for its alignment with our supply chain security posture, developer tooling compatibility, Docker’s maturity in this space, and integration with our existing infrastructure. Our focus was on balancing trust, maintainability, and ecosystem compatibility.”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vikram Sethi&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Principal Scientist, Adobe&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;“Developers deserve secure foundations that do not slow them down. By making Docker Hardened Images freely available, Docker is making it easier than ever to secure the software supply chain at the source. This helps eliminate risk before anything touches production, a mission shared by LocalStack. At LocalStack, we are especially excited that developers will be able to use these hardened, minimal images for our emulators, helping teams finally break free from constant CVE firefighting.”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Waldemar Hummer&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Co-Founder and CTO at LocalStack&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Secure Path for Every Team and Business&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone now has a secure foundation to start from with DHI. But businesses of all shapes and sizes often need more. Compliance requirements and risk tolerance may demand CVE patches ahead of upstream the moment the source becomes available. Companies operating in enterprise or government sectors must meet strict standards such as FIPS or STIG. And because production can never stop, many organizations need security patching to continue even after upstream support ends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is why we now offer three DHI options, each built for a different security reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Docker Hardened Images: Free for Everyone. DHI is the foundation modern software deserves: minimal hardened images, easy migration, full transparency, and an open ecosystem built on Alpine and Debian.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Docker Hardened Images (DHI) Enterprise: DHI Enterprise delivers the guarantees that organizations, governments, and institutions with strict security or regulatory demands rely on. FIPS-enabled and STIG-ready images. Compliance with CIS benchmarks. SLA-backed remediations they can trust for critical CVEs in under 7 days. And those SLAs keep getting shorter as we push toward one-day (or less) critical fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For teams that need more control, DHI Enterprise delivers. Change your images. Configure runtimes. Install tools like curl. Add certificates. DHI Enterprise gives you unlimited customization, full catalog access, and the ability to shape your images on your terms while staying secure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DHI Extended Lifecycle Support (ELS): ELS is a paid add-on to DHI Enterprise, built to solve one of software’s hardest problems. When upstream support ends, patches stop but vulnerabilities don’t. Scanners light up, auditors demand answers, and compliance frameworks expect verified fixes. ELS ends that cycle with up to five additional years of security coverage, continuous CVE patches, updated SBOMs and provenance, and ongoing signing and auditability for compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can learn more about these options here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Here’s how to get started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Securing the container ecosystem is something we do together. Today, we’re giving the world a stronger foundation to build on. Now we want every developer, every open source project, every software vendor, and every platform to make Docker Hardened Images the default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Join our launch webinar to get hands-on and learn what’s new.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start using Docker Hardened Images today for free.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Christian Dupuis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s announcement marks a watershed moment for our industry. Docker is fundamentally changing how applications are built-secure by default for every developer, every organization, and every open-source project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This moment fills me with pride as it represents the culmination of years of work: from the early days at Atomist building an event-driven SBOM and vulnerability management system, the foundation that still underpins Docker Scout today, to unveiling DHI earlier this year, and now making it freely available to all. I am deeply grateful to my incredible colleagues and friends at Docker who made this vision a reality, and to our partners and customers who believed in us from day one and shaped this journey with their guidance and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet while this is an important milestone, it remains just that, a milestone. We are far from done, with many more innovations on the horizon. In fact, we are already working on what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security is a team sport, and today Docker opened the field to everyone. Let’s play.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Michael Donovan&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I joined Docker to positively impact as many developers as possible. This launch gives every developer the right to secure their applications without adding toil to their workload. It represents a monumental shift in the container ecosystem and the digital experiences we use every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m extremely proud of the product we’ve built and the customers we serve every day. I’ve had the time of my life building this with our stellar team and I’m more excited than ever for what’s to come next.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;OBS Studio Gets A New Renderer: How OBS Adopted Metal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting with OBS Studio 32.0.0 a new renderer backend based on Apple's Metal graphics API is available for users to test as an experimental alternative to the existing OpenGL backend on macOS. This marks an important step in OBS Studio's development to adapt one of the modern APIs that deliberately broke with the past to unlock better performance and efficiency gains for end users, but also require fundamental changes to how an application interacts with a GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These fundamental changes were necessary to achieve the goals of lower overhead, faster performance, and to better represent the way that modern GPUs actually work, particularly when the GPU is used for more than just 3D rendering. Yet other changes were also necessary due to the way Metal was specifically designed to fit into Apple's operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to the sheer amount of information around this topic, it made sense to split it into separate posts:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;The first post (this one) will go into specific challenges and insights from writing the Metal backend for OBS Studio.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The second post will look at the history of 3D graphics APIs, their core differences, and how the design of the new generation creates challenges for existing renderers like the one in OBS Studio.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Metal backend is explicitly marked as "Experimental" in the application because it has some known quirks (for which no good solutions have been found yet, more about that below) but also because it has not yet been tested by a larger user audience. The OpenGL renderer is still the default choice offered to users and will be available for the foreseeable future, but we still would like to invite users to try out the Metal backend for themselves, and report any critical bugs they might encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better yet, if you happen to have prior experience working with Metal on Apple Silicon platforms (including iPhones), we'd be happy to hear feedback about specific aspects of the current implementation or even review pull-requests with improvements to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 1.1: The Why Of Metal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In June 2014 Apple announced (and - more importantly - also released to developers) the first version of Metal for iPhones with Apple's A7 SOC, extending its support to current Macs of the time in 2015. Thus Metal was not only available on what became later known as "Apple Silicon" GPUs, but also Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA GPUs, being the first "next generation" graphics API to support all mainstream GPUs of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Metal combined many benefits to Apple specifically: The API was based on concepts and ideas that not only already found their way into AMD's "Mantle" API (which was announced in September 2013) but had also been discussed for and adopted to some degree in the existing graphics APIs (OpenGL and Direct3D) at the time. But as a new API written from scratch it had the chance to omit all the legacy aspects of existing APIs and fully lean into these new concepts. It was able to provide the performance gains unlocked by this different approach and as it was originally designed for iOS and macOS, an entirely new API implemented in Objective-C and Swift (the latter of which was also introduced in 2014).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While OpenGL did (and still does) provide a well-established C-based API, it incorporates a binding model that is considered inelegant by many. Direct3D to this day uses a C++-based object-oriented API design (primarily via the COM binary interface), making it easier for developers to keep track of state and objects in their application code. Notably existing APIs in COM-based systems are not allowed to change, instead new variants have to be introduced, providing a decent amount of backwards-compatibility for applications originally written for older versions of Direct3D.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Metal takes Direct3D's object-oriented approach one step further by combining it with the more "verbal" API design common in Objective-C and Swift in an attempt to provide a more intuitive and easier API for app developers to use (and not just game developers) and to further motivate those to integrate more 3D and general GPU functionality into their apps. This lower barrier of entry was very much the point of earlier Metal versions, which combined the comparatively easier API with extensive graphics debugging capabilities built right into Xcode, providing developers with in-depth insights into every detail of their GPU processing (including built-in debugging of shader code) in the same IDE used for the rest of their application development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 1.2: Differences In API Design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All modern APIs share the same concepts and approaches in their designs, which attempt to solve a major design issue of OpenGL and Direct3D:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The old APIs took care of a lot of resource management and synchronization for the developer, "hiding" much of the actual complexity involved in preparing the GPU for workloads.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The old APIs presented the GPU as a big state machine (particularly OpenGL) where the developer can change bits and pieces between issuing draw calls.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Due to the possibility to change bits and pieces of a pipeline at will, the old APIs had to check if the current "state" of the API is valid before issuing any work to the GPU, adding considerable overhead to the API "driver".&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The new APIs removed most of that and now require developers to manage their resources and synchronization themselves, only providing methods to communicate their intent to the API and thus the GPU.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The new APIs present the GPU as a highly parallelized processing unit that can be issued a list of commands that will be added to a queue and are then picked up by the GPU, "drawing" just being one of many operations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To avoid having to re-validate the pipeline state before each draw call, pipelines have become immutable objects, whose validity is checked once during their creation, removing the overhead from draw commands using the pipeline, leaving some overhead whenever the pipelines themselves are switched.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course there are many other differences (large and small) but those are the ones that had the most impact on the attempt to write a "next generation" graphics API backend for OBS Studio. The current renderer is obviously built around the way the old APIs work (particularly Direct3D) and thus makes certain assumptions about the state the APIs will be in at any given point in time. The issue is that those assumptions are not correct as soon as any of those new APIs are used and a lot of the work that the APIs used to do for OBS Studio now has to be taken care of by the application itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So a decision had to be made: Either the core renderer can be updated or even rewritten to take care of the responsibilities expected by the modern APIs, adapting more modern "indirect drawing" techniques in Direct3D and OpenGL to make them more compatible with that approach (making those renderers potentially more performant as well), or put this additional work entirely into the backend for one of the new APIs, leaving the core renderer as-is. At least for the Metal backend, the second path was chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 1.3: The Expectations Of OBS Studio's Renderer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before the new release, OBS Studio shipped with two graphics APIs: Direct3D on Windows and OpenGL on Linux and macOS. This is achieved by having a core rendering subsystem that is (for the most part) API-independent and requires an API-specific backend to be loaded at runtime. This backend then implements a generic set of render commands issued by the core renderer and translates those into the actual commands and operations required by its API. That said, the core renderer has some quirks that become apparent once one tries to add support for an API that works slightly different than it might expect:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As OBS Studio's shader files are effectively written in an older dialect of Microsoft's High Level Shader Language (HLSL), every shader needs to be analyzed and translated into a valid variant for the modern API at runtime.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shaders are expected to use the same data structure as input and output type, as well as support global variables.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The application expects all operations made by the graphics API to be strictly sequential, and to always execute operations involving the same resources strictly in order of submission to the API.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OBS Studio's texture operations (creating textures from data loaded by the application, updating textures, reading from textures, and more) are directly modelled after Direct3D's API design. Any other API needs to work around this expectation and do housekeeping "behind the scenes" to meet it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OBS Studio also expects to be able to render previews (such as the program view, the main preview, the multi-view, and others) directly at its own pace (and framerate), expecting every platform to effectively behave like Windows and provide "swapchains" with the "discard model" used by DXGI, and thus is not decoupled from the render loop for the video output.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of these issues either fall into the realm of shaders or the API design itself, all of which had to be overcome by the Metal backend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Part 1.3.1: Transpiling Shaders&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OBS Studio makes extensive use of shader programs that run on the GPU to do efficient image processing. Both &lt;code&gt;libobs&lt;/code&gt; (OBS Studio's main library that includes the core renderer) as well as plugins like the first-party &lt;code&gt;obs-filters&lt;/code&gt; plugin provide their own "effect" files, which are implemented using the HLSL dialect mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These effects files contain "techniques", each potentially made of up of a number of render passes (although all current OBS Studio effect files use a single pass) that provide a vertex and fragment shader pair. The vertex shader is the little program a GPU runs for every vertex (a "point" of a triangle) to calculate its actual position in a scene relative to a camera looking at it. The fragment shader (also called "pixel shader" in Direct3D) calculates the actual color value for each fragment (a visible pixel in the output image).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make these files work with OpenGL and Direct3D, they need to be converted into bespoke shader source code for each "technique" first, which OBS Studio achieves through multiple steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each effect file is parsed in its entirety and converted into a data structure representing each "part" of the effect file:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The "uniforms", that is data (or a data structure) that is updated by application code at every rendered frame.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The "vertex" or "fragment" data (usually a data struct) that is kept in GPU memory.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Texture descriptions (textures can be 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional) and sampler descriptions (samplers describe how a color value is read from a texture for use in a shader).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The shader functions, including their return type and argument types.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Additionally each technique (and pass(es) within) are parsed into a nested data structure:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;OBS Studio will then iterate over every technique and its passes to pick up the names of the vertex and fragment shader functions mentioned in each.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The uniforms, shader data, as well as the texture and sampler descriptions, are shared among each technique within the same file. The created data structures are used to re-create the (partial) HLSL source code that was parsed originally.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The shader functions and their content are then copied and a "main" function is generated (as the entry-point for the shader) calling the actual shader function. The generated final HLSL string is kept as the shader representation of each "technique".&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each technique is sent in its HLSL form to each graphics API and is then transpiled into its API-specific form:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;For Direct3D this means replacing text tokens with their more current variants.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;For GLSL this means parsing the HLSL string back into structured data again, before iterating over this data and composing a GLSL shader string from it. As shader function code is not analyzed, it needs to be parsed word-for-word and translated into GLSL-specific variants if necessary.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adapting this process for Metal led to a few challenges, born out of the stricter shader language used by the API:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MSL is stricter around types and semantics:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Direct3D uses "semantics" to mark parts of shader data structs and give them meaning, like &lt;code&gt;TEXCOORD0&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;COLOR0&lt;/code&gt;, or&lt;code&gt;SV_VertexID&lt;/code&gt;, while OpenGL uses global variables that shader code instead reads from or writes into.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Metal uses a similar semantics-based model as Direct3D via attributes, but their use is more strict. Some attributes are allowed for input data, but not for output data.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Thus the same struct definition cannot be used as input and output type definition, instead the single struct type used by HLSL needs to be split into two separate structs for MSL.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Every function's content then needs to be scanned for any use of the struct type and needs to be replaced with the appropriate input or output variant.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Direct3D uses "semantics" to mark parts of shader data structs and give them meaning, like &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MSL has no support for global variables:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;This means that "uniforms" as used by Direct3D (and set up by OBS Studio's renderer) cannot be used by Metal - uniform data needs to be provided as a buffer of data in GPU memory.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;This buffer of data can be referenced as an input parameter to a shader function, thus any use of the global variable (used by HLSL and GLSL) needs to be replaced with a use of the function argument.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;However any other function called by the "main" shader function also accessing a global variable needs this local variable passed explicitly to it, thus - once again - every function's code needs to be parsed and analyzed.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Any time a function uses a global, it needs to have a new function argument added to its signature to accept the "global" data as an explicit function parameter.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Any time a function calls a function that uses a global, it also needs to have its signature changed to accept the data explicitly and also change the call signature to pass the data along.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And these are just two examples of major differences in the shader language that require the transpiler to almost rewrite every effect file used by &lt;code&gt;libobs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's a trivial example, OBS Studio's most basic vertex shader that simply multiplies each vertex position with a matrix to calculate the actual coordinates in "clip space" (coordinates that describe the position as a percentage of the width and height of the camera's view):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uniform float4x4 ViewProj;

struct VertInOut {
    float4 pos : POSITION;
    float2 uv : TEXCOORD0;
};

VertInOut VSDefault(VertInOut vert_in)
{
    VertInOut vert_out;
    vert_out.pos = mul(float4(vert_in.pos.xyz, 1.0), ViewProj);
    vert_out.uv  = vert_in.uv;
    return vert_out;
}

VertInOut main(VertInOut vert_in)
{
    return VSDefault(vert_in);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this shader the view projection matrix is provided as a global variable called &lt;code&gt;ViewProj&lt;/code&gt; and it's used by the &lt;code&gt;VSDefault&lt;/code&gt; shader function. The Metal Shader variant needs to be a bit more explicit about the flow of data:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;metal_stdlib&amp;gt;
using namespace metal;

typedef struct {
    float4x4 ViewProj;
} UniformData;

typedef struct {
    float4 pos [[attribute(0)]];
    float2 uv [[attribute(1)]];
} VertInOut_In;

typedef struct {
    float4 pos [[position]];
    float2 uv;
} VertInOut_Out;

VertInOut_Out VSDefault(VertInOut_In vert_in, constant UniformData &amp;amp;uniforms) {
    VertInOut_Out vert_out;
    vert_out.pos = (float4(vert_in.pos.xyz, 1.0)) * (uniforms.ViewProj);
    vert_out.uv  = vert_in.uv;
    return vert_out;
}

[[vertex]] VertInOut_Out _main(VertInOut_In vert_in [[stage_in]], constant UniformData &amp;amp;uniforms [[buffer(30)]]) {
    return VSDefault(vert_in, uniforms);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As explained above, the single &lt;code&gt;VertInOut&lt;/code&gt; struct had to be split into two separate variants for input and output, as the &lt;code&gt;attribute(n)&lt;/code&gt; mapping is only valid for input data. It uses a pattern more common in modern APIs where memory is typically organized in larger heaps into which all other data (buffers, textures, etc.) is placed and referenced. In this case the &lt;code&gt;stage_in&lt;/code&gt; decoration allows the developer to access vertex or fragment data for which a vertex descriptor had been set up and is used for convenience. Otherwise the variable would just represent a buffer of GPU memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To tell Metal which part of the output structure contains the calculated vertex positions, the corresponding field has to be decorated with &lt;code&gt;[[position]]&lt;/code&gt; or return a &lt;code&gt;float4&lt;/code&gt; explicitly. Every vertex shader has to do one or the other, as it would otherwise fail shader compilation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;uniform&lt;/code&gt; global used by HLSL is transformed into a buffer variable: The uniform data is uploaded into the buffer in slot 30 and referenced by the &lt;code&gt;[[buffer(30)]]&lt;/code&gt; decorator and uses the ampersand (&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;) to make it a C++ reference using the &lt;code&gt;constant&lt;/code&gt; address space attribute, which marks this reference to be read-only. The &lt;code&gt;uniforms&lt;/code&gt; reference is also passed into the &lt;code&gt;VSDefault&lt;/code&gt; function, as the transpiler detected that the function accesses &lt;code&gt;ViewProj&lt;/code&gt; within its function body, and thus adds it as an argument to the function signature and converts the reference of &lt;code&gt;ViewProj&lt;/code&gt; into the correct form &lt;code&gt;uniforms.ViewProj&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar work has to be done for all those cases where GLSL or HLSL will opportunistically accept data with the "wrong" types and alias or convert them into the correct one. Metal does not allow this, the developer has to put any such conversion into code explicitly and also requires any function call to match the function signature. Here is one such example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;float PS_Y(FragPos frag_in)
{
    float3 rgb = image.Load(int3(frag_in.pos.xy, 0)).rgb;
    float y = dot(color_vec0.xyz, rgb) + color_vec0.w;
    return y;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this example the HLSL shader uses the &lt;code&gt;Load&lt;/code&gt; function to load color values from a texture and passes in a vector of 3 signed integer values. A valid Metal Shader variant would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;float PS_Y(FragPos frag_in, constant UniformData &amp;amp;uniforms, texture2d&amp;lt;float&amp;gt; image) {
    float3 rgb = image.read(uint2(int2(frag_in.pos.xy)), uint( int( 0))).rgb;
    float y = dot(uniforms.color_vec0.xyz, rgb) + uniforms.color_vec0.w;
    return y;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The signature of the corresponding &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; function in MSL requires a vector of 2 unsigned integer values and a single unsigned integer. Thus the transpiler needs to detect any (known) invocation of a function that uses type aliasing or other kinds of type punning and explicitly convert the provided function arguments into the types required by the MSL shader function, in this case converting a single &lt;code&gt;int3&lt;/code&gt; into a pair of &lt;code&gt;uint2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;uint&lt;/code&gt; and ensuring that the data passed into the &lt;code&gt;uint&lt;/code&gt; constructor is actually of a specific type that can be converted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These and many other changes are necessary because MSL is effectively C++14 code and thus requires the same adherence to type safety and function signatures as any other application code written in C++. This allows sharing header files of data type and structure definitions between application and shader code, but also requires shader code to be more correct than it had to be for HLSL or GLSL in the past. And in the case of OBS Studio, the transpiler has to partially "rewrite" the HLSL shader code into more compliant MSL code at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Part 1.3.2: Pretending To Be Direct3D&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next hurdle was to simulate the behavior of Direct3D inside the Metal API implementation. As it was deemed infeasible to rewrite the core renderer itself, it must be "kept in the dark" about what actually happens behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the main jobs OBS Studio has to do for every video frame is convert images (or "frames") provided by the CPU into textures on the GPU, and - depending on the video encoder used - convert the final output texture back into a frame in CPU memory that can be sent to the encoder. In Direct3D this involves the "mapping" and "unmapping" of a texture:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When a texture is "mapped" it is made available for the application code in CPU memory.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When the texture is mapped for writing, Direct3D will provide a pointer to some CPU memory that it has either allocated directly or had been "lying around" from an earlier map operation. OBS Studio can then copy its frame data into the location.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When the texture is mapped for reading, Direct3D will provide a pointer to CPU memory that contains a copy of the texture data from GPU memory. OBS Studio can copy this data into its own "cache" of frames.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When OBS Studio is done with either operation, it has to "unmap" the texture. The provided pointer is then invalidated and any data pointed to it can and will be changed randomly.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By itself a naïve implementation of this operation can have severe consequences: When a texture is mapped for writing, any pending GPU operation (e.g., a shader's sampler reading color data from it) might be blocked from being executed as the texture is still being written to. Likewise when a texture is mapped for reading, any pending CPU operation (e.g., copying the frame data into a cache for the video encoder) might have to wait for any GPU operation that currently uses that texture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of its resource tracking behind the scenes, Direct3D 11 keeps track of texture access operations and will try to keep any such interruptions to a minimum, which leads specifically to the kind of overhead the modern APIs try to avoid:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When a texture is mapped for writing, Direct3D will keep track of the mapping request and provide a pointer to get the data copied into, even while the texture is in use, and schedule a synchronization of the texture data.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Once the texture is unmapped, Direct3D will upload the data to GPU memory and once this has taken place, schedule an update of the texture with the new image data.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If any consecutive draw call that uses the same texture was issued by the application code after the unmapping, Direct3D will implicitly ensure that all pending GPU commands are scheduled and thus the texture update will take place before any consecutive GPU command might access the same texture.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When a texture is mapped for reading, Direct3D will also ensure that all pending GPU commands writing to that texture are executed first to ensure that the copy it will provide will represent the result of any draw commands issued by the application before that.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;These are just examples of what might happen, as the specifics are highly dependent on the current state of the pipelines, the internal caches of the API's "driver" and other heuristics.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OBS Studio's entire render pipeline is designed around the characteristics of the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unmap&lt;/code&gt; commands in Direct3D 11 and expect any other graphics API to behave in a similar way. Metal (as other modern APIs) does not do all of this work (Metal 3 will indeed still do hazard tracking of resources, but developers can opt-out of this behavior, and Metal 4 removed it entirely) and thus the API-specific backend has to simulate the behavior of Direct3D 11 in its own implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When a texture is mapped for writing, a GPU buffer is opportunistically set up to hold the image data.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As the Metal backend is only supported on Apple Silicon devices, GPU and CPU share the same memory. This means that a pointer to the buffer's memory can be directly shared with the renderer,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When the texture is "unmapped", a simple block transfer (or blit) operation is scheduled on the GPU to copy the contents of the GPU buffer into the GPU texture. The unmap operation will "wait" until the blit operation has been scheduled on the GPU to prohibit the renderer from issuing any new render commands which would potentially run in parallel.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When a texture is mapped for reading, the same pointer to the GPU buffer is shared with application code. As the buffers are never used by any render command directly, no hazard tracking is necessary. An "unmapping" thus does nothing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;"Staging" a texture for reading thus only requires scheduling a blit from the source texture into its associated staging buffer (as buffers and textures are effectively the same thing and differ only by their API). To ensure that no further render commands are issued by the application, the copy operation is made to wait until it is completed by the GPU, but also has to ensure that if the source texture has any pending render commands, that those are scheduled to be run on the GPU explicitly.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same applies to other operations closely following Direct3D's design: To ensure that the Metal backend reacts in a way that meets the way OBS Studio's renderer expects, it had the "hidden" functionality of Direct3D implemented explicitly, particularly the tracking of texture use by prior render commands before any staging takes place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 1.4: But Wait, There's More (Issues)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One major reason why the backend is considered "experimental" is due to the way its preview rendering had to be implemented for now. To understand the core reason for those issues, it is important to first understand how OBS Studio expects preview rendering to work, which closely shaped by the way DXGI (DirectX Graphics Infrastructure) allows applications to present 3D content on Windows. DXGI swapchains hold a number of buffers with image data created by the application, one of which the application can ask to be "presented" by the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To avoid an application potentially generating too many frames than can be presented (and thus potentially blocking the application), DXGI swapchains can be set to have a "discard" mode and a synchronization interval of &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, which effectively allows an application to force the presentation of a back buffer immediately (without waiting for the operating system's own screen refresh interval) and because the contents of the buffer are discarded, it becomes available to be overwritten by the application with the the next frame's data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this is the opposite of how Metal (or more precisely Metal Layers) allows one to render 3D contents into application windows: With the introduction of ProMotion on iPhones and Macbooks, macOS controls the effective frame rates used by devices to provide fluid motion during interaction, but potentially throttle the desktop rendering to single digit framerates when no interaction or updates happen. This allows iOS and macOS to limit the operating system framerate (and the framerate of all applications within it) when the device is set to "low power" mode and is thus not designed to be "overruled" by an application (as it would allow such an application to violate the "low power" decision made by the user).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus applications cannot just render frames to be presented by the OS at their own pace, instead they have to ask for a surface to render to and the number of surfaces an application can be provided with is limited. This means that if OBS Studio is running at twice the frame rate of the operating system, it would exhaust its allowance of surfaces to render into. And because OBS Studio renders previews as part of its single render loop, any delay introduced by a preview render operation also stalls or delays the generation of new frames for video encoders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution (at least for this first experimental release) was for OBS Studio to always render into a texture that "pretends" to be the window surface to allow the renderer to finish all its work in its required frame time. Then a different thread (running globally for the entire app with a fixed screen refresh interval) will pick up this texture, request a window surface to render into, and then schedule a block transfer (blit) to copy the contents into the surface. This also requires explicit synchronization of the textures' use on the GPU to ensure that the "pretender" texture is fully rendered to by OBS before the copy to the surface is executed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a nutshell: Whenever the operating system compositor requires a refresh, a separate thread will wait for OBS Studio to render a new frame of the associated preview texture and only once that has happened, the texture data is copied into the surface provided by the compositor. But as the preview rendering is now decoupled from the main render loop, framerate inconsistencies are inevitable. The kernel-level timer provided by the operating system will not align with OBS Studio's render loop (which requires the render thread to be woken up when it's calculated "time for the next frame" has been reached) and thus either a new frame might have been rendered in time or an old frame could not be copied in time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting with macOS 14, the approach suggested by Apple would require OBS Studio to decouple these intervals even further, as every window (and thus potentially every preview) will have its own independent timer at which the application will receive a call from the operating system with a surface ready to be rendered into, which would bring a whole new set of potential challenges as it's even further removed from how OBS Studio expects to be able to render previews in the application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 1.5: The Hidden Costs Of Modern Graphics APIs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The complexity of the endeavor was high and took several months of research, trial and error, bugfixing, multiple redesigns of specific aspects, and many long weekends. During the course of development it also became clear why some applications that simply switched from OpenGL to Vulkan or Direct3D 11 to Direct3D 12 might have potentially faced worse performance than before, seemingly contradicting those API's promise of improved performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part of the reason is that a lot of the work that had been taken care of the by API's drivers are now application responsibilities and thus need to be taken care of by developers themselves. This however requires a more intimate understanding of "how the GPU works" and familiarization with those parts of Direct3D or OpenGL that were purposefully hidden from developers up to this point. And it also requires a more in-depth understanding of how the render commands interact with each other, what their dependencies are, and similarly how to encode and communicate these dependencies to the GPU to ensure that render commands are executed in the right order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the case of the Metal backend, this means that a certain amount of overhead that was removed from the API itself had to be reintroduced into the backend again, as even though it would be in a far better position for adoption, the core renderer was not available for a rewrite. Nevertheless even with this overhead, the Metal backend provides multiple benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In Release configuration and even in its non-optimized current form, it performs as well or even better as the OpenGL renderer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In Debug configuration it provides an amazing set of capabilities to analyze render passes in all their detail, including shader debugging, texture lookups, and so much more.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As it's written in Swift, it uses a safer programming language than the OpenGL renderer, one that is at the same time easier and less time consuming to work with.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Because preview rendering is effectively handled separately from the main render loop, the Metal renderer enables EDR previews on macOS for high-bitrate video setups.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As far as maintenance of the macOS version of OBS Studio is concerned, the Metal backend brings considerable benefits as Xcode can now provide insights that haven't been available to developers since the deprecation of OpenGL on all Apple platforms in 2018. But it is due to these complexities that the project would like to extend an invitation to all developers (and users that might be so inclined) to provide feedback and suggestions for changes to improve the design and implementation of the Metal backend to first move it out of the "experimental" stage and later make it the default graphics backend on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I got hacked, my server started mining Monero this morning.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Edit: This got way more attention than I was ever expecting. I originally asked claude to draft it from a transcript of my panicked messages and the feedback was clear, nobody likes AI slop. As a result I’ve redrafted it this morning to fix some inaccuracies and make it sound human. - Jake&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or: How I learned that “I don’t use Next.js” doesn’t mean your dependencies don’t use Next.js&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;8:25 AM: The Email&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I woke up to this beauty from Hetzner:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Dear Mr Jake Saunders,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We have indications that there was an attack from your server. Please take all necessary measures to avoid this in the future and to solve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We also request that you send a short response to us. This response should contain information about how this could have happened and what you intend to do about it. In the event that the following steps are not completed successfully, your server can be blocked at any time after the 2025-12-17 12:46:15 +0100.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Attached was evidence of network scanning from my server to some IP range in Thailand. Great. Nothing says “good morning” like an abuse report and the threat of getting your infrastructure shut down in 4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Background: I run a Hetzner server with Coolify. It runs all my stuff, like my little corner of the internet:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;My IoT Side Project&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This Blog&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Analytics&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;My dads site (he’s an electrician)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;8:30 AM: Oh Fuck&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First thing I did was SSH in and check the load average:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I run a bunch of Go backend services and some SvelteKit frontend stuff on there. My grand total of daily users peaks at 20, so something was very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ran &lt;code&gt;ps aux&lt;/code&gt; to see what was eating my CPU:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;819% CPU usage. On a process called &lt;code&gt;javae&lt;/code&gt; running from &lt;code&gt;/tmp/.XIN-unix/&lt;/code&gt;. And multiple &lt;code&gt;xmrig&lt;/code&gt; processes - that’s
literally cryptocurrency mining software (Monero, specifically).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looks like I’d been mining cryptocurrency for someone since December 7th. For ten days. Brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Investigation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first thought was “I’m completely fucked.” My host had been running a crypto miner for a week, the whole think was borked. Time to just nuke it from orbit and rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I had the foresight to do a little detective work beforehand to at least learn how I’d been compromised so I could learn for the future. I set out to do this with the help of Claude (this is not my speciality).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, I noticed something interesting. All these processes were running as user &lt;code&gt;1001&lt;/code&gt;. Not root. Not a system user.
UID 1001.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me check what’s actually running:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note: Deleted ports from this list as i feel like the might expose some inner workings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crucially, I was running Umami - a privacy-focused analytics tool I’d re-deployed 9 days ago to track traffic on my blog. I redeployed it because it had started acting up and I wasn’t sure why. The timing was suspicious to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me check which container has user 1001:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Output:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There it is. Container &lt;code&gt;a42f72cb1bc5&lt;/code&gt; - that’s my Umami analytics container. And it’s got a whole &lt;code&gt;xmrig-6.24.0&lt;/code&gt;
directory sitting in what should be Next.js server internals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mining command in the process list confirmed it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Someone had exploited my analytics container and was mining Monero using my CPU. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wait, I Don’t Use Next.js&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d actually seen a post on HN referencing this Reddit post about a critical Next.js (CVE-2025-66478). My immediate reaction was “lol who cares, I don’t run Next.js.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Oh my sweet summer child.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except… Umami is built with Next.js. I did not know this, nor did I bother looking. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vulnerability (CVE-2025-66478) was in Next.js’s React Server Components deserialization. The “Flight” protocol that RSC uses to serialize/deserialize data between client and server had an unsafe deserialization flaw. An attacker could send a specially crafted HTTP request with a malicious payload to any App Router endpoint, and when deserialized, it would execute arbitrary code on the server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Attacker sends crafted HTTP request to Umami’s Next.js endpoint&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RSC deserializes the malicious payload&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RCE achieved via unsafe deserialization&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download and install cryptominers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Profit (for them)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So much for “I don’t use Next.js.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Panic: Has It Escaped the Container?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where I started to properly panic. Looking at that process list:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That path - &lt;code&gt;/tmp/.XIN-unix/javae&lt;/code&gt; - looks like it’s on the host filesystem, not inside a container. That means it
can get access to my database, all my environment variables, the works. Claude was telling me I’d need to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Assume everything is compromised&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check for rootkits, backdoors, persistence mechanisms&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Probably rebuild from scratch&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Spend my entire day unfucking this&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I checked for persistence mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No malicious cron jobs. No fake systemd services pretending to be &lt;code&gt;nginxs&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;apaches&lt;/code&gt;. That’s… good?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I still needed to know: Did the malware actually escape the container or not?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Moment of Truth&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The test was, if &lt;code&gt;/tmp/.XIN-unix/javae&lt;/code&gt; exists on the host, I’m fucked. If it doesn’t exist, then apparently what I’m
seeing is
just Docker’s default behavior of showing container processes in the host’s &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt; output, but they’re actually isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IT NEVER ESCAPED.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or at least it doesn’t look like it. We can downgrade this incident from DEFCON1 to ‘point a gun at it and do some more checks, but no guillotine yet’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The malware was entirely contained within the Umami container. Apparently, when you run &lt;code&gt;ps aux&lt;/code&gt; on a Docker host, you
see processes
from all containers because they share the same kernel. But those processes are in their own mount namespace - they
can’t see or touch the host filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I verified what user that container was actually running as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So here’s what I now know, and why I’m not totally fucked:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Container ran as user &lt;code&gt;nextjs&lt;/code&gt;(UID 1001), not root.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Container was not privileged.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Container had zero volume mounts.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which means:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run processes inside the container&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mine cryptocurrency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Scan networks (hence the Hetzner abuse report)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Consume 100% CPU&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The malware could NOT:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Access the host filesystem&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install cron jobs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create systemd services&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Persist across container restarts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Escape to other containers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install rootkits&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Container isolation actually worked. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dockerfiles vs. Auto-Generated Images&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were a couple of things which saved me in this case IMO compared to the Reddit post I linked:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I write all my own dockerfiles for my applications. This isn;t a silver bullet on it’s own but compared to autogenerated ones you have a better idea of what’s in there.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Coolify and Dockers approach to containerization in general. I’ve since learned that we can’t rely on container separation for security but honestly it seems better than running everything on the host.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Reddit post I’d seen earlier? That guy got completely screwed because his container was running as root. The malware could:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install cron jobs for persistence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create systemd services&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write anywhere on the filesystem&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Survive reboots&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in this case, container isolation had worked!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I did not do, was keep track of the tolling I was using and what tooling that was using. In fact, I installed Umami from Coolify’s services screen. I didn’t even configure it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Obviously none of this is Umami’s fault by the way. They released a fix for their free software like a week ago. I just didn’t think to do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Fix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CPU back to normal. It’s been two days since and my CPU is just chilling at like 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also enabled UFW (which I should have done ages ago):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This blocks all inbound connections except SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS. No more exposed PostgreSQL ports, no more RabbitMQ ports open to the internet. In my mind this shouldn’t be too big a deal because 5432 wasn’t open to he host from the docker container. But worth doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I sent Hetzner a brief explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Investigation complete. The scanning originated from a compromised Umami analytics container (CVE-2025-66478).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The container ran as non-root user with no privileged access or host mounts, so the compromise was fully contained. Container has been removed and firewall hardened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They closed the ticket within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. “I don’t use X” doesn’t mean your dependencies don’t use X&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t write Next.js applications. But I run third-party tools that are built with Next.js. When CVE-2025-66478 was disclosed, I thought “not my problem.” Wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Know what your dependencies are actually built with. That “simple analytics tool” is a full web application with a complex stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Container isolation works (when configured properly)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This could have been so much worse. If that container had been running as root, or had volume mounts to sensitive directories, or had access to the Docker socket, I’d be writing a very different blog post about rebuilding my entire infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, I deleted one container and moved on with my day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Write your own Dockerfiles. Understand what user your processes run as. Avoid &lt;code&gt;USER root&lt;/code&gt; unless you have a very
good reason. Don’t mount volumes you don’t need. Don’t give containers &lt;code&gt;--privileged&lt;/code&gt; access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. The sophistication gap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This malware wasn’t like those people who auto-poll for &lt;code&gt;/wpadmin&lt;/code&gt; every time I make a DNS change. This was spicy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disguised itself in legitimate-looking paths (&lt;code&gt;/app/node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Used process names that blend in (&lt;code&gt;javae&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;runnv&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Attempted to establish persistence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;According to other reports, even had “killer scripts” to murder competing miners&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it was still limited by container isolation. Good security practices beat sophisticated malware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4. Defense in depth matters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though the container isolation held, I still should have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Had a firewall enabled from day one (not “I’ll do it later”)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Been running fail2ban to stop those SSH brute force attempts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Had proper monitoring/alerting (I only noticed because of the Hetzner email)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Updated Umami when the CVE was disclosed&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got lucky. Container isolation saved me from my own laziness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What I’m Doing Differently&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No more Umami. - Meh, I’ve gone back on this. This wasn’t Umami’s fault, and their open source software is super cool. I’ve rebooted a fresh version of Umami.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Audit all third-party containers. Going through everything I run and checking: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;What user does it run as?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;What volumes does it have?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;When was it last updated?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Do I actually need it?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;SSH hardening. Moving to key-based authentication only, disabling password auth, and setting up fail2ban.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Proper monitoring. Setting up alerts for CPU usage, load average, and suspicious network activity. I shouldn’t find out about compromises from my hosting provider. I actually have grafana and Node exporter set up, but it’s not good unless I go look at it!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Regular security updates. No more “I’ll update it later.” If there’s a CVE, I patch or I remove the service.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Silver Lining&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was actually a pretty good learning experience. I got to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Practice incident response on a real compromise (never done this before!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prove that container isolation actually works&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Learn about Docker namespaces, user mapping, and privilege boundaries&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Harden my infrastructure without the pressure of active data loss&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I only lost about 2 hours of my morning before work. Could’ve been way worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though I do wonder how much Monero I mined for that dickhead. Based on the CPU usage and duration… probably enough for them to have a nice lunch. You’re welcome, mysterious attacker. Hope you enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TL;DR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Umami analytics (built with Next.js) had an RCE vulnerability.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Got exploited, installed cryptominers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mined Monero for 10 days at 1000%+ CPU&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Container isolation saved me because it ran as non-root with no mounts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fix: &lt;code&gt;docker rm umami&lt;/code&gt;and enable firewall&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lesson: Know what your dependencies are built with, and configure containers properly&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Expected applications across diverse solid tumor types, opening new avenues for cancer treatment&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ãResearch Overviewã&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A research team of Prof. Eijiro Miyako at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST) has discovered that the bacterium Ewingella americana, isolated from the intestines of Japanese tree frogs (Dryophytes japonicus), possesses remarkably potent anticancer activity. This groundbreaking research has been published in the international journal Gut Microbes.&lt;lb/&gt;While the relationship between gut microbiota and cancer has attracted considerable attention in recent years, most approaches have focused on indirect methods such as microbiome modulation or fecal microbiota transplantation. In contrast, this study takes a completely different approach: isolating, culturing, and directly administering individual bacterial strains intravenously to attack tumors--- representing an innovative therapeutic strategy.&lt;lb/&gt;The research team isolated a total of 45 bacterial strains from the intestines of Japanese tree frogs, Japanese fire belly newts (Cynops pyrrhogaster), and Japanese grass lizards (Takydromus tachydromoides). Through systematic screening, nine strains demonstrated antitumor effects, with E. americana exhibiting the most exceptional therapeutic efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ãResearch Detailsã&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remarkable Therapeutic Efficacy&lt;lb/&gt;In a mouse colorectal cancer model, a single intravenous administration of E. americana achieved complete tumor elimination with a 100% complete response (CR) rate. This dramatically surpasses the therapeutic efficacy of current standard treatments, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-L1 antibody) and liposomal doxorubicin (chemotherapy agent) (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Figure 1. Anticancer efficacy: Ewingella americana versus conventional therapies. Tumor response: single i.v. dose of E. americana (200 ÂµL, 5 Ã 10â¹ CFU/mL); four doses of doxorubicin or anti-PD-L1 (200 ÂµL, 2.5 mg/kg per dose); PBS as control. Data: mean Â± SEM (n = 5). ****, p &amp;lt; 0.0001 (Student's two-sided t-test).&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dual-Action Anticancer Mechanism&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;E. americana attacks cancer through two complementary mechanisms (Figure 2):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Direct Cytotoxic Effect: As a facultative anaerobic bacterium, E. americana selectively accumulates in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment and directly destroys cancer cells. Bacterial counts within tumors increase approximately 3,000-fold within 24 hours post-administration, efficiently attacking tumor tissue.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Immune Activation Effect: The bacterial presence powerfully stimulates the immune system, recruiting T cells, B cells, and neutrophils to the tumor site. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³) produced by these immune cells further amplify immune responses and induce cancer cell apoptosis.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 2. Mechanisms underlying Ewingella americana antitumor effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tumor-Specific Accumulation Mechanism&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;E. americana selectively accumulates in tumor tissues with zero colonization in normal organs. This remarkable tumor specificity arises from multiple synergistic mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hypoxic Environment: The characteristic hypoxia of tumor tissues promotes anaerobic bacterial proliferation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Immunosuppressive Environment: CD47 protein expressed by cancer cells creates local immunosuppression, forming a permissive niche for bacterial survival&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Abnormal Vascular Structure: Tumor vessels are leaky, facilitating bacterial extravasation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Metabolic Abnormalities: Tumor-specific metabolites support selective bacterial growth&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Excellent Safety Profile&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comprehensive safety evaluation revealed that E. americana demonstrates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rapid blood clearance (half-life ~1.2 hours, completely undetectable at 24 hours)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zero bacterial colonization in normal organs including liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and heart&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Only transient mild inflammatory responses, normalizing within 72 hours&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No chronic toxicity during 60-day extended observation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ãFuture Directionsã&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This research has established proof-of-concept for a novel cancer therapy using natural bacteria. Future research and development will focus on:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expansion to Other Cancer Types: Efficacy validation in breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and other malignancies&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimization of Administration Methods: Development of safer and more effective delivery approaches including dose fractionation and intratumoral injection&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Combination Therapy Development: Investigation of synergistic effects with existing immunotherapy and chemotherapy&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This research demonstrates that unexplored biodiversity represents a treasure trove for novel medical technology development and holds promise for providing new therapeutic options for patients with refractory cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ãGlossaryã&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Facultative Anaerobic Bacteria: Bacteria capable of growing in both oxygen-rich and oxygen-depleted environments, enabling selective proliferation in hypoxic tumor regions.&lt;lb/&gt;Complete Response (CR): Complete tumor elimination confirmed by diagnostic examination following treatment.&lt;lb/&gt;Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor: Drugs that release cancer cell-mediated immune suppression, enabling T cells to attack cancer cells.&lt;lb/&gt;CD47: A cell surface protein that emits "don't eat me" signals; cancer cells overexpress this to evade immune attack.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Judge hints Vizio TV buyers may have rights to source code licensed under GPL&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tentative ruling signals a potential win for SFC’s copyleft enforcement push&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electronics biz Vizio may be required by a California court to provide source code for its SmartCast TV software, which is allegedly based on open source code licensed under the GPLv2 and LGPLv2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The legal complaint from the Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) seeks access to the SmartCast source code so that Vizio customers can make changes and improvements to the platform, something that ought to be possible for code distributed under the GPL. On Thursday, California Superior Court Judge Sandy Leal issued a tentative ruling in advance of a hearing, indicating support for part of SFC's legal challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tentative ruling is not a final decision, but it signals the judge's inclination to grant the SFC's motion for summary adjudication, at least in part.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The tentative ruling [PDF] grants SFC's motion on the issue that a direct contract was made between SFC and Vizio when SFC's systems administrator, Paul Visscher, requested the source code to a TV that SFC has purchased," the SFC said in a blog post. "This contract obligated Vizio to provide SFC the complete and corresponding source code."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SFC initially asked Vizio to publish its SmartCast source code back in August 2018, based on its claim that the software relies on various applications and libraries that are licensed under the GPLv2 and LGPLv2.1, including the Linux kernel, alsa-utils, GNU bash, GNU awk, bluez, BusyBox, and other components.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vizio responded in 2019 but the code it provided was incomplete, according to the SFC, and didn't fulfill the company's obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After two more years of negotiation, the SFC sued Vizio in October 2021, a relatively uncommon event in the FOSS world due to the cost and difficulty of enforcing open source licenses. SFC director of compliance Denver Gingerich told The Register that software developer Sebastian Steck's open source licensing victory in Germany against AVM in January appears to be the first time the LGPL has been successfully litigated.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;We call this kernel saunters: How Apple rearranged its XNU core with exclaves&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Karen Sandler, executive director of the SFC, told The Register in an email that the hearing went well, though Vizio's legal counsel "stridently disagreed" with the legal analysis in the tentative ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Judge Leal said she would take the matter 'under submission' which means she will think about it further," Sandler said. "After the Court went off the record, Leal's clerk specifically verified the Court reporter could provide an expedited transcript, so Leal will likely review the hearing transcript soon."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sandler expects Leal will examine the filings again before issuing her opinion, which is likely to be issued in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bradley Kühn, policy fellow at the SFC, posted about the hearing (in a personal capacity) in a Mastodon thread. His account expresses some skepticism about the validity of Vizio's legal arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Vizio is effectively saying if you're in a #GPL lawsuit, you lose your right to even ask for source at all!!!" he observed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vizio did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ®&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Egyptian Hieroglyphs: Lesson 1&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;General Overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reading Hieroglyphs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ancient Egyptians created a highly flexible hieroglyphic system of writing. Hieroglyphs could be arranged in both columns and rows and could be read from the left or from the right, depending on how they were written. This allowed the ancient Egyptians to effortlessly integrate their writing with art, blurring the boundary between art and script. In the example below, the god Amun, imn, is written each of the possible combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Left to Right&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right to Left&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Left to Right&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right to Left&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although the task of reading hieroglyphs from the right direction may seem daunting at first, there is a simple trick that will allow you to easily identify the correct direction from which to begin:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look for a hieroglyph with a face and read toward it. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the figure is facing to the left, begin reading from the left. If they are facing right, begin from the right. When there are hieroglyphs are stacked on top of each other, the top sign should always be read before lower sign. Another feature of the Egyptian writing system that you might have noticed is “group writing.” Rather than placing hieroglyphs side-by-side, they were arranged in a way to reduce empty space: taller signs stand alone, while smaller signs are stacked on top of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Transliteration and the Alphabet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transliteration is the method of converting one script into another, also referred to as transcription. The hieroglyphs in the alphabet are called “uniliterals,” because they represent a single consonant. The ancient Egyptian language also contains biliterals and triliterals, which represent two and three consonants, respectively. The alphabet can be found in the chart below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It will be helpful to memorize the alphabet not only because they occur often in texts, but also because Egyptologists arrange dictionaries in this order. So if you are unsure of the meaning of a word, but know how to transliterate it, knowing the alphabet will help you find the word faster than flipping frantically between the four different types of “H’s” to find the right one.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You might have noticed that there aren’t any vowels in the alphabet. They exist in the language, but the hieroglyphic script omitted them, which makes things difficult when it comes to pronunciation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of current research into pronunciation (e.g. Allen’s Ancient Egyptian Phonology), but I was never particularly interested in it. If you are, then I suggest grabbing the book I listed, but it’s far beyond the scope of these lessons. For our purposes, I’ll simply describe the general conventions used in an introductory glyphs course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add an “e” in between the consonants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yup. That’s the basic approach when vocalizing transliterations. There’s some leeway when it comes to names and places (e.g. Amon vs Amun vs Amen), but in general, adding “e” in between consonants is just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When hieroglyphs are used to represent these real world things, they are called ideograms. For example, the hieroglyph&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might be wondering how you’d know whether a hieroglyph was being used as a ideogram or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phonograms are hieroglyphs that represent a specific sound (phonetic value). Using phonograms, scribes could spell out words. For example, we could combine the hieroglyphs for mouth,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A determinative is a hieroglyph that does not have a phonetic value so it is not transliterated. They are placed at the end of words and provide a general meaning of the word. For example, we may not know what the word&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideogram&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phonogram&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Determinative&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;General meaning: movement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actual definiton of ptpt: to trample.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Memorization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section will contain either a vocabulary list, sign list, or both. Although it would be great if you memorized the lists, it’s not required at this point. The more you interact with hieroglyphic texts, in these exercises or elsewhere, the more you’ll begin to notice some of the more common signs and words. After a while, you’ll begin to naturally remember them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or you’ll get tired of looking them up and memorize them on the spot. Flashcards are great for that!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Identify the direction the hieroglyphs should be read (right to left or left to right), and then in your head, identify the order in which each individual glyph should be read. If you need help, refer to the “Reading Hieroglyphs” section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transliteration and Translation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;gm.n.f sw m pr&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He found him in the house.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Left to Right&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transliteration and Translation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;nswt bity nb t3wy nb hʿw nb-m3ʿt-rʿ&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Lord of the Two Lands, Lord of Diadems, Nebmaatre (Amenhotep III)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Right to left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last sequence of hieroglyphs might be confusing. Why 13, 11, and 12 and not 11-13? This is a common feature called “honorific transposition” and often found in names. When a certain god or goddess is being honored, their name is pushed to the front. In this case, Re is being honored, so his name is at the head. We’ll learn more about this feature in the next lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transliteration and Translation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;sḏm.n.f mdt imn&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He heard the speech of Amun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transliteration and Translation&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ḥmt nswt tiy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Royal wife, Tiye&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Left to right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is kinda mean, unless you remembered that the sedge (see problem #1 above) is transliterated as nswt. Although you’ve been introduced to honorific transposition, I haven’t mentioned it applies to nswt, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

(2019)</title><link>https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2019/02/21/what-is-an-elliptic-curve/</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="945d9a954a133365"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elliptic curves are pure and applied, concrete and abstract, simple and complex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elliptic curves have been studied for many years by pure mathematicians with no intention to apply the results to anything outside math itself. And yet elliptic curves have become a critical part of applied cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elliptic curves are very concrete. There are some subtleties in the definition—more on that in a moment—but they’re essentially the set of points satisfying a simple equation. And yet a lot of extremely abstract mathematics has been developed out of necessity to study these simple objects. And while the objects are in some sense simple, the questions that people naturally ask about them are far from simple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Preliminary definition&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A preliminary definition of an elliptic curve is the set of points satisfying&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;y² = x³ + ax + b.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a theorem, not a definition, and it requires some qualifications. The values x, y, a, and b come from some field, and that field is an important part of the definition of an elliptic curve. If that field is the real numbers, then all elliptic curves do have the form above, known as the Weierstrass form. For fields of characteristic 2 or 3, the Weierstrass form isn’t general enough. Also, we require that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4a³ + 27b² ≠ 0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other day I wrote about Curve1174, a particular elliptic curve used in cryptography. The points on this curve satisfy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;x² + y² = 1 – 1174 x² y²&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This equation does not specify an elliptic curve if we’re working over real numbers. But Curve1174 is defined over the integers modulo p = 2251 – 9. There it is an elliptic curve. It is equivalent to a curve in Weierstrass form, though that’s not true when working over the reals. So whether an equation defines an elliptic curve depends on the field the xs and ys come from.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Not an ellipse, not a curve&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An elliptic curve is not an ellipse, and it may not be a curve in the usual sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a connection between elliptic curves and ellipses, but it’s indirect. Elliptic curves are related to the integrals you would write down to find the length of a portion of an ellipse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working over the real numbers, an elliptic curve is a curve in the geometric sense. Working over a finite field, an elliptic curve is a discrete set of points, not a continuum. Working over the complex numbers, an elliptic curve is a two-dimensional surface. The name “curve” is extended by analogy to elliptic curves over general fields.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final definition&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this section we’ll give the full definition of an algebraic curve, though we’ll be deliberately vague about some of the details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The definition of an elliptic curve is not in terms of equations of a particular form. It says an elliptic curve is a&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;smooth,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;projective,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;algebraic curve,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;of genus one,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;having a specified point O.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working over real numbers, smoothness can be specified in terms of derivatives. But what does smoothness mean working over a finite field? You take the derivative equations from the real case and extend them by analogy to other fields. You can “differentiate” polynomials in settings where you can’t take limits by defining derivatives algebraically. (The condition 4a³ + 27b² ≠ 0 above is to guarantee smoothness.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Informally, projective means we add “points at infinity” as necessary to make things more consistent. Formally, we’re not actually working with pairs of coordinates (x, y) but equivalence classes of triples of coordinates (x, y, z). You can usually think in terms of pairs of values, but the extra value is there when you need it to deal with points at infinity. More on that here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An algebraic curve is the set of points satisfying a polynomial equation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The genus of an algebraic curve is roughly the number of holes it has. Over the complex numbers, the genus of an algebraic curve really is the number of holes. As with so many ideas in algebra, a theorem from a familiar context is taken as a definition in a more general context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The specified point O, often the point at infinity, is the location of the identity element for the group addition. In the post on Curve1174, we go into the addition in detail, and the zero point is (0, 1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In elliptic curve cryptography, it’s necessary to specify another point, a base point, which is the generator for a subgroup. This post gives an example, specifying the base point on secp256k1, a curve used in the implementation of Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

FreeBSD-SA-25:12.rtsold Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Remote code execution via ND6 Router Advertisements
Category: core
Module: rtsold
Announced: 2025-12-16
Credits: Kevin Day
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2025-12-16 23:39:32 UTC (stable/15, 15.0-STABLE)
2025-12-16 23:43:01 UTC (releng/15.0, 15.0-RELEASE-p1)
2025-12-16 23:45:05 UTC (stable/14, 14.3-STABLE)

2025-12-16 23:43:33 UTC (releng/13.5, 13.5-RELEASE-p8)
CVE Name: CVE-2025-14558
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
rtsold(8) and rtsol(8) are programs which process router advertisement
packets as part of the IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
mechanism.
II. Problem Description
The rtsol(8) and rtsold(8) programs do not validate the domain search list
options provided in router advertisement messages; the option body is passed
to resolvconf(8) unmodified.
resolvconf(8) is a shell script which does not validate its input. A lack of
quoting meant that shell commands pass as input to resolvconf(8) may be
executed.
III. Impact
Systems running rtsol(8) or rtsold(8) are vulnerable to remote code execution
from systems on the same network segment. In particular, router advertisement
messages are not routable and should be dropped by routers, so the attack does
not cross network boundaries.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available. Users not using IPv6, and IPv6 users that do not
configure the system to accept router advertisement messages, are not affected.
A network interface listed by ifconfig(8) accepts router advertisement messages
if the string "ACCEPT_RTADV" is present in the nd6 option list.
V. Solution
Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
Perform one of the following:
1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the amd64 or arm64 platforms,
or the i386 platform on FreeBSD 13, can be updated via the freebsd-update(8)
utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-25:12/rtsold.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-25:12/rtsold.patch.asc
# gpg --verify rtsold.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch &amp;lt; /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart the applicable daemons, or reboot the system.
VI. Correction details
This issue is corrected as of the corresponding Git commit hash in the
following stable and release branches:

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;GitHub Actions for Self-Hosted Runners Price Increase Postponed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub update on the postponement of the price increase for GitHub Actions for self-hosted runners to $0.002 per minute. Below is a screenshot of the update shared on X (@github).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub had earlier announced in a post we published that it would increase the cost of self-hosted runners from $0.00 (free) to $0.002 per minute, starting March 1, 2026. This increase has been postponed, which means it will not apply until a new decision is made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub stated that it has canceled the price increase after reviewing developer feedback. It added that it will take time to listen to customers and partners. For now, GitHub Actions for self-hosted runners remain free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The good news is that the 39% price reduction for hosted runners will continue as previously announced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will continue to monitor GitHub Actions price changes and update them on GitHub Actions Pricing history page.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How getting richer made teenagers less free&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;We value children more than ever. But we're suffocating them.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1913, journalist Helen Todd talked to hundreds of 14- to 16-year-olds working in American factories. Most of their fathers were dead or had crippling health issues thanks to decades of work in unsafe factories, and their mothers were supporting an average of five children on low wages. By doing piecemeal work for excruciatingly low pay in dangerous factories, the teenagers were keeping their families afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Todd asked these teenage laborers whether they would choose work in the factory or school if their families were rich enough that they didn’t need to work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overwhelmingly, they chose the factory:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The children don’t holler at ye and call ye a Christ-killer in a factory.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They don’t call ye a Dago.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They’re good to you at home when you earn money.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Youse can eat sittin’ down, when youse work.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You can go to the nickel show.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to work so hard at night when you get home.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Yer folks don’t hit ye so much.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You can buy shoes for the baby.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You can give your mother yer pay envelop.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What ye learn in school ain’t no’ good. Ye git paid just as much in the factory if ye never was there. Our boss he never went to school.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“That boy can’t speak English, and he gets six dollars. I only get four dollars, and I’ve been through the sixth grade.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“When my brother is fourteen, I’m going to get him a job here. Then, my mother says, we’ll take the baby out of the ‘Sylum for the Half Orphans.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No one in America today lives under the cloud of desperation that these children did. In the last century, economic growth has transformed our society from every conceivable angle. But one we don’t dwell on much is how it has transformed childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1910, shortly before these children were interviewed, 16% of American children died before age 5 and 19% before age 18. Just 13.5% of adults had a high school diploma, and the median adult had about an eighth-grade education. The 1910 Census found 41% of 14- to 15-year-old boys gainfully occupied (that is, in the workforce), and 79% of boys and young men aged 16 to 20.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Naturally, these changes — in the odds that children survive to adulthood, in the age at which they first work, in how many of them complete high school — have profoundly shaped our conception of childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Kids’ lives are better — but involve much less autonomy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the nation grew wealthier and more children began to survive to adulthood, we became vastly more protective of them — and permitted them far fewer risks. It’s hard to invest (either emotionally or literally) in children when poverty, disease, and starvation haunt your days. And now that we are less desperately poor, we can afford to ask less of our children — no family need choose between sending their 14-year-old to the factories or surrendering their baby to an orphanage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, legal protections for minors are more expansive than they ever have been. Cultural expectations have shifted enormously. Americans hit their children less than we used to. We spend more time playing with them. We spend, of course, far more money on them. We supervise them more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The very successes achieved in improving children’s lives led to an escalation in what came to be seen as the minimal standard for children’s well-being,” wrote Peter Stearns in his history of American child-rearing. “Levels of anxiety experienced by parents did not correlate with what might have been registered as historic progress in children’s quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously, “kids rarely die these days” is a massive change for the good, and I’m also not exactly here to defend children dropping out of middle school to tape labels on cigarettes for six cents per thousand (as one child featured in Todd’s article does).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the same forces that worked to eliminate child labor and exploitation and gave parents more room and incentive to invest in their progeny have also worked to strip children of independence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This month, The Argument polled voters about modern parenting. I found it striking how far our society has pushed back the age at which children are trusted with even the barest autonomy — or, from another angle, how many years we expect parents to dedicate all their time to closely supervising them. (The full crosstabs are available to paying subscribers at the bottom of this post.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We asked “At what age do you think it is appropriate for a child to stay home alone for an hour or two?” To my astonishment, 36% of respondents said that it was not appropriate until “between the ages of 14 and 17.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are a third of you really refusing to leave your 13-year-olds home alone for a couple hours while you go to the grocery store? Or are those respondents the ones who don’t have children?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I asked my colleague Lakshya Jain to break the data down for me, and parents aren’t much different than nonparents here — 37% of parents and 35% of nonparents said it wasn’t appropriate until the child was aged 14 to 17.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or take the responses to another question we asked: “When parents allow a 10-year-old child to play alone in a nearby park for three hours, should they be investigated by Child Protective Services for potential neglect?” Again, 36% of respondents said that they should — and since it only takes one person to make a CPS call, many of your neighbors thinking it’s wildly inappropriate for a child to play alone at the park could amount to an effective ban on doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don’t have kids, it can be pretty hard to have a good mental picture of what capabilities a 10-year-old has and doesn’t have, so I expect some readers may be adrift in trying to estimate whether this survey result is reasonable or nuts. And 10-year-olds also vary enormously in their maturity and common sense. But I interact with lots of kids, so let me tell you: This is absolutely nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ten-year-olds are way past the age where you have to worry about them running into the road; I would trust the majority of 10-year-olds to play unsupervised for a few hours, and parents deciding whether to allow this have far more knowledge than anyone else of their specific child. Cellphones mean that it’s easy for a kid to contact their parents immediately if something comes up. When I was 10, I babysat for the neighbors, and I was a perfectly adequate babysitter; I think in most U.S. states today, that might be regarded as child neglect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The role of CPS in accelerating this transition to a highly supervised, highly limited childhood is probably underrated. Around 35% of American families have been investigated by CPS. In most of these cases, no maltreatment will be found — only about 1 in 8 families will ever have a finding of maltreatment. But obviously it is terrifying, as a parent, to be investigated, even if you are found to be doing fine; it will naturally heighten the anxiety experienced by parents and lead them to further restrict the activities of their children.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you get CPS called on you for letting your 10-year-old play at the park across the street, you aren’t likely to do it again even if CPS drops the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But despite my trepidations, the very population most likely to have CPS called on them are the ones most likely to support state intervention. Fully 50% of Black voters in our poll agreed that allowing a 10-year-old to play unsupervised at a park for a few hours was grounds for a CPS call. Just 33% of white voters and 37% of Hispanic voters said the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This might reflect the relatively higher rates of risk faced by Black children who are more likely to be victims of crimes, but the absolute risk is small enough for all children that playing freely in the park clearly passes the cost-benefit sniff test — especially when you consider the alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In about a century, we’ve gone from a world where many 14-year-olds are the breadwinners for their family — bad! — to a world where many of them aren’t even trusted to be in the house without a babysitter — also bad!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There has to be a middle ground, where we ensure that 14-year-olds don’t permanently foreclose opportunities for their future selves, ensure they all get a good education, and also don’t make them miserable by extending their adolescence a full decade during which they’re cut off from all the parts of the world that offer autonomy and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many analyses of the consequences of our ethos of extended childhood focus on the indirect effects on the parents. They focus on how the increasing demands of parenthood mean that parents are much less happy, without any corresponding benefit to their children. Or they focus on declining birth rates. These are serious problems, but it’s worth not skipping over the direct impacts on teenagers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Teenagers are allowed to do less and less in the physical world, even as (thanks to technological advancement) they have more and more access to the digital world. I’m not going to recapitulate Jonathan Haidt here; I actually feel very confused about precisely the role that Instagram and TikTok play in the stress and unhappiness of the modern American adolescent. But I feel on much more solid ground saying that the effects of the digital world on our kids is worse when it is the only world they have access to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When teenagers aren’t trusted to walk over to a friend’s house or play in the park, when they almost never have a part-time job where they can earn a paycheck and meet expectations that aren’t purely artificial, then I think it’s much harder for them to have a realistic, non-algorithm-driven worldview and concrete life goals they can work toward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t have good data on teen suicides in 1910 — and it has historically been common for suicides to be recorded as accidents, making it extremely hard to confidently compare across time periods. All the same, I think teen suicides are up. In 1950, there were 2.7 suicides per 100,000 15- to 19-year-olds. Today, there are 7.5 (though that’s down from a 1990s peak of 13.2).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No one could possibly examine what it was like to be a teenager a century ago and soberly call for a return to it. Things are better now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, it would be a tragedy if the explosion of prosperity that freed our children from labor traps them under increasing supervision and diminished opportunities for meaningful choice and meaningful participation in society. Today’s child endangerment doesn’t come from dangerous machines, high mortality rates, or a lack of K-12 opportunities — it often comes from a lack of agency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the last 100 years, we gave our children better and safer childhoods. Now it’s time to give them the teen years they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;It's all about momentum, innit?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In physics and in your life, the only metric you should care about is momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I enjoy rally games. What made them truly click for me is understanding that rally driving is all about weight transfer. A car is a spring, and any of your inputs, throttle, brake or steering, unsettles the 1000 kg of steel you're controlling in a particular direction. If you brake too hard, most of the weight moves forward, your steering wheels will have better grip but could easily lock up; the back of the car lifts and sends you spinning. If you steer too hard in one direction, the lateral forces could make you tip over. This phenomenon is especially noticeable when driving older rally cars, which do not have modern tyres and quick-responding engines. You need to remain mindful that you are controlling a hunk of metal moving at large speed, and you need to apply the least amount of force to nudge it in the direction you want. The last thing you want to do is to be abrupt with your inputs and velocity changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People naturally resist change, and even more so as they get older. We pursue the ideal of being flexible and agile, but that's all aspirational nonsense that is often demanded of us, despite the reality that deep down we are more akin to freight trains, let alone rally cars. Slow to start, slow to change direction, and only once we get going the magic happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take the mandated two weeks of yearly holidays, for example. Have they ever been restorative? After a whole year of being immersed in your work, worrying about your daily chores, it's going to take a while to switch off, and a while longer to actually start to get used to the fact that you are in an unfamiliar setting, sleeping in an unknown bed. Why even subject yourself to all this stress for little benefit, one wonders. Your habits and routine condition your momentum, and anything unfamiliar, even if it is sitting on a lovely beach, will feel uncomfortable, and uncomfortable again readjusting to working 40 hours a week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the past 3 years I have picked up the habit of dedicating the morning hours of 9 to noon for creative, mental work. Every morning starts a blank slate, the stresses of yesterday hopefully digested and integrated into my psyche by sleep. What I quickly learned is that whatever I do in the first hour after waking up will set the tone for the entire day. If I read social media, my head will fill with nonsense I truly don't give a shit about, and will develop into a thirst for quick dopamine which escalates as the day rolls by. Any action, really, will set me in a particular direction and then it's too late to do anything about it. The only thing that has been working for me is to be completely intolerant of any distractions in the morning. Until noon, my phone is silenced. My email client is closed. Social media is blocked on all my devices. My chores and admin work are scheduled for the afternoon. This routine doesn't always work out, urgent matters might waste my precious morning, and it's healthy to accept that I can try and salvage the rest of the day, not to end up scrolling the internet all day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cal Newport talks about this exact idea in his book about deep work, but deep work is the just the result of being mindful of your momentum, of being the conductor of a freight train. Truly, the difference between your TV-bingeing self and your dream of being a writer has never been about willpower, or practice, or to never have acquired a taste for the liquor. It is all about being extremely jealous of your attention, setting aside time to pursue your craft and changing your whole life around this dream of yours. The train needs enough space to maneuver and to get going. On the other hand, creativity has never been about sheer effort; you don't need much sweating to go far. Consistency is key. Thirty minutes a day are much better than one day a week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will talk about habits, and capturing high-entropy spurts of creative energy in another post.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;A long-discussed plan to move the capital from Tehran to the wetter south is now “no longer optional” but a necessity.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The government blames the current crisis on changing climate [but] the dramatic water security issues of Iran are rooted in decades of disintegrated planning and managerial myopia,” says Keveh Madani, a former deputy head of the country’s environment department and now director of the United Nations University’s Institute of Water, Environment and Health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To meet growing water shortages in the country’s burgeoning cities, “Iran was one of the top three dam-builders in the world” in the late 20th century, says Penelope Mitchell, a geographer at the University of Arizona’s Global Water Security Center. Dozens were built on rivers too small to sustain them. Rather than fixing shortages, the reservoirs have increased the loss of water due to evaporation from their large surface areas, she says, while lowering river flows downstream and drying up wetlands and underground water reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, many of the reservoirs behind those dams are all but empty. Iran’s president made his call to relocate the capital after water levels in Tehran’s five reservoirs plunged to 12 percent of capacity last month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iran’s neighbors are exacerbating the crisis. In Afghanistan, the source of two rivers important to Iran’s water supplies (the Helmand and Harirud), the Taliban are on their own dam-building spree that is reducing cross-border flows. The Pashdan Dam, which went into operation in August, “means Afghanistan can control up to 80 percent of the average stream flow of the Harirud,” says Mitchell, threatening water supplies to much of eastern Iran, including Iran’s second largest city, Mashhad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While surface waters suffer, the situation underground is even worse. In the past 40 years, Iranians have sunk more than a million wells fitted with powerful pumps. The aim has been to irrigate arid farmland to meet the country’s goal of food self-sufficiency in a hostile world of trade sanctions. But the result has been rampant overpumping of aquifers that once held copious amounts of water.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The majority of Iran’s precious underground water reserves have been pumped dry, says Madani. He estimates a loss of more than 210 cubic kilometers [50 cubic miles] of stored water in the first two decades of this century.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iran is far from alone in overpumping its precious national water stores. But a recent international study of 1,700 underground water reserves in 40 countries found that a staggering 32 of the world’s 50 most overpumped aquifers are in Iran. “The biggest alarm bells are in Iran’s West Qazvin Plain, Arsanjan Basin, Baladeh Basin, and Rashtkhar aquifers,” says coauthor Richard Taylor, geographer at University College London. In each, water tables are falling by up to 10 feet a year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agriculture is the prime culprit, says Mitchell. In Iran, some 90 percent of the water abstracted from rivers and underground aquifers is taken for agriculture. But as ever more pumped wells are sunk, their returns are diminishing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analyzing the most recently publicly available figures, Roohollah Noori, a freshwater ecologist until recently at the University of Tehran, found that the number of wells and other abstraction points had almost doubled since 2000. But the amount of water successfully brought to the surface fell by 18 percent. In many places, formerly irrigated fields lie barren and abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As reservoirs empty and wells fail, the country’s hydrologists say Iran is on the verge of “water bankruptcy.” They forecast food shortages, a repetition of water protests that spread across the country in the summer of 2021, and even a water war with Afghanistan over its dam-building. And a long-discussed plan to move the capital from Tehran to the wetter south of the country is now “no longer optional” but a necessity, because of water shortages, says Iran’s president. No detailed plans have yet been drawn up, but the Makran region on the shores of the Gulf of Oman is seen as the most likely location for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Hydrologists say about half of Iran’s qanat systems have been rendered waterless by poor maintenance or overpumping.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a tragic turnaround for an arid country with a proud tradition of sophisticated management of its meager water resources. Iran is the origin and cultural and engineering heartland of ancient water-collecting systems known as qanats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qanats are gently sloping tunnels dug into hillsides in riverless regions to tap underground water, allowing it to flow out into valleys using gravity alone. They have long sustained the country’s farmers, as well as being until recently the main source of water for cities such as Tehran, Yazd, and Isfahan. But today only one in seven fields are irrigated by the tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iran has an estimated 70,000 of these structures, most of which are more than 2,500 years old. Their aggregate length has been put at more than 250,000 miles. The Gonabad qanat network, reputedly the world’s largest, extends for more than 20 miles beneath the Barakuh Mountains of northeast Iran. The tunnels are more than 3 feet high, reach a depth of a thousand feet, and are supplied by more than 400 vertical wells for maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike pumped wells, qanats are an inherently sustainable source of water. They can only take as much water as is replenished by the rain. Yet such has been their durability that they were often called “everlasting springs.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This Persian technology spread far and wide from China to North Africa and Spain, which exported the idea to the Americas. Many qanats have fallen out of use, deprived of water by pumped wells. Some countries, such as Oman, are reviving them as the most viable water resources in many arid regions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in their homeland, there is no such action. Iranian hydrologists estimate that in the past half century, around half of Iran’s qanats have been rendered waterless through poor maintenance or as pumped wells have lowered water tables within hillsides. Noori found that groundwater depletion began in the early 1950s and “coincided with the gradual replacement of Persian qanats… with deep wells”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“History will never forgive us for what [deep wells] have done to our qanats,” says Mohammad Barshan, director of the Qanats Center in Kerman.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides overpumping, a second reason why Iran’s underground water reserves are slipping away is that less water is seeping down from surface water bodies and soils to replenish them. Noori found a 35 percent decline in aquifer recharge since 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Iranian experts are calling for a massive switch of funding from dams and wells to repairing historic qanat systems.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One reason is climate change. Droughts have combined with warmer temperatures that reduce winter snow cover, which is a major means of groundwater replenishment in the mountains. But Noori identifies “human intervention” as the main cause — especially dams and abstractions for irrigation that dry up rivers, natural lakes, and wetlands, whose seepage is another major source of recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lake Urmia in northwest Iran was once the Middle East’s largest lake, covering more than 2,300 square miles. But NASA satellite images taken in 2023 showed it had almost completely dried up. Similarly, the Hamoun wetland, straddling the Iran-Afghan border on the Helmand River, once covered some 1,500 square miles and was home to abundant wildlife, including a population of leopards. Now it is mostly lifeless salt flats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The loss of such ecological jewels makes a mockery of Iran’s status as the host of the 1971 treaty to protect internationally important wetlands, named after Ramsar, the Iranian city where it was signed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another factor in the reduced recharge, says Noori, is the introduction of more modern irrigation methods aimed at getting more crops from less water. Farmers are being encouraged to line canals and irrigate crops more efficiently. But this greater “efficiency” has a perverse consequence: It results in less water seeping below ground to top up aquifers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hydrologists warn that much of the damage to aquifers is permanent. As they dry out, their water-holding pores collapse. As qanats dry up, they too cave in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the surface, this is causing an epidemic of subsidence. According to Iranian remote sensing expert Mahmud Haghshenas Haghighi, now at Leibniz University in Germany, subsidence affects more than 3.5 percent of the country. Ancient cities once reliant on qanats, such as Isfahan and Yazd, are seeing buildings and infrastructure damaged on a huge scale. Geologists call it a “silent earthquake.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, while surface structures can be repaired, the geological wreckage underground cannot. “Once significant subsidence and compression occurs, much of the… water storage capacity is permanently lost and cannot be restored, even if water levels later rise,” says Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Critics say officials are closely aligned with politically well-connected engineers bent on constructing ever more big projects.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What can be done to ward off Iran’s water bankruptcy? Many Iranian hydrologists believe there needs to be a massive switch of funding from dams and wells to repairing qanats, which Barshan says “remain the best solution for Iran’s ongoing water crisis,” and recharging the aquifers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aquifer recharge was long advocated by Iranian hydrologist Sayyed Ahang Kowsar, who died last year. Forty years ago, when a professor of natural resources at Shiraz University in southern Iran, he developed a successful pilot project that channeled occasional extreme mountain floods to recharge underground water beneath the Gareh-Bygone Plain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iran is estimated to lose at least a fifth of its rainfall to flash floods that flow uncollected into the ocean. Kowsar found that as much as 80 percent of those floodwaters could be redirected into aquifers. Yet hydrologists say the idea of tapping this water has been almost entirely rebuffed by the government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Critics such as Kowsar’s son Nik, a water analyst now working in the U.S., say officials are closely aligned with politically well-connected engineers bent on constructing ever more big projects such as dams. Their latest is a complex and expensive scheme to desalinate seawater from the Persian Gulf and pump it through some 2,300 miles of pipelines to parched provinces. A link to Isfahan opened this month. But, while the water is valuable for heavy industries such as steel, the high cost of desalination, pipes, and pumping makes it far too expensive for agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something has to give. More dams make no sense when the rivers are already running dry. More pumped wells make no sense when there is no water left to tap. They just hasten water bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Politically, the country’s ambition for food security through self-reliance needs to be rethought, hydrologists say. There is simply not enough water to achieve it in the long run. Madani and others call for farmers to switch from growing thirsty staple crops such as rice to higher-value, less water-intensive crops that can be sold internationally in exchange for staples. But that requires Iran to lose its current political status as an international pariah and rejoin the global trading community.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Slowness is a Virtue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;... at least when you're doing research, not development&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern culture is focused exclusively on questions that can be answered quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In academia, that’s what you can get funding for. Fast questions can be answered within a few weeks. You can then publish a paper. You can start collecting citations. You can present your answer at conferences. This is how you build a career.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the most important questions can’t be answered like that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you can write down a step-by-step plan for how you’re going to answer a question or solve a specific problem, you aren’t doing research but development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research means you only have a fuzzy idea of your destination but no clear idea of how you’re going to get there. You’re mostly just following hunches and intuitions. That’s how the biggest leaps forward are achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Development is the execution of a map toward a goal while research is the pursuit of a goal without a map.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on questions you can answer fast means you know what you’re doing. And knowing what you’re doing is a sign you’re not pushing into genuinely new territory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Slowness allows for the exploration of uncharted territory and unexpected discoveries. Johann Friedrich Böttger spent almost a decade trying to find a formula that produces gold. While he never succeeded, a byproduct of his relentless experimentation was the discovery of a process to produce porcelain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Andrew Wiles worked in secret for 7 years on Fermat’s Last Theorem, publishing nothing. It took Einstein around ten years to write down the foundational equation of General Relativity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this sense, when it comes to research, speed should be considered an anti-signal and slowness a virtue.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How Intelligence Leads Us Astray&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our very definition of intelligence encodes the bias toward speed. The modern definition of intelligence is extremely narrow. It simply describes the speed at which you can solve well-defined problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider this: if you get access to an IQ test weeks in advance, you could slowly work through all the problems and memorize the solutions. The test would then score you as a genius. This reveals what IQ tests actually measure. It’s not whether you can solve problems, but how fast you solve them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it’s exclusively this kind of intelligence that’s measured in academic and IQ tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What these tests completely miss is the ability to select problems worth working on and to choose interesting steps forward in the absence of a well-defined problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, many people live under the illusion that because their intelligence doesn’t fit this narrow definition, they’re not able to contribute something meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the saying goes, “if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where does this obsession with IQ come from? Partly from bad science that got repeated until it became truth. In the 1950s, a Harvard professor named Anne Roe claimed to have measured the IQs of Nobel Prize winners, reporting a median of 166. The finding has been cited ever since. But here’s what actually happened: she never used a real IQ test. She made up her own test from SAT questions, had no comparison group, and when the Nobel laureates took it, they scored... average. Not genius-level. Just fine. She then performed a mysterious statistical conversion to arrive at 166. The raw data showed nothing exceptional. But the inflated number is what survived.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Einstein never took an IQ test, but his school records show a B+ student who failed his college entrance exam on the first try. The numbers you see cited are invented. And the few geniuses we do have data on, like Richard Feynman, scored a “mere” 125.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, it’s not hard to imagine how raw processing speed can be counterproductive. People who excel at quickly solving well-defined problems tend to gravitate toward... well-defined problems. They choose what to work on based on what they’re good at, not necessarily what’s worth doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider Marilyn vos Savant, listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for the highest recorded IQ. What does she do with it? She writes a puzzle column for Parade magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Slow thinkers, on the other hand, have an easier time ignoring legible problems. They’re not constantly tempted by technical puzzles they know they could solve.2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The obsession with processing speed creates a systemic filter. Because we measure intelligence by how quickly one can reach a known finish line, we exclusively fund the ‘sprinters.’ But if you are a sprinter, you have no incentive to wander into the trackless wilderness of true research where speed is irrelevant because the direction is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, ‘sprinters’ rise to leadership and design institutions that reward the same legibility they excel at. Over time, our institutions have become nothing but a series of well-manicured running tracks. By rewarding those who can write down and finish well-explained plans the fastest, we have built a world that has no room for anyone who doesn’t yet have a plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Illegibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Legibility and speed are connected. Well-defined problems come with clear milestones, measurable progress, and recognizable success. They’re easy to explain to funding committees, to put on a CV, to defend in casual conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, as Michael Nielsen put it: “the most significant creative work is illegible to existing institutions, and so almost unfundable. There is a grain of truth to Groucho’s Law: you should never work on any project for which you can get funding.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because if it’s fundable, it means the path is already clear enough that it will happen anyway. You’re not needed there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many people abandon interesting problems because they don’t know how to defend them and how to lay out a legible path forward. When someone asks “what are you working on?” they need an answer that immediately makes sense. When people ask “how’s it going?” they need visible progress to report. The illegible path offers neither. So most people switch to something they can explain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is how modern institutions crush slow thinkers. Through thousand small moments the illegible path becomes socially unbearable.3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So here is a question worth sitting with: What problem would you work on if you could delete “legible progress within the next ten years” from your list of requirements?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you’re doing development, on the other hand, slowness should be called out and criticised. It is right to ask why so many development projects take so much longer compared to similar projects in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mom likes to make fun of me for thinking slowly. She’s not wrong. It’s why I’m boring in conversations and prefer writing, where I can take my time. School almost crushed me until I realized there is no free lunch in either direction and every weakness is a strength. Slow thinking gives you the patience to sit with ambigious problems that don’t have obvious answers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many people know that I don’t like talking about what I’m working on. This is a big reason why. I don’t want to waste any energy defending illegible ideas. The other reason is that talking about plans tricks the brain into feeling like you’ve already made progress. The satisfaction you get from explaining your vision can quickly replace the drive to actually execute it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it comes to fighting climate change, you canât manage what you canât measure. Under the Trump administration, U.S. efforts to track planet-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions face an existential threat, but that isnât stopping one team of researchers from producing this essential data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature Scientific Data, the team presented findings from the fourth version of Vulcan, a dataset that captures every source of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion across the United States at an incredibly fine scale. This latest release includes the map below, which pinpoints hot spots of fossil fuel CO2 emissions produced in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;âThe U.S. taxpayers have a right to this data,â lead author Kevin Gurney, a professor at Northern Arizona Universityâs School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems (SICCS), said in a release. âWith the proposed rule to end the United States Environmental Protection Agency greenhouse gas reporting program, this data is more important than ever.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Zeroing-in on carbon sources&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gurney and his team have spent the last 20 years developing highly granular maps of CO2 emissions through the Vulcan project. This multi-agency-funded research effort aims to aid quantification of the North American carbon budget, identify carbon sources and sinks, and meet the technical and scientific needs of higher-resolution fossil fuel CO2 observations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new map clearly shows which parts of the U.S. were the worst emitters in 2022. Notice that the highest emissions (areas in red) correspond to areas of greater population density, such as the East Coast and major cities like Dallas, Texas. In general, emissions were much higher across the eastern half of the county, where most people live.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite its fine level of detail, this map is actually a high-level visualization of the data Vulcan provides. âThe output constitutes many terabytes of data and requires a high-performance computing system to run,â co-author Pawlok Dass, a SICCS research associate, said in the release. âIt captures CO2 emissions at unprecedented resolutionâdown to every city block, road segment and individual factory or power plant.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Emissions reporting amid hostility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vulcan could soon help fill a major gap in emissions data. In September, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed ending the âburdensomeâ Greenhouse Gas Reporting (GHGRP) Program, claiming this will save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs while still meeting the agencyâs statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The GHGRP requires facilities that emit more than 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year to report their emissions annually to the EPA. This rule applies to roughly 13,000 facilities that produce an estimated 85% to 90% of the countryâs total greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EPAâs proposal has been met with some opposition from both sides of the aisle, but whether this will be enough to keep it from moving forward remains to be seen. If a major blind spot in federal emissions tracking does emerge, research efforts like the Vulcan project could fill inâas long as they can keep their funding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;âIn spite of the science funding cuts and threats to federal science data reporting, my team will continue to produce and share data critical to climate change and environmental quality,â Gurney said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Creating apps like Signal or WhatsApp could be 'hostile activity,' claims UK watchdog&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's the latest blow to encryption in the UK&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Encrypted messaging developers may be considered hostile actors in the UK&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An independent review of national security law warns of overreach&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Encryption repeatedly targeted by UK lawmakers&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developers of apps that use end-to-end encryption to protect private communications could be considered hostile actors in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is the stark warning from Jonathan Hall KC, the government’s Independent Reviewer of State Threats Legislation and Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, in a new report on national security laws.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his independent review of the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act and the newly implemented National Security Act, Hall KC highlights the incredibly broad scope of powers granted to authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He warns that developers of apps like Signal and WhatsApp could technically fall within the legal definition of "hostile activity" simply because their technology "make[s] it more difficult for UK security and intelligence agencies to monitor communications."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He writes: "It is a reasonable assumption that this would be in the interests of a foreign state even if though the foreign state has never contemplated this potential advantage."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The report also notes that journalists "carrying confidential information" or material "personally embarrassing to the Prime Minister on the eve of important treaty negotiations" could face similar scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While it remains to be seen how this report will influence future amendments, it comes at a time of increasing pressure from lawmakers against encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Encryption under siege&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the report’s strong wording may come as a shock, it doesn't exist in a vacuum. Encrypted apps are increasingly in the crosshairs of UK lawmakers, with several pieces of legislation targeting the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most notably, Apple was served with a technical capability notice under the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) demanding it weaken the encryption protecting iCloud data. That legal standoff led the tech giant to disable its Advanced Data Protection instead of creating a backdoor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Online Safety Act is already well known for its controversial age verification requirements. However, its most contentious provisions have yet to be fully implemented, and experts fear these could undermine encryption even further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Monday, Parliament debated the Act following a petition calling for its repeal. Instead of rolling back the law, however, MPs pushed for stricter enforcement. During the discussion, lawmakers specifically called for a review of other encrypted tools, like the best VPNs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The potential risks of the Act's tougher stance on encryption were only briefly mentioned during the discussion, suggesting a stark disconnect between MPs and security experts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Olivier Crépin-Leblond, of the Internet Society, told TechRadar he was disappointed by the outcome of the debate. "When it came to Client Side Scanning (CSS), most felt this could be one of the 'easy technological fixes' that could help law enforcement greatly, especially when they showed their frustration at Facebook rolling end-to-end encryption," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's clearly not understood that any such software could fall prey to hackers."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is clear that for many lawmakers, encryption is viewed primarily as an obstacle to law enforcement. This stands in sharp contrast to the view of digital rights experts, who stress that the technology is vital for protecting privacy and security in an online landscape where cyberattacks are rising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The government signposts end-to-end encryption as a threat, but what they fail to consider is that breaking it would be a threat to our national security too," Jemimah Steinfeld, CEO of Index on Censorship, told TechRadar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She also added that this ignores encryption's vital role for dissidents, journalists, and domestic abuse victims, "not to mention the general population who should be afforded basic privacy."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the battle lines drawn, we can expect a challenging year ahead for services like Signal and WhatsApp. Both companies have previously pledged to leave the UK market rather than compromise their users' privacy and security.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;We are a small team of kind and talented people&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Let’s grow together&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Hightouch, we’re committed to helping our customers, business, and employees grow. As a series C startup backed by top investors, we are determined to continuously raise the bar and provide the best product in the market. Grow your career in a fast paced environment that values creative thinking and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our values&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Forever hungry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are hungry and ambitious. We celebrate our accomplishments, but we’re never fully satisfied. We’re always figuring out how to collectively push ourselves further and do more.If we think we can grow the company 5x this year, the first question should be “why not 10x?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Kindness&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to create an environment where people feel actively welcomed, encouraged, and supported. People who aren’t kind aren’t tolerated — it’s just not worth it.We intrinsically believe in a deeper kindness as a core value, aside from its obvious benefits to the business&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Efficient execution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speed matters. We don’t have time for endless deliberation — most decisions are two-way doors. Move fast, adapt quickly.We take inspiration from others and don’t innovate where we don’t need to. We communicate clearly because time is precious. We parallelize to the greatest extent possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compassion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We listen to everyone and try to put ourselves in their shoes, regardless of our initial reaction to what they say.This applies to everyone — customers, prospects, partners, peers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Impact driven&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone should be intrinsically motivated by business impact. We minimize distractions and prioritize our time based on what’s actually impactful to the business.We value people at all levels based on their impact above anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Raising the bar&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have high expectations for performance and believe in having exceptional talent in every position. We understand the value of great people.We look deeper than credentials, prioritize slope over y-intercept, and put in the hard work to find those that truly raise the bar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Humility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are humble. Listening is mission critical — we are open to others’ perspectives and ideas. No work is beneath us. We also believe that humility leads to foresight.If we are not grounded and open minded, we blind ourselves from key opportunities and risks in every aspect of business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benefits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Competitive compensation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We offer competitive compensation and meaningful equity. We also offer 401k for our US employees and retirement plans for our international employees.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Flexible PTO&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Downtime is just as important as on time and your teammates will support you while you relax and recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Core benefits&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For full-time US-based employees, we cover all health benefit premiums, 80% for dependents, and life insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Parental leave&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We value and support the family planning process. We provide up to 16 weeks for parents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Professional development&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We support employees for all learning resources needed to grow in their role (classes, books, conferences, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Connectivity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We offer a $50 per month cell-phone or wifi connectivity stipend to all employees.&lt;/p&gt;
