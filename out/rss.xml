  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Claude Opus 4.6&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re upgrading our smartest model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Claude Opus 4.6 improves on its predecessor’s coding skills. It plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, can operate more reliably in larger codebases, and has better code review and debugging skills to catch its own mistakes. And, in a first for our Opus-class models, Opus 4.6 features a 1M token context window in beta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opus 4.6 can also apply its improved abilities to a range of everyday work tasks: running financial analyses, doing research, and using and creating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. Within Cowork, where Claude can multitask autonomously, Opus 4.6 can put all these skills to work on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model’s performance is state-of-the-art on several evaluations. For example, it achieves the highest score on the agentic coding evaluation Terminal-Bench 2.0 and leads all other frontier models on Humanity’s Last Exam, a complex multidisciplinary reasoning test. On GDPval-AA—an evaluation of performance on economically valuable knowledge work tasks in finance, legal, and other domains1—Opus 4.6 outperforms the industry’s next-best model (OpenAI’s GPT-5.2) by around 144 Elo points,2 and its own predecessor (Claude Opus 4.5) by 190 points. Opus 4.6 also performs better than any other model on BrowseComp, which measures a model’s ability to locate hard-to-find information online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we show in our extensive system card, Opus 4.6 also shows an overall safety profile as good as, or better than, any other frontier model in the industry, with low rates of misaligned behavior across safety evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Claude Code, you can now assemble agent teams to work on tasks together. On the API, Claude can use compaction to summarize its own context and perform longer-running tasks without bumping up against limits. We’re also introducing adaptive thinking, where the model can pick up on contextual clues about how much to use its extended thinking, and new effort controls to give developers more control over intelligence, speed, and cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve made substantial upgrades to Claude in Excel, and we’re releasing Claude in PowerPoint in a research preview. This makes Claude much more capable for everyday work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 is available today on claude.ai, our API, and all major cloud platforms. If you’re a developer, use &lt;code&gt;claude-opus-4-6&lt;/code&gt; via the Claude API. Pricing remains the same at $5/$25 per million tokens; for full details, see our pricing page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We cover the model, our new product updates, our evaluations, and our extensive safety testing in depth below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;First impressions&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We build Claude with Claude. Our engineers write code with Claude Code every day, and every new model first gets tested on our own work. With Opus 4.6, we’ve found that the model brings more focus to the most challenging parts of a task without being told to, moves quickly through the more straightforward parts, handles ambiguous problems with better judgment, and stays productive over longer sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opus 4.6 often thinks more deeply and more carefully revisits its reasoning before settling on an answer. This produces better results on harder problems, but can add cost and latency on simpler ones. If you’re finding that the model is overthinking on a given task, we recommend dialing effort down from its default setting (high) to medium. You can control this easily with the &lt;code&gt;/effort&lt;/code&gt; parameter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the things our Early Access partners told us about Claude Opus 4.6, including its propensity to work autonomously without hand-holding, its success where previous models failed, and its effect on how teams work:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 is the strongest model Anthropic has shipped. It takes complicated requests and actually follows through, breaking them into concrete steps, executing, and producing polished work even when the task is ambitious. For Notion users, it feels less like a tool and more like a capable collaborator.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Early testing shows Claude Opus 4.6 delivering on the complex, multi-step coding work developers face every day—especially agentic workflows that demand planning and tool calling. This starts unlocking long-horizon tasks at the frontier.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 is a huge leap for agentic planning. It breaks complex tasks into independent subtasks, runs tools and subagents in parallel, and identifies blockers with real precision.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 is the best model we've tested yet. Its reasoning and planning capabilities have been exceptional at powering our AI Teammates. It's also a fantastic coding model – its ability to navigate a large codebase and identify the right changes to make is state of the art.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 reasons through complex problems at a level we haven't seen before. It considers edge cases that other models miss and consistently lands on more elegant, well-considered solutions. We're particularly impressed with Opus 4.6 in Devin Review, where it's increased our bug catching rates.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 feels noticeably better than Opus 4.5 in Windsurf, especially on tasks that require careful exploration like debugging and understanding unfamiliar codebases. We’ve noticed Opus 4.6 thinks longer, which pays off when deeper reasoning is needed.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 represents a meaningful leap in long-context performance. In our testing, we saw it handle much larger bodies of information with a level of consistency that strengthens how we design and deploy complex research workflows. Progress in this area gives us more powerful building blocks to deliver truly expert-grade systems professionals can trust.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Across 40 cybersecurity investigations, Claude Opus 4.6 produced the best results 38 of 40 times in a blind ranking against Claude 4.5 models. Each model ran end to end on the same agentic harness with up to 9 subagents and 100+ tool calls.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 is the new frontier on long-running tasks from our internal benchmarks and testing. It's also been highly effective at reviewing code.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 achieved the highest BigLaw Bench score of any Claude model at 90.2%. With 40% perfect scores and 84% above 0.8, it’s remarkably capable for legal reasoning.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 autonomously closed 13 issues and assigned 12 issues to the right team members in a single day, managing a ~50-person organization across 6 repositories. It handled both product and organizational decisions while synthesizing context across multiple domains, and it knew when to escalate to a human.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 is an uplift in design quality. It works beautifully with our design systems and it’s more autonomous, which is core to Lovable’s values. People should be creating things that matter, not micromanaging AI.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 excels in high-reasoning tasks like multi-source analysis across legal, financial, and technical content. Box’s eval showed a 10% lift in performance, reaching 68% vs. a 58% baseline, and near-perfect scores in technical domains.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 generates complex, interactive apps and prototypes in Figma Make with an impressive creative range. The model translates detailed designs and multi-layered tasks into code on the first try, making it a powerful starting point for teams to explore and build ideas.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 is the best Anthropic model we’ve tested. It understands intent with minimal prompting and went above and beyond, exploring and creating details I didn’t even know I wanted until I saw them. It felt like I was working with the model, not waiting on it.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Both hands-on testing and evals show Claude Opus 4.6 is a meaningful improvement for design systems and large codebases, use cases that drive enormous enterprise value. It also one-shotted a fully functional physics engine, handling a large multi-scope task in a single pass.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 is the biggest leap I’ve seen in months. I’m more comfortable giving it a sequence of tasks across the stack and letting it run. It’s smart enough to use subagents for the individual pieces.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;Claude Opus 4.6 handled a multi-million-line codebase migration like a senior engineer. It planned up front, adapted its strategy as it learned, and finished in half the time.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;We only ship models in v0 when developers will genuinely feel the difference. Claude Opus 4.6 passed that bar with ease. Its frontier-level reasoning, especially with edge cases, helps v0 to deliver on our number-one aim: to let anyone elevate their ideas from prototype to production.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;The performance jump with Claude Opus 4.6 feels almost unbelievable. Real-world tasks that were challenging for Opus [4.5] suddenly became easy. This feels like a watershed moment for spreadsheet agents on Shortcut.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Evaluating Claude Opus 4.6&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across agentic coding, computer use, tool use, search, and finance, Opus 4.6 is an industry-leading model, often by a wide margin. The table below shows how Claude Opus 4.6 compares to our previous models and to other industry models on a variety of benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opus 4.6 is much better at retrieving relevant information from large sets of documents. This extends to long-context tasks, where it holds and tracks information over hundreds of thousands of tokens with less drift, and picks up buried details that even Opus 4.5 would miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common complaint about AI models is “context rot,” where performance degrades as conversations exceed a certain number of tokens. Opus 4.6 performs markedly better than its predecessors: on the 8-needle 1M variant of MRCR v2—a needle-in-a-haystack benchmark that tests a model’s ability to retrieve information “hidden” in vast amounts of text—Opus 4.6 scores 76%, whereas Sonnet 4.5 scores just 18.5%. This is a qualitative shift in how much context a model can actually use while maintaining peak performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, Opus 4.6 is better at finding information across long contexts, better at reasoning after absorbing that information, and has substantially better expert-level reasoning abilities in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the charts below show how Claude Opus 4.6 performs on a variety of benchmarks that assess its software engineering skills, multilingual coding ability, long-term coherence, cybersecurity capabilities, and its life sciences knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A step forward on safety&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;These intelligence gains do not come at the cost of safety. On our automated behavioral audit, Opus 4.6 showed a low rate of misaligned behaviors such as deception, sycophancy, encouragement of user delusions, and cooperation with misuse. Overall, it is just as well-aligned as its predecessor, Claude Opus 4.5, which was our most-aligned frontier model to date. Opus 4.6 also shows the lowest rate of over-refusals—where the model fails to answer benign queries—of any recent Claude model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Claude Opus 4.6, we ran the most comprehensive set of safety evaluations of any model, applying many different tests for the first time and upgrading several that we’ve used before. We included new evaluations for user wellbeing, more complex tests of the model’s ability to refuse potentially dangerous requests, and updated evaluations of the model’s ability to surreptitiously perform harmful actions. We also experimented with new methods from interpretability, the science of the inner workings of AI models, to begin to understand why the model behaves in certain ways—and, ultimately, to catch problems that standard testing might miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A detailed description of all capability and safety evaluations is available in the Claude Opus 4.6 system card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve also applied new safeguards in areas where Opus 4.6 shows particular strengths that might be put to dangerous as well as beneficial uses. In particular, since the model shows enhanced cybersecurity abilities, we’ve developed six new cybersecurity probes—methods of detecting harmful responses—to help us track different forms of potential misuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re also accelerating the cyberdefensive uses of the model, using it to help find and patch vulnerabilities in open-source software (as we describe in our new cybersecurity blog post). We think it’s critical that cyberdefenders use AI models like Claude to help level the playing field. Cybersecurity moves fast, and we’ll be adjusting and updating our safeguards as we learn more about potential threats; in the near future, we may institute real-time intervention to block abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Product and API updates&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve made substantial updates across Claude, Claude Code, and the Claude Developer Platform to let Opus 4.6 perform at its best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude Developer Platform&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the API, we’re giving developers better control over model effort and more flexibility for long-running agents. To do so, we’re introducing the following features:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Adaptive thinking. Previously, developers only had a binary choice between enabling or disabling extended thinking. Now, with adaptive thinking, Claude can decide when deeper reasoning would be helpful. At the default effort level (high), the model uses extended thinking when useful, but developers can adjust the effort level to make it more or less selective.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Effort. There are now four effort levels to choose from: low, medium, high (default), and max. We encourage developers to experiment with different options to find what works best.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Context compaction (beta). Long-running conversations and agentic tasks often hit the context window. Context compaction automatically summarizes and replaces older context when the conversation approaches a configurable threshold, letting Claude perform longer tasks without hitting limits.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;1M token context (beta). Opus 4.6 is our first Opus-class model with 1M token context. Premium pricing applies for prompts exceeding 200k tokens ($10/$37.50 per million input/output tokens).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;128k output tokens. Opus 4.6 supports outputs of up to 128k tokens, which lets Claude complete larger-output tasks without breaking them into multiple requests.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;US-only inference. For workloads that need to run in the United States, US-only inference is available at 1.1× token pricing.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product updates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across Claude and Claude Code, we’ve added features that allow knowledge workers and developers to tackle harder tasks with more of the tools they use every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve introduced agent teams in Claude Code as a research preview. You can now spin up multiple agents that work in parallel as a team and coordinate autonomously—best for tasks that split into independent, read-heavy work like codebase reviews. You can take over any subagent directly using Shift+Up/Down or tmux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude now also works better with the office tools you already use. Claude in Excel handles long-running and harder tasks with improved performance, and can plan before acting, ingest unstructured data and infer the right structure without guidance, and handle multi-step changes in one pass. Pair that with Claude in PowerPoint, and you can first process and structure your data in Excel, then bring it to life visually in PowerPoint. Claude reads your layouts, fonts, and slide masters to stay on brand, whether you’re building from a template or generating a full deck from a description. Claude in PowerPoint is now available in research preview for Max, Team, and Enterprise plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Footnotes&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1] Run independently by Artificial Analysis. See here for full methodological details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[2] This translates into Claude Opus 4.6 obtaining a higher score than GPT-5.2 on this eval approximately 70% of the time (where 50% of the time would have implied parity in the scores).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;For GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro models, we compared the best reported model version in the charts and table.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Terminal-Bench 2.0: We report both scores reproduced on our infrastructure and published scores from other labs. All runs used the Terminus-2 harness, except for OpenAI’s Codex CLI. All experiments used 1× guaranteed / 3× ceiling resource allocation and 5–15 samples per task across staggered batches. See system card for details.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Humanity’s Last Exam: Claude models run “with tools” were run with web search, web fetch, code execution, programmatic tool calling, context compaction triggered at 50k tokens up to 3M total tokens, max reasoning effort, and adaptive thinking enabled. A domain blocklist was used to decontaminate eval results. See system card for more details.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;SWE-bench Verified: Our score was averaged over 25 trials. With a prompt modification, we saw a score of 81.42%.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;MCP Atlas: Claude Opus 4.6 was run with max effort. When run at high effort, it reached an industry-leading score of 62.7%.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;BrowseComp: Claude models were run with web search, web fetch, programmatic tool calling, context compaction triggered at 50k tokens up to 10M total tokens, max reasoning effort, and no thinking enabled. Adding a multi-agent harness increased scores to 86.8%. See system card for more details.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;ARC AGI 2: Claude Opus 4.6 was run with max effort and a 120k thinking budget score.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;CyberGym: Claude models were run on no thinking, default effort, temperature, and &lt;code&gt;top_p&lt;/code&gt;. The model was also given a “think” tool that allowed interleaved thinking for multi-turn evaluations.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;OpenRCA: For each failure case in OpenRCA, Claude receives 1 point if all generated root-cause elements match the ground-truth ones, and 0 points if any mismatch is identified. The overall accuracy is the average score across all failure cases. The benchmark was run on the benchmark author’s harness, graded using their official methodology, and has been submitted for official verification.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Related content&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Claude is a space to think&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. We explain why advertising incentives are incompatible with a genuinely helpful AI assistant, and how we plan to expand access without compromising user trust.&lt;/p&gt;Read more&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Agent teams are experimental and disabled by default. Enable them by adding&lt;code&gt;CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS&lt;/code&gt; to your settings.json or environment. Agent teams have known limitations around session resumption, task coordination, and shutdown behavior.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Agent teams let you coordinate multiple Claude Code instances working together. One session acts as the team lead, coordinating work, assigning tasks, and synthesizing results. Teammates work independently, each in its own context window, and communicate directly with each other.
Unlike subagents, which run within a single session and can only report back to the main agent, you can also interact with individual teammates directly without going through the lead.
This page covers:&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When to use agent teams&lt;/head&gt; Agent teams are most effective for tasks where parallel exploration adds real value. See use case examples for full scenarios. The strongest use cases are: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Research and review: multiple teammates can investigate different aspects of a problem simultaneously, then share and challenge each other’s findings&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;New modules or features: teammates can each own a separate piece without stepping on each other&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Debugging with competing hypotheses: teammates test different theories in parallel and converge on the answer faster&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Cross-layer coordination: changes that span frontend, backend, and tests, each owned by a different teammate&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;Agent teams add coordination overhead and use significantly more tokens than a single session. They work best when teammates can operate independently. For sequential tasks, same-file edits, or work with many dependencies, a single session or subagents are more effective.&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compare with subagents&lt;/head&gt; Both agent teams and subagents let you parallelize work, but they operate differently. Choose based on whether your workers need to communicate with each other: &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left" role="head"&gt;Subagents&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left" role="head"&gt;Agent teams&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Context&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Own context window; results return to the caller&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Own context window; fully independent&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Communication&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Report results back to the main agent only&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Teammates message each other directly&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Coordination&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Main agent manages all work&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Shared task list with self-coordination&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Best for&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Focused tasks where only the result matters&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Complex work requiring discussion and collaboration&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Token cost&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Lower: results summarized back to main context&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Higher: each teammate is a separate Claude instance&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Use subagents when you need quick, focused workers that report back. Use agent teams when teammates need to share findings, challenge each other, and coordinate on their own.&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Enable agent teams&lt;/head&gt; Agent teams are disabled by default. Enable them by setting the &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, either in your shell environment or through settings.json:
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Start your first agent team&lt;/head&gt; After enabling agent teams, tell Claude to create an agent team and describe the task and the team structure you want in natural language. Claude creates the team, spawns teammates, and coordinates work based on your prompt. This example works well because the three roles are independent and can explore the problem without waiting on each other: &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;I'm designing a CLI tool that helps developers track TODO comments across
their codebase. Create an agent team to explore this from different angles: one
teammate on UX, one on technical architecture, one playing devil's advocate.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;From there, Claude creates a team with a shared task list, spawns teammates for each perspective, has them explore the problem, synthesizes findings, and attempts to clean up the team when finished.
The lead’s terminal lists all teammates and what they’re working on. Use Shift+Up/Down to select a teammate and message them directly.
If you want each teammate in its own split pane, see Choose a display mode.&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Control your agent team&lt;/head&gt; Tell the lead what you want in natural language. It handles team coordination, task assignment, and delegation based on your instructions. &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Choose a display mode&lt;/head&gt; Agent teams support two display modes: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;In-process: all teammates run inside your main terminal. Use Shift+Up/Down to select a teammate and type to message them directly. Works in any terminal, no extra setup required.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Split panes: each teammate gets its own pane. You can see everyone’s output at once and click into a pane to interact directly. Requires tmux, or iTerm2.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt; has known limitations on certain operating systems and traditionally works best on macOS. Using &lt;code&gt;tmux -CC&lt;/code&gt; in iTerm2 is the suggested entrypoint into &lt;code&gt;tmux&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The default is&lt;code&gt;"auto"&lt;/code&gt;, which uses split panes if you’re already running inside a tmux session, and in-process otherwise. The &lt;code&gt;"tmux"&lt;/code&gt; setting enables split-pane mode and auto-detects whether to use tmux or iTerm2 based on your terminal. To override, set &lt;code&gt;teammateMode&lt;/code&gt; in your settings.json:
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "teammateMode": "in-process"
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;To force in-process mode for a single session, pass it as a flag:&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;claude --teammate-mode in-process
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Split-pane mode requires either tmux or iTerm2 with the&lt;code&gt;it2&lt;/code&gt; CLI. To install manually:
&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;tmux: install through your system’s package manager. See the tmux wiki for platform-specific instructions.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;iTerm2: install the &lt;code&gt;it2&lt;/code&gt; CLI, then enable the Python API in iTerm2 → Settings → General → Magic → Enable Python API.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Specify teammates and models&lt;/head&gt; Claude decides the number of teammates to spawn based on your task, or you can specify exactly what you want: &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;Create a team with 4 teammates to refactor these modules in parallel.
Use Sonnet for each teammate.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Require plan approval for teammates&lt;/head&gt; For complex or risky tasks, you can require teammates to plan before implementing. The teammate works in read-only plan mode until the lead approves their approach: &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;Spawn an architect teammate to refactor the authentication module.
Require plan approval before they make any changes.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;When a teammate finishes planning, it sends a plan approval request to the lead. The lead reviews the plan and either approves it or rejects it with feedback. If rejected, the teammate stays in plan mode, revises based on the feedback, and resubmits. Once approved, the teammate exits plan mode and begins implementation.
The lead makes approval decisions autonomously. To influence the lead’s judgment, give it criteria in your prompt, such as “only approve plans that include test coverage” or “reject plans that modify the database schema.”&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Use delegate mode&lt;/head&gt; Without delegate mode, the lead sometimes starts implementing tasks itself instead of waiting for teammates. Delegate mode prevents this by restricting the lead to coordination-only tools: spawning, messaging, shutting down teammates, and managing tasks. This is useful when you want the lead to focus entirely on orchestration, such as breaking down work, assigning tasks, and synthesizing results, without touching code directly. To enable it, start a team first, then press Shift+Tab to cycle into delegate mode. &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Talk to teammates directly&lt;/head&gt; Each teammate is a full, independent Claude Code session. You can message any teammate directly to give additional instructions, ask follow-up questions, or redirect their approach. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;In-process mode: use Shift+Up/Down to select a teammate, then type to send them a message. Press Enter to view a teammate’s session, then Escape to interrupt their current turn. Press Ctrl+T to toggle the task list.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Split-pane mode: click into a teammate’s pane to interact with their session directly. Each teammate has a full view of their own terminal.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Assign and claim tasks&lt;/head&gt; The shared task list coordinates work across the team. The lead creates tasks and teammates work through them. Tasks have three states: pending, in progress, and completed. Tasks can also depend on other tasks: a pending task with unresolved dependencies cannot be claimed until those dependencies are completed. The lead can assign tasks explicitly, or teammates can self-claim: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Lead assigns: tell the lead which task to give to which teammate&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Self-claim: after finishing a task, a teammate picks up the next unassigned, unblocked task on its own&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;Task claiming uses file locking to prevent race conditions when multiple teammates try to claim the same task simultaneously.&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Shut down teammates&lt;/head&gt; To gracefully end a teammate’s session: &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ask the researcher teammate to shut down
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The lead sends a shutdown request. The teammate can approve, exiting gracefully, or reject with an explanation.&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Clean up the team&lt;/head&gt; When you’re done, ask the lead to clean up: This removes the shared team resources. When the lead runs cleanup, it checks for active teammates and fails if any are still running, so shut them down first. &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always use the lead to clean up. Teammates should not run cleanup because their team context may not resolve correctly, potentially leaving resources in an inconsistent state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How agent teams work&lt;/head&gt; This section covers the architecture and mechanics behind agent teams. If you want to start using them, see Control your agent team above. &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How Claude starts agent teams&lt;/head&gt; There are two ways agent teams get started: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;You request a team: give Claude a task that benefits from parallel work and explicitly ask for an agent team. Claude creates one based on your instructions.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Claude proposes a team: if Claude determines your task would benefit from parallel work, it may suggest creating a team. You confirm before it proceeds.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;In both cases, you stay in control. Claude won’t create a team without your approval.&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Architecture&lt;/head&gt; An agent team consists of: &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left" role="head"&gt;Component&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left" role="head"&gt;Role&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Team lead&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;The main Claude Code session that creates the team, spawns teammates, and coordinates work&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Teammates&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Separate Claude Code instances that each work on assigned tasks&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Task list&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Shared list of work items that teammates claim and complete&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Mailbox&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell style="text-align:left"&gt;Messaging system for communication between agents&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;See Choose a display mode for display configuration options. Teammate messages arrive at the lead automatically.
The system manages task dependencies automatically. When a teammate completes a task that other tasks depend on, blocked tasks unblock without manual intervention.
Teams and tasks are stored locally:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Team config: &lt;code&gt;~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/config.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Task list: &lt;code&gt;~/.claude/tasks/{team-name}/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;The team config contains a&lt;code&gt;members&lt;/code&gt; array with each teammate’s name, agent ID, and agent type. Teammates can read this file to discover other team members.
&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Permissions&lt;/head&gt; Teammates start with the lead’s permission settings. If the lead runs with &lt;code&gt;--dangerously-skip-permissions&lt;/code&gt;, all teammates do too. After spawning, you can change individual teammate modes, but you can’t set per-teammate modes at spawn time.
&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Context and communication&lt;/head&gt; Each teammate has its own context window. When spawned, a teammate loads the same project context as a regular session: CLAUDE.md, MCP servers, and skills. It also receives the spawn prompt from the lead. The lead’s conversation history does not carry over. How teammates share information: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Automatic message delivery: when teammates send messages, they’re delivered automatically to recipients. The lead doesn’t need to poll for updates.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Idle notifications: when a teammate finishes and stops, they automatically notify the lead.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Shared task list: all agents can see task status and claim available work.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;Teammate messaging:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;message: send a message to one specific teammate&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;broadcast: send to all teammates simultaneously. Use sparingly, as costs scale with team size.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Token usage&lt;/head&gt; Agent teams use significantly more tokens than a single session. Each teammate has its own context window, and token usage scales with the number of active teammates. For research, review, and new feature work, the extra tokens are usually worthwhile. For routine tasks, a single session is more cost-effective. See agent team token costs for usage guidance. &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Use case examples&lt;/head&gt; These examples show how agent teams handle tasks where parallel exploration adds value. &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Run a parallel code review&lt;/head&gt; A single reviewer tends to gravitate toward one type of issue at a time. Splitting review criteria into independent domains means security, performance, and test coverage all get thorough attention simultaneously. The prompt assigns each teammate a distinct lens so they don’t overlap: &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;Create an agent team to review PR #142. Spawn three reviewers:
- One focused on security implications
- One checking performance impact
- One validating test coverage
Have them each review and report findings.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Each reviewer works from the same PR but applies a different filter. The lead synthesizes findings across all three after they finish.&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Investigate with competing hypotheses&lt;/head&gt; When the root cause is unclear, a single agent tends to find one plausible explanation and stop looking. The prompt fights this by making teammates explicitly adversarial: each one’s job is not only to investigate its own theory but to challenge the others’. &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;Users report the app exits after one message instead of staying connected.
Spawn 5 agent teammates to investigate different hypotheses. Have them talk to
each other to try to disprove each other's theories, like a scientific
debate. Update the findings doc with whatever consensus emerges.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The debate structure is the key mechanism here. Sequential investigation suffers from anchoring: once one theory is explored, subsequent investigation is biased toward it.
With multiple independent investigators actively trying to disprove each other, the theory that survives is much more likely to be the actual root cause.&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Best practices&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Give teammates enough context&lt;/head&gt; Teammates load project context automatically, including CLAUDE.md, MCP servers, and skills, but they don’t inherit the lead’s conversation history. See Context and communication for details. Include task-specific details in the spawn prompt: &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;Spawn a security reviewer teammate with the prompt: "Review the authentication module
at src/auth/ for security vulnerabilities. Focus on token handling, session
management, and input validation. The app uses JWT tokens stored in
httpOnly cookies. Report any issues with severity ratings."
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Size tasks appropriately&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Too small: coordination overhead exceeds the benefit&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Too large: teammates work too long without check-ins, increasing risk of wasted effort&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Just right: self-contained units that produce a clear deliverable, such as a function, a test file, or a review&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead breaks work into tasks and assigns them to teammates automatically. If it isn’t creating enough tasks, ask it to split the work into smaller pieces. Having 5-6 tasks per teammate keeps everyone productive and lets the lead reassign work if someone gets stuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Wait for teammates to finish&lt;/head&gt; Sometimes the lead starts implementing tasks itself instead of waiting for teammates. If you notice this: &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;Wait for your teammates to complete their tasks before proceeding
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Start with research and review&lt;/head&gt; If you’re new to agent teams, start with tasks that have clear boundaries and don’t require writing code: reviewing a PR, researching a library, or investigating a bug. These tasks show the value of parallel exploration without the coordination challenges that come with parallel implementation. &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Avoid file conflicts&lt;/head&gt; Two teammates editing the same file leads to overwrites. Break the work so each teammate owns a different set of files. &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Monitor and steer&lt;/head&gt; Check in on teammates’ progress, redirect approaches that aren’t working, and synthesize findings as they come in. Letting a team run unattended for too long increases the risk of wasted effort. &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Teammates not appearing&lt;/head&gt; If teammates aren’t appearing after you ask Claude to create a team: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;In in-process mode, teammates may already be running but not visible. Press Shift+Down to cycle through active teammates.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Check that the task you gave Claude was complex enough to warrant a team. Claude decides whether to spawn teammates based on the task.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If you explicitly requested split panes, ensure tmux is installed and available in your PATH: &lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;For iTerm2, verify the &lt;code&gt;it2&lt;/code&gt; CLI is installed and the Python API is enabled in iTerm2 preferences.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Too many permission prompts&lt;/head&gt; Teammate permission requests bubble up to the lead, which can create friction. Pre-approve common operations in your permission settings before spawning teammates to reduce interruptions. &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Teammates stopping on errors&lt;/head&gt; Teammates may stop after encountering errors instead of recovering. Check their output using Shift+Up/Down in in-process mode or by clicking the pane in split mode, then either: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Give them additional instructions directly&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Spawn a replacement teammate to continue the work&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Lead shuts down before work is done&lt;/head&gt; The lead may decide the team is finished before all tasks are actually complete. If this happens, tell it to keep going. You can also tell the lead to wait for teammates to finish before proceeding if it starts doing work instead of delegating. &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Orphaned tmux sessions&lt;/head&gt; If a tmux session persists after the team ends, it may not have been fully cleaned up. List sessions and kill the one created by the team: &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;tmux ls
tmux kill-session -t &amp;lt;session-name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Limitations&lt;/head&gt; Agent teams are experimental. Current limitations to be aware of: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;No session resumption with in-process teammates: &lt;code&gt;/resume&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/rewind&lt;/code&gt; do not restore in-process teammates. After resuming a session, the lead may attempt to message teammates that no longer exist. If this happens, tell the lead to spawn new teammates.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Task status can lag: teammates sometimes fail to mark tasks as completed, which blocks dependent tasks. If a task appears stuck, check whether the work is actually done and update the task status manually or tell the lead to nudge the teammate.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Shutdown can be slow: teammates finish their current request or tool call before shutting down, which can take time.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;One team per session: a lead can only manage one team at a time. Clean up the current team before starting a new one.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;No nested teams: teammates cannot spawn their own teams or teammates. Only the lead can manage the team.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Lead is fixed: the session that creates the team is the lead for its lifetime. You can’t promote a teammate to lead or transfer leadership.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Permissions set at spawn: all teammates start with the lead’s permission mode. You can change individual teammate modes after spawning, but you can’t set per-teammate modes at spawn time.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Split panes require tmux or iTerm2: the default in-process mode works in any terminal. Split-pane mode isn’t supported in VS Code’s integrated terminal, Windows Terminal, or Ghostty.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; works normally: teammates read &lt;code&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/code&gt; files from their working directory. Use this to provide project-specific guidance to all teammates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Next steps&lt;/head&gt; Explore related approaches for parallel work and delegation: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Lightweight delegation: subagents spawn helper agents for research or verification within your session, better for tasks that don’t need inter-agent coordination&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Manual parallel sessions: Git worktrees let you run multiple Claude Code sessions yourself without automated team coordination&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Compare approaches: see the subagent vs agent team comparison for a side-by-side breakdown&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re introducing a new model that unlocks even more of what Codex can do: GPT‑5.3-Codex, the most capable agentic coding model to date. The model advances both the frontier coding performance of GPT‑5.2-Codex and the reasoning and professional knowledge capabilities of GPT‑5.2, together in one model, which is also 25% faster. This enables it to take on long-running tasks that involve research, tool use, and complex execution. Much like a colleague, you can steer and interact with GPT‑5.3-Codex while it’s working, without losing context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.3‑Codex is our first model that was instrumental in creating itself. The Codex team used early versions to debug its own training, manage its own deployment, and diagnose test results and evaluations—our team was blown away by how much Codex was able to accelerate its own development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With GPT‑5.3-Codex, Codex goes from an agent that can write and review code to an agent that can do nearly anything developers and professionals can do on a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.3-Codex sets a new industry high on SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench, and shows strong performance on OSWorld and GDPval, four benchmarks we use to measure coding, agentic and real-world capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.3-Codex achieves state-of-the-art performance on SWE-Bench Pro, a rigorous evaluation of real-world software engineering. Where SWE‑bench Verified only tests Python, SWE‑Bench Pro spans four languages and is more contamination‑resistant, challenging, diverse and industry-relevant. It also far exceeds the previous state-of-the-art performance on Terminal-Bench 2.0, which measures the terminal skills a coding agent like Codex needs. Notably, GPT‑5.3‑Codex does so with fewer tokens than any prior model, letting users build more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Combining frontier coding capabilities, improvements in aesthetics, and compaction results in a model that can do striking work, building highly functional complex games and apps from scratch over the course of days. To test the model’s web development and long-running agentic capabilities, we asked GPT‑5.3‑Codex to build us two games: version two of the racing game from the Codex app launch, and a diving game. Using the develop web game skill and preselected, generic follow-up prompts like "fix the bug" or "improve the game", GPT‑5.3-Codex iterated on the games autonomously over millions of tokens. Watch the trailers and play the games for yourself to see what Codex can do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.3-Codex also better understands your intent when you ask it to make day-to-day websites, compared to GPT‑5.2-Codex. Simple or underspecified prompts now default to sites with more functionality and sensible defaults, giving you a stronger starting canvas to bring your ideas to life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, we asked GPT‑5.3-Codex and GPT‑5.2-Codex to build two landing pages below. GPT‑5.3-Codex automatically showed the yearly plan as a discounted monthly price, making the discount feel clear and intentional, instead of multiplying the yearly total. It also made an automatically transitioning testimonial carousel with three distinct user quotes rather than one, resulting in a page that feels more complete and production-ready by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software engineers, designers, product managers, and data scientists do far more than generate code. GPT‑5.3‑Codex is built to support all of the work in the software lifecycle—debugging, deploying, monitoring, writing PRDs, editing copy, user research, tests, metrics, and more. Its agentic capabilities go beyond software, helping you build whatever you want to build—whether it’s slide decks or analyzing data in sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With custom skills similar to those used for our previous GDPval results, GPT‑5.3‑Codex also shows strong performance on professional knowledge work as measured by GDPval, matching GPT‑5.2. GDPval is an evaluation OpenAI released in 2025 that measures a model’s performance on well‑specified knowledge‑work tasks across 44 occupations. These tasks include things like making presentations, spreadsheets, and other work products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below are a few examples of the work the agent produced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Prompt + task context&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;GPT-5.3-Codex output&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OSWorld is an agentic computer-use benchmark where the agent has to complete productivity tasks in a visual desktop computer environment. GPT‑5.3-Codex demonstrates far stronger computer use capabilities than previous GPT models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together, these results across coding, frontend, and computer-use and real-world tasks show that GPT‑5.3-Codex isn’t just better at individual tasks, but marks a step change toward a single, general-purpose agent that can reason, build, and execute across the full spectrum of real-world technical work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As model capabilities become more powerful, the gap shifts from what agents are capable of doing to how easily humans can interact with, direct and supervise many of them working in parallel. The Codex app makes managing and directing agents much easier, and now with GPT‑5.3-Codex it’s more interactive. With the new model, Codex provides frequent updates so you stay appraised of key decisions and progress as it works. Instead of waiting for a final output, you can interact in real time—ask questions, discuss approaches, and steer toward the solution. GPT‑5.3-Codex talks through what it’s doing, responds to feedback, and keeps you in the loop from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The recent rapid Codex improvements build on the fruit of research projects spanning months or years across all of OpenAI. These research projects are being accelerated by Codex, with many researchers and engineers at OpenAI describing their job today as being fundamentally different from what it was just two months ago. Even early versions of GPT‑5.3-Codex demonstrated exceptional capabilities, allowing our team to work with those earlier versions to improve training and support the deployment of later versions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codex is useful for a very broad range of tasks, making it difficult to fully enumerate the ways in which it helps our teams. As some examples, the research team used Codex to monitor and debug the training run for this release. It accelerated research beyond debugging infrastructure problems: it helped track patterns throughout the course of training, provided a deep analysis on interaction quality, proposed fixes and built rich applications for human researchers to precisely understand how the model’s behavior differed compared to prior models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The engineering team used Codex to optimize and adapt the harness for GPT‑5.3-Codex. When we started seeing strange edge cases impacting users, team members used Codex to identify context rendering bugs, and root cause low cache hit rates. GPT‑5.3-Codex is continuing to help the team throughout the launch by dynamically scaling GPU clusters to adjust to traffic surges and keeping latency stable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During alpha testing, one researcher wanted to understand how much additional work GPT‑5.3-Codex was getting done per turn and the associated difference in productivity. GPT‑5.3-Codex came up with several simple regex classifiers to estimate frequency of clarifications, positive and negative user responses, progress on the task, and then ran them scalably over all session logs and produced a report with its conclusion. People building with Codex were happier as the agent was better understanding their intent and made more progress per turn, with fewer clarifying questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to GPT‑5.3-Codex being so different from its predecessors, the data from alpha testing exhibited numerous unusual and counter-intuitive results. A data scientist on the team worked with GPT‑5.3-Codex to build new data pipelines and visualize the results much more richly than our standard dashboarding tools enabled. The results were co-analyzed with Codex, which concisely summarized key insights over thousands of data points in under three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Individually, all of these tasks are interesting examples of how Codex can help researchers and product builders. Taken together, we found that these new capabilities resulted in powerful acceleration of our research, engineering, and product teams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over recent months, we’ve seen meaningful gains in model performance on cybersecurity tasks, benefiting both developers and security professionals. In parallel, we’ve been preparing strengthened cyber safeguards to support defensive use and broader ecosystem resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.3-Codex is the first model we classify as High capability for cybersecurity-related tasks under our Preparedness Framework, and the first we’ve directly trained to identify software vulnerabilities. While we don’t have definitive evidence it can automate cyber attacks end-to-end, we’re taking a precautionary approach and deploying our most comprehensive cybersecurity safety stack to date. Our mitigations include safety training, automated monitoring, trusted access for advanced capabilities, and enforcement pipelines including threat intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because cybersecurity is inherently dual-use, we’re taking an evidence-based, iterative approach that accelerates defenders’ ability to find and fix vulnerabilities while slowing misuse. As part of this, we’re launching Trusted Access for Cyber, a pilot program to accelerate cyber defense research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re investing in ecosystem safeguards such as expanding the private beta of Aardvark, our security research agent, as the first offering in our suite of Codex Security products and tools, and partnering with open-source maintainers to provide free codebase scanning for widely used projects such as Next.js—where a security researcher used Codex to find vulnerabilities disclosed(opens in a new window) last week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building on our $1M Cybersecurity Grant Program launched in 2023, we’re also committing $10M in API credits to accelerate cyber defense with our most capable models, especially for open source software and critical infrastructure systems. Organizations engaged in good-faith security research can apply for API credits and support through our Cybersecurity Grant Program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.3-Codex is available with paid ChatGPT plans, everywhere you can use Codex: the app, CLI, IDE extension and web. We are working to safely enable API access soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this update, we are also now running GPT‑5.3-Codex 25% faster for Codex users, thanks to improvements in our infrastructure and inference stack, resulting in faster interactions and faster results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.3-Codex was co-designed for, trained with, and served on NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 systems. We are grateful to NVIDIA for their partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With GPT‑5.3-Codex, Codex is moving beyond writing code to using it as a tool to operate a computer and complete work end to end. By pushing the frontier of what a coding agent can do, we’re also unlocking a broader class of knowledge work—from building and deploying software to researching, analyzing, and executing complex tasks. What started as a focus on being the best coding agent has become the foundation for a more general collaborator on the computer, expanding both who can build and what’s possible with Codex.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;My AI Adoption Journey&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head class="pt-2 pb-2 text-md font-bold"&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My experience adopting any meaningful tool is that I've necessarily gone through three phases: (1) a period of inefficiency (2) a period of adequacy, then finally (3) a period of workflow and life-altering discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In most cases, I have to force myself through phase 1 and 2 because I usually have a workflow I'm already happy and comfortable with. Adopting a tool feels like work, and I do not want to put in the effort, but I usually do in an effort to be a well-rounded person of my craft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is my journey of how I found value in AI tooling and what I'm trying next with it. In an ocean of overly dramatic, hyped takes, I hope this represents a more nuanced, measured approach to my views on AI and how they've changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This blog post was fully written by hand, in my own words. I hate that I have to say that but especially given the subject matter, I want to be explicit about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Step 1: Drop the Chatbot&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Immediately cease trying to perform meaningful work via a chatbot (e.g. ChatGPT, Gemini on the web, etc.). Chatbots have real value and are a daily part of my AI workflow, but their utility in coding is highly limited because you're mostly hoping they come up with the right results based on their prior training, and correcting them involves a human (you) to tell them they're wrong repeatedly. It is inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think everyone's first experience with AI is a chat interface. And I think everyone's first experience trying to code with AI has been asking a chat interface to write code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I was still a heavy AI skeptic, my first "oh wow" moment was pasting a screenshot of Zed's command palette into Gemini, asking it to reproduce it with SwiftUI, and being truly flabbergasted that it did it very well. The command palette that ships for macOS in Ghostty today is only very lightly modified from what Gemini produced for me in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when I tried to reproduce that behavior for other tasks, I was left disappointed. In the context of brownfield projects, I found the chat interface produced poor results very often, and I found myself very frustrated copying and pasting code and command output to and from the interface. It was very obviously far less efficient than me doing the work myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To find value, you must use an agent. An agent is the industry-adopted term for an LLM that can chat and invoke external behavior in a loop1 At a bare minimum, the agent must have the ability to: read files, execute programs, and make HTTP requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Step 2: Reproduce Your Own Work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next phase on my journey I tried Claude Code. I'll cut to the chase: I initially wasn't impressed. I just wasn't getting good results out of my sessions. I felt I had to touch up everything it produced and this process was taking more time than if I had just done it myself. I read blog posts, watched videos, but just wasn't that impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of giving up, I forced myself to reproduce all my manual commits with agentic ones. I literally did the work twice. I'd do the work manually, and then I'd fight an agent to produce identical results in terms of quality and function (without it being able to see my manual solution, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was excruciating, because it got in the way of simply getting things done. But I've been around the block with non-AI tools enough to know that friction is natural, and I can't come to a firm, defensible conclusion without exhausting my efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, expertise formed. I quickly discovered for myself from first principles what others were already saying, but discovering it myself resulted in a stronger fundamental understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Break down sessions into separate clear, actionable tasks. Don't try to "draw the owl" in one mega session.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For vague requests, split the work into separate planning vs. execution sessions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you give an agent a way to verify its work, it more often than not fixes its own mistakes and prevents regressions.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More generally, I also found the edges of what agents -- at the time -- were good at, what they weren't good at, and for the tasks they were good at how to achieve the results I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this led to significant efficiency gains, to the point where I was starting to naturally use agents in a way that I felt was no slower than doing it myself (but I still didn't feel it was any faster, since I was mostly babysitting an agent).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The negative space here is worth reiterating: part of the efficiency gains here were understanding when not to reach for an agent. Using an agent for something it'll likely fail at is obviously a big waste of time and having the knowledge to avoid that completely leads to time savings2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this stage, I was finding adequate value with agents that I was happy to use them in my workflow, but still didn't feel like I was seeing any net efficiency gains. I didn't care though, I was content at this point with AI as a tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Step 3: End-of-Day Agents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To try to find some efficiency, I next started up a new pattern: block out the last 30 minutes of every day to kick off one or more agents. My hypothesis was that perhaps I could gain some efficiency if the agent can make some positive progress in the times I can't work anyways. Basically: instead of trying to do more in the time I have, try to do more in the time I don't have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to the previous task, I at first found this both unsuccessful and annoying. But, I once again quickly found different categories of work that were really helpful:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Deep research sessions where I'd ask agents to survey some field, such as finding all libraries in a specific language with a specific license type and producing multi-page summaries for each on their pros, cons, development activity, social sentiment, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parallel agents attempting different vague ideas I had but didn't have time to get started on. I didn't expect them to produce something I'd ever ship here, but perhaps could illuminate some unknown unknowns when I got to the task the next day.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Issue and PR triage/review. Agents are good at using &lt;code&gt;gh&lt;/code&gt;(GitHub CLI), so I manually scripted a quick way to spin up a bunch in parallel to triage issues. I would NOT allow agents to respond, I just wanted reports the next day to try to guide me towards high value or low effort tasks.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, I did not go as far as others went to have agents running in loops all night. In most cases, agents completed their tasks in less than half an hour. But, the latter part of the working day, I'm usually tired and coming out of flow and find myself too personally inefficient, so shifting my effort to spinning up these agents I found gave me a "warm start" the next morning that got me working more quickly than I would've otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was happy, and I was starting to feel like I was doing more than I was doing prior to AI, if only slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Step 4: Outsource the Slam Dunks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By this point, I was getting very confident about what tasks my AI was and wasn't great at. I had really high confidence with certain tasks that the AI would achieve a mostly-correct solution. So the next step on my journey was: let agents do all of that work while I worked on other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More specifically, I would start each day by taking the results of my prior night's triage agents, filter them manually to find the issues that an agent will almost certainly solve well, and then keep them going in the background (one at a time, not in parallel).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I'd work on something else. I wasn't going to social media (any more than usual without AI), I wasn't watching videos, etc. I was in my own, normal, pre-AI deep thinking mode working on something I wanted to work on or had to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very important at this stage: turn off agent desktop notifications. Context switching is very expensive. In order to remain efficient, I found that it was my job as a human to be in control of when I interrupt the agent, not the other way around. Don't let the agent notify you. During natural breaks in your work, tab over and check on it, then carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Importantly, I think the "work on something else" helps counteract the highly publicized Anthropic skill formation paper. Well, you're trading off: not forming skills for the tasks you're delegating to the agent while continuing to form skills naturally in the tasks you continue to work on manually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point I was firmly in the "no way I can go back" territory. I felt more efficient, but even if I wasn't, the thing I liked the most was that I could now focus my coding and thinking on tasks I really loved while still adequately completing the tasks I didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Step 5: Engineer the Harness&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At risk of stating the obvious: agents are much more efficient when they produce the right result the first time, or at worst produce a result that requires minimal touch-ups. The most sure-fire way to achieve this is to give the agent fast, high quality tools to automatically tell it when it is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't know if there is a broad industry-accepted term for this yet, but I've grown to calling this "harness engineering." It is the idea that anytime you find an agent makes a mistake, you take the time to engineer a solution such that the agent never makes that mistake again. I don't need to invent any new terms here; if another one exists, I'll jump on the bandwagon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This comes in two forms:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better implicit prompting (AGENTS.md). For simple things, like the agent repeatedly running the wrong commands or finding the wrong APIs, update the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;AGENTS.md&lt;/code&gt;(or equivalent). Here is an example from Ghostty. Each line in that file is based on a bad agent behavior, and it almost completely resolved them all.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Actual, programmed tools. For example, scripts to take screenshots, run filtered tests, etc etc. This is usually paired with an AGENTS.md change to let it know about this existing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where I'm at today. I'm making an earnest effort whenever I see an agent do a Bad Thing to prevent it from ever doing that bad thing again. Or, conversely, I'm making an earnest effort for agents to be able to verify they're doing a Good Thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Step 6: Always Have an Agent Running&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simultaneous to step 5, I'm also operating under the goal of having an agent running at all times. If an agent isn't running, I ask myself "is there something an agent could be doing for me right now?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I particularly like to combine this with slower, more thoughtful models like Amp's deep mode (which is basically just GPT-5.2-Codex) which can take upwards of 30+ minutes to make small changes. The flip side of that is that it does tend to produce very good results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not [yet?] running multiple agents, and currently don't really want to. I find having the one agent running is a good balance for me right now between being able to do deep, manual work I find enjoyable, and babysitting my kind of stupid and yet mysteriously productive robot friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The "have an agent running at all times" goal is still just a goal. I'd say right now I'm maybe effective at having a background agent running 10 to 20% of a normal working day. But, I'm actively working to improve that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't want to run agents for the sake of running agents. I only want to run them when there is a task I think would be truly helpful to me. Part of the challenge of this goal is improving my own workflows and tools so that I can have a constant stream of high quality work to do that I can delegate. Which, even without AI, is important!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Today&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that's where I'm at today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through this journey, I've personally reached a point where I'm having success with modern AI tooling and I believe I'm approaching it with the proper measured view that is grounded in reality. I really don't care one way or the other if AI is here to stay3, I'm a software craftsman that just wants to build stuff for the love of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole landscape is moving so rapidly that I'm sure I'll look back at this post very quickly and laugh at my naivete. But, as they say, if you can't be embarassed about your past self, you're probably not growing. I just hope I'll grow in the right direction!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have no skin in the game here4, and there are of course other reasons behind utility to avoid using AI. I fully respect anyone's individual decisions regarding it. I'm not here to convince you! For those interested, I just wanted to share my personal approach to navigating these new tools and give a glimpse about how I approach new tools in general, regardless of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Written by Nicholas Carlini, a researcher on our Safeguards team. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been experimenting with a new approach to supervising language models that we’re calling "agent teams."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With agent teams, multiple Claude instances work in parallel on a shared codebase without active human intervention. This approach dramatically expands the scope of what's achievable with LLM agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To stress test it, I tasked 16 agents with writing a Rust-based C compiler, from scratch, capable of compiling the Linux kernel. Over nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions and $20,000 in API costs, the agent team produced a 100,000-line compiler that can build Linux 6.9 on x86, ARM, and RISC-V.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler is an interesting artifact on its own, but I focus here on what I learned about designing harnesses for long-running autonomous agent teams: how to write tests that keep agents on track without human oversight, how to structure work so multiple agents can make progress in parallel, and where this approach hits its ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Enabling long-running Claudes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Existing agent scaffolds like Claude Code require an operator to be online and available to work jointly. If you ask for a solution to a long and complex problem, the model may solve part of it, but eventually it will stop and wait for continued input—a question, a status update, or a request for clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To elicit sustained, autonomous progress, I built a harness that sticks Claude in a simple loop (if you’ve seen Ralph-loop, this should look familiar). When it finishes one task, it immediately picks up the next. (Run this in a container, not your actual machine).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/bash

while true; do
    COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short=6 HEAD)
    LOGFILE="agent_logs/agent_${COMMIT}.log"

    claude --dangerously-skip-permissions \
           -p "$(cat AGENT_PROMPT.md)" \
           --model claude-opus-X-Y &amp;amp;&amp;gt; "$LOGFILE"
done
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;In the agent prompt, I tell Claude what problem to solve and ask it to approach the problem by breaking it into small pieces, tracking what it’s working on, figuring out what to work on next, and to effectively keep going until it’s perfect. (On this last point, Claude has no choice. The loop runs forever—although in one instance, I did see Claude &lt;code&gt;pkill -9 bash&lt;/code&gt; on accident, thus killing itself and ending the loop. Whoops!).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Running Claude in parallel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running multiple instances in parallel can address two weaknesses of a single-agent harness:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One Claude Code session can only do one thing at a time. Especially as the scope of a project expands, debugging multiple issues in parallel is far more efficient.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Running multiple Claude agents allows for specialization. While a few agents are tasked to solve the actual problem at hand, other specialized agents can be invoked to (for example) maintain documentation, keep an eye on code quality, or solve specialized sub-tasks.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My implementation of parallel Claude is bare-bones. A new bare git repo is created, and for each agent, a Docker container is spun up with the repo mounted to &lt;code&gt;/upstream&lt;/code&gt;. Each agent clones a local copy to &lt;code&gt;/workspace&lt;/code&gt;, and when it's done, pushes from its own local container to upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To prevent two agents from trying to solve the same problem at the same time, the harness uses a simple synchronization algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude takes a "lock" on a task by writing a text file to current_tasks/ (e.g., one agent might lock current_tasks/parse_if_statement.txt, while another locks current_tasks/codegen_function_definition.txt). If two agents try to claim the same task, git's synchronization forces the second agent to pick a different one.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Claude works on the task, then pulls from upstream, merges changes from other agents, pushes its changes, and removes the lock. Merge conflicts are frequent, but Claude is smart enough to figure that out.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The infinite agent-generation-loop spawns a new Claude Code session in a fresh container, and the cycle repeats.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a very early research prototype. I haven’t yet implemented any other method for communication between agents, nor do I enforce any process for managing high-level goals. I don’t use an orchestration agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, I leave it up to each Claude agent to decide how to act. In most cases, Claude picks up the “next most obvious” problem. When stuck on a bug, Claude will often maintain a running doc of failed approaches and remaining tasks. In the git repository of the project, you can read through the history and watch it take out locks on various tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lessons from programming with Claude agent teams&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scaffolding runs Claude in a loop, but that loop is only useful if Claude can tell how to make progress. Most of my effort went into designing the environment around Claude—the tests, the environment, the feedback—so that it could orient itself without me. These are the approaches I’ve found most helpful when orchestrating multiple Claude instances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Write extremely high-quality tests&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude will work autonomously to solve whatever problem I give it. So it’s important that the task verifier is nearly perfect, otherwise Claude will solve the wrong problem. Improving the testing harness required finding high-quality compiler test suites, writing verifiers and build scripts for open-source software packages, and watching for mistakes Claude was making, then designing new tests as I identified those failure modes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, near the end of the project, Claude started to frequently break existing functionality each time it implemented a new feature. To address this, I built a continuous integration pipeline and implemented stricter enforcement that allowed Claude to better test its work so that new commits can’t break existing code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Put yourself in Claude’s shoes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had to constantly remind myself that I was writing this test harness for Claude and not for myself, which meant rethinking many of my assumptions about how tests should communicate results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, each agent is dropped into a fresh container with no context and will spend significant time orienting itself, especially on large projects. Before we even reach the tests, to help Claude help itself, I included instructions to maintain extensive READMEs and progress files that should be updated frequently with the current status.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also kept in mind the fact that language models have inherent limitations, which, in this case, needed to be designed around. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Context window pollution: The test harness should not print thousands of useless bytes. At most, it should print a few lines of output and log all important information to a file so Claude can find it when needed. Logfiles should be easy to process automatically: if there are errors, Claude should write ERROR and put the reason on the same line so grep will find it. It helps to pre-compute aggregate summary statistics so Claude doesn't have to recompute them.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Time blindness: Claude can't tell time and, left alone, will happily spend hours running tests instead of making progress. The harness prints incremental progress infrequently (to avoid polluting context) and includes a default &lt;code&gt;--fast&lt;/code&gt;option that runs a 1% or 10% random sample. This subsample is deterministic per-agent but random across VMs, so Claude still covers all files but each agent can perfectly identify regressions.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Make parallelism easy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When there are many distinct failing tests, parallelization is trivial: each agent picks a different failing test to work on. After the test suite reached a 99% pass rate, each agent worked on getting a different small open-source project (e.g., SQlite, Redis, libjpeg, MQuickJS, Lua) to compile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when agents started to compile the Linux kernel, they got stuck. Unlike a test suite with hundreds of independent tests, compiling the Linux kernel is one giant task. Every agent would hit the same bug, fix that bug, and then overwrite each other's changes. Having 16 agents running didn't help because each was stuck solving the same task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fix was to use GCC as an online known-good compiler oracle to compare against. I wrote a new test harness that randomly compiled most of the kernel using GCC, and only the remaining files with Claude's C Compiler. If the kernel worked, then the problem wasn’t in Claude’s subset of the files. If it broke, then it could further refine by re-compiling some of these files with GCC. This let each agent work in parallel, fixing different bugs in different files, until Claude's compiler could eventually compile all files. (After this worked, it was still necessary to apply delta debugging techniques to find pairs of files that failed together but worked independently.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Multiple agent roles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parallelism also enables specialization. LLM-written code frequently re-implements existing functionality, so I tasked one agent with coalescing any duplicate code it found. I put another in charge of improving the performance of the compiler itself, and a third I made responsible for outputting efficient compiled code. I asked another agent to critique the design of the project from the perspective of a Rust developer, and make structural changes to the project to improve the overall code quality, and another to work on documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Stress testing the limits of agent teams&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project was designed as a capability benchmark. I am interested in stress-testing the limits of what LLMs can just barely achieve today in order to help us prepare for what models will reliably achieve in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been using the C Compiler project as a benchmark across the entire Claude 4 model series. As I did with prior projects, I started by drafting what I wanted: a from-scratch optimizing compiler with no dependencies, GCC-compatible, able to compile the Linux kernel, and designed to support multiple backends. While I specified some aspects of the design (e.g., that it should have an SSA IR to enable multiple optimization passes) I did not go into any detail on how to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previous Opus 4 models were barely capable of producing a functional compiler. Opus 4.5 was the first to cross a threshold that allowed it to produce a functional compiler which could pass large test suites, but it was still incapable of compiling any real large projects. My goal with Opus 4.6 was to again test the limits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Evaluation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions across two weeks, Opus 4.6 consumed 2 billion input tokens and generated 140 million output tokens, a total cost just under $20,000. Compared to even the most expensive Claude Max plans, this was an extremely expensive project. But that total is a fraction of what it would cost me to produce this myself—let alone an entire team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was a clean-room implementation (Claude did not have internet access at any point during its development); it depends only on the Rust standard library. The 100,000-line compiler can build a bootable Linux 6.9 on x86, ARM, and RISC-V. It can also compile QEMU, FFmpeg, SQlite, postgres, redis, and has a 99% pass rate on most compiler test suites including the GCC torture test suite. It also passes the developer's ultimate litmus test: it can compile and run Doom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compiler, however, is not without limitations. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It lacks the 16-bit x86 compiler that is necessary to boot Linux out of real mode. For this, it calls out to GCC (the x86_32 and x86_64 compilers are its own).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It does not have its own assembler and linker; these are the very last bits that Claude started automating and are still somewhat buggy. The demo video was produced with a GCC assembler and linker.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The compiler successfully builds many projects, but not all. It's not yet a drop-in replacement for a real compiler.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The generated code is not very efficient. Even with all optimizations enabled, it outputs less efficient code than GCC with all optimizations disabled.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Rust code quality is reasonable, but is nowhere near the quality of what an expert Rust programmer might produce.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The resulting compiler has nearly reached the limits of Opus’s abilities. I tried (hard!) to fix several of the above limitations but wasn’t fully successful. New features and bugfixes frequently broke existing functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As one particularly challenging example, Opus was unable to implement a 16-bit x86 code generator needed to boot into 16-bit real mode. While the compiler can output correct 16-bit x86 via the 66/67 opcode prefixes, the resulting compiled output is over 60kb, far exceeding the 32k code limit enforced by Linux. Instead, Claude simply cheats here and calls out to GCC for this phase (This is only the case for x86. For ARM or RISC-V, Claude’s compiler can compile completely by itself.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The source code for the compiler is available. Download it, read through the code, and try it on your favorite C projects. I’ve consistently found the best way to understand what language models can do is to push them to their limits, and then study where they start to break down. Over the coming days, I’ll continue having Claude push new changes if you want to follow along with Claude’s continued attempts at addressing these limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Looking forward&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each generation of language models opens up new ways of working with them. Early models were useful for tab-completion in IDEs. Before long, models could complete a function body from its docstring. The launch of Claude Code brought agents into the mainstream and enabled developers to pair-program with Claude. But each of these products operates under the assumption that a user defines a task, an LLM runs for a few seconds or minutes and returns an answer, and then the user provides a follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agent teams show the possibility of implementing entire, complex projects autonomously. This allows us, as users of these tools, to become more ambitious with our goals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are still early, and fully autonomous development comes with real risks. When a human sits with Claude during development, they can ensure consistent quality and catch errors in real time. For autonomous systems, it is easy to see tests pass and assume the job is done, when this is rarely the case. I used to work in penetration testing, exploiting vulnerabilities in products produced by large companies, and the thought of programmers deploying software they’ve never personally verified is a real concern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, while this experiment excites me, it also leaves me feeling uneasy. Building this compiler has been some of the most fun I’ve had recently, but I did not expect this to be anywhere near possible so early in 2026. The rapid progress in both language models and the scaffolds we use to interact with them opens the door to writing an enormous amount of new code. I expect the positive applications to outweigh the negative, but we’re entering a new world which will require new strategies to navigate safely.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The time I didn’t meet Jeffrey Epstein&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last night, I was taken aback to discover that my name appears in the Epstein Files, in 26 different documents. This is despite the fact that I met Jeffrey Epstein a grand total of zero times, and had zero email or any other contact with him … which is more (less) than some of my colleagues can say.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bulk of the correspondence involves Epstein wanting to arrange a meeting with me and Seth Lloyd back in 2010, via an intermediary named Charles Harper, about funding a research project on “Cryptography in Nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Searching my inbox, it turns out that this Charles Harper did contact me in May 2010, and I then met him at S&amp;amp;S Deli in Cambridge (plausible, although I have zero recollections of this meeting—only of the deli). Harper then sent me a detailed followup email about his proposed Cryptography in Nature project, naming Jeffrey Epstein for the first time as the project’s funder, and adding: “perhaps you will know Jeffrey and his background and situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, I forwarded this email to my parents, brother, and then-fiancee Dana. My brother then found and shared a news article about Epstein’s prostitution conviction, adding to a different article that I had found and shared. (At that time, like many others, I’d probably vaguely heard of Epstein, but he didn’t have 0.1% the infamy that he has now.) Then my mom wrote the following: “be careful not to get sucked up in the slime-machine going on here! Since you don’t care that much about money, they can’t buy you at least.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It appears from emails that Charles Harper tried again later that summer to arrange a meeting between me and Epstein, but that I took my mom’s advice and largely blew him off, and no such meeting ever happened. Amazingly, I then forgot entirely that any of this had occurred until last night. By way of explanation, some business/finance dude trying to interest me in half-baked ideas involving quantum, AI, cryptography, etc., often dangling the prospect of funding for my students and postdocs, shows up in my life like every month. Most of their world-changing initiatives go nowhere for one reason or another. There really wasn’t much reason to think further about this, until Epstein had become history’s most notorious sex criminal, which (again) wouldn’t happen until years later, after I’d forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It gets better, though. In the Epstein Files, one also finds a November 2010 letter from Charles Harper to Epstein about organizing a conference on the same Cryptography in Nature topic, which includes the following idea about me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Scott Aaronson was born on May 21st, 1981. He will be 30 in 2011. The conference could follow a theme of: “hurry to think together with Scott Aaronson while he is still in his 20s and not yet a pitiful over-the-hill geezer in his 30s.” This offers another nice opportunity for celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see no indication that any such conference ever happened; in any case, I didn’t get invited to one!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On my Facebook, some friends are joking that “it tracks that someone into teenage girls might think Scott Aaronson was a hot property in his nubile 20s, who would get old and boring in his 30s”—and that maybe Epstein was less sexist about such matters than everyone assumes. I replied that I wished I could say the proposition that I’d gradually get slower and more senile through the 2010s and 2020s was entirely false.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the best comment was that I’ve been incredibly lucky to have such an astute family. If only Bill Gates and Larry Summers had had my mom to go to for advice, they could’ve saved themselves a lot of grief.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;REVIEW OF 1984&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; By Isaac Asimov&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been writing a four-part article for Field Newspaper Syndicate at the&lt;lb/&gt; beginning of each year for several years now and in 1980, mindful of the&lt;lb/&gt; approach of the year 1984, FNS asked me to write a thorough critique of&lt;lb/&gt; George Orwell's novel 1984.&lt;lb/&gt; I was reluctant. I remembered almost nothing of the book and said so -&lt;lb/&gt; but Denison Demac, the lovely young woman who is my contact at FNS, simply&lt;lb/&gt; sent me a copy of it and said, 'Read it.'&lt;lb/&gt; So I read it and found myself absolutely astonished at what I read. I&lt;lb/&gt; wondered how many people who talked about the novel so glibly had ever read&lt;lb/&gt; it; or if they had, whether they remembered it at all.&lt;lb/&gt; I felt I would have to write the critique if only to set people straight.&lt;lb/&gt; (I'm sorry; I love setting people straight.)&lt;lb/&gt; A. THE WRITING OF 1984&lt;lb/&gt; In 1949, a book entitled 1984 was published. It was written by Eric Arthur&lt;lb/&gt; Blair under the pseudonym of George Orwell.&lt;lb/&gt; The book attempted to show what life would be like in a world of total&lt;lb/&gt; evil, in which those controlling the government kept themselves in power by&lt;lb/&gt; brute force, by distorting the truth, by continually rewriting history, by&lt;lb/&gt; mesmerising the people generally.&lt;lb/&gt; This evil world was placed only thirty-five years in the future so that&lt;lb/&gt; even men who were already in their early middle age at the time the book was&lt;lb/&gt; published might live to see it if they lived out a normal lifetime.&lt;lb/&gt; I, for instance, was already a married man when the book appeared and yet&lt;lb/&gt; here we are less than four years away from that apocalyptic year (for '1984'&lt;lb/&gt; has become a year that is associated with dread because of Orwell's book),&lt;lb/&gt; and I am very likely to live to see it.&lt;lb/&gt; In this chapter, I will discuss the book, but first: Who was Blair/Orwell&lt;lb/&gt; and why was the book written?&lt;lb/&gt; Blair was born in 1903 into the status of a British gentleman. His father&lt;lb/&gt; was in the Indian civil service and Blair himself lived the life of a&lt;lb/&gt; British Imperial official. He went to Eton, served in Burma, and so on.&lt;lb/&gt; However, he lacked the money to be an English gentleman to the full.&lt;lb/&gt; Then, too, he didn't want to spend his time at dull desk jobs; he wanted to&lt;lb/&gt; be a writer. Thirdly, he felt guilty about his status in the upper class.&lt;lb/&gt; So he did in the late 1920s what so many well-to-do American young people&lt;lb/&gt; in the 1960s did. In short, he became what we would have called a 'hippie'&lt;lb/&gt; at a later time. He lived under slum conditions in London and Paris,&lt;lb/&gt; consorted with and identified with slum dwellers and vagrants, managed to&lt;lb/&gt; ease his conscience and, at the same time, to gather material for his&lt;lb/&gt; earliest books.&lt;lb/&gt; He also turned left wing and became a socialist, fighting with the&lt;lb/&gt; loyalists in Spain in the 1930s. There he found himself caught up in the&lt;lb/&gt; sectarian struggles between the various left-wing factions, and since he&lt;lb/&gt; believed in a gentlemanly English form of socialism, he was inevitably on&lt;lb/&gt; the losing side. Opposed to him were passionate Spanish anarchists,&lt;lb/&gt; syndicalists, and communists, who bitterly resented the fact that the&lt;lb/&gt; necessities of fighting the Franco fascists got in the way of their fighting&lt;lb/&gt; each other.&lt;lb/&gt; The communists, who were the best organised, won out and Orwell had to leave&lt;lb/&gt; Spain, for he was convinced that if he did not, he would be killed&lt;lb/&gt; From then on, to the end of his life, he carried on a private literary&lt;lb/&gt; war with the communists, determined to win in words the battle he had lost&lt;lb/&gt; in action.&lt;lb/&gt; During World War II, in which he was rejected for military service, he&lt;lb/&gt; was associated with the left wing of the British Labour party, but didn't&lt;lb/&gt; much sympathise with their views, for even their reckless version of&lt;lb/&gt; socialism seemed too well organised for him.&lt;lb/&gt; He wasn't much affected, apparently, by the Nazi brand of&lt;lb/&gt; totalitarianism, for there was no room within him except for his private war&lt;lb/&gt; with Stalinist communism. Consequently, when Great Britain was fighting for&lt;lb/&gt; its life against Nazism, and the Soviet Union fought as an ally in the&lt;lb/&gt; struggle and contributed rather more than its share in lives lost and in&lt;lb/&gt; resolute courage, Orwell wrote Animal Farm which was a satire of the Russian&lt;lb/&gt; Revolution and what followed, picturing it in terms of a revolt of barnyard&lt;lb/&gt; animals against human masters.&lt;lb/&gt; He completed Animal Farm in 1944 and had trouble finding a publisher&lt;lb/&gt; since it wasn't a particularly good time for upsetting the Soviets. As soon&lt;lb/&gt; as the war came to an end, however, the Soviet Union was fair game and&lt;lb/&gt; Animal Farm was published. It was greeted with much acclaim and Orwell&lt;lb/&gt; became sufficiently prosperous to retire and devote himself to his&lt;lb/&gt; masterpiece, 1984.&lt;lb/&gt; That book described society as a vast world-wide extension of Stalinist&lt;lb/&gt; Russia in the 1930s, pictured with the venom of a rival left-wing sectarian.&lt;lb/&gt; Other forms of totalitarianism play a small role. There are one or two&lt;lb/&gt; mentions of the Nazis and of the Inquisition. At the very start, there is a&lt;lb/&gt; reference or two to Jews, almost as though they were going to prove the&lt;lb/&gt; objects of persecution, but that vanishes almost at once, as though Orwell&lt;lb/&gt; didn't want readers to mistake the villains for Nazis.&lt;lb/&gt; The picture is of Stalinism, and Stalinism only.&lt;lb/&gt; By the time the book came out in 1949, the Cold War was at its height.&lt;lb/&gt; The book therefore proved popular. It was almost a matter of patriotism in&lt;lb/&gt; the West to buy it and talk about it, and perhaps even to read parts of it,&lt;lb/&gt; although it is my opinion that more people bought it and talked about it&lt;lb/&gt; than read it, for it is a dreadfully dull book - didactic, repetitious, and&lt;lb/&gt; all but motionless.&lt;lb/&gt; It was most popular at first with people who leaned towards the&lt;lb/&gt; conservative side of the political spectrum, for it was clearly an&lt;lb/&gt; anti-Soviet polemic, and the picture of life it projected in the London of&lt;lb/&gt; 1984 was very much as conservatives imagined life in the Moscow of 1949 to&lt;lb/&gt; be.&lt;lb/&gt; During the McCarthy era in the United States, 1984 became increasingly&lt;lb/&gt; popular with those who leaned towards the liberal side of the political&lt;lb/&gt; spectrum, for it seemed to them that the United States of the early 1950s&lt;lb/&gt; was beginning to move in the direction of thought-control and that all the&lt;lb/&gt; viciousness Orwell had depicted was on its way towards us.&lt;lb/&gt; Thus, in an afterword to an edition published in paperback by New&lt;lb/&gt; American Library in 1961, the liberal psychoanalyst and philosopher Erich&lt;lb/&gt; Fromm concluded as follows:&lt;lb/&gt; 'Books like Orwell's are powerful warnings, and it would be most&lt;lb/&gt; unfortunate if the reader smugly interpreted 1984 as another description of&lt;lb/&gt; Stalinist barbarism, and if he does not see that it means us, too.'&lt;lb/&gt; Even if Stalinism and McCarthyism are disregarded, however, more and more&lt;lb/&gt; Americans were becoming aware of just how 'big' the government was getting;&lt;lb/&gt; how high taxes were; how increasingly rules and regulations permeated&lt;lb/&gt; business and even ordinary life; how information concerning every facet of&lt;lb/&gt; private life was entering the files not only of government bureaux but of&lt;lb/&gt; private credit systems.&lt;lb/&gt; 1984, therefore, came to stand not for Stalinism, or even for&lt;lb/&gt; dictatorship in general - but merely for government. Even governmental&lt;lb/&gt; paternalism seemed '1984ish' and the catch phrase 'Big Brother is watching&lt;lb/&gt; you' came to mean everything that was too big for the individual to control.&lt;lb/&gt; It was not only big government and big business that was a symptom of 1984&lt;lb/&gt; but big science, big labour, big anything.&lt;lb/&gt; In fact, so thoroughly has 1984-ophobia penetrated the consciousness of&lt;lb/&gt; many who have not read the book and have no notion of what it contains, that&lt;lb/&gt; one wonders what will happen to us after 31 December 1984. When New Year's&lt;lb/&gt; Day of 1985 arrives and the United States is still in existence and facing&lt;lb/&gt; very much the problems it faces today, how will we express our fears of&lt;lb/&gt; whatever aspect of life fills us with apprehension? What new date can we&lt;lb/&gt; invent to take the place of 1984?&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell did not live to see his book become the success it did. He did not&lt;lb/&gt; witness the way in which he made 1984 into a year that would haunt a whole&lt;lb/&gt; generation of Americans. Orwell died of tuberculosis in a London hospital in&lt;lb/&gt; January 1950, just a few months after the book was published, at the age of&lt;lb/&gt; forty-six. His awareness of imminent death may have added to the bitterness&lt;lb/&gt; of the book.&lt;lb/&gt; B. THE SCIENCE FICTION OF 1984&lt;lb/&gt; Many people think of 1984 as a science fiction novel, but almost the only&lt;lb/&gt; item about 1984 that would lead one to suppose this is the fact that it is&lt;lb/&gt; purportedly laid in the future. Not so! Orwell had no feel for the future,&lt;lb/&gt; and the displacement of the story is much more geographical than temporal.&lt;lb/&gt; The London in which the story is placed is not so much moved thirty-five&lt;lb/&gt; years forward in time, from 1949 to 1984, as it is moved a thousand miles&lt;lb/&gt; east in space to Moscow.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell imagines Great Britain to have gone through a revolution similar&lt;lb/&gt; to the Russian Revolution and to have gone through all the stages that&lt;lb/&gt; Soviet development did. He can think of almost no variations on the theme.&lt;lb/&gt; The Soviets had a series of purges in the 1930s, so the Ingsoc (English&lt;lb/&gt; Socialism) had a series of purges in the 1950s.&lt;lb/&gt; The Soviets converted one of their revolutionaries, Leon Trotsky, into a&lt;lb/&gt; villain, leaving his opponent, Joseph Stalin, as a hero. The Ingsoc,&lt;lb/&gt; therefore, convert one of their revolutionaries, Emmanuel Goldstein, into a&lt;lb/&gt; villain, leaving his opponent, with a moustache like Stalin, as a hero.&lt;lb/&gt; There is no ability to make minor changes, even. Goldstein, like Trotsky,&lt;lb/&gt; has 'a lean Jewish face, with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a&lt;lb/&gt; small goatee beard'. Orwell apparently does not want to confuse the issue by&lt;lb/&gt; giving Stalin a different name so he calls him merely 'Big Brother'.&lt;lb/&gt; At the very beginning of the story, it is made clear that television&lt;lb/&gt; (which was coming into existence at the time the book was written) served as&lt;lb/&gt; a continuous means of indoctrination of the people, for sets cannot be&lt;lb/&gt; turned off. (And, apparently, in a deteriorating London in which nothing&lt;lb/&gt; works, these sets never fail.)&lt;lb/&gt; The great Orwellian contribution to future technology is that the&lt;lb/&gt; television set is two-way, and that the people who are forced to hear and&lt;lb/&gt; see the television screen can themselves be heard and seen at all times and&lt;lb/&gt; are under constant supervision even while sleeping or in the bathroom.&lt;lb/&gt; Hence, the meaning of the phrase 'Big Brother is watching you'.&lt;lb/&gt; This is an extraordinarily inefficient system of keeping everyone under&lt;lb/&gt; control. To have a person being watched at all times means that some other&lt;lb/&gt; person must be doing the watching at all times (at least in the Orwellian&lt;lb/&gt; society) and must be doing so very narrowly, for there is a great&lt;lb/&gt; development of the art of interpreting gesture and facial expression.&lt;lb/&gt; One person cannot watch more than one person in full concentration, and&lt;lb/&gt; can only do so for a comparatively short time before attention begins to&lt;lb/&gt; wander. I should guess, in short, that there may have to be five watchers&lt;lb/&gt; for every person watched. And then, of course, the watchers must themselves&lt;lb/&gt; be watched since no one in the Orwellian world is suspicion-free.&lt;lb/&gt; Consequently, the system of oppression by two-way television simply will not&lt;lb/&gt; work.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell himself realised this by limiting its workings to the Party&lt;lb/&gt; members. The 'proles' (proletariat), for whom Orwell cannot hide his British&lt;lb/&gt; upper-class contempt, are left largely to themselves as subhuman. (At one&lt;lb/&gt; point in the book, he says that any prole that shows ability is killed - a&lt;lb/&gt; leaf taken out of the Spartan treatment of their helots&lt;lb/&gt; twenty-five hundred years ago.)&lt;lb/&gt; Furthermore, he has a system of volunteer spies in which children report&lt;lb/&gt; on their parents, and neighbours on each other. This cannot possibly work&lt;lb/&gt; well since eventually everyone reports everyone else and it all has to be&lt;lb/&gt; abandoned.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell was unable to conceive of computers or robots, or he would have&lt;lb/&gt; placed everyone under non-human surveillance. Our own computers to some&lt;lb/&gt; extent do this in the IRS, in credit files, and so on, but that does not&lt;lb/&gt; take us towards 1984, except in fevered imaginations. Computers and tyranny&lt;lb/&gt; do not necessarily go hand in hand. Tyrannies have worked very well without&lt;lb/&gt; computers (consider the Nazis) and the most computerised nations in today's&lt;lb/&gt; world are also the least tyrannical.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell lacks the capacity to see (or invent) small changes. His hero&lt;lb/&gt; finds it difficult in his world of 1984 to get shoelaces or razor blades. So&lt;lb/&gt; would I in the real world of the 1980s, for so many people use slip-on shoes&lt;lb/&gt; and electric razors.&lt;lb/&gt; Then, too, Orwell had the technophobic fixation that every technological&lt;lb/&gt; advance is a slide downhill. Thus, when his hero writes, he 'fitted a nib&lt;lb/&gt; into the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. He does so 'because&lt;lb/&gt; of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with&lt;lb/&gt; a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink-pencil'.&lt;lb/&gt; Presumably, the 'ink-pencil' is the ball-point pen that was coming into&lt;lb/&gt; use at the time that 1984 was being written. This means that Orwell&lt;lb/&gt; describes something as being written' with a real nib but being 'scratched'&lt;lb/&gt; with a ball-point. This is, however, precisely the reverse of the truth. If&lt;lb/&gt; you are old enough to remember steel pens, you will remember that they&lt;lb/&gt; scratched fearsomely, and you know ball-points don't.&lt;lb/&gt; This is not science fiction, but a distorted nostalgia for a past that&lt;lb/&gt; never was. I am surprised that Orwell stopped with the steel pen and that he&lt;lb/&gt; didn't have Winston writing with a neat goose quill.&lt;lb/&gt; Nor was Orwell particularly prescient in the strictly social aspects of&lt;lb/&gt; the future he was presenting, with the result that the Orwellian world of&lt;lb/&gt; 1984 is incredibly old-fashioned when compared with the real world of the&lt;lb/&gt; 1980s.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell imagines no new vices, for instance. His characters are all gin&lt;lb/&gt; hounds and tobacco addicts, and part of the horror of his picture of 1984 is&lt;lb/&gt; his eloquent description of the low quality of the gin and tobacco.&lt;lb/&gt; He foresees no new drugs, no marijuana, no synthetic hallucinogens. No&lt;lb/&gt; one expects an s.f. writer to be precise and exact in his forecasts, but&lt;lb/&gt; surely one would expect him to invent some differences.&lt;lb/&gt; In his despair (or anger), Orwell forgets the virtues human beings have.&lt;lb/&gt; All his characters are, in one way or another, weak or sadistic, or sleazy,&lt;lb/&gt; or stupid, or repellent. This may be how most people are, or how Orwell&lt;lb/&gt; wants to indicate they will all be under tyranny, but it seems to me that&lt;lb/&gt; under even the worst tyrannies, so far, there have been brave men and women&lt;lb/&gt; who have withstood the tyrants to the death and whose personal histories are&lt;lb/&gt; luminous flames in the surrounding darkness. If only because there is no&lt;lb/&gt; hint of this in 1984, it does not resemble the real world of the 1980s.&lt;lb/&gt; Nor did he foresee any difference in the role of women or any weakening&lt;lb/&gt; of the feminine stereotype of 1949. There are only two female characters of&lt;lb/&gt; importance. One is a strong, brainless 'prole' woman who is an endless&lt;lb/&gt; washerwoman, endlessly singing a popular song with words of the type&lt;lb/&gt; familiar in the 1930s and 1940s (at which Orwell shudders fastidiously as&lt;lb/&gt; 'trashy', in blissful non-anticipation of hard rock).&lt;lb/&gt; The other is the heroine, Julia, who is sexually promiscuous (but is at&lt;lb/&gt; least driven to courage by her interest in sex) and is otherwise brainless.&lt;lb/&gt; When the hero, Winston, reads to her the book within a book that explains&lt;lb/&gt; the nature of the Orwellian world, she responds by falling asleep - but then&lt;lb/&gt; since the treatise Winston reads is stupefyingly soporific, this may be an&lt;lb/&gt; indication of Julia's good sense rather than the reverse.&lt;lb/&gt; In short, if 1984 must be considered science fiction, then it is very bad&lt;lb/&gt; science fiction.&lt;lb/&gt; C. THE GOVERNMENT OF 1984&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell's 1984 is a picture of all-powerful government, and it has helped&lt;lb/&gt; make the notion of 'big government' a very frightening one.&lt;lb/&gt; We have to remember, though, that the world of the late 1940s, during&lt;lb/&gt; which Orwell was writing his book, was one in which there had been, and&lt;lb/&gt; still were, big governments with true tyrants - individuals whose every&lt;lb/&gt; wish, however unjust, cruel or vicious, was law. What's more, it seemed as&lt;lb/&gt; though such tyrants were irremovable except by the chance of outside force.&lt;lb/&gt; Benito Mussolini of Italy, after twenty-one years of absolute rule, was&lt;lb/&gt; overthrown, but that was only because his country was suffering defeat in&lt;lb/&gt; war.&lt;lb/&gt; Adolf Hitler of Germany, a far stronger and more brutal tyrant, ruled&lt;lb/&gt; with a steel hand for twelve years, yet even defeat did not, in itself,&lt;lb/&gt; bring about his overthrow. Though the area over which he ruled shrank and&lt;lb/&gt; shrank and shrank, and even though overwhelming armies of his adversaries&lt;lb/&gt; closed in from the east and west, he remained absolute tyrant over whatever&lt;lb/&gt; area he controlled - even when it was only over the bunker in which he&lt;lb/&gt; committed suicide. Until he removed himself, no one dared remove him. (There&lt;lb/&gt; were plots against him, to be sure, but they never worked, sometimes through&lt;lb/&gt; quirks of fate that seemed explainable only by supposing that someone down&lt;lb/&gt; there liked him.)&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell, however, had no time for either Mussolini or Hitler. His enemy&lt;lb/&gt; was Stalin, and at the time that 1984 was published, Stalin had ruled the&lt;lb/&gt; Soviet Union in a ribbreaking bear hug for twenty-five years, had survived a&lt;lb/&gt; terrible war in which his nation suffered enormous losses and yet was now&lt;lb/&gt; stronger than ever. To Orwell, it must have seemed that neither time nor&lt;lb/&gt; fortune could budge Stalin, but that he would live on forever with ever&lt;lb/&gt; increasing strength. - And that was how Orwell pictured Big Brother.&lt;lb/&gt; Of course, that was not the way it really was. Orwell didn't live long&lt;lb/&gt; enough to see it but Stalin died only three years after 1984 was published,&lt;lb/&gt; and it was not long after that that his regime was denounced as a tyranny&lt;lb/&gt; by - guess who - the Soviet leadership.&lt;lb/&gt; The Soviet Union is still the Soviet Union, but it is not Stalinist, and&lt;lb/&gt; the enemies of the state are no longer liquidated (Orwell uses 'vaporised'&lt;lb/&gt; instead, such small changes being all he can manage) with quite such&lt;lb/&gt; abandon.&lt;lb/&gt; Again, Mao Tse-tung died in China, and while he himself has not been&lt;lb/&gt; openly denounced, his close associates, as 'the Gang of Four', were promptly&lt;lb/&gt; demoted from Divinity, and while China is still China, it is not Maoist any&lt;lb/&gt; longer.&lt;lb/&gt; Franco of Spain died in his bed and while, to his very last breath, he&lt;lb/&gt; remained the unquestioned leader he had been for nearly forty years,&lt;lb/&gt; immediately after that last breath, Fascism abruptly dwindled in Spain, as&lt;lb/&gt; it had in Portugal after Salazar's death.&lt;lb/&gt; In short, Big Brothers do die, or at least they have so far, and when&lt;lb/&gt; they die, the government changes, always for the milder.&lt;lb/&gt; This is not to say that new tyrants may not make themselves felt, but&lt;lb/&gt; they will die, too. At least in the real 1980s we have every confidence they&lt;lb/&gt; will and the undying Big Brother is not yet a real threat.&lt;lb/&gt; If anything, in fact, governments of the 1980s seem dangerously weak. The&lt;lb/&gt; advance of technology has put powerful weapons - explosives, machine guns,&lt;lb/&gt; fast cars into the hands of urban terrorists who can and do kidnap, hijack,&lt;lb/&gt; gun down, and take hostages with impunity while governments stand by more or&lt;lb/&gt; less helplessly.&lt;lb/&gt; In addition to the immortality of Big Brother, Orwell presents two other&lt;lb/&gt; ways of maintaining an eternal tyranny.&lt;lb/&gt; First -,present someone or something to hate. In the Orwellian world it&lt;lb/&gt; was Emmanuel Goldstein for whom hate was built up and orchestrated in a&lt;lb/&gt; robotized mass function.&lt;lb/&gt; This is nothing new, of course. Every nation in the world has used&lt;lb/&gt; various neighbours for the purpose of hate. This sort of thing is so easily&lt;lb/&gt; handled and comes as such second nature to humanity that one wonders why&lt;lb/&gt; there have to be the organised hate drives in the Orwellian world.&lt;lb/&gt; It needs scarcely any clever psychological mass movements to make Arabs&lt;lb/&gt; hate Israelis and Greeks hate Turks and Catholic Irish hate Protestant&lt;lb/&gt; Irish - and vice versa in each case. To be sure, the Nazis organised mass&lt;lb/&gt; meetings of delirium that every participant seemed to enjoy, but it had no&lt;lb/&gt; permanent effect. Once the war moved on to German soil, the Germans&lt;lb/&gt; surrendered as meekly as though they had never Sieg-Heiled in their lives.&lt;lb/&gt; Second - rewrite history. Almost every one of the few individuals we meet&lt;lb/&gt; in 1984 has, as his job, the rapid rewriting of the past, the readjustment&lt;lb/&gt; of statistics, the overhauling of newspapers - as though anyone is going to&lt;lb/&gt; take the trouble to pay attention to the past anyway.&lt;lb/&gt; This Orwellian preoccupation with the minutiae of 'historical proof' is&lt;lb/&gt; typical of the political sectarian who is always quoting what has been said&lt;lb/&gt; and done in the past to prove a point to someone on the other side who is&lt;lb/&gt; always quoting something to the opposite effect that has been said and done.&lt;lb/&gt; As any politician knows, no evidence of any kind is ever required. It is&lt;lb/&gt; only necessary to make a statement - any statement - forcefully enough to&lt;lb/&gt; have an audience believe it. No one will check the lie against the facts,&lt;lb/&gt; and, if they do, they will disbelieve the facts. Do you think the German&lt;lb/&gt; people in 1939 pretended that the Poles had attacked them and started World&lt;lb/&gt; War II? No! Since they were told that was so, they believed it as seriously&lt;lb/&gt; as you and I believe that they attacked the Poles.&lt;lb/&gt; To be sure, the Soviets put out new editions of their Encyclopaedia in&lt;lb/&gt; which politicians rating a long biography in earlier editions are suddenly&lt;lb/&gt; omitted entirely, and this is no doubt the germ of the Orwellian notion, but&lt;lb/&gt; the chances of carrying it as far as is described in 1984 seem to me to be&lt;lb/&gt; nil - not because it is beyond human wickedness, but because it is totally&lt;lb/&gt; unnecessary.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell makes much of 'Newspeak' as an organ of repression - the&lt;lb/&gt; conversion of the English language into so limited and abbreviated an&lt;lb/&gt; instrument that the very vocabulary of dissent vanishes. Partly he got the&lt;lb/&gt; notion from the undoubted habit of abbreviation. He gives examples of&lt;lb/&gt; 'Communist International' becoming 'Comintern' and 'Geheime Staatspolizei'&lt;lb/&gt; becoming 'Gestapo', but that is not a modern totalitarian invention. 'Vulgus&lt;lb/&gt; mobile' became 'mob'; 'taxi cabriolet' became 'cab'; 'quasi-stellar radio&lt;lb/&gt; source' became 'quasar'; 'light amplification by stimulated emission of&lt;lb/&gt; radiation' became 'laser' and so on. There is no sign that such compressions&lt;lb/&gt; of the language have ever weakened it as a mode of expression.&lt;lb/&gt; As a matter of fact, political obfuscation has tended to use many words&lt;lb/&gt; rather than few, long words rather than short, to extend rather than to&lt;lb/&gt; reduce. Every leader of inadequate education or limited intelligence hides&lt;lb/&gt; behind exuberant inebriation of loquacity.&lt;lb/&gt; Thus, when Winston Churchill suggested the development of 'Basic English'&lt;lb/&gt; as an international language (something which undoubtedly also contributed&lt;lb/&gt; to 'Newspeak'), the suggestion was stillborn.&lt;lb/&gt; We are therefore in no way approaching Newspeak in its condensed form,&lt;lb/&gt; though we have always had Newspeak in its extended form and always will&lt;lb/&gt; have.&lt;lb/&gt; We also have a group of young people among us who say things like 'Right&lt;lb/&gt; on, man, you know. It's like he's got it all together, you know, man. I&lt;lb/&gt; mean, like you know -' and so on for five minutes when the word that the&lt;lb/&gt; young people are groping for is 'Huh?'&lt;lb/&gt; That, however, is not Newspeak, and it has always been with us, too. It&lt;lb/&gt; is something which in Oldspeak is called 'inarticulacy' and it is not what&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell had in mind.&lt;lb/&gt; D. THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION OF 1984&lt;lb/&gt; Although Orwell seemed, by and large, to be helplessly stuck in the world of&lt;lb/&gt; 1949, in one respect at least he showed himself to be remarkably prescient,&lt;lb/&gt; and that was in foreseeing the tripartite split of the world of the 1980s.&lt;lb/&gt; The international world of 1984 is a world of three superpowers: Oceania,&lt;lb/&gt; Eurasia, and Eastasia - and that fits in, very roughly, with the three&lt;lb/&gt; actual superpowers of the 1980s: the United States, the Soviet Union, and&lt;lb/&gt; China.&lt;lb/&gt; Oceania is a combination of the United States and the British Empire.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell, who was an old Imperial civil servant, did not seem to notice that&lt;lb/&gt; the British Empire was in its last throes in the late 1940s and was about to&lt;lb/&gt; dissolve. He seems to suppose, in fact, that the British Empire is the&lt;lb/&gt; dominant member of the British-American combination.&lt;lb/&gt; At least, the entire action takes place in London and phrases such as&lt;lb/&gt; 'the United States' and 'Americans' are rarely, if ever, mentioned. But&lt;lb/&gt; then, this is very much in the fashion of the British spy novel in which,&lt;lb/&gt; ever since World War II, Great Britain (currently about the eighteenth&lt;lb/&gt; strongest military and economic power in the world) is set up as the great&lt;lb/&gt; adversary of the Soviet Union, or of China, or of some invented&lt;lb/&gt; international conspiracy, with the United States either never mentioned or&lt;lb/&gt; reduced to the small courtesy appearance of an occasional CIA agent.&lt;lb/&gt; Eurasia is, of course, the Soviet Union, which Orwell assumes will have&lt;lb/&gt; absorbed the whole European continent. Eurasia, therefore, includes all of&lt;lb/&gt; Europe, plus Siberia, and its population is 95 per cent European by any&lt;lb/&gt; standard. Nevertheless, Orwell describes the Eurasians as 'solid-looking men&lt;lb/&gt; with expressionless Asiatic faces'. Since Orwell still lives in a time when&lt;lb/&gt; 'European' and 'Asiatic' are equivalent to ' 'hero' and 'villain', it is&lt;lb/&gt; impossible to inveigh against the Soviet Union with the proper emotion if it&lt;lb/&gt; is not thought of as 'Asiatic'. This comes under the heading of what&lt;lb/&gt; Orwellian Newspeak calls 'double-think', something that Orwell, like any&lt;lb/&gt; human being, is good at.&lt;lb/&gt; It may be, of course, that Orwell is thinking not of Eurasia, or the&lt;lb/&gt; Soviet Union, but of his great bête noire, Stalin. Stalin is a Georgian, and&lt;lb/&gt; Georgia, lying south of the Caucasus mountains, is, by strict geographic&lt;lb/&gt; considerations, part of Asia.&lt;lb/&gt; Eastasia is, of course, China and various dependent nations.&lt;lb/&gt; Here is prescience. At the time Orwell was writing 1984, the Chinese&lt;lb/&gt; communists had not yet won control of the country and many (in the United&lt;lb/&gt; States, in particular) were doing their best to see that the anti-Communist,&lt;lb/&gt; Chiang Kai-shek, retained control. Once the communists won, it became part&lt;lb/&gt; of the accepted credo of the West that the Chinese would be under thorough&lt;lb/&gt; Soviet control and that China and the Soviet Union would form a monolithic&lt;lb/&gt; communist power.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell not only foresaw the communist victory (he saw that victory&lt;lb/&gt; everywhere, in fact) but also foresaw that Russia and China would not form a&lt;lb/&gt; monolithic bloc but would be deadly enemies.&lt;lb/&gt; There, his own experience as a Leftist sectarian may have helped him. He&lt;lb/&gt; had no Rightist superstitions concerning Leftists as unified and&lt;lb/&gt; indistinguishable villains. He knew they would fight each other as fiercely&lt;lb/&gt; over the most trifling points of doctrine as would the most pious&lt;lb/&gt; of Christians.&lt;lb/&gt; He also foresaw a permanent state of war among the three; a condition of&lt;lb/&gt; permanent stalemate with the alliances ever-shifting, but always two against&lt;lb/&gt; the strongest. This was the old-fashioned 'balance of power' system which&lt;lb/&gt; was used in ancient Greece, in medieval Italy, and in early modern Europe.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell's mistake lay in thinking there had to be actual war to keep the&lt;lb/&gt; merry-go-round of the balance of power in being. In fact, in one of the more&lt;lb/&gt; laughable parts of the book, he goes on and on concerning the necessity of&lt;lb/&gt; permanent war as a means of consuming the world's production of resources&lt;lb/&gt; and thus keeping the social stratification of upper, middle, and lower&lt;lb/&gt; classes in being. (This sounds like a very Leftist explanation of war as the&lt;lb/&gt; result of a conspiracy worked out with great difficulty.)&lt;lb/&gt; In actual fact, the decades since 1945 have been remarkably war-free as&lt;lb/&gt; compared with the decades before it. There have been local wars in&lt;lb/&gt; profusion, but no general war. But then, war is not required as a desperate&lt;lb/&gt; device to consume the world's resources. That can be done by such other&lt;lb/&gt; devices as endless increase in population and in energy use, neither of&lt;lb/&gt; which Orwell considers.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell did not foresee any of the significant economic changes that have&lt;lb/&gt; taken place since World War II. He did not foresee the role of oil or its&lt;lb/&gt; declining availability or its increasing price, or the escalating power of&lt;lb/&gt; those nations who control it. I don't recall his mentioning the word 'oil'.&lt;lb/&gt; But perhaps it is close enough to mark Orwellian prescience here, if we&lt;lb/&gt; substitute 'cold war' for 'war'. There has been, in fact, a more or less&lt;lb/&gt; continual 'cold war' that has served to keep employment high and solve some&lt;lb/&gt; short-term economic problems (at the cost of creating long-term greater&lt;lb/&gt; ones). And this cold war is enough to deplete resources.&lt;lb/&gt; Furthermore, the alliances shifted as Orwell foresaw and very nearly as&lt;lb/&gt; suddenly. When the United States seemed all-powerful, the Soviet Union and&lt;lb/&gt; China were both vociferously anti-American and in a kind of alliance. As&lt;lb/&gt; American power decreased, the Soviet Union and China fell apart and, for a&lt;lb/&gt; while, each of the three powers inveighed against the other two equally.&lt;lb/&gt; Then, when the Soviet Union came to seem particularly powerful, a kind of&lt;lb/&gt; alliance sprang up between the United States and China, as they co-operated&lt;lb/&gt; in vilifying the Soviet Union, and spoke softly of each other.&lt;lb/&gt; In 1984 every shift of alliance involved an orgy of history rewriting. In&lt;lb/&gt; real life, no such folly is necessary. The public swings from side to side&lt;lb/&gt; easily, accepting the change in circumstance with no concern for the past at&lt;lb/&gt; all. For instance, the Japanese, by the 1950s, had changed from unspeakable&lt;lb/&gt; villains to friends, while the Chinese moved in the opposite direction with&lt;lb/&gt; no one bothering to wipe out Pearl Harbour. No one cared, for goodness'&lt;lb/&gt; sake.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell has his three great powers voluntarily forgo the use of nuclear&lt;lb/&gt; bombs, and to be sure such bombs have not been used in war since 1945. That,&lt;lb/&gt; however, may be because the only powers with large nuclear arsenals, the&lt;lb/&gt; United States and the Soviet Union, have avoided war with each other. Were&lt;lb/&gt; there actual war, it is extremely doubtful that one side or the other would&lt;lb/&gt; not finally feel it necessary to push the button. In that respect, Orwell&lt;lb/&gt; perhaps falls short of reality.&lt;lb/&gt; London does, however, occasionally suffer a missile strike, which sounds&lt;lb/&gt; very much like a V-1 or V-2 weapon of 1944, and the city is in a 1945-type&lt;lb/&gt; shambles. Orwell cannot make 1984 very different from 1944 in this respect.&lt;lb/&gt; Orwell, in fact, makes it clear that by 1984, the universal communism of&lt;lb/&gt; the three superpowers has choked science and reduced it to uselessness&lt;lb/&gt; except in those areas where it is needed for war. There is no question but&lt;lb/&gt; that the nations are more eager to invest in science where war applications&lt;lb/&gt; are in clear view but, alas, there is no way of separating war from peace&lt;lb/&gt; where applications are in question.&lt;lb/&gt; Science is a unit, and everything in it could conceivably be related to&lt;lb/&gt; war and destruction. Science has therefore not been choked off but continues&lt;lb/&gt; not only in the United States and Western Europe and Japan, but also in the&lt;lb/&gt; Soviet Union and in China. The advances of science are too numerous to&lt;lb/&gt; attempt to list, but think of lasers and computers as 'war weapons' with&lt;lb/&gt; infinite peaceful applications.&lt;lb/&gt; To summarise, then: George Orwell in 1984 was, in my opinion, engaging in&lt;lb/&gt; a private feud with Stalinism, rather that attempting to forecast the&lt;lb/&gt; future. He did not have the science fictional knack of foreseeing a&lt;lb/&gt; plausible future and, in actual fact, in almost all cases, the world of 1984&lt;lb/&gt; bears no relation to the real world of the 1980s.&lt;lb/&gt; The world may go communist, if not by 1984, then by some not very much&lt;lb/&gt; later date; or it may see civilisation destroyed. If this happens, however,&lt;lb/&gt; it will happen in a fashion quite different from that depicted in 1984 and&lt;lb/&gt; if we try to prevent either eventuality by imagining that 1984 is accurate,&lt;lb/&gt; then we will be defending ourselves against assaults from the wrong&lt;lb/&gt; direction and we will lose.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The RCE that AMD won’t fix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After being interrupted multiple times by an annoying console window that would pop up periodically on my new gaming PC, I managed to track the offending executable down to AMD’s AutoUpdate software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my anger, I decided to punish this software by decompiling it to figure out how it worked, and accidentally discovered a trivial Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing I found, is that they store their update URL in the program’s &lt;code&gt;app.config&lt;/code&gt;, although its a little odd that they use their “Develpment” URL in production, it uses HTTPS so its perfectly safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real problem starts when you open up this URL in your web browser, and realise that all of the executable download URL’s are using HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that a malicious attacker on your network, or a nation state that has access to your ISP can easily perform a MITM attack and replace the network response with any malicious executable of their choosing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was hoping that AMD perhaps had some form of certificate validation to ensure that it could not download &amp;amp; run any unsigned executables, however a quick look into the decompiled code revealed that the AutoUpdate software does no such validation and immediately executes the downloaded file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After finding this issue, I thought it was worth reporting to AMD since it seemed to be a pretty severe issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However it turned out to be considered “out of scope”, resulting in AMD not considering this to be a vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Solving Shrinkwrap: New Experimental Technique&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this article, I present my new technique for solving a CSS problem that was deemed impossible — true shrinkwrapping of an element with auto-wrapped content. By using anchor positioning and scroll-driven animations, we can adjust our element’s outer dimensions by measuring its inner contents, demonstrating that for many cases this can already work and might unlock a future native feature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since anchor positioning and scroll-driven animations appeared on my radar, I knew they would unlock things that were not possible before. These new CSS features hook into many things that were previously either impossible or available only through cumbersome JavaScript APIs. Two years ago, I wrote about one of such things — the “shrinkwrap” problem and a partial decorative workaround that used anchor positioning — in my “The Shrinkwrap Problem: Possible Future Solutions” article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After writing that article, and experimenting more with scroll-driven animations, I knew that there could be a way to combine those and achieve shrinkwrapping not just visually, but also make it affect the layout. In the last few months, I was experimenting with my past findings and a few novel approaches, and, finally, honed them into something reusable — and already working in stable Chrome and Safari, with a graceful degradationGo to a sidenote for other browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Disclaimeranchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, even though my examples for the base technique might work in the latest versions of some stable browsers, the technique itself is highly experimental.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, I experienced occasional crashes in Safari. I managed to find a workaround, but I strongly suggest being careful before using anything from this article in production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Problemanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s say we have a simple header, which we style to look like a nice rounded box, and that should shrink to its &lt;code&gt;max-content&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it is short, all is good! But we anticipate that it might wrap when the content is longer, and add &lt;code&gt;text-wrap: balance&lt;/code&gt; to make it prettier. But then, this happens:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On most viewports, you could see how when the header wraps, we get all this extra space on one side — the shrinkwrap problem. What exactly is happening, and why is it so challenging to make it work?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll quote my first article about shrinkwrap:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When different content wraps — be it text, floats, inline-blocks, flex, or grid, — if that wrapping is automatic (without hard breaks), the way CSS calculates the final width is limited. The element with wrapped items gets expanded to fill all the available space.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In CSS2 specs, this behavior is called “shrink-to-fit”:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;shrink-to-fit width is: min(max(preferred minimum width, available width), preferred width)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a problem people have stumbled over and over from the beginning of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Under a cut — a long (not comprehensive) list with many links!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Elika J. Etemad wrote about it to the www-style mailing list: “True Shrinkwrapping”. She even already mentioned&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;text-wrap: balance&lt;/code&gt;in the code example!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In 2016, yisibl opened an issue #191 on CSSWG’s GitHub, “How to shrink to fit the width?”, showing a use case for wrapping of items inside a flexbox layout. Most of the following cases are from this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In 2017, Vasilis van Gemert questioned if this can be fixed in his blog post “How do I fix this CSS alignment issue?”, about a left-aligned block that, when wrapped, should be aligned as a whole to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In 2018, Nadya678 opened a duplicate issue about this.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Also in 2018, Benoît Rouleau provided another use case in the issue #191. The CodePen in question is no longer accessible, but from the description, it sounds like the underlined headers use case from my previous article about shrinkwrap.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In 2019, Dan Tonon also provided his use case in the same issue. This is probably the hardest to solve use case — a menu.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In 2020, Dan stumbled upon this again and opened a duplicate issue with the same case.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting from 2023, we saw a resurgence of reports about this issue thanks to the work on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;text-wrap: balance&lt;/code&gt;which highlighted this issue. Many people did write about it then:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;On March 3, Adam Argyle wrote about a few use cases.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;On September 7, Šime Vidas linked to a related Reddit post, which had a “message” use case.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;I published my “The Shrinkwrap Problem: Possible Future Solutions” article in December.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In 2024 this continued:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;On April 23, Lea Verou highlighted the &lt;code&gt;text-wrap: balance&lt;/code&gt;issue once again.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;On May 3, Vincent Rubinetti linked to a JS workaround on StackOverflow.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;On May 19, Tomer Aberbach wanted to replace a JS lib with &lt;code&gt;text-wrap: balance&lt;/code&gt;and couldn’t because of this issue.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On April 23, Lea Verou highlighted the &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;2025!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;On April 18, Miriam Suzanne stumbled upon the &lt;code&gt;text-wrap: balance&lt;/code&gt;use case as well.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;On May 21, Mo Beigi ran into one of the original use cases for the menu.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;On May 27, Stephanie Eckles mentioned a tooltip use case they had in Adobe, one that we have as well in Datadog.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;On July 21, Lea returned to this problem, opening a new duplicate issue with a proposal to use &lt;code&gt;fit-content&lt;/code&gt;or something similar for this.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;On October 23, Svein Alexander Frotjold provided another use case with alignment of form fields.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On April 18, Miriam Suzanne stumbled upon the &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is just mostly mentions from the #191 issue — there are also many StackOverflow issues and likely other places where authors wrote about this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article will show how we could solve almost all of these cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Solutionsanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bulk of all use cases are “simple”: we have a pre-defined space in which we have our element that could wrap, with the wrapped state often being the default one. There, we never want to use &lt;code&gt;max-content&lt;/code&gt; for the element’s width, and these elements generally do not depend on the surrounding context but want just their box to be flush with text or the surrounding context to depend on our wrapped box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These cases are solved either by the base technique, or by a more advanced version of it where we have to measure multiple items.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hardest cases are those like the menu items, where every item might wrap, and by default, they want to be sized as &lt;code&gt;max-content&lt;/code&gt;. I admit that my technique is not a good fit for these cases, but I will attempt to solve that as well, although through an extension of the base technique that uses content duplication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Base Techniqueanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is how I will present the technique:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I will list the limitations and corresponding prerequisites for using this basic technique.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The full code for the abstracted technique is placed under a cut — if you are eager to try to understand what is going on inside without my lengthier explanations, feel free to read it! Although I placed many comments inside, which helps.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all of that code is needed for the simplest of cases: first, I will iteratively explain how we solve the common case of an element with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;text-align: left&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then, I will complete the technique by handling the non-left text alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finally, I will show how to use the technique as a building block for handling more complex cases with multiple nested phrasing contents.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Limitations &amp;amp; Requirementsanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The prerequisites for being able to use this technique are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, we’d want to have some&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;container-type: inline-size&lt;/code&gt;around our element, as its default max-inline-size will use&lt;code&gt;100cqi&lt;/code&gt;, and most use cases will want to use&lt;code&gt;cqi&lt;/code&gt;in one way or another.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The element’s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;max-inline-size&lt;/code&gt;should not dependGo to a sidenote on its siblings. For the technique to work, we will need to set it to a value in&lt;code&gt;px&lt;/code&gt;, which could depend on its container through the container query length units. But we can’t have our element respond to&lt;code&gt;flex-shrink&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;flex-grow&lt;/code&gt;: when placed in a flex or grid context, its width will be more or less static.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our element must have only phrasing content, or, in other words, should contain only inline elements inside. Replaced elements like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;are allowed inside, alongside anything with&lt;code&gt;inline-block&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;inline-flex&lt;/code&gt;, and other&lt;code&gt;inline-&lt;/code&gt;s, like the future&lt;code&gt;inline grid-lanes&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Full Codeanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re curious, you can peek at the full code of the technique. It is thoroughly commented and might cover some of the things I did not cover in this article. That said, I tried to expand on many things in later sections, so keep reading if you want to get the most of that info in a more readable form!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Simple Caseanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the case from “The Problem” section again:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now, let’s apply our base technique to it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It works! But how did we achieve this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the HTMLGo to a sidenote needed for the technique. Instead of just one element, we need to have a pretty specificGo to a sidenote nested structure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Side note: All the CSS that we had to add for this specific example is &lt;code&gt;--sw-padding: var(--inline-padding)&lt;/code&gt; — I will explain this in the base technique’s CSS API later. Jump to this sidenote’s context.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Side note: Obviously, the &lt;code&gt;h5&lt;/code&gt; here is just for this example; otherwise it could be a &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt;, or anything else that fits your use case. Jump to this sidenote’s context.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h5 class="shrinkwrap"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;span class="shrinkwrap-content"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;span class="shrinkwrap-source"&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;!-- Text --&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;span class="shrinkwrap-probe"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/h5&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap&lt;/code&gt;is our topmost wrapper element — one that will receive the final dimensions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-content&lt;/code&gt;is the inner wrapper that usually will be wider than its parent and will determine how the text content inside will wrap.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-source&lt;/code&gt;is the additional wrapper around our inline content, which we will target with anchor positioning.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-probe&lt;/code&gt;is our anchored element that will measure the&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-source&lt;/code&gt;and which will communicate its dimensions to the&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap&lt;/code&gt;via scroll-driven animations.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core idea is relatively simple. To stealGo to a sidenote a Doctor Who metaphor from Amelia Bellamy-Royds:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We want a box that is bigger on the inside than out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s precisely what we’re doing with our technique.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you read my previous article on this topic, you might wonder, wouldn’t that previous technique that involved just anchor positioning be enough?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem with that older technique was that it would only position the anchored element around our inline element — and this would not impact the actual element’s dimensions or position in any way, making the setup pretty awkward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, we would not be able to make the text inside this header be still left-aligned while centering the header itself:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new technique gave the parent &lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap&lt;/code&gt; element the correct dimensions, making it possible to continue using CSS as usual, without trying to “fake” its visuals through an external anchored element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will omit explaining some styles and will trim various calculations — you can find them in the full code, but in these sections I want to give the general overview of the code involved in the technique.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Styles for the Top Wrapperanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our top &lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap&lt;/code&gt; wrapper has a few important partsGo to a sidenote in its CSS:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.shrinkwrap {
  /* 1. Setting up overrideable custom properties. */
  @layer defaults {/*…*/}

  /* 2. Base styles: some other values are allowed. */
  display:  block;
  overflow: hidden;

  /* 3. Scroll-driven animations for remote measuring. */
  timeline-scope:     /* One timeline   */;
  animation:          /* Two animations */;
  animation-range:    /* Two ranges     */;
  animation-timeline: /* One timeline   */;

  /* 4. Applying the measured dimensions to the element. */
  inline-size:     /* Cyclic-toggled value. */;
  min-inline-size: max(/*…*/);

  /* 5. Some important resets. */
  box-sizing: content-box !important;
  flex-grow:  0 !important;
  flex-shrink:     /* Cyclic-toggled value */;
  max-inline-size: /* Cyclic-toggled value */;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We use layers and custom properties for defining the CSS API of our technique.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our topmost element should have a normal flow:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;block&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;inline-block&lt;/code&gt;will work, as well as it being inside a flex or grid context, but the element itself can’t establish a grid or flex.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The key part: we use scroll-driven animations to retrieve the dimensions of our inner element. I will expand on this a bit more in a later “Remote Dimensions Measuring” section.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second key part: applyingGo to a sidenote the measured dimensions to our element. The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;inline-size&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;min-inline-size&lt;/code&gt;will be calculated based on variables that will be applied via scroll-driven animations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I also included a few properties that we should never really change for our parent element, as we are sizing it in a very specific way. This part might be adjusted: we could add more properties there or find use cases in which these properties could play a role and require overriding.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Styles for the Content Wrapperanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-content&lt;/code&gt; is that “inner box” that might be bigger than the actual &lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap&lt;/code&gt; elementGo to a sidenote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.shrinkwrap-content {
  /* 1. Base styles. */
  display:  block;
  overflow: hidden;

  /* 2. Inner box’ dimensions. */
  inline-size:     /*…*/;
  min-inline-size: min-content;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The styles for the inner box are (for now) simple:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to have some base styles — again, we need to make sure we use a normal flow, and specifically&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;overflow: hidden&lt;/code&gt;, as scroll-driven animations will rely on its presence on this element.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have to set the dimensions of our element in a pretty specific way. It will reuse several “private” custom properties that we set on the wrapper and which are based on the custom properties defined by our technique’s API. The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;inline-size&lt;/code&gt;here is the most important part: the way we size it (by default with&lt;code&gt;100cqi&lt;/code&gt;) makes it so it is independent of the&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap&lt;/code&gt;’s dimensions.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Styles for the Sourceanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-source&lt;/code&gt; isGo to a sidenote one of the more simple elements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.shrinkwrap-source {
  anchor-name: var(/*…*/);

  @layer defaults {
    display: inline;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This element will provide the &lt;code&gt;anchor-name&lt;/code&gt; used for our technique, which might be reassigned via the custom properties API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, we need it to be inline by default, as this is what we rely on when measuring our element. However, there are use cases where we are not measuring inline elements, so we apply this style weakly and allow overriding externally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Styles for the Probeanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we have our &lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-probe&lt;/code&gt; element:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@supports (timeline-scope: --f) {
  .shrinkwrap-probe {
    /* 1. Base styles. */
    position:       absolute;
    pointer-events: none;

    /* 2. Anchoring to the Source. */
    position-anchor: var(/*…*/);
    inset-block:     0;
    inset-inline:    calc(/*…*/);
    margin:          calc(/*…*/);

    /* Establishing the view timeline. */
    view-timeline: /*…*/;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is our absolutely positionedGo to a sidenote element that will measure the source element. We should remove the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pointer-events&lt;/code&gt;from it, as it should not interfere with our page in any way. An alternative could be to use&lt;code&gt;visibility: hidden&lt;/code&gt;, but I find it is much easier to keep it “visible” with just&lt;code&gt;pointer-events&lt;/code&gt;for easier debugging.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then anchor this element to the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-source&lt;/code&gt;. Later techniques might override some of these, but by default we only care about the&lt;code&gt;inset-inline&lt;/code&gt;and use anchor positioning for defining it. Additionally, we’re using a&lt;code&gt;margin&lt;/code&gt;to optionally adjust the measured rectangle.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we need to establish an&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt;view timeline, which will mean we could access it on the&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap&lt;/code&gt;element via&lt;code&gt;timeline-scope&lt;/code&gt;and its&lt;code&gt;animation&lt;/code&gt;properties.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that we can also wrap this whole element with an &lt;code&gt;@supports&lt;/code&gt; — no reason to do anything with it unless &lt;code&gt;timeline-scope&lt;/code&gt; is supported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Non-Left Text Alignmentanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above styles would be enough for cases when we have just a left-aligned text, as our &lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-source&lt;/code&gt;’s left boundary will be the same, and that would be enough to just shrink the &lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap&lt;/code&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, if we were to override the &lt;code&gt;text-align&lt;/code&gt; on our element, the following could happen:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because our inner box is bigger than the outer, and the text is aligned inside that box, it is not enough to shrink the outer one — we need to also detectGo to a sidenote that offset between the &lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-content&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-source&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, with the way we’re measuring our element, we can reuse the variables that our scroll-driven animation applies and adjust the position of our &lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-content&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/* Added to the other styles */
.shrinkwrap-content {
  position: relative;

  @supports (timeline-scope: --f) {
    inset-inline-start: min(/*…*/);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We makeGo to a sidenote our element &lt;code&gt;position: relative&lt;/code&gt;, and then use &lt;code&gt;inset-inline-start&lt;/code&gt; to adjust its position.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I imagine there could be other text edge cases that the base technique does not cover — if you’ll think of anything, please let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Multiple Nested Phrasing Contentsanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the base technique is limited to only shrinkwrapping elements with phrasing content, more complicated cases could be covered by reusing the technique multiple times for every instance of such content inside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, we could have a list with several items, and then we’d want to put it into a card with its edges flush with the content of all items inside. For this, we can make our list the container and then wrap the contents of each list item with the technique and then size the card with &lt;code&gt;max-content&lt;/code&gt; — and it will just work! And if some list items have multiple paragraphs, we use the technique once per paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, we can use our base technique as a building block for anything that is more complex. The later sections expand on this base technique but adjust how we measure things and what exactly we are measuring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Base Technique’s APIanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The HTML of the technique is a part of its API:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class="shrinkwrap"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div class="shrinkwrap-content"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;span class="shrinkwrap-source"&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;!-- Text --&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;span class="shrinkwrap-probe"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap&lt;/code&gt;and the&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-content&lt;/code&gt;can be anything apart from the&lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt;, but they can only have the&lt;code&gt;display: block&lt;/code&gt;(which is applied by the technique but should not be overridden).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-source&lt;/code&gt;defines what we will be measuring, and by default has&lt;code&gt;display: inline&lt;/code&gt;. It is possible to apply it to some other element or skip this element completely if we’re overriding what we’re targeting with the&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-probe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-probe&lt;/code&gt;is our measuring element, it must be strictly inside the&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-content&lt;/code&gt;, and by default is measuring the&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-source&lt;/code&gt;. We can override what the&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-probe&lt;/code&gt;is measuring by overriding its&lt;code&gt;inset&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alongside HTML, we can define a set of CSS custom properties on the &lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap&lt;/code&gt; element:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--sw-limit&lt;/code&gt;— the key custom property that has the default of&lt;code&gt;100cqi&lt;/code&gt;. We can use it when we want to place some other elements alongside ours on the same “row”. The above “Multiple Nested Phrasing Contents” use one such case, where we set it to, essentially,&lt;code&gt;50cqi - 3 * var(--gap) - var(--list-item-padding)&lt;/code&gt;— defining the maxGo to a sidenote limit that the text inside could take to be a half of the container, minus all the paddings and gaps that the surrounding layout has.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--sw-padding&lt;/code&gt;can be used when we have a uniform padding around the element that we’re sizing. We are in a something similar to the&lt;code&gt;box-sizing: content-box&lt;/code&gt;context when we’re using this technique, so we can use this custom property to communicate the possible adjustment. It is similar to using a&lt;code&gt;calc()&lt;/code&gt;inside a&lt;code&gt;--sw-limit&lt;/code&gt;, and often is a more simple way of handling the paddings, but more complex cases might be better solved with the calculated&lt;code&gt;--sw-limit&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--sw-inner-padding&lt;/code&gt;is a bit different, and might be mostly used for more complex cases that involve&lt;code&gt;--sw-inset&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;--sw-source&lt;/code&gt;overrides. This is a custom property to account for any padding that could be present between the&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap&lt;/code&gt;and the measured content inside the&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-content&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--sw-inset&lt;/code&gt;can be used to override the value of the&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-probe&lt;/code&gt;’s&lt;code&gt;inset&lt;/code&gt;, making it possible to anchor it to multiple elements for more complex cases like the “Multiple Explicit Anchors”. This is where the&lt;code&gt;--sw-inner-padding&lt;/code&gt;can also be useful, as it will be automatically used for calculations that can be trickier to achieve with the&lt;code&gt;inset&lt;/code&gt;shorthand. **Note: ** this custom property is used specifically for&lt;code&gt;inset-inline&lt;/code&gt;property, and not&lt;code&gt;inset&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--sw-source&lt;/code&gt;is for those rare cases where you’d want to override the&lt;code&gt;anchor-name&lt;/code&gt;of the&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-probe&lt;/code&gt;element. This can be useful for any complex techniques where the measured element lives outside the&lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap&lt;/code&gt;element, allowing us to “link” them. See my “Inline Custom Identifiers” blog post that covers this way of connecting elements.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Remote Dimension Measuringanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am using a technique, the basics of which I came up with somewhere in 2023, after publishing my second article about scroll-driven animations. I did not write about this technique anywhere yet, but had a few drafts with various use cases for it that I sometimes worked on in background.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, someone else came up with a similar technique and wrote about it — it was Temani Afif and his “How to Get the Width/Height of Any Element in Only CSS” article from July 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is one difference between our techniques: Temani relies on the “measuring” element when it is at the beginning of the box, and then using its &lt;code&gt;1px&lt;/code&gt; dimension and its proportions relative to the scrollport to calculate that scrollport’s dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because I am using anchor positioning to place my probing element at a very specific point — which I want to measure — I, instead, rely on a very high value of the &lt;code&gt;timeline-range&lt;/code&gt;, which I store in the &lt;code&gt;--resolution&lt;/code&gt; custom property.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When some view timeline then reports its position in this range, by knowing this “resolution” we can then retrieve that position through scoping the timeline to another element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the CSSGo to a sidenote responsible for the scroll-driven animations that I previously skimmed through:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.shrinkwrap {
  /* Lifting the scope of view timelines from inside. */
  timeline-scope: --_sw-x;

  /*
    Accessing the start and end coordinates of the
    inner element via scroll-driven animations.
    Only apply when the technique is enabled.
  */
  animation: var(--sw-enabled--on,
    --_sw-x-start linear both,
    --_sw-x-end   linear both
  );

  /*
    We will be using the “resolution” as a range to
    retrieve the width of various things.
  */
  --_sw-resolution: 10000px;
  animation-range:
    0               var(--_sw-resolution),
    contain contain var(--_sw-resolution);
  animation-timeline: --_sw-x;

  /*
    Calculating the actual size from the variables applied
    via the animation with the given resolution.
  */
  --_sw-size:
    (var(--_sw-x-start) - var(--_sw-x-end))
    *
    var(--_sw-resolution)
  ;
  /*
    For the main size, clamp the result within limits,
    and guard everything with a space toggle.
  */
  inline-size: var(--sw-enabled--on,
    clamp(
      0px,
      var(--_sw-size),
      var(--_sw-max-size)
    )
  );
  /* Min-size should not be clamped. */
  min-inline-size: max(
    0px,
    var(--_sw-size)
  );
}

.shrinkwrap-content {
  @supports (timeline-scope: --f) {
    /* Guard by the cyclic toggle. */
    inset-inline-start: var(--sw-enabled--on,
      min(
        0px,
        var(--_sw-x-start) * var(--_sw-resolution)
        -
        var(--_sw-max-size)
      )
    );
  }
}

@supports (timeline-scope: --f) {
  .shrinkwrap-probe {
    /* Exposes the element to the scope on an ancestor. */
    view-timeline: --_sw-x inline;
  }
}

/*
  Custom properties that will be applied via scroll-driven
  animations, with the value from 0 to 1.
*/
@property --_sw-x-end {
  syntax: "&amp;lt;number&amp;gt;";
  initial-value: 0;
  inherits: true;
}
@property --_sw-x-start {
  syntax: "&amp;lt;number&amp;gt;";
  initial-value: 0;
  inherits: true;
}

/* The keyframes that deliver their values. */
@keyframes --_sw-x-end {
  0%   { --_sw-x-end: 0 }
  100% { --_sw-x-end: 1 }
}
@keyframes --_sw-x-start {
  0%   { --_sw-x-start: 0 }
  100% { --_sw-x-start: 1 }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am planning to write a separate article that will explain how this dimension measuring works in detail, and I would rather not repeat myself in this one (and make it even longer).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So — stay tuned for that next article!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A Crashing Safari Buganchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the disclaimer, this technique is very experimental, and the CSS features it relies on are pretty new, and can sometimes cause issues even though they’re there in the “stable” versions of major browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially, I was creating the probing elements as pseudo-elements, but while testing my article, I found that in certain conditions my article was crashing its tab in Safari.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After reducing the code to its minimal reproductionGo to a sidenote, I found that the probing element being a pseudo-element was one of the conditions for the crash to happen, so I adjusted the technique by replacing it with a real element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially, my technique also had another pseudo-element that did not trigger the issue, but I managed to simplify my technique to allow doing both measurements from the single additional element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Solving for Complex Contentanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The base technique works for the simple case where our source element has phrasing content: only &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; (and &lt;code&gt;inline-…&lt;/code&gt;) elements inside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what about more complex cases, like when we have multiple items inside wrapping flexbox, grids, etc?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simpler cases which we could separate into several independent phrasing contexts can be solved by repeating the base technique — see “Multiple Nested Phrasing Contents”, but not everything can be done this way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Multiple Explicit Anchorsanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I covered this use case and a few of my approaches to a solution in my previous article, in a “Wrapping Flex Items” section, but the new technique improves on those.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, if we have a wrapping list of items, either inside a grid or a flex container, if we know the number of items, then we can assign a unique anchor to every item and then use a &lt;code&gt;min()&lt;/code&gt; function involving all the anchors to find the “furthest” element that could be used to determine our shrinkwrapped dimension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because I abstracted the measuring into a separate element, implementing this is as easy as doing the followingGo to a sidenote (after stripping visual styles unrelated to the technique):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;li {
  padding:     var(--padding);
  anchor-name: var(--is);
}

.shrinkwrap {
  --sw-inner-padding: var(--padding);
  --sw-inset:
    min(
      anchor(--a inside, calc(infinity * 1px)),
      anchor(--b inside, calc(infinity * 1px)),
      anchor(--c inside, calc(infinity * 1px)),
      anchor(--d inside, calc(infinity * 1px)),
      anchor(--e inside, calc(infinity * 1px)),
      anchor(--f inside, calc(infinity * 1px)),
      anchor(--g inside, calc(infinity * 1px))
    )
  ;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the HTML is pretty simple: we wrap our list with our shrinkwrap technique:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class="shrinkwrap"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div class="shrinkwrap-content"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;li style="--is: --a"&amp;gt;
        An item
      &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;!-- the rest of the items  --&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;span class="shrinkwrap-probe"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because what we’re measuring is not inline, we are not using the &lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-source&lt;/code&gt; class that would assign the target that we measure; that’s where the &lt;code&gt;--sw-inset&lt;/code&gt; custom property comes into play: we can use it to reassign how the &lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-probe&lt;/code&gt; will be positioned by overriding its &lt;code&gt;inset&lt;/code&gt; property, and thus what exactly it will measure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only thing that we need to do here is use the &lt;code&gt;min()&lt;/code&gt; function and pass all items’ anchors inside, making it possible to compare the inset positions of all the items and choose those that make the biggest bounding box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to this, we can use the &lt;code&gt;--sw-inline-padding&lt;/code&gt; to accommodate the padding around items, which, in this case, is much easier to do than adding a calculation to the &lt;code&gt;min()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Chained Anchors Abominationanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, the above code relies on knowing the number of elements, assigning the unique anchor identifiers to them, and then listing all of them inside a &lt;code&gt;min()&lt;/code&gt;. But what if I tell you that we could achieve this without doing so?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, we can, but, for now, this works only in Chrome — this relies on the ability to chain multiple anchors together, and that currently only works reliably in Chrome, while Safari and Firefox have pretty serious bugsGo to a sidenote with that behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time, HTML is a bit more simple in one way (no unique idents), but more complex in another (additional probe elements, two per item):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;  &amp;lt;div class="shrinkwrap"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div class="shrinkwrap-content"&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
          An item
          &amp;lt;div class="probe-left"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;div class="probe-right"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;!-- the rest of the elements  --&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;div class="shrinkwrap-probe"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see how, alongside the &lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-probe&lt;/code&gt; element, each element has its two &lt;code&gt;probe-left&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;probe-right&lt;/code&gt; elements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But how, without a &lt;code&gt;min()&lt;/code&gt;, can we use this to measure the bounding box for all elements without explicitly mentioning them?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the CSSGo to a sidenote responsible for this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;li {
  anchor-name:  --li;
  anchor-scope: --li;
}

.probe-left,
.probe-right {
  position:       absolute;
  pointer-events: none;
  inset:          anchor(--li inside);
  container-type: inline-size;

  &amp;amp;::before {
    content:  "";
    position: absolute;
    inset:    0;
  }
}

.probe-left {
  left:  anchor(--li left, 0);
  right: anchor(--leftmost left, anchor(--li right));

  @container (min-width: 1px) {
    &amp;amp;::before {
      anchor-name: --leftmost;
    }
  }
}

.probe-right {
  left:  anchor(--rightmost right, anchor(--li left));
  right: anchor(--li right, 0);

  @container (min-width: 1px) {
    &amp;amp;::before {
      anchor-name: --rightmost;
    }
  }
}

.shrinkwrap {
  --sw-inner-padding: 1em
  --sw-inset:
    anchor(--leftmost  left)
    anchor(--rightmost right)
  ;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting from the end — as we don’t have a &lt;code&gt;shrinkwrap-source&lt;/code&gt;, we override &lt;code&gt;--sw-inset&lt;/code&gt; to get the insets from the leftmost and rightmost items, which will be determined later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, we can assign a scoped anchor name to our items:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;li {
  anchor-name:  --li;
  anchor-scope: --li;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need to scope it so the probe elements inside the items would see the correct anchors; otherwise, they could look up at the last one they see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we do next is pretty fun: we use this parent &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; as the anchor for the nested probes via &lt;code&gt;inset: anchor(--li inside)&lt;/code&gt; on them and also make these probes inline containers via &lt;code&gt;container-type: inline-size&lt;/code&gt;, which makes it possible to query them on inner pseudo-elements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, we do this for the probe that measures the right edge of our boundary box (and mirror it for the &lt;code&gt;probe-left&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.probe-right {
  left:  anchor(--rightmost right, anchor(--li left));
  right: anchor(--li right, 0);

  @container (min-width: 1px) {
    &amp;amp;::before {
      anchor-name: --rightmost;
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We rely on an ability to “chain” the anchorsGo to a sidenote: anchor to the previous valid anchor target among multiple that share the name. Then we can use container queries to check if our probe has a positive width — that would mean that its edge is to the right from the previous rightmost probe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a way, this is an algorithm for determining the maximum value of something expressed via pure layout — anchor positioning and container queries! It relies on the order the elements are laid out: the later elements can anchor to earlier elements, so they can use the dynamic anchor names that are applied inside container queries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it is difficult to understand what is going on, highlighting those &lt;code&gt;probe-left&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;probe-right&lt;/code&gt; elements could help:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going with elements one by one, we position both probes on both sides, each going from the edge of the last pseudo-element that was placed into a positive container query or falling back to the first element’s dimensions. This makes it so, going through all elements, we will create “steps” out of our probes, where only the rightmost and leftmost ones will have positive dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Too bad Safari and Firefox don’t work well with chaining just yet…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cross-Dependencies: Menu Use Caseanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final and the hardest use case I want to cover is something like a navigation menu, in which all elements should participate in a single flex context, and with these elements shrinking if there is not enough space for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we take some horizontal menu with just a few shorter items, then everything looks fine when all items fit in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here is what happens when the items are longer, there are more of them, and not enough space to have them all without wrapping:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the core, this is the same issue as with the other shrinkwrap problems: once wrapped, the element tries to take as much space as it can, and when there are multiple elements fighting for that space, it will be re-distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would’ve been great if the base technique I presented above could work for that case. But it doesn’t: for the base technique to work, we have to know the limits in which we’re working, but when our element depends on all other elements and shrinks proportionally based on all the extra elements present around, we cannotGo to a sidenote achieve it with what we have for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only way to solve it that I found is with content duplication: first, we can render our menu as regular but hidden, measure the wrapped elements, and then transfer their dimensions to the visible copy, one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole setup can then be placed inside another instance of our base technique, so we could collapse the whole menu and allow elements around it to stretch over the space that we gain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is what it can look like when adding a few more elements to the example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I managed to make it work in this case, I found that there are more problems with these kinds of menus. If you resize it, on narrower screens, things become pretty bad. Some container queries and switching up the layout could work, and there are things that could be improved with this solution further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I won’t provide a more detailed explanation of how this works and won’t show any code, at least for now: it is very fragile, and maybe once I play with this type of layout more, I could see a better way to apply my technique. Or come up with something else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what this demonstrates is that the complex cases are complex, and while it is possible to come closer to solving them, there are still many unknowns over how exactly they should be solved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Some Other Use Casesanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before I end the article, I don’t want it to stop on the sourer note with the previous not fully solved case. So, let’s return to some examples from my last article on shrinkwrap, and demonstrate how the new technique solves them much better. Plus, I’ll add another two use cases that I did not cover in my previous article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Chat Bubblesanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of my favorite examples is the chat bubbles — you can see this everywhere, from phone apps to video games. I imagine native frameworks have their ways of doing this, but on the web we could not achieve this look with just CSS until now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The implementation of this is so much simpler than what I had to do when trying to fake it by anchor-positioning the bubble’s background separately! Now we just give &lt;code&gt;max-width: max-content&lt;/code&gt; to the blockquotes inside and then wrap each paragraph with our technique, like that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p class="shrinkwrap"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;span class="shrinkwrap-content"&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;span class="shrinkwrap-source"&amp;gt;
        Hello, there!
      &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;span class="shrinkwrap-probe"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then the only extra CSS that we have to add is the definition of the &lt;code&gt;--sw-limit&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--sw-padding&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.example-bubbles .shrinkwrap {
  --sw-padding: var(--padding-inline);
  --sw-limit: calc(
    100cqi
    -
    (
      var(--margin-start)
      +
      var(--margin-end)
    )
  );
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have to account for all the paddings and margins we can have and add &lt;code&gt;inline-size&lt;/code&gt; containment on our example wrapper, but otherwise this shows how much easier it is to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fieldsets and Legendsanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the corresponding example in my previous article on this topic, I relied on the legend expanding and then re-adding the borders, faking them via added pseudo-elements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The below &lt;code&gt;legend&lt;/code&gt; is using the new technique and doesn’t have any faked bordersGo to a sidenote. It fully relies on the “magic” behavior of the native &lt;code&gt;fieldset&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;legend&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, again, this example shows how &lt;code&gt;text-wrap: balance&lt;/code&gt; could improve things, but only if we could shrinkwrap it natively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Overlay Image Captionsanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This use case wasn’t in my first post about shrinkwrap but was provided by Johannes Odland to me in a private conversation, where he mentioned that they had cases like this at NRK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s say we want to have a figure with an image and want to put the caption on top of it with a semi-opaque background that is flush to the caption’s text so we could minimize the area it covers. As with other cases, when the text is short, everything is ok, but when it wraps, it will span all the available space. Shrinkwrapping will help with this a lot!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Tooltipsanchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last use case I’ll show in this article is one that we have in Datadog, and that is likely familiar to anyone dealing with design systems — tooltips and popovers. Pretty often you want the content in them to be nice and balanced, but have a certain limit, usually much smaller than the width of the viewport. Without shrinkwrapping, this can lead to rather ugly results. But our technique allows creating pretty and neat tooltips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the tooltip’s content that wraps over several lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is always shown, as this is a demo, so the button before it doesn’t really do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wish the HTML for the technique was as pretty as the result — while all the demos above show how it works, it is hardly easily applicable for user-generated content, and even when you have full control over your HTML, it can be pretty cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Next?anchor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me, it is clear that the most basic use cases — when we know the max-inline-size our element can take — should be achievable in browsers with either a new property or a new function that could be used for size properties. It might require containment or something similar, as there is still a chance the percentage-based dimensions could lead to some circularities. But even with the required containment, what this will allow us to achieve will cover so many things people wanted to do for more than a decade now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t think we need to pursue solving the menu case (cross-dependent shrinkwrapping) for now — it is a much, much more complicated layout. But I believe if we work out the simple cases first, we could crunch on those low-hanging fruits and see if we could make some more complex jams out of them later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will post a link to this article and my proposal to explore the simpler solution todayGo to a sidenote in the corresponding CSSWG issue, and if you had stumbled upon this problem before and have any specific use cases, bring them up and maybe even see if my technique will cover them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I will also be working on another article — one that will cover my method of remote dimension measuring technique, so stay tuned for that and more! Although, likely, it won’t be anywhere soon, as these articles take a long time to research and write.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Tower of Flaws: Dismantling Tower of Fantasy's Anti-Cheat Driver While Waiting for The Game to Install&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This all started because I wanted to delete my Tower of Fantasy account from over 4 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the life of me, I couldn’t find a way to do it without having the game installed. There was no web portal and no obvious support route. Eventually I gave up and decided to just download it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tower of Fantasy is over 100 GB so it would be a long install. I already knew the game shipped with an anti-cheat driver from past experience, so while the download crawled along I started poking around the launcher directory. That’s when I noticed &lt;code&gt;GameDriverX64.sys&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kernel drivers run with the highest privileges on your machine. Anti-cheat drivers use this power to protect games from cheaters, but when they’re poorly written, attackers can abuse that same power against you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I opened the driver in IDA expecting a wall of virtualized code, probably VMProtect. Instead I got clean, readable functions with no obfuscation or virtualization at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By now, the install was at 9%. I had time to dig in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of noise online about kernel anti-cheats being “spyware” or inherently privacy-invasive. Most of it misidentifies the actual risk. A usermode game client can already steal your browser cookies, log keystrokes, and exfiltrate files without ever touching the kernel. The real concern with kernel anti-cheats isn’t surveillance, it’s that they are security-critical code running at the highest privilege level. When they’re poorly written, they become attack surface, and when they fail, they can take your entire system down with them (e.g the CrowdStrike incident). For a thorough, level-headed breakdown of the privacy and security tradeoffs, I’d recommend this post by Bevan Philip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Isn’t This Obfuscated?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The previous version of this driver (&lt;code&gt;KSophon_x64.sys&lt;/code&gt;) was VMProtect’d to hell, so I was curious why they’d strip protection from a security-critical kernel component. The reason is due to HVCI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HVCI (Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity) is a Windows security feature that uses Hyper-V to enforce code integrity above the NT kernel, enabled by default on clean Windows 11 installs. The key constraint: W^X (Write XOR Execute) enforcement means code pages can’t be both writable and executable. VMProtect’s packing and import protection both violate this, so the driver fails integrity checks on HVCI-enabled systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VMProtect can still work under HVCI if you stick to mutation and virtualization macros while avoiding the features that break W^X. They could still protect their imports manually and virtualize the bulk of their code. For some reason, they did neither.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even with VMProtect, these vulnerabilities would still exist. The IOCTLs still do what they do and the authentication is essentially nonexistent. Obfuscation makes reversing harder, not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What the Driver Actually Does&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It registers the following device:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Device Access Control&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;IRP_MJ_CREATE&lt;/code&gt; handler checks whether the calling process has loaded one of three specific DLLs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, you don’t even need the real DLLs. The check only looks at module names in your PEB, so you can rename literally any DLL to &lt;code&gt;QmGUI.dll&lt;/code&gt; for example and load it. My PoC just copies &lt;code&gt;version.dll&lt;/code&gt; from System32 and renames it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Handle Protection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The driver registers &lt;code&gt;ObRegisterCallbacks&lt;/code&gt; to intercept handle operations on protected processes and strip dangerous access rights. The callbacks look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, &lt;code&gt;PROCESS_TERMINATE&lt;/code&gt; is not stripped from process handles, so external processes can still kill the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before stripping, the callback checks a whitelist. One entry is hardcoded for &lt;code&gt;"CrashCapture.e"&lt;/code&gt; (their crash handler) with zero integrity verification. The &lt;code&gt;.e&lt;/code&gt; extension isn’t a typo by the way, &lt;code&gt;PsGetProcessImageFileName&lt;/code&gt; returns from &lt;code&gt;EPROCESS.ImageFileName&lt;/code&gt;, a 15-byte array, so “CrashCapture.exe” (16 chars) gets truncated to 14 chars + null. The check itself is just a filename comparison:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s also a subtle bug here: the &lt;code&gt;strnicmp&lt;/code&gt; calls use &lt;code&gt;strlen(ProcessName)&lt;/code&gt; as the comparison length, not the length of the constant string. This means the comparison is a prefix match. Any process whose name is a prefix of the whitelist entry will pass. A process named &lt;code&gt;"Crash"&lt;/code&gt; or even &lt;code&gt;"C"&lt;/code&gt; would match &lt;code&gt;"CrashCapture.e"&lt;/code&gt;. The same bug applies to every dynamic whitelist entry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dynamic whitelist entries do one more check: comparing the caller’s &lt;code&gt;OptionalHeader.CheckSum&lt;/code&gt; against a stored value. PE checksums aren’t cryptographic though, so anyone can set them to any value with a hex editor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s also a background thread that runs anti-debug and integrity checks in a loop:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plus a process creation callback that kills all protected processes if it sees &lt;code&gt;GPUView.exe&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;xperf.exe&lt;/code&gt; launch, neither of which are reverse engineering tools. My best guess is this was cargo-culted from another anti-cheat driver’s blocklist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The IOCTL Interface&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The driver exposes 10 IOCTL codes, 7 of which are interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;IOCTL Code&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Purpose&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;0x222000&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Check if debugger attached via debug port&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;0x222004&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Register a process as “protected”&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;0x222008&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Heartbeat/keepalive&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;0x222020&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Get list of protected processes&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;0x222040&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Terminate any process by PID&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;0x222044&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Strip handle access rights via ExEnumHandleTable&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;0x222048&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Validate memory checksum&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The remaining three (&lt;code&gt;0x222080&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0x222084&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0x222088&lt;/code&gt;) expose kernel memory scanning and module enumeration. Not the main finding here, but worth noting they exist behind the same weak authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Authentication Mechanism (Or Lack Thereof)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every IOCTL is “protected” by this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A hardcoded 32-bit magic value. No cryptographic verification, no challenge-response, no signature validation. The driver is unobfuscated, so anyone can just read the value out of the binary and call whatever IOCTL they want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Four Layers, None of Them Do Anything&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The full “authentication” stack:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DLL presence check - bypassed by loading any renamed DLL&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Process name whitelist - bypassed by renaming your executable&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PE checksum validation - bypassed by writing 4 bytes with a hex editor&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hardcoded magic number - bypassed by reading the binary&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Vulnerability #1: Arbitrary Process Termination&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IOCTL &lt;code&gt;0x222040&lt;/code&gt; terminates any process on the system:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The IOCTL dispatch routine validates the magic field, then passes just the PID to an internal &lt;code&gt;TerminateProcess&lt;/code&gt; function. That function calls &lt;code&gt;ZwOpenProcess&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;GENERIC_ALL&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;0x10000000&lt;/code&gt;), then &lt;code&gt;ZwTerminateProcess&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;Zw&lt;/code&gt; prefix is important here: &lt;code&gt;Zw*&lt;/code&gt; functions set &lt;code&gt;PreviousMode&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;KernelMode&lt;/code&gt; before entering the system service, which tells the object manager to skip security descriptor checks on the target process entirely. If they’d used the &lt;code&gt;Nt*&lt;/code&gt; variants instead, the call would inherit the original caller’s previous mode and could actually be denied. But with &lt;code&gt;Zw*&lt;/code&gt;, no access check will block the open. &lt;code&gt;GENERIC_ALL&lt;/code&gt; maps to every access right, so the returned handle can do anything. Antivirus, EDR agents, system services, even PPL (Protected Process Light) processes are not safe. &lt;code&gt;ZwTerminateProcess&lt;/code&gt; from kernel mode bypasses PPL protection entirely, which means even processes that Windows itself is supposed to shield from tampering are killable through this driver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Vulnerability #2: Arbitrary Process Protection&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IOCTL &lt;code&gt;0x222004&lt;/code&gt; registers any process as “protected.” The same &lt;code&gt;ObRegisterCallbacks&lt;/code&gt; that strip handle access rights for the game now apply to whatever PID you pass in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t make your process invisible on its own. EDR agents register kernel callbacks (&lt;code&gt;PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine&lt;/code&gt;) to inject their monitoring DLLs during early process creation, before your entry point or even TLS callbacks run. By the time your code can call this IOCTL, the EDR’s hooks are already in your process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What this does block is future handle operations. &lt;code&gt;ObRegisterCallbacks&lt;/code&gt; intercepts both &lt;code&gt;OB_OPERATION_HANDLE_CREATE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;OB_OPERATION_HANDLE_DUPLICATE&lt;/code&gt;, so it covers &lt;code&gt;NtOpenProcess&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NtDuplicateObject&lt;/code&gt;. Important detail: the callback can’t outright deny the open. It strips access bits from the &lt;code&gt;DesiredAccess&lt;/code&gt; mask, so the call still succeeds but returns a handle with reduced permissions (no &lt;code&gt;PROCESS_VM_READ&lt;/code&gt;, no &lt;code&gt;PROCESS_VM_WRITE&lt;/code&gt;, etc). Functionally useless for the caller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That leaves existing handles. Any handles the EDR already holds from before the IOCTL remain valid with their original access rights. But the driver has a solution for that too: IOCTL &lt;code&gt;0x222044&lt;/code&gt; calls &lt;code&gt;ExEnumHandleTable&lt;/code&gt; to walk the system handle table and retroactively strip access rights from existing handles pointing at a target process. So the full protection chain doesn’t even require killing anything:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;0x222004&lt;/code&gt;to register your PID as protected (blocks future handles via&lt;code&gt;ObRegisterCallbacks&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;0x222044&lt;/code&gt;to strip all existing handles to your process (kills current EDR handles via&lt;code&gt;ExEnumHandleTable&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New handles get stripped on creation, existing handles get stripped after the fact. Combine that with Vulnerability #1 to kill the EDR service entirely and you have the complete BYOVD toolkit. If you remember mhyprot2 (the Genshin Impact driver that got weaponized by ransomware groups), this driver has the same kill-then-shield capability exposed through a comparably weak authentication mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;They Don’t Even Use It&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After documenting all of this, I actually launched the game to see the driver in action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It wasn’t running. I checked for a loaded driver, checked for associated services, tried deleting the file to see if anything held a handle. Nothing. The driver just sits in the game directory and never gets loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game process isn’t protected either. No &lt;code&gt;ObRegisterCallbacks&lt;/code&gt; stripping handle access. You can freely open a handle and read/write its memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They ship a kernel driver with hardcoded authentication and full BYOVD capabilities, and they don’t even load it. It just sits on every player’s machine. Good to know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Proof of Concept&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote a PoC demonstrating both vulnerabilities. It bypasses the DLL check by loading one of the required DLLs, opens a handle to the driver, and first registers notepad.exe as a protected process via IOCTL &lt;code&gt;0x222004&lt;/code&gt;. Once protected, it waits for you to press Delete, then terminates it via IOCTL &lt;code&gt;0x222040&lt;/code&gt; with the magic value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full source on GitHub: TowerOfFlaws&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Disclosure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Someone already filed a CVE for this driver (CVE-2025-61155) before I started this work, but the entry has no writeup, no PoC, and no technical details. As far as I can tell, this is the first public documentation of how these vulnerabilities actually work. The driver isn’t actively loaded by the game (reducing immediate attack surface), the techniques involved are straightforward enough that any motivated attacker would find them independently, and if nothing else it’s a good reference for other anti-cheat vendors and driver developers on what not to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Takeaways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;mhyprot2 already proved that anti-cheat drivers make high-value BYOVD targets. This driver has the same capabilities behind weaker authentication, and it shipped anyway. HVCI doesn’t kill obfuscation entirely, but it does break major features like packing and import protection that protectors like VMProtect offer. It’s possible some vendors just see their protected driver fail on HVCI systems and strip it entirely without understanding what specifically broke. Code obfuscation is still possible under HVCI, just more constrained, and if your security model depended on it, you were already in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re shipping a kernel driver and want to make sure it doesn’t end up as someone’s next blog post, feel free to reach out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; There are two main schools of thought in software development about how to build really big, complicated stuff.&lt;lb/&gt;The most prevalent one, these days, is that you gradually evolve the complexity over time. You start small and keep adding to it. &lt;lb/&gt;The other school is that you lay out a huge specification that would fully work through all of the complexity in advance, then build it.&lt;lb/&gt;In a sense, it is the difference between the way an entrepreneur might approach doing a startup versus how we build modern skyscrapers. Evolution versus Engineering.&lt;lb/&gt;I was working in a large company a while ago, and I stumbled on the fact that they had well over 3000 active systems that were covering dozens of lines of business and all of the internal departments. It had evolved this way over fifty years, and included lots of different tech stacks, as well as countless vendors. Viewed as ‘one’ thing it was a pretty shaky house of cards.&lt;lb/&gt;It’s not hard to see that if they had a few really big systems, then a great number of their problems would disappear. The inconsistencies between data, security, operations, quality, and access were huge across all of those disconnected projects. Some systems were up-to-date, some were ancient. Some worked well, some were barely functional. With way fewer systems, a lot of these self-inflicted problems would just go away.&lt;lb/&gt;It’s not that you could cut the combined complexity in half, but more likely that you could bring it down to at least one-tenth of what it is today, if not even better. It would function better, be more reliable, and would be far more resilient to change. It would likely cost far less and require fewer employees as well. All sorts of ugly problems that they have now would just not exist.&lt;lb/&gt;The core difference between the different schools really centers around how to deal with dependencies. &lt;lb/&gt;If you had thousands of little blobs of complexity that were all entirely independent, then getting finished is just a matter of banging out each one by itself until they are all completed. That’s the dream. &lt;lb/&gt;But in practice, very few things in a big ecosystem are actually independent. That’s the problem.&lt;lb/&gt;If you are going to evolve a system, then you ignore these dependencies. Sort them out afterwards, as the complexity grows. It’s faster, and you can get started right away.&lt;lb/&gt;If you were going to design a big system, then these dependencies dictate that design. You have to go through each one and understand them all right away. They change everything from the architecture all the way down to the idioms and style in the code. &lt;lb/&gt;But that means that all of the people working to build up this big system have to interact with each other. Coordinate and communicate. That is a lot of friction that management and the programmers don’t want. They tend to feel like it would all get done faster if they could just go off on their own. And it will, in the short-term.&lt;lb/&gt;If you ignore a dependency and try to fix it later, it will be more expensive. More time, more effort, more thinking. And it will require the same level of coordination that you tried to avoid initially. Slightly worse, in that the time pressures of doing it correctly generally give way to just getting it done quickly, which pumps up the overall artificial complexity. The more hacks you throw at it, the more hacks you will need to hold it together. It spirals out of control. You lose big in the long-term.&lt;lb/&gt;One of the big speed bumps preventing big up-front designs is a general lack of knowledge. Since the foundations like tech stacks, frameworks, and libraries are always changing rapidly these days, there are few accepted best practices, and most issues are incorrectly believed to be subjective. They’re not, of course, but it takes a lot of repeated experience to see that. &lt;lb/&gt;The career path of most application programmers is fairly short. In most enterprises, the majority have five years or less of real in-depth experience, and battle-scared twenty-year+ vets are rare. Mostly, these novices are struggling through early career experiences, not ready yet to deal with the unbounded, massive complexity present in a big design. &lt;lb/&gt;Also, the other side of it is that evolutionary projects are just more fun. I’ve preferred them. You’re not loaded down with all those messy dependencies. Way fewer meetings, so you can just get into the work and see how it goes. Endlessly arguing about fiddly details in a giant spec is draining, made worse if the experience around you is weak. &lt;lb/&gt;Evolutionary projects go very badly sometimes. The larger they grow, the more likely they will derail. And the fun gives way to really bad stress. That severe last-minute panic that comes from knowing that the code doesn't really work as it should, and probably never will. And the longer-term dissatisfaction of having done all that work to ultimately just contribute to the problem, not actually fix it.&lt;lb/&gt;Big up-front designs are often better from a stress perspective. A little slow to start and sometimes slow in the middle, they mostly smooth out the overall development process. You’ve got a lot of work to do, but you’ve also got enough time to do it correctly. So you grind through it, piece by piece, being as attentive to the details as possible. Along the way, you actively look for smarter approaches to compress the work. Reuse, for instance, can shave a ton of code off the table, cut down on testing, and provide stronger certainty that the code will do the right thing in production. &lt;lb/&gt;The fear that big projects will end up producing the wrong thing is often overstated. It’s true for a startup, but entirely untrue for some large business application for a market that’s been around forever. You don’t need to burn a lot of extra time, breaking the work up into tiny fragments, unless you really don’t have a clue what you are building. If you're replacing some other existing system, not only do you have a clue, you usually have a really solid long-term roadmap. Replace the original work and fix its deficiencies. &lt;lb/&gt;There should be some balanced path in the middle somewhere, but I haven’t stumbled across a formal version of it after all these decades. &lt;lb/&gt;We could go first to the dependencies, then come up with reasons why they can be temporarily ignored. You can evolve the next release, but still have a vague big design as a long-term plan. You can refactor the design as you come across new, unexpected dependencies. Change your mind, over and over again, to try to get the evolved works to converge on a solid grand design. Start fast, slow right down, speed up, slow down again, and so forth. The goal is one big giant system to rule them all, but it may just take a while to get there. &lt;lb/&gt;The other point is that the size of the iterations matters, a whole lot. If they are tiny, it is because you are blindly stumbling forward. If you are not blindly stumbling forward, they should be longer, as it is more effective. They don’t have to all be the same size. And you really should stop and take stock after each iteration. The faster people code, the more cleanup that is required. The longer you avoid cleaning it up, the worse it gets, on basically an exponential scale. If you run forward like crazy and never stop, the working environment will be such a swamp that it will all grind to an abrupt stop. This is true in building anything, or even cooking in a restaurant. Speed is a tradeoff.&lt;lb/&gt;Evolution is the way to avoid getting bogged down in engineering, but engineering is the way to ensure that the thing you build really does what it is supposed to do. Engineering is slow, but spinning way out of control is a heck of a lot slower. Evolution is obviously more dynamic, but it is also more chaotic, and you have to continually accept that you’ve gone down a bad path and need to backtrack. That is hard to admit sometimes. For most systems, there are parts that really need to be engineered, and parts that can just be allowed to evolve. The more random the evolutionary path, the more stuff you need to throw away and redo. Wobbling is always expensive. Nature gets away with this by having millions of species, but we really only have one development project, so it isn’t particularly convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Things UNIX can do atomically 2010/01/06&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a catalog of things UNIX-like/POSIX-compliant operating systems can do atomically, making them useful as building blocks for thread-safe and multi-process-safe programs without mutexes or read/write locks. The list is by no means exhaustive and I expect it to be updated frequently for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The philosophy here is to let the kernel do as much work as possible. At my most pessimistic, I trust the kernel developers more than a trust myself. More practically, it’s stupid to spend CPU time locking around an operation that’s already atomic. Added 2010-01-07.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Operating on a pathname&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The operations below are best left to local filesystems. More than a few people have written in crying foul if any of these techniques are used on an NFS mount. True. When there are multiple kernels involved, the kernel can’t very well take care of all the locking for us. Added 2010-01-06.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;mv -T &amp;lt;oldsymlink&amp;gt; &amp;lt;newsymlink&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;atomically changes the target of&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;newsymlink&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;to the directory pointed to by&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;oldsymlink&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;and is indispensable when deploying new code. Updated 2010-01-06: both operands are symlinks. (So this isn’t a system call, it’s still useful.)&lt;del rend="overstrike"&gt;A reader pointed out that&lt;/del&gt;Deleted 2010-01-06:&lt;code&gt;ln -Tfs &amp;lt;directory&amp;gt; &amp;lt;symlink&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;accomplishes the same thing without the second symlink. Added 2010-01-06.&lt;code&gt;strace(1)&lt;/code&gt;shows that&lt;code&gt;ln -Tfs &amp;lt;directory&amp;gt; &amp;lt;symlink&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;actually calls&lt;code&gt;symlink(2)&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;unlink(2)&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;symlink(2)&lt;/code&gt;once more, disqualifying it from this page.&lt;code&gt;mv -T &amp;lt;oldsymlink&amp;gt; &amp;lt;newsymlink&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;ends up calling&lt;code&gt;rename(2)&lt;/code&gt;which can atomically replace&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;newsymlink&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Caveat 2013-01-07: this does not apply to Mac OS X, whose&lt;code&gt;mv(1)&lt;/code&gt;doesn’t call&lt;code&gt;rename(2)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;code&gt;mv(1)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;link(oldpath, newpath)&lt;/code&gt;creates a new hard link called&lt;code&gt;newpath&lt;/code&gt;pointing to the same inode as&lt;code&gt;oldpath&lt;/code&gt;and increases the link count by one. This will fail with the error code&lt;code&gt;EEXIST&lt;/code&gt;if&lt;code&gt;newpath&lt;/code&gt;already exists, making this a useful mechanism for locking a file amongst threads or processes that can all agree upon the name&lt;code&gt;newpath&lt;/code&gt;. I prefer this technique for whole-file locking because the lock is visible to&lt;code&gt;ls(1)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;code&gt;link(2)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;symlink(oldpath, newpath)&lt;/code&gt;operates very much like&lt;code&gt;link(2)&lt;/code&gt;but creates a symbolic link at a new inode rather than a hard link to the same inode. Symbolic links can point to directories, which hard links cannot, making them a perfect analogy to&lt;code&gt;link(2)&lt;/code&gt;when locking entire directories. This will fail with the error code&lt;code&gt;EEXIST&lt;/code&gt;if&lt;code&gt;newpath&lt;/code&gt;already exists, making this a perfect analogy to&lt;code&gt;link(2)&lt;/code&gt;that works for directories, too. Be careful of symbolic links whose target inode has been removed ("dangling" symbolic links) —&lt;code&gt;open(2)&lt;/code&gt;will fail with the error code&lt;code&gt;ENOENT&lt;/code&gt;. It should be mentioned that inodes are a finite resource (this particular machine has 1,245,184 inodes).&lt;code&gt;symlink(2)&lt;/code&gt;. Added 2010-01-07&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rename(oldpath, newpath)&lt;/code&gt;can change a pathname atomically, provided&lt;code&gt;oldpath&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;newpath&lt;/code&gt;are on the same filesystem. This will fail with the error code&lt;code&gt;ENOENT&lt;/code&gt;if&lt;code&gt;oldpath&lt;/code&gt;does not exist, enabling interprocess locking much like&lt;code&gt;link(oldpath, newpath)&lt;/code&gt;above. I find this technique more natural when the files in question will be&lt;code&gt;unlink&lt;/code&gt;ed later.&lt;code&gt;rename(2)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;open(pathname, O_CREAT | O_EXCL, 0644)&lt;/code&gt;creates and opens a new file. (Don’t forget to set the mode in the third argument!)&lt;code&gt;O_EXCL&lt;/code&gt;instructs this to fail with the error code&lt;code&gt;EEXIST&lt;/code&gt;if&lt;code&gt;pathname&lt;/code&gt;exists. This is a useful way to decide which process should handle a task: whoever successfully creates the file.&lt;code&gt;open(2)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir(dirname, 0755)&lt;/code&gt;creates a new directory but fails with the error code&lt;code&gt;EEXIST&lt;/code&gt;if&lt;code&gt;dirname&lt;/code&gt;exists. This provides for directories the same mechanism&lt;code&gt;link(2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;open(2)&lt;/code&gt;with&lt;code&gt;O_EXCL&lt;/code&gt;provides for files.&lt;code&gt;mkdir(2)&lt;/code&gt;. Added 2010-01-06; edited 2013-01-07.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Operating on a file descriptor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;fcntl(fd, F_GETLK, &amp;amp;lock)&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;fcntl(fd, F_SETLK, &amp;amp;lock)&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;fcntl(fd, F_SETLKW, &amp;amp;lock)&lt;/code&gt;allow cooperating processes to lock regions of a file to serialize their access.&lt;code&gt;lock&lt;/code&gt;is of type&lt;code&gt;struct flock&lt;/code&gt;and describes the type of lock and the region being locked.&lt;code&gt;F_SETLKW&lt;/code&gt;is particularly useful as it blocks the calling process until the lock is acquired. There is a “mandatory locking” mode but Linux’s implementation is unreliable as it’s subject to a race condition.&lt;code&gt;fcntl(2)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;fcntl(fd, F_GETLEASE)&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;fcntl(fd, F_SETLEASE, lease)&lt;/code&gt;ask the kernel to notify the calling process with&lt;code&gt;SIGIO&lt;/code&gt;when another process&lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt;s or&lt;code&gt;truncate&lt;/code&gt;s the file referred to by&lt;code&gt;fd&lt;/code&gt;. When that signals arrives, the lease needs to be removed by&lt;code&gt;fcntl(fd, F_SETLEASE, F_UNLCK)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;code&gt;fcntl(fd, F_NOTIFY, arg)&lt;/code&gt;is similar but doesn’t block other processes, so it isn’t useful for synchronization.&lt;code&gt;fcntl(2)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;mmap(0, length, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0)&lt;/code&gt;returns a pointer from which a file’s contents can be read and written by normal memory operations. By making frequent use of&lt;code&gt;msync(addr, length, MS_INVALIDATE)&lt;/code&gt;, data written in this manner can be shared between processes that both map the same file.&lt;code&gt;mmap(2)&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;msync(2)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

GCC Atomic Builtins.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something I should add to my repertoire? Race condition? Let me know at r@rcrowley.org or @rcrowley and I’ll fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new bill in the New York state legislature would require news organizations to label AI-generated material and mandate that humans review any such content before publication. On Monday, Senator Patricia Fahy (D-Albany) and Assemblymember Nily Rozic (D-NYC) introduced the bill, called The New York Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Requirements in News Act — The NY FAIR News Act for short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the center of the news industry, New York has a strong interest in preserving journalism and protecting the workers who produce it,” said Rozic in a statement announcing the bill.&lt;/p&gt;A closer look at the bill shows a few regulations, mostly centered around AI transparency, both for the public and in the newsroom. For one, the law would demand that news organizations put disclaimers on any published content that is “substantially composed, authored, or created through the use of generative artificial intelligence.”&lt;p&gt;AI disclaimers for readers have been hotly debated in the news industry, with some critics arguing that such labels alienate audiences, even when generative AI is only used as an assistive tool. The bill contains a carve-out that would allow copyrightable material to be excluded from the law. (The U.S. Copyright Office has ruled that works solely generated by AI systems are not eligible for copyright, but allows leeway for works that show signs of “human authorship.”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill also requires that news organizations disclose to journalists and other media professionals in their newsrooms when AI is being used and how. Any news content created using generative AI must also be reviewed by a human employee “with editorial control” before publication. That goes not just for news articles but also for audio, images, and other visuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the bill contains language that requires news organizations to create safeguards that protect confidential material — mainly, information about sources — from being accessed by AI technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State lawmakers highlighted two main reasons for proposing the NY FAIR News Act. First, they say, AI-generated content may be “false or misleading.” Second, they argue, AI-generated content “plagiarizes” by deriving content from original sources “without permission or proper citation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps one of the industries at most risk from the use of artificial intelligence is journalism and as a result, the public’s trust and confidence in accurate news reporting,” said Sen. Fahy in a statement. “More than 76% of Americans are concerned about AI stealing or reproducing journalism and local news stories.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed bill was announced with broad endorsements from unions across the news industry, including WGA-East, SAG-AFTRA and the DGA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Sheehan, a spokesperson for the NewsGuild of New York, confirmed that the NewsGuild has been meeting with this labor coalition to discuss shared concerns around AI adoption and working to get the bill off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;Notably, the bill would cement some labor protections for newsroom workers — including restrictions on firing journalists or reducing their work, pay, or benefits due to generative AI adoption. Similar language has been negotiated into individual newsroom union contracts across the country over the past couple of years.&lt;p&gt;In December, the NewsGuild launched a nationwide campaign called “News Not Slop” to advocate for more guardrails on AI usage in newsrooms. In New York City, the Business Insider union held a rally in the Financial District to protest an editorial pilot that was publishing AI-generated news stories with an “AI byline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our union is deeply concerned about media companies implementing artificial intelligence in ways that damage the credibility of our members’ journalism,” Sheehan said, “as well as the impact such technology has had and will have on jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2024, Apple signed a deal with Taboola to serve ads in its app, notably Apple News. John Gruber, writing in Daring Fireball said at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you told me that the ads in Apple News have been sold by Taboola for the last few years, I’d have said, “Oh, that makes sense.” Because the ads in Apple News — at least the ones I see1 — already look like chumbox Taboola ads. Even worse, they’re incredibly repetitious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use Apple News to keep up on topics that I don’t find in sources I pay for (The Guardian and The New York Times). But there’s no way I’m going to pay the exorbitant price Apple wants for Apple News+ – £13 – because, while you get more publications, you still get ads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And those ads have gotten worse recently. Many if not most of them look like and probably are scams. Here are a few examples from Apple News today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are three ads that are scammy; the first two were clearly generated by AI, and the third may have been created by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why are they scams? When I searched domain information for the domains, I found that they were registered very recently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Domain Name: MUSTYLEVO.COM&lt;lb/&gt; Registry Domain ID: 3059688301_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.gname.com&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar URL: http://www.gname.com&lt;lb/&gt; Updated Date: 2026-02-04T07:23:58Z&lt;lb/&gt; Creation Date: 2026-01-21T07:23:43Z&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Domain Name: SOLVERACO.COM&lt;lb/&gt; Registry Domain ID: 3045027870_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar WHOIS Server: grs-whois.hichina.com&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar URL: http://wanwang.aliyun.com&lt;lb/&gt; Updated Date: 2025-12-05T06:10:51Z&lt;lb/&gt; Creation Date: 2025-12-05T06:07:40Z&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Domain Name: SHIYAATELIER.COM&lt;lb/&gt; Registry Domain ID: 3037972202_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.name.com&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar URL: http://www.name.com&lt;lb/&gt; Updated Date: 2025-11-12T06:47:14Z&lt;lb/&gt; Creation Date: 2025-11-12T06:47:13Z&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This recent registration doesn’t necessarily mean they are scams, but they don’t inspire much confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s one example. This ad from Tidenox, whose website says I am retiring, showing a photo of an elderly woman, who says, “For 26 years, Tidenox has been port of your journey in creating earth and comfort at home.” The image of the retiring owner is probably made by AI. (Update: someone on Hacker News pointed out the partly masked Google Gemini logo on the bottom right. I hadn’t spotted that, in part because I don’t use any AI image generation tools.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These fake “going out of business ads” have been around for a few years, and even the US Better Business Bureau warns about them, as they take peoples’ money then shut down. Does Apple care? Does Taboola care? Does Apple care that Taboola serves ads like this? My guess: no, no, and no.&lt;/p&gt;
