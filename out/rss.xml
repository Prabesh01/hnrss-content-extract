  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally posted: 2025-03-16. View source code for this page here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, I've found myself using DuckDB more and more for data processing, to the point where I now use it almost exclusively, usually from within Python.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're moving towards a simpler world where most tabular data can be processed on a single large machine1 and the era of clusters is coming to an end for all but the largest datasets.2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post sets out some of my favourite features of DuckDB that set it apart from other SQL-based tools. In a nutshell, it's simple to install, ergonomic, fast, and more fully featured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An earlier post explains why I favour SQL over other APIs such as Polars, pandas or dplyr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DuckDB is an open source in-process SQL engine that is optimised for analytics queries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The performance difference of analytics-optimised engines (OLAP) vs. transactions-optimised engines (OLTP) should not be underestimated. A query running in DuckDB can be 100 or even 1,000 times faster than exactly the same query running in (say) SQLite or Postgres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A core use-case of DuckDB is where you have one or more large datasets on disk in formats like &lt;code&gt;csv&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;parquet&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; which you want to batch process.  You may want to perform cleaning, joins, aggregation, derivation of new columns - that sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you can also use DuckDB for many other simpler tasks like viewing a csv file from the command line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DuckDB consistently benchmarks as one of the fastest data processing engines. The benchmarks I've seen3 show there's not much in it between the leading open source engines - which at the moment seem to be polars, DuckDB, DataFusion, Spark and Dask. Spark and Dask can be competitive on large data, but slower on small data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DuckDB itself is a single precompiled binary. In Python, it can be &lt;code&gt;pip install&lt;/code&gt;ed with no dependencies.  This makes it a joy to install compared to other more heavyweight options like Spark.  Combined with &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;, you can stand up a fresh DuckDB Python environment from nothing in less than a second - see here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its speed and almost-zero startup time, DuckDB is ideally suited for CI and testing of data engineering pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically this has been fiddly and running a large suite of tests in e.g. Apache Spark has been time consuming and frustrating. Now it's much simpler to set up the test environment, and there's less scope for differences between it and your production pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This simplicity and speed also applies to writing new SQL, and getting syntax right before running it on a large dataset. Historically I have found this annoying in engines like Spark (where it takes a few seconds to start Spark in local mode), or even worse when you're forced to run queries in a proprietary tool like AWS Athena.4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's even a DuckDB UI with autocomplete - see here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DuckDB team has implemented a wide range of innovations in its SQL dialect that make it a joy to use. See the following blog posts 1 2 3 4 5 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of my favourites are the &lt;code&gt;EXCLUDE&lt;/code&gt; keyword, and the &lt;code&gt;COLUMNS&lt;/code&gt; keyword which allows you to select and regex-replace a subset of columns.5  I also like &lt;code&gt;QUALIFY&lt;/code&gt; and the aggregate modifiers on window functions, see here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another is the ability to function chain, like &lt;code&gt;first_name.lower().trim()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can query data directly from files, including on s3, or on the web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example to query a folder of parquet files:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;select *from read_parquet('path/to/*.parquet')&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;or even (on CORS enabled files) you can run SQL directly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;select *from read_parquet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/2015_flights.parquet')limit 2;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click here to try this query yourself in the DuckDB web shell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the easiest ways to cause problems in your data pipelines is to fail to be strict about incoming data types from untyped formats such as csv. DuckDB provides lots of options here - see here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many data pipelines effectively boil down to a long sequence of CTEs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;WITHinput_data AS (SELECT * FROM read_parquet('...')),step_1 AS (SELECT ... FROM input_data JOIN ...),step_2 AS (SELECT ... FROM step_1)SELECT ... FROM step_2;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When developing a pipeline like this, we often want to inspect what's happened at each step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Python, we can write&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;input_data = duckdb.sql("SELECT * FROM read_parquet('...')")step_1 = duckdb.sql("SELECT ... FROM input_data JOIN ...")step_2 = duckdb.sql("SELECT ... FROM step_1")final = duckdb.sql("SELECT ... FROM step_2;")&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes it easy to inspect what the data looks like at &lt;code&gt;step_2&lt;/code&gt; with no performance loss, since these steps will be executed lazily when they're run all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also facilitates easier testing of SQL in CI, since each step can be an independently-tested function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DuckDB offers full ACID compliance for bulk data operations, which sets it apart from other analytical data systems - see here. You can listen to more about this on in this podcast, transcribed here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very interesting new development, making DuckDB potentially a suitable replacement for lakehouse formats such as Iceberg or Delta lake for medium scale data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A longstanding difficulty with data processing engines has been the difficulty in writing high performance user defined functions (UDFs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in PySpark, you will generally get best performance by writing custom Scala, compiling to a JAR, and registering it with Spark. But this is cumbersome and in practice, you will encounter a lot of issues around Spark version compatibility and security restrictions environments such as DataBricks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In DuckDB high performance custom UDFs can be written in C++. Whilst writing these functions is certainly not trivial, DuckDB community extensions offers a low-friction way of distributing the code. Community extensions can be installed almost instantly with a single command such as &lt;code&gt;INSTALL h3 FROM community&lt;/code&gt; to install hierarchical hexagonal indexing for geospatial data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team provide documentation as a single markdown file so it can easily be provided to an LLM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My top tip: if you load this file in your code editor, and use code folding, it's easy to copy the parts of the documentation you need into context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of this blog post is based on my experience supporting multiple SQL dialects in Splink, an open source library for record linkage at scale. We've found that transitioning towards recommending DuckDB as the default backend choice has increased adoption of the library and significantly reduced the amount of problems faced by users, even for large linkage tasks, whilst speeding up workloads very substantially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've also found it's hugely increased the simplicity and speed of developing and testing new features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pg_duckdb&lt;/code&gt; allows you to embed the DuckDB computation engine within Postgres.&lt;p&gt;The later in particular seems potentially extremely powerful, enabling Postgres to be simultanouesly optimised for analytics and transactional processing. I think it's likely to see widespread adoption, especially after they iron out a few of the current shortcomings around enabling and optimising the use of Postgres indexes and pushing up filters up to PostGres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a long-time Spark user, I am glad to be rid of needing to know lots of intricate configuration options for Spark tuning ��↩&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 192 core processors such as this available in the cloud and only costing around $15,000, the complexity of clusters can be avoided unless you have genuinely huge data. It's also worth noting there is actually now a distributed version of DuckDB, see here. ↩&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance see here, here and here/discussion. ↩&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, Athena is a very powerful and useful tool. I just find it frustrating for developing and quickly iterating queries of moderate complexity. An example of why it's easier in DuckDB is this kind of reprex. ↩&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, we can select all columns prefixed with &lt;code&gt;emp_&lt;/code&gt; and rename to remove the prefix as follows: &lt;code&gt;SELECT COLUMNS('emp_(.*)') AS '\1'&lt;/code&gt; ↩&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just the Browser helps you remove AI features, telemetry data reporting, sponsored content, product integrations, and other annoyances from desktop web browsers. The goal is to give you "just the browser" and nothing else, using hidden settings in web browsers intended for companies and other organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project includes configuration files for popular web browsers, documentation for installing and modifying them, and easy installation scripts. Everything is open-source on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Get started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The setup script can install the configuration files in a few clicks. You can also follow the manual guides for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows: Open a PowerShell prompt as Administrator. You can do this by right-clicking the Windows button in the taskbar, then selecting the "Terminal (Admin)" or "PowerShell (Admin)" menu option. Next, copy the below command, paste it into the window (&lt;code&gt;Ctrl+V&lt;/code&gt;), and press the Enter/Return key:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp; ([scriptblock]::Create((irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corbindavenport/just-the-browser/main/main.ps1")))
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mac and Linux: Search for the Terminal in your applications list and open it. Next, copy the below command, paste it into the window (&lt;code&gt;Ctrl+V&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Cmd+V&lt;/code&gt;), and press the Enter/Return key:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corbindavenport/just-the-browser/main/main.sh)"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Download web browsers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start here if you don't have your preferred web browser installed. You can install the configuration files afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Got a question? Check here first, and if you still need help, create an issue on GitHub or join the Discord.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What features or settings are changed?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just the Browser aims to remove the following functionality from popular web browsers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Most AI features: Features that use generative AI models, either on-device or in the cloud, like Copilot in Microsoft Edge or tab group suggestions in Firefox. The main exception is page translation in Firefox.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shopping features: Price tracking, coupon codes, loan integrations, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sponsored or third-party content: Suggested articles on the New Tab Page, sponsored site suggestions, etc.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Default browser reminders: Pop-ups or other prompts that ask you to change the default web browser.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;First-run experiences and data import prompts: Browser welcome screens and their related prompts to import data automatically from other web browsers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Telemetry: Data collection by web browsers. Crash reporting is left enabled if the browser (such as Firefox) supports it as a separate option.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Startup boost: Features that allow web browsers to start with the operating system without explicit permission.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exact list of features modified for each browser can be found on the pages for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Can I change or remove the settings?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. The browser guides include steps for removing the configurations, and the automated script can also do it. The browser guides explain each setting, so you can add, remove, or modify the files before you install them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Which web browsers are supported?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just the Browser has configuration files and setup scripts for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox. However, Chrome on Linux and Edge on Linux are not currently supported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Can I install this on my phone or tablet?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not yet. See the issues for Android support and iOS/iPadOS support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Is this modifying the web browser?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. Just the Browser uses group policies that are fully supported by web browsers, usually intended for IT departments in companies or other large organizations. No applications or executable files are modified in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Do the settings stay applied?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, as long as the web browsers continue to support the settings used in the configuration files. Web browsers occasionally add, remove, or replace the settings options, so if the custom configuration breaks, try installing the latest available version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Does this install ad blockers for me?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. If you want one, try uBlock Origin or uBlock Origin Lite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why does my browser say it's managed by an organization?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The group policy settings used by Just the Browser are intended for PCs managed by companies and other large organizations. Browsers like Microsoft Edge and Firefox will display a message like "Your browser is being managed by your organization" to explain why some settings are disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How do I know the settings are applied?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can open &lt;code&gt;about:policies&lt;/code&gt; in Firefox or &lt;code&gt;chrome://policy&lt;/code&gt; in Chrome and Edge to see a list of active group policy settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why not just use an alternative web browser?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can do that! However, switching to alternative web browsers like Vivaldi, SeaMonkey, Waterfox, or LibreWolf can have other downsides. They are not always available on the same platforms, and they can lag behind mainstream browsers in security updates and engine upgrades. Just the Browser aims to make mainstream web browsers more tolerable, while still retaining their existing benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;psc (ps container) is a fast process scanner that uses eBPF iterators and Google CEL to query system state with precision and full container context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;psc uses eBPF iterators to read process and file descriptor information directly from kernel data structures. This approach is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fast: eBPF iterators are highly efficient compared to the proc filesystem, where traditional tooling spends most of its time executing system calls&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Complete: Access kernel information not traditionally exposed through &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;. I plan to add also a way to access certain fields of the&lt;code&gt;task_struct&lt;/code&gt;on demand for advanced use, but this is just an idea&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tamper-resistant: Bypasses the &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;filesystem entirely, providing visibility that cannot be subverted by userland rootkits or&lt;code&gt;LD_PRELOAD&lt;/code&gt;tricks&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional Linux tools like &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lsof&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ss&lt;/code&gt; are powerful but inflexible. They output fixed formats that require extensive piping through &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Traditional: Find nginx processes owned by root
ps aux | grep nginx | grep root | grep -v grep

# psc: Express exactly what you mean
psc 'process.name == "nginx" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; process.user == "root"'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Traditional: Find processes with established connections on port 443
ss -tnp | grep ESTAB | grep :443 | awk '{print $6}' | cut -d'"' -f2

# psc: One clear expression
psc 'socket.state == established &amp;amp;&amp;amp; socket.dstPort == uint(443)'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;psc uses the Common Expression Language (CEL) to filter processes. CEL expressions read almost like natural language, making your scripts self-documenting and maintainable. No more deciphering complex pipelines of &lt;code&gt;grep | awk | sed | xargs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-o&lt;/code&gt; flag lets you output exactly the fields you need, eliminating post-processing entirely:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;psc 'socket.state == listen' -o process.name,socket.srcPort&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Output presets are also available to quickly print common information:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;psc 'socket.type == tcp &amp;amp;&amp;amp; socket.dstPort == uint(443)' -o sockets &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional tools have no concept of containers. Getting container information requires parsing cgroup paths, querying container runtimes, and correlating PIDs manually:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Traditional: Find containerized processes (fragile, incomplete)
ps aux | xargs -I{} sh -c 'cat /proc/{}/cgroup 2&amp;gt;/dev/null | grep -q docker &amp;amp;&amp;amp; echo {}'

# psc: Native container support
psc 'container.runtime == docker'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;psc extracts container context (ID, name, image, runtime, labels) automatically for Docker, containerd, CRI-O, and Podman. Debug any container's processes, files, and network connections directly from the host:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Show all processes in a specific container
psc 'container.name == "my-app"' --tree

# Find containers running as root
psc 'container.runtime == docker &amp;amp;&amp;amp; process.user == "root"'

# List containers with their images
psc 'container.id != ""' -o process.pid,process.name,container.name,container.image&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux kernel 5.8 or later (eBPF iterators were introduced in this version)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Go 1.25 or later&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clang and LLVM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;libbpf development headers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux kernel headers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;bpftool (for generating vmlinux.h)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Debian/Ubuntu:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install clang llvm libbpf-dev linux-headers-$(uname -r) linux-tools-$(uname -r)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Fedora/RHEL:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo dnf install clang llvm libbpf-devel kernel-devel bpftool&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Generate vmlinux.h (required once per kernel version)
make vmlinux

# Build the binary
make build&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or manually:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bpftool btf dump file /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux format c &amp;gt; bpf/vmlinux.h
go generate ./...
go build -o psc&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo make install&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;psc requires root privileges to load eBPF programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# List all processes
sudo psc

# List all processes as a tree
sudo psc --tree&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pass a CEL expression as the first argument to filter processes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Filter by process name
psc 'process.name == "nginx"'

# Filter by user
psc 'process.user == "root"'

# Filter by command line content
psc 'process.cmdline.contains("--config")'

# Filter by PID range
psc 'process.pid &amp;gt; 1000 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; process.pid &amp;lt; 2000'

# Combine conditions
psc 'process.name == "bash" || process.name == "zsh"'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Show only containerized processes
psc 'container.id != ""'

# Filter by container runtime (constants: docker, containerd, crio, podman)
psc 'container.runtime == docker'

# Filter by container name
psc 'container.name == "nginx"'

# Filter by container image
psc 'container.image.contains("nginx:latest")'

# Show as tree to see container process hierarchy
psc 'container.runtime == docker' --tree&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding why a process exists often requires looking at its open file descriptors and network connections:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Find processes with listening TCP sockets
psc 'socket.type == tcp &amp;amp;&amp;amp; socket.state == listen'

# Find processes with established connections
psc 'socket.state == established'

# Find processes connected to a specific port
psc 'socket.dstPort == uint(443)'

# Find processes using Unix sockets
psc 'socket.family == unix'

# Find processes with files open in /etc
psc 'file.path.startsWith("/etc")'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Process fields (&lt;code&gt;process.X&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;- Process name (string)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;pid&lt;/code&gt;- Process ID (int)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;ppid&lt;/code&gt;- Parent process ID (int)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;tid&lt;/code&gt;- Thread ID (int)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;euid&lt;/code&gt;- Effective user ID (int)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;ruid&lt;/code&gt;- Real user ID (int)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;suid&lt;/code&gt;- Saved set-user-ID (int)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt;- Username (string)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;cmdline&lt;/code&gt;- Full command line (string)&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-o&lt;/code&gt; flag lets you specify exactly which fields to display. You can use presets for common use cases or specify individual fields.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Presets:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;sockets&lt;/code&gt;- Process info + full socket details (family, type, state, addresses, ports)&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;containers&lt;/code&gt;- Process info + container details (name, image, runtime)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;network&lt;/code&gt;- Compact network view (pid, name, type, state, ports)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Use a preset
psc 'socket.state == listen' -o sockets
psc 'container.id != ""' -o containers

# Or specify individual fields
psc -o process.pid,process.name,process.user
psc 'socket.state == listen' -o process.pid,process.name,socket.srcPort,socket.state&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the output includes file/socket fields and the filter matches multiple files per process, each match gets its own row:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ psc 'socket.state == listen' -o network

PID      NAME      TYPE   STATE    SRCPORT   DSTPORT
1234     nginx     tcp    LISTEN   80        0

    &lt;p&gt;Find all web servers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;psc 'process.name == "nginx" || process.name == "apache2" || process.name == "httpd"'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find processes listening on privileged ports:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;psc 'socket.state == listen &amp;amp;&amp;amp; socket.srcPort &amp;lt; uint(1024)'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find processes in a different network namespace (useful for container/pod inspection):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;psc 'process.namespaces.net != uint(4026531840)' -o process.pid,process.name,process.namespaces.net&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Show capabilities for privileged processes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;psc 'process.euid == 0' -o process.pid,process.name,process.capabilities.effective,process.capabilities.permitted&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find processes that elevated privileges via SUID binaries (real UID differs from effective UID):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;psc 'process.ruid != process.euid'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find processes with connections to external services:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;psc 'socket.state == established &amp;amp;&amp;amp; socket.dstPort == uint(443)'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Show network connections with custom columns:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;psc 'socket.state == established' -o process.pid,process.name,socket.srcPort,socket.dstPort,socket.dstAddr&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Think back, if you will, to the works of art you created at age twelve or thirteen. For many, perhaps most of us, our output at that stage of adolescence amounted to directionless doodles, chaotic comics, and a few unsteady-at-best school projects. But then, most of us didn’t grow up to be Michelangelo. In the late fourteen-eighties, when that towering Renaissance artist was still what we would now call a “tween,” he painted The Torment of Saint Anthony, a depiction of the titular religious figure beset by demons in the desert. Though based on a widely known engraving, it nevertheless shows evidence of rapidly advancing technique, inspiration, and even creativity — especially when placed under the infrared scanner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For about half a millennium, The Torment of Saint Anthony wasn’t thought to have been painted by Michelangelo. As explained in the video from Inspiraggio just below, when the painting sold at Sotheby’s in 2008, the buyer took it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for examination and cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Beneath the layers of dirt accumulated over the centuries,” says the narrator, “a very particular color palette appeared. “The tones, the blends, the way the human figure was treated: all of it began to resemble the style Michelangelo would use years later in none other than the Sistine Chapel.” Infrared reflectography subsequently turned up pentimenti, or correction marks, a common indication that “a painting is not a copy, but an original work created with artistic freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas that first bet big on the provenance of The Torment of Saint Anthony. Its newly hired director purchased the painting after turning up “not a single convincing argument against the attribution.” Thus acquired, it became “the only painting by Michelangelo located anywhere in the Americas, and also just one of four easel paintings attributed to him throughout his entire career,” during most of which he disparaged oil painting itself. About a decade later, and after further analysis, the art historian Giorgio Bonsanti put his considerable authority behind a definitive confirmation that it is indeed the work of the young Michelangelo. There remain doubters, of course, and even the notoriously uncompromising artist himself may have considered it an immature work unworthy of his name. But who else could have created an immature work like it?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Astro Technology Company — the company behind the Astro web framework — is joining Cloudflare! Adoption of the Astro web framework continues to double every year, and Astro 6 is right around the corner. With Cloudflare’s support, we’ll have more resources and fewer distractions to continue our mission to build the best framework for content-driven websites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What this means for Astro:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Astro stays open-source and MIT-licensed&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Astro continues to be actively maintained&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Astro continues to support a wide set of deployment targets, not just Cloudflare&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Astro’s open governance and current roadmap remain in place.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All full-time employees of The Astro Technology Company are now employees of Cloudflare, and will continue to work on Astro full-time.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Astro started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2021, Astro was born out of frustration. The trend at the time was that every website should be architected as an application, and then shipped to the user’s browser to render. This was not very performant, and we’ve spent the last decade coming up with more and more complex solutions to solve for that performance problem. SSR, ISR, RSC, PPR, TTI optimizations via code-splitting, tree-shaking, lazy-loading, all to generate a blocking double-data hydration payload from a pre-warmed server running halfway around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our mission to design a web framework specifically for building websites — what we call content-driven websites, to better distinguish from data-driven, stateful web applications — resonated. Now Astro is downloaded almost 1,000,000 times per week, and has been used by 100,000s of developers to build fast, beautiful websites. Today you’ll find Astro all over the web, powering major websites and even entire developer platforms for companies like Webflow, Wix, Microsoft, and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Along the way, we also tried to grow a business. In 2021 we raised some money and formed The Astro Technology Company. Our larger vision was that a well-designed framework like Astro could sit at the center of a massive developer platform, with optional hosted primitives (database, storage, analytics) designed in lockstep with the framework.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We were never able to realize this vision. Attempts to introduce paid, hosted primitives into our ecosystem fell flat, and rarely justified their own existence. We considered going more directly after first-class hosting or content management for Astro, but knew we’d spend much of our time playing catchup to well-funded, savvy competitors. We kept exploring different ideas, but nothing clicked with users the same way Astro did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It wasn’t all bad. Astro DB (our attempt to build a hosted database product for Astro projects) eventually evolved into the open, built-in Astro database client that still lives in core today. Our exploration into building an e-commerce layer with Astro was eventually open-sourced. It was rewarding work, but over the years the distraction took its toll. Each attempt at a new paid product or offering took myself and others on the project away from working on the Astro framework that developers were using and loving every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Returning to Focus&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year, Dane (Cloudflare CTO) and I began to talk more seriously about the future of the web. Those conversations quickly grew into something bigger: What does the next decade look like? How do frameworks adapt to a world of AI coding and agents?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It became clear that even as web technologies evolve, content remains at the center. We realized that we’ve each been working toward this same vision from different angles:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cloudflare has been solving it from the infrastructure side: betting on a platform that is global by default, with fast startup, low latency, and security built-in.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Astro has been solving it from the framework side: betting on a web framework that makes it easy to build sites that are fast by default, without overcomplicating things.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The overlap is obvious. By working together, Cloudflare gives us the backing we need to keep innovating for our users. Now we can stop spending cycles worrying about building a business on top of Astro, and start focusing 100% on the code, with a shared vision to move the web forward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cloudflare ❤️ Astro&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has been a long-time sponsor and champion of Astro. They have a proven track record of supporting great open-source projects like Astro, TanStack, and Hono without trying to capture or lock anything down. Staying open to all was a non-negotiable requirement for both us and for Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is why Astro will remain free, open-source, and MIT-licensed. We will continue to run our project in the open, with an open governance model for contributors and an open community roadmap that anyone can participate in. We remain fully committed to maintaining Astro as a platform-agnostic framework, meaning we will continue to support and improve deployments for all targets—not just Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Cloudflare’s resources and support, we can now return our focus fully towards building the best web framework for content-driven websites. The web is changing fast, and the bar keeps rising: performance, scale, reliability, and a better experience for the teams shipping content on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll see that focus reflected across our roadmap, as we prepare for the upcoming Astro 6 release (beta out now!) and our 2026 roadmap. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thank you&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to extend a huge thank you to the agencies, companies, sponsors, partners, and theme authors who chose to work with us over the years. Thank you to our initial investors — Haystack, Gradient, Uncorrelated, Lightspeed — without whom Astro likely wouldn’t exist. Thank you to everyone in our open source community who continues to help make Astro better every day. And finally, thank you to everyone who uses Astro and puts their trust in us to help them build for the web.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2026-01-16&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Cursor's latest "browser experiment" implied success without evidence&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On January 14th 2026, Cursor published a blog post titled "Scaling long-running autonomous coding" (https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the blog post, they talk about their experiments with running "coding agents autonomously for weeks" with the explicit goal of&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;understand[ing] how far we can push the frontier of agentic coding for projects that typically take human teams months to complete&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They talk about some approaches they tried, why they think those failed, and how to address the difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally they arrived at a point where something "solved most of our coordination problems and let us scale to very large projects without any single agent", which then led to this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To test this system, we pointed it at an ambitious goal: building a web browser from scratch. The agents ran for close to a week, writing over 1 million lines of code across 1,000 files. You can explore the source code on GitHub (https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where things get a bit murky and unclear. They claim "Despite the codebase size, new agents can still understand it and make meaningful progress" and "Hundreds of workers run concurrently, pushing to the same branch with minimal conflicts", but they never actually say if this is successful or not, is it actually working? Can you run this browser yourself? We don't know and they never say explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After this, they embed the following video:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And below it, they say "While it might seem like a simple screenshot, building a browser from scratch is extremely difficult.".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;They never actually claim this browser is working and functional&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;error: could not compile 'fastrender' (lib) due to 34 previous errors; 94 warnings emitted&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if you try to compile it yourself, you'll see that it's very far away from being a functional browser at all, and seemingly, it never actually was able to build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple recent GitHub Actions runs on &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; show
failures (including workflow-file errors), and independent build
attempts report dozens of compiler errors, recent PRs were all merged
with failing CI, and going back in the Git history from most recent
commit back 100 commits,&lt;lb/&gt;I couldn't find a single commit that compiled cleanly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what the "agents" they unleashed on this codebase actually did, but they seemingly never ran "cargo build" or even less "cargo check", because both of those commands surface 10s of errors (which surely would balloon should we solve them) and about 100 warnings. There is an open GitHub issue in their repository about this right now: https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender/issues/98&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And diving into the codebase, if the compilation errors didn't make that clear already, makes it very clear to any software developer that none of this is actually engineered code. It is what is typically known as "AI slop", low quality something that surely represents something, but it doesn't have intention behind it, and it doesn't even compile at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They later start to talk about what's next, but not a single word about how to run it, what to expect, how it's working or anything else. Cursor's blog post provides no reproducible demo and no known-good revision (tag/release/commit) to verify the screenshots, beyond linking the repo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless of intent, Cursor's blog post creates the impression of a functioning prototype while leaving out the basic reproducibility markers one would expect from such claim. They never explicitly claim it's actually working, so no one can say they lied at least.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They finish off the article saying:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But the core question, can we scale autonomous coding by throwing more agents at a problem, has a more optimistic answer than we expected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which seems like a really strange conclusion to arrive at, when all they've proved so far, is that agents can output millions of tokens and still not end up with something that actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A "browser experiment" doesn't need to rival Chrome. A reasonable minimum bar is: it compiles on a supported toolchain and can render a trivial HTML file. Cursor's post doesn’t demonstrate that bar, and current public build attempts fail at this too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cursor never says "this browser is production-ready", but they do frame it as "building a web browser from scratch" and "meaningful progress" and then use a screenshot and "extremely difficult" language, wanting to give the impression that this experiment actually was a success.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The closest they get to implying that this was a success, is this part:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hundreds of agents can work together on a single codebase for weeks, making real progress on ambitious projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this extraordinary claim isn't backed up by any evidence. In the blog post they never provide a working commit, build instructions or even a demo that can be reproduced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think anyone expects this browser to be the next Chrome, but I do think that if you claim you've built a browser, it should at least be able to demonstrate being able to be compiled + loading a basic HTML file at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;READ_ONCE(), WRITE_ONCE(), but not for Rust&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;[LWN subscriber-only content]&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An understanding of READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE() is important for kernel developers who will be dealing with any sort of concurrent access to data. So, naturally, they are almost entirely absent from the kernel's documentation. A description of sorts can be found at the top of include/asm-generic/rwonce.h:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Prevent the compiler from merging or refetching reads or writes. The compiler is also forbidden from reordering successive instances of READ_ONCE and WRITE_ONCE, but only when the compiler is aware of some particular ordering. One way to make the compiler aware of ordering is to put the two invocations of READ_ONCE or WRITE_ONCE in different C statements.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, a READ_ONCE() call will force the compiler to read from the indicated location exactly one time, with no optimization tricks that would cause the read to be either elided or repeated; WRITE_ONCE() will force a write under those terms. They will also ensure that the access is atomic; if one task reads a location with READ_ONCE() while another is writing that location, the read will return the value as it existed either before or after the write, but not some random combination of the two. These macros, other than as described above, impose no ordering constraints on the compiler or the CPU, making them different from macros like smp_load_acquire(), which have stronger ordering requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Stay on top of Linux kernel development with a one-month free trial subscription to LWN, no credit card required.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE() macros were added for the 3.18 release in 2014. WRITE_ONCE() was initially called ASSIGN_ONCE(), but that name was changed during the 3.19 development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the last day of 2025, Alice Ryhl posted a patch series adding implementations of READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE() for Rust. There are places in the code, she said, where volatile reads could be replaced with these calls, once they were available; among other changes, the series changed access to the struct file f_flags field to use READ_ONCE(). The implementation of these macros involves a bunch of Rust macro magic, but in the end they come down to calls to the Rust read_volatile() and write_volatile() functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Some of the other kernel Rust developers objected to this change, though. Gary Guo said that he would rather not expose READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE() and suggested using relaxed operations from &lt;del&gt;the Rust Atomic crate&lt;/del&gt; the kernel's Atomic module instead. Boqun Feng expanded on the objection: &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;The problem of READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE() is that the semantics is complicated. Sometimes they are used for atomicity, sometimes they are used for preventing data race. So yes, we are using LKMM [the Linux kernel memory model] in Rust as well, but whenever possible, we need to clarify the intention of the API, using Atomic::from_ptr().load(Relaxed) helps on that front.&lt;p&gt;IMO, READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE() is like a "band aid" solution to a few problems, having it would prevent us from developing a more clear view for concurrent programming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, using the Atomic crate allows developers to specify more precisely which guarantees an operation needs, making the expectations (and requirements) of the code more clear. This point of view would appear to have won out, and Ryhl has stopped pushing for this addition to the kernel's Rust code — for now, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a couple of interesting implications from this outcome, should it hold. The first of those is that, as Rust code reaches more deeply into the core kernel, its code for concurrent access to shared data will look significantly different from the equivalent C code, even though the code on both sides may be working with the same data. Understanding lockless data access is challenging enough when dealing with one API; developers may now have to understand two APIs, which will not make the task easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, this discussion is drawing some attention to code on the C side as well. As Feng pointed out, there is still C code in the kernel that assumes a plain write will be atomic in many situations, even though the C standard explicitly says otherwise. Peter Zijlstra answered that all such code should be updated to use WRITE_ONCE() properly. Simply finding that code may be a challenge (though KCSAN can help); updating it all may take a while. The conversation also identified a place in the (C) high-resolution-timer code that is missing a needed READ_ONCE() call. This is another example of the Rust work leading to improvements in the C code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In past discussions on the design of Rust abstractions, there has been resistance to the creation of Rust interfaces that look substantially different from their C counterparts; see this 2024 article, for example. If the Rust developers come up with a better design for an interface, the thinking went, the C side should be improved to match this new design. If one accepts the idea that the Rust approach to READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE() is better than the original, then one might conclude that a similar process should be followed here. Changing thousands of low-level concurrency primitives to specify more precise semantics would not be a task for the faint of heart, though. This may end up being a case where code in the two languages just does things differently.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Posted Jan 9, 2026 17:19 UTC (Fri) by mb (subscriber, #50428) [Link] (9 responses) I experimented with read/write volatile on AVR, where it would be greatly beneficial to use them for certain inter-thread (interrupt) communication. However, I came to the conclusion that using read/write volatile for inter-thread (interrupt) communication is unsound in Rust. AVR hardware is not capable of doing a non-atomic read/write for byte sized objects. So the hardware is fine for all of the relevant cases. https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ptr/fn.read_volatile.html &amp;gt; an operation is volatile has no bearing whatsoever on questions involving concurrent accesses from multiple threads &amp;gt; This access is still not considered atomic, and as such it cannot be used for inter-thread synchronization. My implementation worked fine and the generated assembly code was perfect. (Yes, I know there is AtomicXX and no it's not efficient for reasons... And yes, I should fix the compiler's atomic intrinsics instead of working around the problem... I know :) Posted Jan 9, 2026 19:20 UTC (Fri) by josh (subscriber, #17465) [Link] (8 responses) Relaxed atomics are effectively compiler-barrier atomics, and *shouldn't* have any runtime overhead. Are you encountering cases where there's more inefficiency than that? Posted Jan 9, 2026 19:54 UTC (Fri) by mb (subscriber, #50428) [Link] (1 responses) But that was not my point. My point was that I think volatile accesses are not sound in Rust for inter thread communication. Posted Jan 9, 2026 22:10 UTC (Fri) by josh (subscriber, #17465) [Link] Ah, got it, thank you. Hopefully that can be fixed. &amp;gt; My point was that I think volatile accesses are not sound in Rust for inter thread communication. Right, I believe that's correct. Posted Jan 10, 2026 9:33 UTC (Sat) by plugwash (subscriber, #29694) [Link] (5 responses) The situation is a little more subtle than that. Relaxed atomics on a given memory location, must behave as-if they had a well-defined order (though this order may differ from operations on other memory locations, unless fences are used), and this must apply to the whole set of atomic operations. You may only be using load and store on a particular location, but the compiler doesn't know that. Other code might be performing other atomic operations on that location. My understanding is that this effectively means that if you implement read-modify-write operations by using a global lock, you must also implement plain write operations using that same global lock. Posted Jan 10, 2026 20:13 UTC (Sat) by comex (subscriber, #71521) [Link] (1 responses) Posted Jan 11, 2026 17:49 UTC (Sun) by garyguo (subscriber, #173367) [Link] `READ_ONCE` on u64 might still be useful is you just want to read the value in a data-race-free way and you don't care about atomicity (i.e. allow the read to tear). However this is yet another reason I don't want people to just use `READ_ONCE()` for atomic ops on Rust side -- it's just not intuitive which semantics is desired. Posted Jan 10, 2026 20:44 UTC (Sat) by NYKevin (subscriber, #129325) [Link] (2 responses) That is true but misleading. Your parenthetical negates all of the guarantees that are actually expensive to implement, at least on x86. Noting for the record: A fence must be on the same thread as the relaxed atomic in order to restrict it, and there are several other requirements as well. I refer the curious reader to https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic_thread_fe... and related documentation for more information. &amp;gt; My understanding is that this effectively means that if you implement read-modify-write operations by using a global lock, you must also implement plain write operations using that same global lock. If you take a global lock, then there are two different memory locations in play (lock and payload), so your parenthetical above already tells us that the lock is ineffective (at protecting against against un-fenced relaxed atomics on either the lock or the payload). Or perhaps I have misunderstood what you mean by "implement read-modify-write operations by using a global lock." I would normally understand a "read-modify-write operation" to be a hardware instruction (or sequence of instructions), which is not our problem to "implement" in the first place. If you mean "emulate," then the problem we run into is that emulators do not emulate the C abstract machine. They emulate some real hardware like x86, or virtual hardware like the JVM. Those platforms have their own, more specific memory models than the C abstract machine, and the compiler backend must necessarily take advantage of those memory models to emit correct assembly/machine code. So our emulator is not permitted to stop at just taking locks for relaxed atomics - it doesn't necessarily know which stores or loads originated as relaxed atomics in the first place, and therefore may have to take locks for all loads and stores whatsoever. Of course, it would be preferable to implement these operations lock-free if it is possible to do so.

In this case, the compiler would need to compile un-fenced relaxed atomics so that they take the global lock. That’s what plugwash meant.

While it may be prohibitively difficult, it does seem like changing the C side to use relaxed atomics (when correct) would be the right thing to do. But I don't really know how many uses actually require the additional "volatility" guarantee provided by READ/WRITE_ONCE(). Posted Jan 10, 2026 1:39 UTC (Sat) by wahern (subscriber, #37304) [Link] (8 responses) Also, C11 atomics is not the origin point for atomic intrinsics[1] or a meaningful memory model in either GCC or Linux. It's not the final or even 100% comprehensive model, either. I think the push for a more formal memory model in C, C++, and the compilers gives a false impression such a thing was completely non-existent beforehand and that things are satisfactory today. [1] GCC had at least two sets of intrinsics before supporting C11 atomics, and of course projects like the kernel had their own set that work just as well today as they did before the latest set of builtins. Posted Jan 10, 2026 8:54 UTC (Sat) by koverstreet (✭ supporter ✭, #4296) [Link] (2 responses) The "atomicity" guarantees that READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE() provide only come in at the compiler level. The compiler will coalesce loads and stores or emit multiple loads as a substitute for spilling registers without some notion of atomicity at the language level. The "unnecessarily costly" part of READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE() is that they don't distinguish between atomicity and ordering - they also specify strict ordering, but only to the compiler, not the hardware (they don't emit memory barriers). Rust's atomic load/store really are just better, because they separate out ordering from atomicity and make ordering explicit. And instead of sprinkling around separate memory barrier calls, which may or may not be commented, they're attached to the operation that needs them - which is good for readability. Posted Jan 10, 2026 17:45 UTC (Sat) by excors (subscriber, #95769) [Link] I'm not certain what you mean by that. E.g. the ARM ARM defines "single-copy atomicity" which is important even in single-processor code: if an interrupt occurs during a STP (Store Pair) instruction, whose operation is defined as a single assignment to memory, the interrupt handler may observe the first half of memory was updated and the second half wasn't, because STP is treated as two separate atomic writes. (The STP instruction will be restarted after the interrupt returns, so it'll complete eventually). So I think the ISA does define the notion of atomic loads and stores, even before getting to the more complex operations. (GCC will happily use STP for an int64_t assignment, making it non-atomic, unless you add 'volatile' and then it'll use a single 64-bit STR (which is single-copy atomic).) Posted Jan 10, 2026 20:18 UTC (Sat) by comex (subscriber, #71521) [Link] Posted Jan 10, 2026 16:55 UTC (Sat) by joib (subscriber, #8541) [Link] (4 responses) I wonder, if the C++/C11 memory models and atomics were to be developed today, how different would they look, considering the amount of knowledge the world has gained since then and now? Certainly there were parts of the C/C++11 models that were, ahem, less than successful, like the consume memory ordering, but otherwise, would there be a place for doing it substantially better and different in general? Posted Jan 11, 2026 20:33 UTC (Sun) by pbonzini (subscriber, #60935) [Link] (1 responses) I don't have high hopes that this would be accepted now, but maybe it would be since "almost nobody will need anything but sequential consistent variables" has been shown wrong. The other thing that still hasn't been fully formalized is out-of-thin-air values. Everybody agrees that they won't happen but strictly speaking they aren't prohibited, or weren't last time I checked.

Given that the article mentions there are cases in C where READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE() should have been used, but weren't, this seems to be a real risk. Posted Jan 10, 2026 15:42 UTC (Sat) by bjackman (subscriber, #109548) [Link] (1 responses) IIUC C11's relaxed ordering is too weak for that, but any of the other C11 orderings are likely to be unnecessarily strict, i.e. they might force the use of special (costly) CPU instructions where normal reads and writes are already safe enough.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Short-lived and IP address certificates are now generally available from Let’s Encrypt. These certificates are valid for 160 hours, just over six days. In order to get a short-lived certificate subscribers simply need to select the ‘shortlived’ certificate profile in their ACME client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Short-lived certificates improve security by requiring more frequent validation and reducing reliance on unreliable revocation mechanisms. If a certificate’s private key is exposed or compromised, revocation has historically been the way to mitigate damage prior to the certificate’s expiration. Unfortunately, revocation is an unreliable system so many relying parties continue to be vulnerable until the certificate expires, a period as long as 90 days. With short-lived certificates that vulnerability window is greatly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Short-lived certificates are opt-in and we have no plan to make them the default at this time. Subscribers that have fully automated their renewal process should be able to switch to short-lived certificates easily if they wish, but we understand that not everyone is in that position and generally comfortable with this significantly shorter lifetime. We hope that over time everyone moves to automated solutions and we can demonstrate that short-lived certificates work well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our default certificate lifetimes will be going from 90 days down to 45 days over the next few years, as previously announced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IP address certificates allow server operators to authenticate TLS connections to IP addresses rather than domain names. Let’s Encrypt supports both IPv4 and IPv6. IP address certificates must be short-lived certificates, a decision we made because IP addresses are more transient than domain names, so validating more frequently is important. You can learn more about our IP address certificates and the use cases for them from our post announcing our first IP Certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’d like to thank the Open Technology Fund and Sovereign Tech Agency, along with our Sponsors and Donors, for supporting the development of this work.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I am a big fan of Claude Opus as it has been very good at understanding feature requests and generally staying consistent with my codebase (completely written from scratch using Opus).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I've noticed recently that when I am using Opus at night (Eastern US), I am seeing it go down extreme rabbit holes on the same types of requests I am putting through on a regular basis. It is more likely to undertake refactors that break the code and then iterates on those errors in a sort of spiral. A request that would normally take 3-4 minutes will turn into a 10 minute adventure before I revert the changes, call out the mistake, and try again. It will happily admit the mistake, but the pattern seems to be consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I haven't performed a like for like test and that would be interesting, but has anyone else noticed the same?&lt;/p&gt;

The unique feat was the result of over a year and a half of preparations involving three different balloons, various modifications, and a first, unsuccessful attempt. The failed attempt alerted the East German authorities to the plot, but the police were unable to identify the escapees before their second, successful flight two months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;East Germany, then part of the Eastern Bloc, was separated from West Germany in the Western Bloc by the inner German border and the Berlin Wall, which were heavily fortified with watchtowers, land mines, armed soldiers, and various other measures to prevent illegal crossings. East German border troops were instructed to prevent defection to West Germany by all means, including lethal force (Schießbefehl; "order to fire").[2]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Strelzyk (1942–2017), an electrician and former East German Air Force mechanic, and Günter Wetzel (born 1955), a bricklayer by trade,[3] were colleagues at a local plastics factory.[4] Friends for four years, they shared a desire to flee the country and began discussing ways to get across the border. On 7 March 1978, they agreed to plan an escape.[5] They considered building a helicopter but quickly realized they would be unable to acquire an engine capable of powering such a craft. They then decided to explore the idea of constructing a hot air balloon,[6] having been inspired by a television program about ballooning.[3] An alternate account is that a relative shared a magazine article about the International Balloon Festival in Albuquerque, New Mexico.[5]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Construction&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Strelzyk and Wetzel began research into balloons. Their plan was to escape with their wives and a total of four children (aged 2 to 15). They calculated the weight of the eight passengers and the craft itself to be around 750 kilograms (1,650 lb). Subsequent calculations determined a balloon capable of lifting this weight would need to hold 2,000 cubic metres (71,000 cu ft) of air heated to 100 °C (212 °F). The next calculation was the amount of material needed for the balloon, estimated to be 800 square metres (8,600 sq ft).[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair lived in Pößneck, a small town of about 20,000 where large quantities of cloth could not be obtained without raising attention. They tried neighbouring towns of Rudolstadt, Saalfeld, and Jena without success.[7] They travelled 50 km (31 mi) to Gera, where they purchased 1-metre-wide (3 ft 3 in) rolls of cotton cloth totalling 850 metres (2,790 ft) in length at a department store after telling the astonished clerk that they needed the large quantity of material to use as tent lining for their camping club.[6][7]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wetzel spent two weeks sewing the cloth into a balloon-shaped bag, 15 metres (49 ft) wide by 20 metres (66 ft) long, on a 40-year-old manually operated sewing machine. Strelzyk spent the time building the gondola and burner assembly. The gondola was made from an iron frame, sheet metal floor, and clothesline run around the perimeter every 150 millimetres (5.9 in) for the sides. The burner was made using two 11-kilogram (24 lb) bottles of liquid propane household gas, hoses, water pipe, a nozzle, and a piece of stove pipe.[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;First test&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The team was ready to test the craft in April 1978. After days of searching, they found a suitable secluded forest clearing near Ziegenrück, 10 km (6.2 mi) from the border and 30 km (19 mi) from Pößneck. After lighting the burner one night, they failed to inflate the balloon. They thought the problem might stem from the fact that they had laid the balloon on the ground. After weeks of additional searching, they found a 25-metre (82 ft) cliff at a rock quarry where they could suspend the balloon vertically before inflation, but that also proved unsuccessful.[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair then decided to fill the bag with ambient-temperature air before using the burner to raise the air temperature and provide lift. They constructed a blower with a 14 hp (10 kW) 250 cc (15 cu in) motorcycle engine taken from Wetzel's old MZ, started with a Trabant automobile starter powered by jumper cables from Strelzyk's Moskvitch sedan.[8] This engine, silenced by a Trabant muffler, turned 1-metre-long (3.3 ft) fan blades to inflate the balloon. They also used a home-made flamethrower, similar to the gondola's burner, to pre-heat the air faster. With these modifications in place, they returned to the secluded clearing to try again but still could not inflate the balloon. But using the blower did allow them to discover that the cotton material with which they fashioned the balloon was too porous and leaked excessively.[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their unsuccessful effort had cost them 2,400 DDM (US$360). Strelzyk disposed of the cloth by burning it in his furnace over several weeks.[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Second test&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Strelzyk and Wetzel purchased samples of different fabrics in local stores, including umbrella material and various samples of taffeta and nylon. They used an oven to test the material for heat resistance. In addition, they created a test rig from a vacuum cleaner and a water-filled glass tube to determine which material would allow the vacuum to exert the most suction on the water, and consequently which was the most impervious to air. The umbrella covering performed the best but was also the most expensive. They instead selected a synthetic kind of taffeta.[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To purchase a large quantity of fabric without arousing too much suspicion, the pair again drove to a distant city. This time they travelled over 160 kilometres (100 mi) to a department store in Leipzig. Their new cover story was that they belonged to a sailing club and needed the material to make sails. The quantity they needed had to be ordered, and although they feared the purchase might be reported to East Germany's State Security Service (Stasi), they returned the next day and picked up the material without incident. They paid 4,800 DDM (US$720) for 800 metres (2,600 ft) of 1-metre-wide (3 ft 3 in) fabric.[6] On the way home, they also purchased an electric motor to speed up the pedal-operated sewing machine they had been using to sew the material into the desired balloon shape.[7]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wetzel spent the next week sewing the material into another balloon, accomplishing the task faster the second time with the now-electric sewing machine. Soon afterwards, the two men returned to the forest clearing and inflated the bag in about five minutes using the blower and flame thrower. The bag rose and held air, but the burner on the gondola was not powerful enough to create the heat needed for lift. The pair continued experimenting for months, doubling the number of propane tanks and trying different fuel mixtures. Disappointed with the result, Wetzel decided to abandon the project and instead started to pursue the idea of building a small gasoline engine-powered light aeroplane[6] or a glider.[5]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strelzyk continued trying to improve the burner. In June 1979, he discovered that with the propane tank inverted, additional pressure caused the liquid propane to evaporate, which produced a bigger flame. He modified the gondola to mount the propane tanks upside down, and returned to the test site where he found the new configuration produced a 12-metre (39 ft) long flame. Strelzyk was ready to attempt an escape.[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;First escape attempt&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;On 3 July 1979, the weather and wind conditions were favourable. The entire Strelzyk family lifted from a forest clearing at 1:30 am and climbed at a rate of 4 metres (13 ft) per second. They reached an altitude of 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) according to an altimeter Strelzyk had made by modifying a barometer. A light wind was blowing them towards the border. The balloon then entered clouds, and atmospheric water vapour condensed on the balloon, adding weight which caused it to descend prematurely. The family landed safely approximately 180 metres (590 ft) short of the border, at the edge of the heavily mined border zone. Unsure of where they were, Strelzyk explored until he found a piece of litter – a bread bag from a bakery in Wernigerode, an East German town. The group spent nine hours carefully extricating themselves from the 500-metre (1,600 ft) wide border zone to avoid detection. They also had to travel unnoticed through a 5 km (3.1 mi) restricted zone before hiking back a total of 14 km (8.7 mi) to their car and the launch paraphernalia they had left behind.[6] They made it home just in time to report their absence from work and school was due to sickness.[7]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The abandoned balloon was discovered by the authorities later that morning. Strelzyk destroyed all compromising evidence and sold his car, fearing that it could link him to the escape attempt.[6] On 14 August, the Stasi launched an appeal to find the "perpetrator of a serious offence", listing in detail all the items recovered at the landing site.[9] Strelzyk felt that the Stasi would eventually trace the balloon to him and the Wetzels. He agreed with Wetzel that their best chance was to quickly build another balloon and get out as soon as possible.[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Successful escape&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;Strelzyk and Wetzel decided to double the balloon's size to 4,000 cubic metres (140,000 cu ft) in volume, 20 metres (66 ft) in diameter, and 25 metres (82 ft) in height. They needed 1,250 square metres (13,500 sq ft) of taffeta, and purchased the material, in various colours and patterns, all over the country in order to escape suspicion. Wetzel sewed a third balloon, using over 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) of thread, and Strelzyk rebuilt everything else as before. In six weeks, they had prepared the 180-kilogram (400 lb) balloon and a payload of 550 kilograms (1,210 lb), including the gondola, equipment, and cargo (the two families). Confident in their calculations, they found the weather conditions right on 15 September, when a violent thunderstorm created the correct winds. The two families set off for the launch site in Strelzyk's replacement car (a Wartburg) and a moped. Arriving at 1:30 am, they needed just ten minutes to inflate the balloon and an additional three minutes to heat the air.[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifting off just after 2:00 am, the group failed to cut the tethers holding the gondola to the ground at the same time, tilting the balloon and sending the flame towards the fabric, which caught fire. After putting out the fire with an extinguisher brought along for just such an emergency, they climbed to 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) in nine minutes, drifting towards West Germany at 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph). The balloon flew for 28 minutes, with the temperature plummeting to −8 °C (18 °F) in the unsheltered gondola, which consisted solely of clothesline railing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A design miscalculation resulted in the burner stovepipe being too long, causing the flame to be too high in the balloon, creating excessive pressure which caused the balloon to split. The air rushing out of the split extinguished the burner flame. Wetzel was able to re-light the flame with a match, and had to do so several more times before the group landed. At one point, they increased the flame to the maximum possible extent and rose to 2,500 metres (8,200 ft). They later learned they had been high enough to be detected, but not identified, on radar by West German air traffic controllers.[6] They had also been detected on the East German side by a night watchman at the district culture house in Bad Lobenstein. The report of an unidentified flying object heading toward the border caused guards to activate search lights, but the balloon was too high and out of reach of the lights.[10]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tear in the balloon meant the group had to use the burner much more often, greatly limiting the distance it could travel. Wetzel later said he thought they could have travelled another 50 kilometres (31 mi) had the balloon remained intact. They made out the border crossing at Rudolphstein on the A9 and saw the search lights. When the propane ran out, they descended quickly, landing near the town of Naila, in the West German state of Bavaria and only 10 km (6 mi) from the border. The only injury was suffered by Wetzel, who broke his leg upon landing.[6] Various clues indicated to the families that the balloon had made it across the border. These included spotting red and yellow coloured lights, not common in East Germany,[3] and small farms, in contrast to the large state-run operations in the east. Another clue was modern farm equipment, unlike the older equipment used in East Germany.[11] Two Bavarian State Police officers saw the balloon's flickering light and headed to where they thought it would land. There they found Strelzyk and Wetzel, who first asked if they had made it to the West, although they noticed the police car was an Audi – another sign they were in West Germany. Upon learning they had, the escapees happily called for their families to join them.[6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Aftermath&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;East Germany immediately increased border security, closed all small airports close to the border, and ordered the planes kept farther inland.[6] Propane gas tanks became registered products, and large quantities of fabric suitable for balloon construction could no longer be purchased. Mail from East Germany to the two escaped families was prohibited.[12]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erich Strelzyk learned of his brother's escape on the ZDF news and was arrested in his Potsdam apartment three hours after the landing. The arrest of family members was standard procedure to deter others from attempting escape. He was charged with "aiding and abetting escape", as were Strelzyk's sister Maria and her husband, who were sentenced to 2½ years. The three were eventually released with the help of Amnesty International.[12]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The families decided to initially settle in Naila where they had landed. Wetzel worked as an automobile mechanic and Strelzyk opened a TV repair shop in Bad Kissingen. Due to pressure from Stasi spies, the Strelzyks moved to Switzerland in 1985.[10] After German reunification in 1990, they returned to their old home in their hometown of Pößneck.[13] The Wetzels remained in Bavaria.[7]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West German weekly magazine Stern paid Strelzyk and Wetzel for exclusive rights to the story.[3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The escape has been portrayed in two films: Night Crossing (1982) and Balloon (2018). The former, also called With the Wind to the West – the English translation of the German title – was an English-language film produced by Disney. The Strelzyks were reportedly "moved to tears" at the screening of the movie at Rockefeller Center in New York City.[12] The latter was a German-language production which "both families welcomed [Director] Herbig’s desire to, as he put it, 'make a German film for an international audience.'" Herbig claimed in 2018 that both the Strelzyk and Wetzel families had been dissatisfied with the Disney film.[14]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Strelzyk died in 2017 at age 74 after a long illness.[13]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the balloon was put on permanent display at the Haus der Bayerischen Geschichte: Museum in Regensburg.[10]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Escapees&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The family members included:[3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Peter Strelzyk, aged 37&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Doris Strelzyk&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Frank Strelzyk, aged 15&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Andreas Strelzyk, aged 11&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Günter Wetzel, aged 24&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Petra Wetzel&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Peter Wetzel, aged 5&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Andreas Wetzel, aged 2&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Media&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The Disney film Night Crossing (1982) is an adaptation of the story[13]&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Michael Herbig's film Balloon (2018) is a German-language adaptation of the story[15]&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;BBC program Outlook, "Fleeing Communism in a Hot Air Balloon"[16]&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;PBS Nova program, "History's Great Escapes" (2004)[17]&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Doris Strelzyk, Peter Strelzyk, Gudrun Giese: Destiny Balloon Escape.

    &lt;p&gt;i was at bombay airport. some dude was watching reels on full volume and laughing loudly. asking nicely doesn't work anymore. me being me, didn't have the courage to speak up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;so i built a tiny app that plays back the same audio it hears, delayed by ~2 seconds. asked claude, it spat out a working version in one prompt. surprisingly WORKS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;discussion - https://x.com/the2ndfloorguy/status/2011734249871954188&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;something something auditory feedback loop something something cognitive dissonance. idk i'm not a neuroscientist. all i know is it makes people shut up and that's good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;straight up honest - originally called this "make-it-stop" but then saw @TimDarcet also built similar and named it STFU. wayyyyy better name. so stole it. sorry not sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;made with spite and web audio api. do whatever you want with it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI is reaching a point where everyone can have a personal super-assistant that helps them learn and do almost anything. Who gets access to that level of intelligence will shape whether AI expands opportunity or reinforces the same divides.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve been working to make powerful AI accessible to everyone through our free product and low-cost subscription tier, ChatGPT Go, which has launched in 171 countries since August. Today we’re bringing Go to the U.S. and everywhere ChatGPT is available, giving people expanded access to messaging, image creation, file uploads and memory for $8 USD/month. In the coming weeks, we’re also planning to start testing ads in the U.S. for the free and Go tiers, so more people can benefit from our tools with fewer usage limits or without having to pay. Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise subscriptions will not include ads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People trust ChatGPT for many important and personal tasks, so as we introduce ads, it’s crucial we preserve what makes ChatGPT valuable in the first place. That means you need to trust that ChatGPT’s responses are driven by what’s objectively useful, never by advertising. You need to know that your data and conversations are protected and never sold to advertisers. And we need to keep a high bar and give you control over your experience so you see truly relevant, high-quality ads—and can turn off personalization if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that, we want to be clear about the principles that guide our approach to advertising:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Mission alignment: Our mission is to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity; our pursuit of advertising is always in support of that mission and making AI more accessible.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Answer independence: Ads do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you. Answers are optimized based on what's most helpful to you. Ads are always separate and clearly labeled.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Conversation privacy: We keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers, and we never sell your data to advertisers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Choice and control: You control how your data is used. You can turn off personalization, and you can clear the data used for ads at any time. We’ll always offer a way to not see ads in ChatGPT, including a paid tier that’s ad-free.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Long-term value: We do not optimize for time spent in ChatGPT. We prioritize user trust and user experience over revenue.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re not launching ads yet, but we do plan to start testing in the coming weeks for logged in adults in the U.S. on the free and Go tiers. To start, we plan to test ads at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation. Ads will be clearly labeled and separated from the organic answer. You’ll be able to learn more about why you’re seeing that ad, or dismiss any ad and tell us why. During our test, we will not show ads in accounts where the user tells us or we predict that they are under 18, and ads are not eligible to appear near sensitive or regulated topics like health, mental health or politics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of what the first ad formats we plan to test could look like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best ads are useful, entertaining, and help people discover new products and services. Given what AI can do, we're excited to develop new experiences over time that people find more helpful and relevant than any other ads. Conversational interfaces create possibilities for people to go beyond static messages and links. For example, soon you might see an ad and be able to directly ask the questions you need to make a purchase decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ads also can be transformative for small businesses and emerging brands trying to compete. AI tools level the playing field even further, allowing anyone to create high-quality experiences that help people discover options they might never have found otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll learn from feedback and refine how ads show up over time, but our commitment to putting users first and maintaining trust won’t change. By starting our ad platform from the ground up with these principles in place, we can align our incentives with what people want from ChatGPT. Our long-term focus remains on building products that millions of people and businesses find valuable enough to pay for. Our enterprise and subscription businesses are already strong, and we believe in having a diverse revenue model where ads can play a part in making intelligence more accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once we begin testing our first ad formats in the coming weeks and months, we look forward to getting people's feedback and ensuring that ads can support broad access to AI and keep the trust that makes ChatGPT valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This Copernicus Sentinel-2 image over the South Atlantic Ocean features a close-up view of the A23a iceberg, once the world’s largest. The unusually cloud-free image shows the first signs that the iceberg will soon disintegrate completely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zoom in to explore this image at its full 10 m resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A23a calved from the Filchner-Ronne ice shelf in West Antarctica in 1986. At the time it measured around 4000 sq km – more than three times the size of Rome – making it the largest iceberg in the world. After being grounded on the ocean floor for decades, in 2020 it lost its grip and began floating in the Weddell Sea until, in November 2023, it started drifting quickly away from Antarctic waters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Driven by winds and currents, the iceberg travelled about 2000 km further north towards the warmer South Atlantic Ocean waters, reaching South Georgia Island in May 2025, where it started to disintegrate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout 2025, A23a has been breaking apart into smaller blocks of ice reducing its size significantly. In this image from 20 December 2025, the iceberg is approximately 150 km northwest of South Georgia, surrounded by numerous icebergs from different sizes. Although it has lost about three-quarters of its surface area, A23a is still one of the largest icebergs floating in open waters, covering roughly 1000 sq km.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bright blue areas visible on its surface and on the icebergs to its south are ponds of meltwater, which are clear signs of the iceberg’s rapid demise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The disintegration is typical of icebergs that reach this far north and is caused by the warmer sea temperatures and weather conditions. As A23a is travelling towards even warmer waters pushed by the currents, it will soon experience a similar fate to other megabergs that have disintegrated in the same waters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Reading across books with Claude Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jan 4, 2026&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs are overused to summarise and underused to help us read deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To explore how they can enrich rather than reduce, I set Claude Code up with tools to mine a library of 100 non-fiction books. It found sequences of excerpts connected by an interesting idea, or trails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a part of one such trail, linking deception in the startup world to the social psychology of mass movements (I’m especially pleased by the jump from Jobs to Theranos):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How it works&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The books were selected from Hacker News’ favourites, which I previously scraped and visualized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude browses the books a chunk at a time. A chunk is a segment of roughly 500 words that aligns with paragraphs when possible. This length is a good balance between saving tokens and providing enough context for ideas to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chunks are indexed by topic, and topics are themselves indexed for search. This makes it easy to look up all passages in the corpus that relate to, say, deception.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This works well when you know what to look for, but search alone can’t tell you which topics are present to begin with. There are over 100,000 extracted topics, far too many to be browsed directly. To support exploration, they are grouped into a hierarchical tree structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This yields around 1,000 top-level topics. They emerge from combining lower-level topics, and not all of them are equally useful:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Incidents that frustrated Ev Williams&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Names beginning with “Da”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Events between 1971 &amp;amp; 1974&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this Borgesian taxonomy is good enough for Claude to piece together what the books are about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude uses the topic tree and the search via a few CLI tools.&lt;lb/&gt; They allow it to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find all chunks associated with a topic similar to a query.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find topics which occur in a window of chunks around a given topic.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Find topics that co-occur in multiple books.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Browse topics and chunks that are siblings in the topic tree.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To generate the trails, the agent works in stages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;First, it scans the library and the existing trails, and proposes novel trail ideas. It mainly browses the topic tree to find unexplored areas and rarely reads full chunks in depth.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Then, it takes a specific idea and turns it into a trail. It receives seed topics from the previous stage and browses many chunks. It extracts excerpts, specific sequences of sentences, and decides on how best to order them to support an insight.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finally, it adds highlights and edges between consecutive excerpts.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What I learned&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Claude Code is great for non-coding tasks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though I’ve been using Claude Code to develop for months, my first instinct for this project was to consider it as a traditional pipeline of several discrete stages. My initial attempt at this system consisted of multiple LLM modules with carefully hand-assembled contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a whim, I ran Claude with access to the debugging tools I’d been using and a minimal prompt: “find something interesting.” It immediately did a better job at pulling in what it needed than the pipeline I was trying to tune by hand, while requiring much less orchestration. It was a clear improvement to push as much of the work into the agent’s loop as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ended up using Claude as my main interface to the project.&lt;lb/&gt; Initially I did so because it inferred the sequence of CLI calls I wanted to run faster than I could recall them. Then, I used it to automate tasks which weren’t rigid enough to be scripted traditionally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The latter opened up options that I wouldn’t have considered before. For example, I changed my mind on how short I wanted excerpts to be. I communicated my new preference to Claude, which then looked through all the existing trails and edited them as necessary, balancing the way the overall meaning of the trail changed. Previously, I would’ve likely considered all previous trails to be outdated and generated new ones, because the required edits would’ve been too nuanced to specify.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, agents have widened my ambitions.&lt;lb/&gt; By taking care of the boilerplate, I no longer shy away from the tedious parts. Revision is cheap, so I don’t need to plow ahead with suboptimal choices just because it’d be too costly to undo them. This, in turn, keeps up the momentum and lets me focus on the joyful, creative aspects of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ask the agent what it needs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My focus went from optimising prompts to implementing better tools for Claude to use, moving up a rung on the abstraction ladder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mental model of the AI component changed: from a function mapping input to output, to a coworker I was assisting. I spent my time thinking about the affordances that would make the workflow better, as if I were designing them for myself. That they were to be used by an agent was a mere detail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This worked because the agent is now intelligent enough that the way it uses these tools overlaps with my own mental model. It is generally easy to empathise with it and predict what it will do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially I watched Claude’s logs closely and tried to guess where it was lacking a certain ability. Then I realised I could simply ask it to provide feedback at the end and list the functionality it wished it had. Claude was excellent at proposing new commands and capabilities that would make the work more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude suggested improvements, which Claude implemented, so Claude could do the work better. At least I’m still needed to pay for the tokens — for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Novelty is a useful guide&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to quantify interestingness as an objective to optimise for.&lt;lb/&gt; Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned makes the case that chasing novelty is often a more fruitful approach. While its conclusions are debated, I’ve found this idea to be a good fit for this project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a sign of the times, this novelty search was implemented in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;By biasing the search algorithm towards under-explored topics and books.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;By asking Claude nicely.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A topic’s novelty score was calculated as the mean distance from its embedding’s k nearest neighbors. A book’s novelty score is the average novelty of the unique topics that it contains. This value was used to rank search results, so that those which were both relevant and novel were more likely to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a prompting level, Claude starts the ideation phase by looking at all the existing trails and is asked to avoid any conceptual overlap. This works fairly well, though it is often distracted by any topics related to secrecy, systems theory, or tacit knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s as if the very act of finding connections in a corpus summons the spirit of Umberto Eco and amps up the conspiratorial thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How it’s implemented&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;EPUBs are parsed using &lt;code&gt;selectolax&lt;/code&gt;, which I picked over BeautifulSoup for its speed and simpler API.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Everything from the plain text to the topic tree is stored in SQLite. Embeddings are stored using &lt;code&gt;sqlite-vec&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The text is split into sentences using &lt;code&gt;wtpsplit&lt;/code&gt;(the&lt;code&gt;sat-6l-sm&lt;/code&gt;model). Those sentences are then grouped into chunks, trying to get up to 500 words without breaking up paragraphs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I used &lt;code&gt;DSPy&lt;/code&gt;to call LLMs. It worked well for the structured data extraction and it was easy to switch out different models to experiment. I tried its prompt optimizers before I went full agentic, and their results were very promising.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I settled on Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite for topic extraction. The model gets passed a chunk and is asked to return 3-5 topics. It is also asked whether the chunk is useful, in order to filter out index entries, acknowledgements, orphan headers, etc. I was surprised at how stable these extracted topics were: similar chunks often shared some of the exact same topic labels. Processing 100 books used about 60M input tokens and ~£10 in total.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After a couple books got indexed, I shared the results with Claude Opus along with the original prompt and asked it to improve it. This is a half-baked single iteration of the type of prompt optimisation DSPy implements, and it worked rather well.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Topic pairs with a distance below a threshold get merged together. This takes care of near-duplicates such as “Startup founder”, “Startup founders”, and “Founder of startups”.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The CLI output uses a semi-XML format. In order to stimulate navigating, most output is nested with related content. For example, when searching for a topic, chunks are shown with the other topics they contain. This allows us to get a sense of what the chunk is about, as well as which other topics might be interesting. There’s probably more token-efficient formats, but I never hit the limit of the context window.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

      &amp;lt;topic id="59348" label="Blood testing system"/&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;topic id="59329" label="Elizabeth Holmes"/&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;topic id="59352" label="Investor demo"/&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;topic id="59349" label="Theranos"/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/chunk&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/topic&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/topics&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topics are embedded using&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;google/embeddinggemma-300m&lt;/code&gt;and reranked using&lt;code&gt;BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many CLI tools require loading the embedding model and other expensive state. The first call transparently starts a separate server process which loads all these resources once and holds onto them for a while. Subsequent CLI calls use this server through Python’s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;multiprocessing.connection&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The topic collection is turned into a graph (backed by&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;igraph&lt;/code&gt;) by adding edges based on the similarity of their embeddings and the point-wise mutual information of their co-occurrences.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The graph is turned into a tree by applying Leiden partitioning recursively until a minimum size is reached. I tried the Surprise quality function because it had no parameters to tweak, and found it to be good enough. Each group is labelled by Gemini based on all the topics that it contains.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Excerpts are cleaned by Gemini to remove EPUB artifacts, parsing errors, headers, footnotes, etc. Doing this only for excerpts that are actually shown, instead of during pre-processing, saved a lot of tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Slop is Everywhere For Those With Eyes to See&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The size of your plate can influence how much food you eat. The absence of a clock on a casino wall can keep you gambling through the early morning. On social media, our For You Pages give us the illusion of infinite content. How our environments are designed influences how we consume. And wouldn't you know it, everything around us is designed for maximum consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open TikTok, and you can easily burn through a hundred videos or more before you glance at the time. It doesn't help that the For You Page hides the time on our phones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are over consuming content on the FYP. The sudden surge of low-quality, AI-generated content, i.e. “AI slop,” is a byproduct of that overconsumption. We don't see it because, well, we're conditioned not to, but slop always arrives on time. Slop is inevitable. Slop is quintessential. Slop is everywhere for those with eyes to see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Olive oil, wasabi, saffron, vanilla, Wagyu, honey, champagne, and truffle,...reality TV, all hold examples of what happens when demand exceeds supply— companies fill the gap with slop. The free market loves a good filler. So, why should the digital realm be any different?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The For You page is designed to keep us playing the dopamine slot machine for as long as possible. The Average Time on Site metric is still the goose that lays the golden eggs, and both TikTok and Meta are reporting that their egg baskets have never been fuller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, there's a problem. On any given platform, only 1-3% of users publish content. It's called the 90-9-1 rule, and platforms that rely on free user generated content have been trying to solve this problem since the beginning of the commercialized web. The introduction of the For You Page, and the illusion of endless content, has only exasperated the inequity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Curation used to be part of our media consumption process. We would hop from website to website looking for a laugh. We used to click on hyperlinks for Christ's sake. Now, all we must do is sit at the trough￼ and let daddy Zuck feed us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a recent essay, Joan Westenberg makes a complementary argument that the algorithm has “flattened” curiosity by eliminating the need to “hunt” for our content. They go on to say:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There’s a concept in behavioral science called the “effort heuristic.” It’s the idea that we tend to value information more if we worked for it. The more effort something requires, the more meaning we assign to the result. When all knowledge is made effortless, it’s treated as disposable. There’s no awe, no investment, no delight in the unexpected—only consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(I'm reminded of the scene in Jurassic Park when the tour Jeep pulls up to the Tyrannosaurus rex exhibit. Doctor Grant says￼ “The T-Rex doesn't want to be fed. It wants to hunt.”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;￼This type of mindless consumption is not only harming our curiosity, it's helping to cheapen creativity for the people who produce what we consume.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creativity isn't scalable. Content creation has a hard productivity ceiling. Every human-created video on our feeds require some level of writing, production, and editing. Yet the For You Page has made the content consumption so efficient, that perhaps demand has exceeded supply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're a product manager for a social media platform, you can reduce the friction of publishing content to the app, or ship better editing tools, but you can't optimize creative spark. You can't treat humans like content-generating machines (as much as they have tried). Despite the illusion of infinite scrolling thanks to the FYP, art remains a finite resource bound to the whims of human creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You see their problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mark Zuckerberg wants us on his platforms, flicking our thumbs, for as long as possible. But the more we open Instagram, the more creators he needs posting multiple times each day. Mark has very little control over this variable. Creators could suddenly post less, or simply stop posting all together, and there's nothing he could do about it. What's worse, creators could demand Meta pay them for their art.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could you imagine?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually, yes. And it turns out, you could rather effectively kill a platform if you got a small group of top creators organized and angry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Twenty on the Vine #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2016, twenty social media personalities took down one of the largest mobile video apps on the internet. They wanted money for their labor. The executives at Vine said no. The gang of twenty, who were the highest performing creators on the app, walked away. They stopped posting entertaining content to Vine, and instead repeatedly implored their followers to find them on competing apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vine shut down for good just months later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From Inside the secret meeting of Vine stars that ushered in the app’s demise:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Vine’s spectacular rise and fall showed the power of online creators. Its demise offers crucial lessons for platforms trying to engage with power users — and a deeper understanding of who ultimately controls a social product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vine creators exposed and exploited a weakness in Vine's conventional approach to social media. Follower count had power. Old-style discovery algorithms could be easily manipulated. Vine creators used that power to take over the app, and convinced users to migrate to other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You see why follower counts are less important today, and why black-box algorithms have full control over who goes viral and who gets “shadow banned.” TikTok saw the mistakes of its predecessor, and made it so content creators could never exercise collective influence again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because virality now feels more like gambling, I suspect people post more content today than a decade ago. But it's not enough. Our insatiable appetites for content is pushing for corporations to meet that demand with slop. ￼&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it were up to TikTok and Meta, our feeds would be exclusively robot-made. Humans are a variable they cannot control, and I think they despise us for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, I have good news. Outside of our FYPs you'll find a surplus of art, essays, articles, and videos just waiting to be discovered. And best of all, these artists and writers are making things on their own terms. We, too, can enjoy the products of their labor on our terms, while not giving a dime of our attention to big tech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the open web. Or the social web. Or the open social web. Or the-- you get the point. To find it, you must reacquaint yourself with the lost art of surfing the web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Surfing the web is very different than scrolling the FYP. You don't often hear the words ”mindful” and “internet” together but, surfing the web was an art of mindful consumption that doesn't much exist today. Not to get all old man yells at cloud at you, but maybe we should bring it back?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Up next: The Lost Art of Surfing The Web (coming soon)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;@corbet @lwn this, combined with search engines prioritising the stolen content!&lt;lb/&gt; This is why I think the web is genuinely doomed. It's not enough to steal the content, for search engines to kill click thtoughs and ad revenues, they are literally killing the ability of original authors to serve the traffic to the few real users that might want to see it.&lt;lb/&gt; Devastating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This helped me a lot with my little projects:&lt;lb/&gt;https://codeberg.org/skewray/htaccess&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;@corbet @lwn at this point we might as well be offensive. If the client seems even slightly sus, just send them gibberish data talking about how good Chihuahua muffins are. Ideally LLM-generated (yes, gross) because this doesn't add new information (linear algebra yay) and makes models collapse (aka AI inbreeding).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;@cadey @corbet @lwn &lt;lb/&gt;I recently saw a traffic spike to a small HTML-only website that never had WP on it, but was suddenly getting failed wp-admin logins and hundreds of PHP vuln scans, non stop. All from MSFT IP addresses. Abuse reports were sent, but there was no response, and the abuse kept happening.&lt;lb/&gt;So now I'm blocking every MSFT CIDR block that I can find, server-wide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe it doesn't need to be subscriber only, just registered users only? Which can also be a PITA, but if there's no enshittification for non-registered users other than the bandwidth being shared with bots, maybe it's tolerable? Could even have a banner about this explaining the benefits of registering, and how LWN won't sell your data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, it's hard to argue against that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And maybe you weren't seeking for "helpful" advice anyway, but, uh, you know your audience. :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;@corbet @lwn @jani @suihkulokki I have a simple solution: Stop being so damn relevant!!!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait... 🤡&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;@mupuf @corbet @lwn @suihkulokki&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think the scrapers care about that, though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;@jani @corbet @lwn @suihkulokki Sorry, I was being too optimistic... I was thinking they wanted sources with high SNR... But you are probably right...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;@corbet @lwn @jani @suihkulokki one day the photocopiers will get busy after the office hours again, but this time it's going to be linux weekly news instead of the punk fanzines&lt;/p&gt;
