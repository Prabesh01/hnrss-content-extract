  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Procedural Island Generation (III)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post continues from Part II, where we established the paint map foundation and mountain ridge system. Now we’ll add detailed noise layers, distance-based mountain peaks, and do blending to create the final terrain elevation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Paint Map (recap)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before applying noise layers, we start with the foundation established in Part I - the paint map that defines our base land/water distribution:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For visualization throughout this series, we’ll be using the magma palette from matplotlib, which I patched to artificially darken the ocean areas to highlight the coastline:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that we’ll be sampling the paint map per Delaunay triangle (at each triangle’s centroid):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that the paint map provides the broad strokes: positive values for land, negative for ocean, with smooth transitions between them. Now we’ll enhance it with noise layers to create realistic terrain detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Multi-Scale Noise Layers&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will layer multiple octaves of Simplex noise at different frequencies over the broad strokes provided by the paint map. Each will contribute different detail scales to the final terrain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;mapgen4 by @redblobgames in particular uses six layers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Layer&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Frequency&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;n₀&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;1x&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Lowest frequency&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;n₁&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;2x&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Low frequency&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;n₂&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;4x&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Medium-low frequency&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;n₄&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;16x&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Medium-high frequency&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;n₅&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;32x&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;High frequency&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;n₆&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;64x&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Highest frequency&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice the gap in numbering (n₃ is missing). This would correspond to frequency 8x, which we don’t use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Coastal Noise Enhancement&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;mapgen4 starts with coastal noise enhancement. This provides control over the variation at coastlines while keeping inland elevation unaffected:&lt;/p&gt;\[e = \text{Paint map from Part I}\] \[e_{coast} = e + \alpha \cdot (1 - e^4) \cdot \left(n_4 + \frac{n_5}{2} + \frac{n_6}{4}\right)\]&lt;p&gt;The term \((1 - e^4)\) creates a bell curve that peaks at \(e=0\) (coastline) and decreases rapidly for \(\lvert e \rvert &amp;gt; 0\). This modulates an fBm-like combination of our three highest frequency noise layers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What matters here isn’t the exact formula or amplitudes, but the core principle: applying high-frequency detail specifically where land meets water.&lt;/p&gt;\[e_{tmp} = \begin{cases} e &amp;amp; \text{if } e_{coast} &amp;gt; 0 \\ e_{coast} &amp;amp; \text{if } e_{coast} \leq 0 \end{cases}\]&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mountain Distance Field&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mountains need special pre-processing. If you remember from Part I in the swarm of seed points we tagged some as mountain peaks. Here we will pre-compute a distance field from every regular seed point to the closest mountain peak point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We compute distance through the mesh topology of the Delaunay triangulation using BFS (breadth-first search). i.e., we don’t use Euclidean distance. This creates more organic mountain shapes that follow the terrain’s natural connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The algorithm spreads outward from mountain peaks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Start at triangles containing mountain seed points (distance = 0)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Visit neighboring triangles, incrementing distance by a randomized amount&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The randomization creates natural ridge patterns instead of perfect cones&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the magic formula used for distance increment in each step:&lt;/p&gt;\[\Delta = s \cdot (1 + j \cdot r)\]&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;\(s\) = spacing between triangles (uses configured Poisson disk separation)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;\(j\) = jaggedness parameter (0 = true topological distance, 1 = very irregular)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;\(r \in [-1,1]\) = random factor using triangular distribution&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The triangular distribution &lt;code&gt;rand() - rand()&lt;/code&gt; clusters values near zero while allowing occasional larger variations. This looks more natural than uniform randomness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I implemented Fisher-Yates shuffling when visiting neighbor triangles. Instead of processing neighbors in a fixed order (which would create directional bias), the order is randomly shuffled each time. This ensures mountain ridges branch out organically in all directions rather than following predictable patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After computing distances this way, we normalize them (by the max dist, for example):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Elevation Blending&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final elevation combines all components through weighted blending:&lt;/p&gt;\[e_{final} = \begin{cases} \text{lerp}(e_{coast}^2, e_{hill}, e_{mountain}) &amp;amp; \text{if } e_{coast} &amp;gt; 0 \\ e_{coast} \cdot (\rho + n_1) &amp;amp; \text{if } e_{coast} \leq 0 \end{cases}\]&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;\(e_{hill} = h \cdot (1 + \text{lerp}(\frac{1 + n_0}{2}, n_4, n_2))\) =&amp;gt; hill elevation with noise-modulated height&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;\(e_{mountain} = 1 - \frac{\mu}{2^\sigma} \cdot d_m\) =&amp;gt; mountain elevation from distance field&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quadratic blend weight produces smooth transitions from hills near the coast through mixed terrain at mid-elevations to pure mountains at peaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With (editable) parameters:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;\(\alpha\): Coastal noise strength (0.01)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;\(h\): Hill height scale (0.02)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;\(\rho\): Ocean depth multiplier (1.5)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;\(\mu\): Mountain slope (17.6)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;\(\sigma\): Mountain sharpness (9.8)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Interactive Parameter Exploration&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Region (vs. Triangle) Elevation&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far we’ve computed elevation for triangles. But our Voronoi regions (from Part I) also need elevations for certain stages in the rest of the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each seed point defines a Voronoi region and serves as a vertex in multiple Delaunay triangles. To assign elevation to a Voronoi region, we average the elevations of all triangles that share its seed point as a vertex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Next Steps&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;With elevation complete, our island has shape but lacks the defining features carved by water. Part IV will simulate the hydrological cycle: rainfall patterns influenced by topography, rivers flowing from peaks to ocean, and valleys carved by erosion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Valuable Resources&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Terrain from Noise - Amit Patel’s Red Blob Games guide to layering noise for terrain&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Polygonal Map Generation - Red Blob Games on Voronoi-based terrain (mapgen4 inspiration)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Distance Fields for Terrain - Red Blob Games on using distance fields in terrain generation&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now on the front page of Hacker News — join the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a recent post, we introduced the Tau² benchmark, a framework for benchmaring LLMs. Today we’re sharing a surprising discovery we made while using it: a simple prompt rewrite boosted a small model’s success rate by over 20%. This post is a deep-dive on how we found and fixed this performance bottleneck by making subtle changes to agent policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benchmarking LLMs with Tau²&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the recent OpenAI Summer Update, we have seen that GPT-5 model has made significant strides in agentic tasks. To validate these claims, they’ve turned to the Tau² benchmark, which simulates real-world agent interactions across various domains like telecom, retail, and airlines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before moving any further, we have to establish that GPT-5 showed significant improvement only in one benchmark domain - which is Telecom. The other ones have been somehow overlooked during model presentation - therefore we won’t bother about them either (😉).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In agentic interactions, accuracy is non-negotiable, but model speed is equally vital for user experience. Therefore, it makes sense to consider alternatives to flagship models, such as the recently introduced GPT-5-mini.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT-5-mini offers significant advantages: it’s roughly twice as fast in latency and noticeably more efficient in throughput. While delivering 85–95% of the full GPT-5’s performance, it is also five times cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, we ran an experiment to explore two things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How well GPT-5-mini performs on this benchmark.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Whether we can improve its results by making subtle changes to the domain, such as modifying agent policies or task descriptions.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Baseline: Expect GPT-5-mini to Fail 45% of the Time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firstly, we’re going to establish the benchmark for the GPT-5-mini model. As the telecom benchmark contains over 100 tests, we’ll use their subset. Luckily, the telecom_small task set comes in handy with just 20 test scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running the benchmark with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;tau2 run \
    --domain telecom \
    --agent-llm gpt-5-mini \
    --user-llm gpt-5-mini \
    --num-trials 2 --task-set-name telecom_small&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our results are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We ended up running 40 simulations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The initial success rate was low: just 55%. The GPT-5-mini with its limited reasoning capabilities doesn’t even get close to flagship GPT-5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s an additional interesting metric this benchmark has introduced, which is pass^k. This measures how well an agent can perform when it’s challenged with the same task k times. I like to think of it as the reliability of the AI Agent.&lt;lb/&gt; Another intriguing aspect of this benchmark are tasks which failed for all given trials - which could imply that the AI Agent is simply not capable of handling at all. This can happen due to multiple factors - reasoning might be too difficult, user ask could not be specific enough, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Hack: Using Claude to Rewrite Prompts for GPT-5-mini&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When hacking the AI Agent for &lt;code&gt;GPT-5-mini&lt;/code&gt; model we aimed to answer three questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can I improve the overall success rate when using this limited model?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Are we able to “unlock” more tasks which agents are capable of handling?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Does agent reliability improve?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The beauty of generative AI is that we could offload lots of work and allow ourselves a little laziness. Therefore, we asked Claude to analyze the AI agent policies in the telecom domain, which are the building blocks for the agent prompt. From there, we asked specifically to assume that these policies are going to feed an AI Agent prompt, which will be using faster, non-flagship LLM. Output documents (&lt;code&gt;main_policy.md&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tech_support_manual.md&lt;/code&gt;) will have to be rephrased so that they are easier to follow for the agent and result in improving its behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the “executive summary” of improvements it made:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;I've created two AI-optimized versions of the telecom domain documentation:

Key Improvements Made:

1. Structure &amp;amp; Flow
   - Decision Trees: Clear branching logic with ├── and └── notation
   - Sequential Steps: Numbered, ordered procedures instead of scattered explanations
   - Prerequisites: Explicit dependency checks before proceeding

2. AI Agent Optimizations
   - Tool Call Clarity: Exact function names and parameters
   - Binary Decisions: Clear yes/no conditions instead of ambiguous language
   - Error Handling: Specific failure conditions and next steps
   - Verification Steps: "Recheck" instructions after each fix

3. Cognitive Load Reduction
   - Reference Tables: Quick lookup for tools and purposes
   - Pattern Recognition: Common issue combinations and their solutions
   - Critical Reminders: Common AI mistakes section to prevent errors

4. Actionable Language
   - Removed verbose explanations mixed with instructions
   - Consolidated multiple documents' logic into single workflows
   - Used imperative commands: "Check X", "If Y then Z"
   - Added immediate verification steps&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve moved from lengthy policy declarations to clear, directive instructions. Instead of wordy statements, the new style uses step-by-step logic, conditions, and patterns. For prompts, this works more like a checklist — “Check X → If Y, then Z” — rather than vague, descriptive policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Result: 22% Accuracy Boost and 50% Fewer Unsolvable Tasks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s review what our improved AI agent results look like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new prompts led to a significant performance boost. Pass^k metrics surged:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;k=1 from 0.55 to 0.675 (a 22.73% improvement) → In plain terms, GPT-5-mini now succeeds on 67.5% of tasks instead of 55%.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;k=2 from 0.4 to 0.5 (a 25% improvement) → Meaning retries became more effective too.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For context, flagship GPT-5 scores ~97% on this benchmark, o3 comes in at 58%, and GPT-4.1 at 34%. With our optimized prompts, GPT-5-mini not only jumped well above its own baseline but also outperformed o3, landing much closer to GPT-5 than before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The side-by-side comparison shows exactly where the gains came from. On the left side of the screen you’ll see the “stock” AI agent results, on the right - our AI agent improved for GPT-5-mini.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The screenshot above outlines that with our updated prompts and policies, we managed to “unlock” some of the tests which were previously always failing due to GPT-5-mini’s limited capabilities. Now there are only 3 tasks, which the agent didn’t manage to solve at all within the given 2 trials - compared to 6.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Key Takeaways for Your Own Models&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This experiment shows that thoughtful prompt design can meaningfully boost the performance of smaller models like GPT-5-mini. By restructuring policies into clear, step-by-step instructions, we not only improved success rates but also “unlocked” tasks that previously seemed unsolvable for the model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key was in simplifying language, reducing ambiguity, and breaking down reasoning into explicit, actionable steps. Smaller models struggle with long-winded or fuzzy policies, but thrive when given structured flows, binary decisions, and lightweight verification steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The takeaway is clear: using a frontier model to automatically optimize prompts can unlock major improvements for smaller LLMs. With strategic optimization, lightweight models can deliver decent results at a fraction of the cost — making them a compelling alternative when efficiency and affordability matter as much as accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you found this helpful, let us know! Prompt engineering is still an open playground, and we’re excited to see what creative approaches others are exploring in this space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discuss it on LinkedIn, X or Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Since publishing this post and hitting the front page of HN, some readers expressed interest in seeing the actual before and after policies (which are building block for the agent prompt). Initially I thought these would be too lengthy for the article and no one would care, but since there’s interest, I’m happy to share them in this Pull Request.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bringing fully autonomous rides to Nashville, in partnership with Lyft&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re on our way to Music City! We’re excited to bring the magic of Waymo’s fully autonomous ride-hailing service to riders in Nashville, in partnership with Lyft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our generalizable Waymo Driver has become even more capable as we’ve scaled to hundreds of thousands of fully autonomous rides each week across five major U.S. cities. We’ll start fully autonomous operations in Nashville in the coming months, and open to public riders next year. We’ll do so by pairing our world-leading technology and seamless ride-hailing service with Lyft’s proven track record of fleet management through its Flexdrive subsidiary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re also excited to offer riders in Nashville even more ways to ride with Waymo. Riders will hail via the Waymo app, and as our service grows, riders will also be able to use the Lyft app to match with a Waymo vehicle. We’re thrilled for even more people to have access to our ride-hailing service, as we work towards our mission to be the world’s most trusted driver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’re delighted to partner with Lyft and launch in Nashville next year, as we continue to scale our Waymo ride-hailing service to more people in more places,” said Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana. “Lyft’s extensive fleet management capabilities through Flexdrive make them an ideal partner for expanding to Nashville. We can’t wait to introduce Music City’s residents and visitors to the convenient, consistent, safe, and magical Waymo experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This partnership brings together best-in-class autonomous vehicles with best-in-class customer experience," said Lyft CEO David Risher. "Waymo has proven that its autonomous technology works at scale. When combined with Lyft's customer-obsession and world-class fleet management capabilities, it's two great tastes that go great together."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With more than 100 million fully autonomous miles driven on public roads, the data shows Waymo’s technology is significantly safer than human drivers in the areas where we operate. Nashville joins a growing list of cities that will soon have access to Waymo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“As families and businesses move to Tennessee in record numbers, our state continues to lead the nation in finding innovative solutions to transportation challenges," said Governor Bill Lee. "By leveraging private sector technologies like Waymo's fully autonomous vehicles, we're exploring possibilities we couldn't achieve on our own, and further accelerating economic growth. I look forward to Waymo's launch in The Volunteer State.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re looking forward to serving the people of Nashville soon. If you’re interested in following our journey or want to help bring Waymo to your city next, sign up at waymo.com/updates.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Firefox DNS privacy: Faster than ever, now on Android&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All web browsing starts with a DNS query to find the IP address for the desired service or website. For much of the internet’s history, this query is sent in the clear. DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) plugs this privacy leak by encrypting the DNS messages, so no one on the network, not your internet service provider or a free public WiFi provider, can eavesdrop on your browsing.&lt;lb/&gt;In 2020, Firefox became the first browser to roll out DoH by default, starting in the United States and in 2023, we announced the Firefox DoH-by-default rollout in Canada, powered by our trusted partner, the Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This year, we’ve built on that foundation and delivered major performance improvements and mobile support, ensuring more Firefox users benefit from privacy without compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introducing DoH for Android&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After bringing encrypted DNS protection to millions of desktop users, we’re now extending the same to mobile. Firefox users who have been waiting for DoH on Android can now turn it on and browse with the same privacy protections as on their desktops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting with this week’s release of Firefox 143 for Android, users can choose to enable DoH in Firefox on their mobile devices by selecting “Increased Protection” DoH configuration. Performance testing with Firefox DoH partners is currently underway. If DoH is as fast as we expect, we plan to enable it by default for Android users in certain regions, similar to desktop users. Until then, these configuration options provide you the choice to opt in early.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;DoH performance breakthroughs in 2025&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DNS resolution speed is critical to the browsing experience — when web pages involve multiple DNS queries, the speed difference compounds and can cause page loads to be slow. Since we first rolled out DoH in Canada, we’ve worked closely with CIRA for reliability and performance measurements. Through our strong collaboration with them and their technology partner Akamai, Firefox DoH lookups are now 61% faster year-to-date for the 75th percentile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With these performance improvements, DoH resolution time is now within a millisecond or two of native DNS resolution. This is a big win because Firefox users in Canada now get the privacy of encrypted DNS with no performance penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although the investigation and analysis started with the desire to improve DoH in Firefox, the benefits didn’t end there. Our collaboration also improved CIRA DoH performance for many of its DNS users, including Canadian universities, as well as other DNS providers relying on CIRA’s or Akamai’s server implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a win not just for Firefox users, but for the many other users around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Robust privacy on your terms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have always approached DoH with an emphasis on transparency, user choice, and strong privacy safeguards. Firefox gives users meaningful control over how their DNS traffic is handled: Users can opt out, choose their own resolver, or adjust DoH protection levels, and Firefox makes it clear what DoH is doing and why it matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firefox enforces strict requirements for DNS resolvers before trusting them with your browsing. Not every DNS provider can become a DoH provider in Firefox — only those that meet and attest to Mozilla’s rigorous Trusted Recursive Resolver (TRR) policy through a legally binding contract.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Prioritizing your privacy and speed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our work with DoH this year shows what’s possible when privacy and performance go hand-in-hand. We’ve proven that encrypted DNS can be fast, reliable, and available on desktop and Android. Just as importantly, we’ve shown that partnerships grounded in open standards and accountability can deliver benefits not only to Firefox users but to the wider internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we look forward, our commitment stays the same: Privacy should be the default, speed should never be a compromise, and the web should remain open and accessible to everyone. Choosing Firefox means choosing a browser that is built for you and for a better internet.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This library was motivated and designed over the course of many episodes on Point-Free, a video series exploring advanced programming topics in the Swift language, hosted by Brandon Williams and Stephen Celis. To support the continued development of this library, subscribe today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SQLiteData is a fast, lightweight replacement for SwiftData, including CloudKit synchronization (and even CloudKit sharing), built on top of the popular GRDB library. To populate data from the database you can use &lt;code&gt;@Table&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@FetchAll&lt;/code&gt;, which are
similar to SwiftData's &lt;code&gt;@Model&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@Query&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;SQLiteData&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;SwiftData&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;@FetchAll
var items: [Item]

@Table
struct Item {
  let id: UUID
  var title = ""
  var isInStock = true
  var notes = ""
}&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;@Query
var items: [Item]

@Model
class Item {
  var title: String
  var isInStock: Bool
  var notes: String
  init(
    title: String = "",
    isInStock: Bool = true,
    notes: String = ""
  ) {
    self.title = title
    self.isInStock = isInStock
    self.notes = notes
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both of the above examples fetch items from an external data store using Swift data types, and both are automatically observed by SwiftUI so that views are recomputed when the external data changes, but SQLiteData is powered directly by SQLite and is usable from UIKit, &lt;code&gt;@Observable&lt;/code&gt; models, and
more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more information on SQLiteData's querying capabilities, see Fetching model data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before SQLiteData's property wrappers can fetch data from SQLite, you need to provide–at runtime–the default database it should use. This is typically done as early as possible in your app's lifetime, like the app entry point in SwiftUI, and is analogous to configuring model storage in SwiftData:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;SQLiteData&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;SwiftData&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;@main
struct MyApp: App {
  init() {
    prepareDependencies {
      let db = try! DatabaseQueue(
        // Create/migrate a database
        // connection
      )
      $0.defaultDatabase = db
    }
  }
  // ...
}&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;@main
struct MyApp: App {
  let container = {
    // Create/configure a container
    try! ModelContainer(/* ... */)
  }()

  var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup {
      ContentView()
        .modelContainer(container)
    }
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more information on preparing a SQLite database, see Preparing a SQLite database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This &lt;code&gt;defaultDatabase&lt;/code&gt; connection is used implicitly by SQLiteData's strategies, like
&lt;code&gt;@FetchAll&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@FetchOne&lt;/code&gt;, which are similar to SwiftData's
&lt;code&gt;@Query&lt;/code&gt; macro, but more powerful:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;SQLiteData&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;SwiftData&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;@FetchAll
var items: [Item]

@FetchAll(Item.order(by: \.title))
var items

@FetchAll(Item.where(\.isInStock))
var items



@FetchAll(Item.order(by: \.isInStock))
var items

@FetchOne(Item.count())
var itemsCount = 0&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;@Query
var items: [Item]

@Query(sort: [SortDescriptor(\.title)])
var items: [Item]

@Query(filter: #Predicate&amp;lt;Item&amp;gt; {
  $0.isInStock
})
var items: [Item]

// No @Query equivalent of ordering
// by boolean column.

// No @Query equivalent of counting
// entries in database without loading
// all entries.&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And you can access this database throughout your application in a way similar to how one accesses a model context, via a property wrapper:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;SQLiteData&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;SwiftData&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;@Dependency(\.defaultDatabase)
var database

let newItem = Item(/* ... */)
try database.write { db in
  try Item.insert { newItem }
    .execute(db))
}&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;@Environment(\.modelContext)
var modelContext

let newItem = Item(/* ... */)
modelContext.insert(newItem)
try modelContext.save()&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more information on how SQLiteData compares to SwiftData, see Comparison with SwiftData.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further, if you want to synchronize the local database to CloudKit so that it is available on all your user's devices, simply configure a &lt;code&gt;SyncEngine&lt;/code&gt; in the entry point of the app:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@main
struct MyApp: App {
  init() {
    prepareDependencies {
      $0.defaultDatabase = try! appDatabase()
      $0.defaultSyncEngine = SyncEngine(
        for: $0.defaultDatabase,
        tables: Item.self
      )
    }
  }
  // ...
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more information on synchronizing the database to CloudKit and sharing records with iCloud users, see CloudKit Synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is all you need to know to get started with SQLiteData, but there's much more to learn. Read the articles below to learn how to best utilize this library:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;SQLiteData leverages high-performance decoding from StructuredQueries to turn fetched data into your Swift domain types, and has a performance profile similar to invoking SQLite's C APIs directly.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;SQLite is one of the most established and widely distributed pieces of software in the history of software. Knowledge of SQLite is a great skill for any app developer to have, and this library does not want to conceal it from you. So, we feel that to best wield this library you should be familiar with the basics of SQLite, including schema design and normalization, SQL queries, including joins and aggregates, and performance, including indices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With some basic knowledge you can apply this library to your database schema in order to query for data and keep your views up-to-date when data in the database changes, and you can use StructuredQueries to build queries, either using its type-safe, discoverable query building APIs, or using its &lt;code&gt;#sql&lt;/code&gt; macro for writing safe SQL strings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further, this library is built on the popular and battle-tested GRDB library for interacting with SQLite, such as executing queries and observing the database for changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This repo comes with lots of examples to demonstrate how to solve common and complex problems with SQLiteData. Check out this directory to see them all, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case Studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Demonstrates how to solve some common application problems in an isolated environment, in both SwiftUI and UIKit. Things like animations, dynamic queries, database transactions, and more.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;CloudKitDemo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;A simplified demo that shows how to synchronize a SQLite database to CloudKit and how to share records with other iCloud users. See our dedicated articles on CloudKit Synchronization and CloudKit Sharing for more information.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reminders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;A rebuild of Apple's Reminders app that uses a SQLite database to model the reminders, lists and tags. It features many advanced queries, such as searching, stats aggregation, and multi-table joins. It also features CloudKit synchronization and sharing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;SyncUps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;This application is a faithful reconstruction of one of Apple's more interesting sample projects, called Scrumdinger, and uses SQLite to persist the data for meetings. We have also added CloudKit synchronization so that all changes are automatically made available on all of the user's devices.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The documentation for releases and &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; are available here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can add SQLiteData to an Xcode project by adding it to your project as a package…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;…and adding the &lt;code&gt;SQLiteData&lt;/code&gt; product to your target.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to use SQLiteData in a SwiftPM project, it's as simple as adding it to your &lt;code&gt;Package.swift&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/pointfreeco/sqlite-data", from: "1.0.0")
]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then adding the following product to any target that needs access to the library:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;.product(name: "SQLiteData", package: "sqlite-data"),&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to discuss this library or have a question about how to use it to solve a particular problem, there are a number of places you can discuss with fellow Point-Free enthusiasts:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;uuidv47 lets you store sortable UUIDv7 in your database while emitting a UUIDv4-looking façade at your API boundary. It does this by XOR-masking only the UUIDv7 timestamp field with a keyed SipHash-2-4 stream tied to the UUID’s own random bits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;DB-friendly: UUIDv7 is time-ordered → better index locality &amp;amp; pagination.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Externally neutral: The façade hides timing patterns and looks like v4 to clients/systems.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Secret safety: Uses a PRF (SipHash-2-4). Non-crypto hashes are not suitable when the key must not leak.&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;rand_b: 62 random bits&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Façade mapping:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Encode: ts48 ^ mask48(R), set version=4&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Decode: encTS ^ mask48(R), set version=7&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Random bits unchanged&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SipHash input: 10 bytes from random field: msg[0] = (byte6 &amp;amp; 0x0F) msg[1] = byte7 msg[2] = (byte8 &amp;amp; 0x3F) msg[3..9] = bytes9..15&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invertibility: XOR mask is reversible with known key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collision analysis: Injective mapping. Only risk is duplicate randoms per ms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Goal: Secret key unrecoverable even with chosen inputs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Achieved: SipHash-2-4 is a keyed PRF.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keys: 128-bit. Derive via HKDF.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rotation: store small key ID outside UUID.&lt;/item&gt;

make coverage
make debug
sudo make install
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Do encode/decode at API boundary.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For Postgres, write tiny C extension.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For sharding, hash v4 façade with xxh3 or SipHash.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SipHash-2-4 on 10-byte message is extremely fast. No allocations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Why not xxHash with a secret? A: Not a PRF; secret can leak. Use SipHash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Q: Is façade indistinguishable from v4? A: Yes, variable bits uniform, version/variant set to v4.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the past month or so, many YouTubers have been reporting major drops to their video view counts. Theories have run wild, but there’s one explanation involving ad blockers that makes the most sense, but YouTube isn’t confirming anything directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since mid-August, many YouTubers have noticed their view counts are considerably lower than they were before, in some cases with very drastic drops. The reason for the drop, though, has been shrouded in mystery for many creators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most likely explanation seems to be that YouTube is not counting views properly for users with an ad blocker enabled, another step in the platform’s continued war on ad blockers. This was first realized by Josh Strife Hayes, who noticed that view counts on TV, phones, and tablets have been steady, while views on computers have dropped by around 50% since the mid-August trend started. TechLinked, a channel in the Linus Tech Tips family, confirmed similar numbers within its statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This aligns with one of the possible explanations that YouTube itself hinted at in an acknowledgement of lower view counts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google says:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Viewers Using Ad Blockers &amp;amp; Other Content Blocking Tools: Ad blockers and other extensions can impact the accuracy of reported view counts. Channels whose audiences include a higher proportion of users utilizing such tools may see more fluctuations in traffic related to updates to these tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Top comment by Napalmxxx2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We wouldn't need ad blockers if we weren't force fed irrelevant to us ads, unskippable ads, and the worst offender; ads that are LONGER than the video being watched.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We wouldn't feel the necessity if we weren't intruded on by a monopoly out for its own self interest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rest of the post addresses prior speculation that YouTube’s new AI-powered age verification tools were to blame – which YouTube adamantly says is not the case – while also offering other possible explanations such as “seasonal viewing habits” and competition on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;YouTube says “there is no systemic issue that is impacting creators” regarding lower view counts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This ad blocker situation does seem the most likely explanation, though. In a prior video, Linus Tech Tips had noted that while view counts were down, ad revenue was not. If computer views are the only ones down, it stands to reason that viewers using an ad blocker are not being counted correctly, especially if ad revenue isn’t taking a hit from the lower view counts. YouTube’s hint that ad blockers “can impact the accuracy of reported view counts” certainly suggests this is possible, even if it’s not firm confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How to Motivate Yourself To Do A Thing You Don't Want to Do&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learn some ways to help encourage action when you feel unmotivated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have an air bike in our basement. If you are unfamiliar with air bikes, they are similar to stationary bikes with foot pedals but also have handles you push and pull with your arms. It uses air resistance, so the harder you pedal and move your arms, the higher the resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s also known as an assault bike. 😬&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which is apt, because it’s a butt-kicker of a workout. I use it about once a week, more frequently in the winter when it’s too cold to run, and less often in the summer when I can get outside more. And I kind of hate it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before I even drag myself to our basement, I’m already dreading it. The only way I can convince myself to do it is by finding a suitably engaging show I can distract myself with on my phone while I huff and puff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every time, I start my warm-up and think to myself,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s only 30 minutes, I can do this!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like clockwork, within the first three minutes, I think, “Maybe I will only do ten minutes today and do some pilates or weights instead.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After ten minutes, I think, “OK, surely I can make it to 20 minutes, and that will be enough”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After 20 minutes, as I gasp for air and sweat soaks through my shirt, I think “Well, I already made it to 20 minutes… I guess I will just finish it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then I proceed to huff and puff to the end, wherein I walk my wobbly legs back up the stairs to do a cooldown. At which point I think, “That suuuuuucked…” And then congratulate myself on finishing as I try to get my heart rate back to normal. 🥵&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This mental dance happens, without fail, every single time I ride.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I share this anecdote because it illustrates how tricky motivation can be, especially when faced with something you don’t want to do or have been procrastinating on. There are any number of things you have to deal with in your life that you don’t want to. There are even things you might generally enjoy that feel like they are hanging over you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pattern often goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Before you start, it feels daunting, and the prospect lingers in the back of your mind. You know it needs to be done, but you really, really don’t feel like it. You leave it until it starts to loom larger and larger.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When you finally convince yourself to start, it’s not what you want to be doing, but it’s generally fine. It’s often not even as bad as you thought it would be, and it feels good to make progress.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As you near the end, you can even push yourself a little to wrap it up and get it off your plate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When it’s over, you feel relieved, like a weight has been taken off your shoulders, and you are both pleased with yourself and a little annoyed that it took you so long to deal with.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Motivation is a topic that comes up with nearly all my clients, as they navigate the various complexities of their lives. In some ways, motivation seems simple. You ask yourself, “Why can’t I just make myself be motivated to do the thing?”, whatever the thing might be. However, as you beat yourself up about it, consider that many factors influence our decision-making and the feeling of being motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Humans are complex creatures, with numerous brain chemicals and hormones influencing our overall physical and emotional state, which themselves are constantly impacted, sometimes drastically, by things like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Have you been sleeping well and enough?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Have you been eating well and the right amount for you?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Have you been imbibing in alcohol or other things?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Have you been moving your body regularly?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Do you have any physical or mental conditions?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Are you in pain?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Do you have significant life stressors at this time?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What time of day is it?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Where are you in your natural hormone cycles?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How old are you?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Have you had any conflicts in your life recently?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Did you move your body in a way entirely within your usual routines, but apparently in a way that is no longer acceptable?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Did you sleep in a slightly different position than usual, and now your back will never be the same again?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could go on, but you get the idea.😅&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of these factors (and more) conspire to shift your mood, physical energy, and mental energy, often making it harder to muster the motivation to do things. What, then, can you do to move things in the right direction? How do you motivate yourself to do a thing you don’t want to do?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are several ways to help encourage action when you feel unmotivated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. Think about why you are feeling unmotivated&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many external and internal factors, as listed above, that contribute to motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When your body isn’t feeling good, it’s harder to make it do things.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When your mind is tired, distracted, or overwhelmed, it’s challenging to focus and accomplish tasks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When the thing you need to do isn’t important to you or something you don’t like, it’s hard to make yourself do it.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you know why you aren’t motivated, you can think about what you could change to make things easier on yourself. What factors do you have control over?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Environment - Is there a place you can go or a thing you can add that will make it feel easier? For example, I have my writing desk set up in a quiet corner of my bedroom (not the office I share with my husband) to help make writing easier, even when I am not feeling it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mood - Is there something that will help boost your mood? Go for a ten-minute walk, treat yourself to a donut, text your best friend for a pep talk, turn on your favourite tunes… anything that will give you a little pick-me-up.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Body - Are there things you can do to take care of your body to make it feel better? Try some stretching, take a nap, meditate, read a book, get some fresh air, go for a run, eat a comfort meal, or do anything that will help your body feel less stressed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Negative or fear motivators - Is the thing you are not motivated to do being motivated by negative or fear motivators? These include things like fear of judgment, fear of conflict, shame, guilt, or obligation. These motivators only go so far and deserve further examination to determine their place in your priorities. Maybe they aren’t things you need to do in the first place.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key point here is to identify where you have control and where you don’t, and then do your best to adapt your circumstances to make it easier to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2. Identify what does motivate you&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you think about the various activities and tasks you do each day, what is it that encourages you to do them? Some of those things will be negative motivators, as I mentioned above, but others will be things you do for fun, because they are interesting or rewarding. These are some tactics to consider for things that might help motivate you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Combine the task with something you enjoy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know what makes cleaning out the garage a lot better? Some good tunes. Throw on an audiobook while you cook dinner. Watch a good show while you huff and puff on the air bike! Think about the things you enjoy and consider how you can combine them with the thing you're trying to motivate yourself to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Add external accountability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes it can be challenging to push yourself to do something when there are no external motivators. Ask a friend to be your accountability buddy, or hire a professional to help you stay accountable for the thing you're trying to do, such as a coach, trainer, teacher, or dietitian. I know that one of the significant value-added benefits my clients get from working with me for a few months is having someone they have to report back to on their progress!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Gamify&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is there any way to turn the process or thing you are unmotivated to do into a game? Can you add rewards if you do a certain amount, or set a goal for how many days you make progress in a row? For example, one of my motivators for doing some kind of fitness every day is keeping up my streak! 2817 days in a row as of publishing. 😁&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Celebrate milestones&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond small planned rewards, having something to look forward to as you make progress on your task or activity can also help encourage you to continue moving forward. Maybe you take a day off, order your favourite takeout, or simply share it with someone you care about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more specifics on types of motivation, read my article, What Motivates You? Learn the Types of Motivation and How to Use Them, where I get into more detail about intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3. Break it into smaller chunks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If part of why you feel unmotivated is that what you need to do feels big and overwhelming, often the best thing you can do is try to break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. What is the smallest amount you can do to make a bit of progress?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Commit to spending 5 minutes on it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Choose a small corner of a room you need to clean&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Commit to writing the outline&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write the text, even if you don’t send it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Plan in your calendar when you will do it, so you don’t have it sitting in the back of your mind&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Talk about it with your partner or a friend&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Switch tasks to take a break and come back to it&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often, getting over the hump of starting something is enough to help push you through it. Even if it isn’t, at the very least, you have made some amount of progress, which you can build on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4. Consistency over motivation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the thing you need to do is something you need to do regularly, like writing, fitness, practicing an instrument, or cleaning, you can’t rely purely on motivation to drive you. Even for things you enjoy, it’s easy to push something off “until you feel like it”. But with so many factors affecting your mood and energy, the times when you feel like it will be fleeting. Instead of relying on motivation, try to establish a routine that fosters consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Plan your intentional week so you have an idea of when you intend to do it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set a daily reminder&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Book it in your calendar&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set a certain amount of time you will put aside each day or week to chip away at it&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A little bit, consistently, will go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;5. Put it on the back burner&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when you are not feeling motivated to do something, it’s reasonable to just put it on the back burner. Maybe it’s just not a priority right now, and that’s totally fine! Ask yourself, is this a glass ball or a plastic ball? If it’s plastic, set it aside for a bit and focus your time and energy on other things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's ok to decide now is not the right time, but make it an intentional decision instead of something you avoid and feel bad about!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're struggling with motivation, you're not alone! It’s normal, it’s natural, and there are tons of different, ever-changing factors that will change how you feel. Do your best to examine where you are at, control what you can control, and make progress where you can!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;mssql-python is a Python driver for Microsoft SQL Server and the Azure SQL family of databases. It leverages Direct Database Connectivity (DDBC) that enables direct connections to SQL Server without requiring an external driver manager. Designed to comply with the DB API 2.0 specification, this driver also introduces Pythonic enhancements for improved usability and functionality. It supports a full range of database operations, including connection management, query execution, and transaction handling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The driver is compatible with all the Python versions &amp;gt;= 3.10&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Documentation | Release Notes | Roadmap&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note: This project is currently in Public Preview, meaning it is still under active development. We are working on core functionalities and gathering more feedback before GA. Please use with caution and avoid production environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows: mssql-python can be installed with pip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install mssql-python&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MacOS: mssql-python can be installed with pip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# For Mac, OpenSSL is a pre-requisite - skip if already present
brew install openssl
pip install mssql-python&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linux: mssql-python can be installed with pip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# For Alpine

# For Debian/Ubuntu  
apt-get install -y libltdl7 libkrb5-3 libgssapi-krb5-2

# For RHEL
dnf install -y libtool-ltdl krb5-libs

# For SUSE
zypper install -y libltdl7 libkrb5-3 libgssapi-krb5-2

# For SUSE/openSUSE
zypper install -y libltdl7

pip install mssql-python&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Windows, MacOS and Linux (manylinux - Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, SUSE (x64 only) &amp;amp; musllinux - Alpine)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note: SUSE Linux ARM64 is not supported by Microsoft ODBC Driver. Use x64 architecture for SUSE deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Microsoft mssql-python module is designed to be fully compliant with the DB API 2.0 specification. This ensures that the driver adheres to a standardized interface for database access in Python, providing consistency and reliability across different database systems. Key aspects of DBAPI v2.0 compliance include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Connection Objects: Establishing and managing connections to the database.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cursor Objects: Executing SQL commands and retrieving results.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transaction Management: Supporting commit and rollback operations to ensure data integrity.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Error Handling: Providing a consistent set of exceptions for handling database errors.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parameter Substitution: Allowing the use of placeholders in SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By adhering to the DB API 2.0 specification, the mssql-python module ensures compatibility with a wide range of Python applications and frameworks, making it a versatile choice for developers working with Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Managed Instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Microsoft mssql-python driver enables Python applications to connect to Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, or Azure SQL Managed Instance using Microsoft Entra ID identities. It supports a variety of authentication methods, including username and password, Microsoft Entra managed identity (system-assigned and user-assigned), Integrated Windows Authentication in a federated, domain-joined environment, interactive authentication via browser, device code flow for environments without browser access, and the default authentication method based on environment and configuration. This flexibility allows developers to choose the most suitable authentication approach for their deployment scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EntraID authentication is now fully supported on MacOS and Linux but with certain limitations as mentioned in the table:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Authentication Method&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;macOS/Linux Support&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Notes&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Interactive login via browser; requires user interaction&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ActiveDirectoryMSI (Managed Identity)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅ Yes&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅ Yes&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;For Azure VMs/containers with managed identity&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ActiveDirectoryServicePrincipal&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅ Yes&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅ Yes&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Use client ID and secret or certificate&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ActiveDirectoryIntegrated&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅ Yes&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;❌ No&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Only works on Windows (requires Kerberos/SSPI)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ActiveDirectoryDeviceCode&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅ Yes&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅ Yes&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Device code flow for authentication; suitable for environments without browser access&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ActiveDirectoryDefault&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅ Yes&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;✅ Yes&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Uses default authentication method based on environment and configuration&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For more information on Entra ID please refer this document&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The driver offers a suite of Pythonic enhancements that streamline database interactions, making it easier for developers to execute queries, manage connections, and handle data more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Microsoft mssql_python driver provides built-in support for connection pooling, which helps improve performance and scalability by reusing active database connections instead of creating a new connection for every request. This feature is enabled by default. For more information, refer Connection Pooling Wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Connect to SQL Server and execute a simple query:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import mssql_python

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Severe Drought in Iraq Reveals Dozens of Ancient Tombs Created 2,300 Years Ago&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The tombs, which likely date to Iraq’s Hellenistic period, were discovered along the Mosul Dam reservoir&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Archaeologists have discovered 40 tombs in Iraq after severe droughts lowered water levels in the country’s largest reservoir, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tombs were discovered along the Mosul Dam reservoir in the Duhok province in northern Iraq. They are thought to be more than 2,300 years old, likely from the Hellenistic period, when Iraq was under the rule of the Seleucid empire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Quick fact: The reach of the Seleucid empire&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At its peak, the empire stretched from what is now Turkey to the edges of India.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A team of archaeologists had surveyed the same area in 2023, also when water levels were low. However, they only spotted parts of the tombs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time, conditions were different. Iraq is in the midst of one of its driest years on record in nearly a century, according to Al Jazeera. Severe water shortages are threatening the country’s health and safety as water reserves have dwindled to just 8 percent of their full capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When water levels in the Mosul Dam reservoir dropped “to their lowest,” archaeologists were able to return and access the tombs, Bekas Brefkany, leader of the site’s archaeological work, tells AFP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“While the receding waters have had negative impacts, for us as archaeologists, they have also provided an opportunity to rediscover areas that had long been hidden underwater,” Brefkany explains to the Art Newspaper’s Hadani Ditmars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brefkany and his team are racing to excavate the tombs before the dam is flooded again. They’ll be transferred to the Duhok Museum for study and preservation. As Brefkany tells the Art Newspaper, he hopes that researchers will eventually be able to “shed more light on causes of death, family ties and the broader social context of these burials.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iraq has contended with numerous droughts in recent years, leading to archaeological discoveries across the country. In 2022, ruins of a 3,400-year-old city were found in a dried-up section of the Mosul Dam along the Tigris River.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They have also brought regions of the country to the brink of humanitarian disaster, which experts warn will worsen if the government doesn’t intervene, per Al Jazeera. According to the United Nations, Iraq is one of the countries “most vulnerable to the impact of climate change” due to rising temperatures, frequent sand and dust storms, and water scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As water levels continue to drop, the archaeologists expect to unearth more artifacts, Nazim Zibari, an archaeologist at the site, tells AFP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This work that we are doing now is very difficult, complex and it takes time,” Zibari says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, archaeologists found a rare stone relief among the ruins of ancient Assyrian metropolis Nineveh in Mosul, a city in northern Iraq. The artifact depicts important deities alongside Ashurbanipal, the last great king of the Assyrian empire.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;@ctrl/tinycolor Supply Chain Attack Post-mortem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;by Scott Cooper&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TL;DR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A malicious GitHub Actions workflow was pushed to a shared repo and exfiltrated a npm token with broad publish rights. The attacker then used that token to publish malicious versions of 20 packages, including &lt;code&gt;@ctrl/tinycolor&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My GitHub account, the @ctrl/tinycolor repository were not directly compromised. There was no phishing involved, and no malicious packages were installed on my machine and I already use pnpm to avoid unapproved postinstall scripts. There was no pull request involved because a repo admin does not need a pull request to add new github actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub/npm security responded quickly, unpublishing the malicious versions. I followed by releasing clean versions to flush caches, as advised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For broader context, see Socket’s write-up or StepSecurity’s analysis. For community discussion, see this Hacker News post, which spent 24 hours on the front page. I’m also finding this wiz.io post helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How I Found Out&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On September 15 around 4:30 PM PT, Wes Todd DM’d me on Bluesky and looped me into the OpenJS Foundation Slack. By that point, Wes had already alerted GitHub/npm security, who were compiling lists of affected packages and rapidly unpublishing compromised versions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early guidance (attributed to Daniel Pereira) was to look for suspicious &lt;code&gt;Shai-Hulud&lt;/code&gt; repos or branches. I wasn’t able to find any of these repos or branches on my own personal repos. The mystery was: how was I impacted at all?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Shai-Hulud was the Fremen term for the sandworm of Arrakis. - dune wiki&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What Actually Happened&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A while ago, I collaborated on angulartics2, a shared repository where multiple people still had admin rights. That repo still contained a GitHub Actions secret — a npm token with broad publish rights. This collaborator had access to projects with other people which I believe explains some of the other 40 initial packages that were affected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new Shai-Hulud branch was force pushed to angulartics2 with a malicious github action workflow by a collaborator. The workflow ran immediately on push (did not need review since the collaborator is an admin) and stole the npm token. With the stolen token, the attacker published malicious versions of 20 packages. Many of which are not widely used, however the @ctrl/tinycolor package is downloaded about 2 million times a week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub and npm security teams moved quickly to unpublish the malicious versions. I then re-published fresh, verified versions of the packages I maintain to flush caches and restore trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Impact&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Malicious versions of several packages — including @ctrl/tinycolor — were briefly available on npm before removal. Installing those compromised versions would have triggered a postinstall payload, which is documented in detail by StepSecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What should you do if you’ve installed a compromised version of a package? see StepSecurity’s immediate actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Publishing Setup &amp;amp; Interim Plan&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I currently use semantic-release with GitHub Actions to handle publishing. The automation is convenient and predictable. I also have npm provenance enabled on many packages, which provides attestations of how they were built. Unfortunately, provenance didn’t prevent this attack because the attacker had a valid token.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My goal is to move to npm’s Trusted Publishing (OIDC) to eliminate static tokens altogether. However, semantic-release integration is still in progress: npm/cli#8525.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the forseeable future, @ctrl/tinycolor requires 2FA for publishing, and all tokens have been revoked. Not expecting to merge any new changes anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For smaller packages, I’ll continue using semantic-release but under stricter controls: no new contributors will be added, and each repo will use a granular npm token limited to publish-only rights for that specific package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Local 2FA based publishing isn’t sustainable, so I’m watching OIDC/Trusted Publishing closely and will adopt it as soon as it fits the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I plan to continue using pnpm that prevents unapproved postinstall scripts from being run and I’ll look into adding pnpm’s new minimumReleaseAge setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Publishing Wishlist&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I could wave a magic wand and design my ideal setup, npm would allow me to require Trusted Publishing (OIDC) with a single toggle for all of my packages. That same toggle would block any release missing provenance, enforcing security at the account level. I’d also want first-class semantic-release support with OIDC and provenance so no static tokens are ever needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of that, I’d like a secure, human-approved publishing option directly in the GitHub UI: a protected workflow_dispatch flow that uses github 2FA approval to satisfy 2FA, without requiring me to publish from my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub Environments — or equivalent workflow protections — should be available without a Pro subscription, or else integrated directly into Trusted Publishing so that security doesn’t depend on the pricing tier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be really nice if NPM also had a more visible mark on the package details page to indicate if the package had a postinstall script. Also, once the packages are pulled its not clear what versions were removed and why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thanks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to Wes Todd, the OpenJS Foundation, and the GitHub/npm security teams for their rapid and coordinated response. Everyone was incredibly fast, helpful, and knowledgeable.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Abstract&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depression and anxiety are often characterized by altered reward-seeking and avoidance, respectively. Yet less is known about the relationship between depressive symptoms and specific avoidance behaviors. To address this gap, we conducted two studies. In Study 1, undergraduates and online workers completed an uninstructed go/no-go avoidance task (NTotal = 465) as a reverse translation of a rodent paradigm. Participants exhibited a wide range of symptom scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), ranging from low to severe. In Study 1, cues were used to signal the response type (go/active vs no-go/inhibitory) required to avoid an aversive sound. Higher depressive scores were associated with poorer acquisition of active avoidance in undergraduates. Overall participants showed lower accuracy for active than inhibitory avoidance. To examine whether the better no-go trial performance reflected a prepotent response to avoid aversive outcomes, in Study 2, undergraduates (NTotal = 330) completed a version of the task that included reward-seeking. Here all participants showed higher accuracy for active reward-seeking and inhibitory avoidance, consistent with a prepotent response to inhibit action to avoid aversive consequences. These findings suggest that in young adults, depressive symptoms are associated with difficulty in overriding prepotent responses to actively avoid aversive outcomes in the absence of reward. This work bridges the gap between preclinical animal models and clinical research, offering insights that could guide the development of more targeted clinical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Translational studies in community samples are crucial for bridging the gap between rodent models, which delineate neural circuitry and pharmacology underlying specific behaviors, and the presentation of mood disorders in clinic settings. Building on rodent studies of avoidance behaviors, thought to be linked to depression, this study examines how depressive symptom scores relate to specific types of avoidance. Our findings revealed that higher depressive symptom scores were associated with reduced capacity to learn active avoidance behaviors, which involved overriding a prepotent response to inhibit action to avoid aversive consequences. This work bridges the gap between preclinical animal models and clinical research, offering insights that may guide the development of more targeted clinical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stimuli that predict aversive events typically evoke avoidance responses aimed at minimizing anticipated threats. Depending on the situation, an active strategy, such as taking an action (walking away), may be most effective, while in other situations, the inhibition of motor output (staying put to avoid detection) may be the more prudent strategy. Although effective in many contexts, these strategies can become maladaptive in depression and anxiety, interfering with goal-directed behavior (Ottenbreit et al., 2014; Haskell et al., 2020).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depression is a leading cause of global disability (Whiteford et al., 2013; World Health Organization, 2017), yet its cognitive and behavioral mechanisms remains to be fully understood. The Altered Computations underlying Decision Making (ACDM) framework posits that decision-making biases perpetuate both depression and anxiety (Bishop and Gagne, 2018). Depression is marked by reduced engagement in reward-seeking, while anxiety by heightened avoidance. In depression, impairments arise from underestimating the probability and value of positive outcomes, and overestimating the effort required to obtain them (Bishop and Gagne, 2018), ultimately leading to reduced engagement in actions. Supporting this view, individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) choose high-effort, high-reward options less frequently, anticipate fewer positive experiences, and rate them as less pleasurable (MacLeod and Salaminiou, 2001; Treadway et al., 2012; Mukherjee et al., 2020; Horne et al., 2021). Although the ACDM primarily distinguishes between depression-related biases in reward-seeking, it also suggests that effort-related impairments may extend to avoidance contexts and contribute to reduced active avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite this, the role of active versus inhibitory forms of avoidance remains underexplored in depression, reflecting broader trends in which negatively valenced systems are predominantly studied in anxiety (Craske et al., 2009). Cognitive theories of depression emphasize a negativity bias in attention, memory, and future expectations (Mogg et al., 2006; Fales et al., 2008; Disner et al., 2011) but often rely on self-report and lack emphasis on behaviors with translational utility for identifying cross-species neurobiological mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning tasks offer a translational approach for examining negatively valenced systems and have been applied across neuropsychiatric conditions (Endrass et al., 2011; Palminteri et al., 2012; Reinen et al., 2016; Waltz et al., 2018), including depression (Chase et al., 2010; Robinson et al., 2012; Mkrtchian et al., 2017; Mukherjee et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2023). These studies typically involve probabilistic and reversal learning tasks to probe sensitivity to reward and punishment. Findings remain mixed: some report reward-specific impairments in depression (Robinson et al., 2012), others find broader impairments across valence (Chase et al., 2010; Mkrtchian et al., 2017; Mukherjee et al., 2020) or even heightened punishment sensitivity (Murphy et al., 2003; Nord et al., 2018), while others identify learning-specific impairments (Chase et al., 2010; Mukherjee et al., 2020). These inconsistencies highlight the need for behavioral assays that isolate avoidance processes and align with cross-species models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Translational gaps can stem from task design. Human studies typically use secondary reinforcers (i.e., monetary rewards or feedback), with punishment operationalized as monetary loss, and avoidance inferred from decreased selection of high-loss options, often omitting safety signals. In contrast, animal paradigms use primary reinforcers (i.e., shock) and deterministic contingencies and explicitly distinguish between active and inhibitory avoidance (Piantadosi et al., 2018; Capuzzo and Floresco, 2020). Although functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies show overlapping blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) responses to primary and secondary aversive cues, regions like the amygdala are more responsive to primary aversive cues (Delgado et al., 2011). Importantly, shared BOLD activation does not necessarily imply equivalent neural mechanisms—especially when task features might differ meaningfully. Translating animal behavioral paradigms to humans has been proposed as a promising strategy to enhance cross-species translation and improve psychiatric treatment development (Kirlic et al., 2017).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To address these gaps, we adapted a validated rodent task designed to assess both active and inhibitory avoidance (Piantadosi et al., 2018; Capuzzo and Floresco, 2020) and deployed it in a large online sample. While prior human studies have included related features, our avoidance task was modeled to parallel the original rodent paradigm. Our aim was to examine how depressive symptom severity relates to the ability to learn and flexibly implement active and inhibitory avoidance strategies. Using a dimensional approach aligned with Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) principles, we recruited a nonclinical sample reporting a broad range of depressive symptoms. We hypothesized that higher depressive symptom scores would be associated with impairments in active—but not inhibitory—avoidance, consistent with ACDM predictions of reduced behavioral engagement stemming from effort overestimation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Study 1 (avoidance)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Participants&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We conducted a power analysis using G*Power to detect a small effect size &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Materials&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Stimuli&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The task was created in PsychoPy 2020.1 (RRID: SCR_006571) and distributed via Pavlovia (www.pavlovia.org; Peirce et al., 2019). Simple shapes signaled the type of response (active vs inhibitory) required to avoid an aversive sound. Coauthor I.D.D. recorded a set of screeching and scraping sounds (i.e., knife on glass, fork on plate, metal on slate), from which 45 were pilot-tested for unpleasantness and salience (N = 45). Using 9-point Likert scales, eight sounds with the highest combined ratings (unpleasantness: M = 6.87–7.57; salience: M = 5.82–6.83) and lowest variance were selected. These eight aversive sounds were randomly presented on failed trials and were found to be highly motivating. In Study 1, 92.46% of participants who responded to a debriefing question (N = 464) endorsed the aversive sounds as motivating to avoid. Rapid acquisition of instrumental avoidance responses further supports the functional aversiveness of the stimuli. On successful trials, a white border around the gray background signaled safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Measures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depressive and anxiety symptom scores were derived from the clinically validated Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck et al., 1988b; Beck et al., 1996) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; Beck et al., 1988a), respectively. One question (suicidality ideation) was removed from the BDI-II for ethical considerations. BDI-II symptom scores were calculated as a proportion score (BDI-IIscore/BDI-IImax_possible_score) for each participant. Similarly, BAI scores are reported as proportion scores (BAIscore/BAImax_possible_score) for consistency and comparability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Procedure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants were tested on a computer-based avoidance task that was reverse-translated from a rodent operant paradigm assessing active/inhibitory avoidance—with some modifications (Piantadosi et al., 2018; Capuzzo and Floresco, 2020). Prior to the avoidance task, participants completed an effort calibration and a volume calibration to control for differences in physical ability and computer systems (see https://osf.io/5sepm/).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Active/inhibitory avoidance task&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specific shapes (circle or squares; counterbalanced) signaled active (“Go”) versus inhibitory (“No-Go”) responses required to avoid a highly aversive sound. The avoidance task consisted of three task stages: acquisition, intermixed, and reversal (Fig. 1A). (1) The acquisition stage required learning an active avoidance response. During the acquisition stage, participants had to reach a criterion performance of 80% successful trials within the previous 20 trials (maximum 120 trials). Once acquisition criterion was reached, participants performed an additional 30 “over-learning” active avoidance trials before an unsignaled transition into the next task stage. Participants failing to reach criterion performance during the acquisition stage were excluded from data analysis. (2) The intermixed stage required participants to learn the inhibitory avoidance response while flexibly deploying both active and inhibitory responses. This stage consisted of 120 avoidance trials (60 active, 60 inhibitory), presented in a pseudorandomized order. (3) The reversal stage also consisted of 120 avoidance trials (60 active, 60 inhibitory; pseudorandomized), but with active and inhibitory response contingencies reversed. The multiple task stages allowed us to assess distinct patterns in the acquisition and expression of active/inhibitory avoidance, as well as reversal learning. Importantly, participants were not instructed about the cue–response contingencies to allow the acquisition through reinforcement, to mirror the rodent paradigm the task was translated from.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trials began with a fixation cross onscreen (ISI; 2,000 ms; jittered 1,200 ms). Active avoidance required an effortful response—specifically, 3, 4, or 5 rapid button presses (criterion determined during effort calibration test). On successful active trials (Fig. 1B), participants made the required response within the cue period (≤1,200 ms), resulting in the avoidance of the aversive sound and the presentation of a safety signal (1,000 ms). On failed active trials (Fig. 1C), either an insufficient response or no response within the cue period triggered the aversive sound (1,000 ms). On inhibitory trials, participants were required to withhold responding. On successful inhibitory trials (Fig. 1D), participants made no button presses during the cue period (1,200 ms), resulting in the avoidance of the aversive sound and the presentation of a safety signal (1,000 ms). On failed inhibitory trials (Fig. 1E), an erroneous button press triggered the aversive sound. A graphical overview of the avoidance task is provided in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Statistical analysis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All analyses were conducted in R 4.2.1 (R Core Team, 2013) using RStudio (Booth et al., 2018). Primary outcome measures included proportion correct for active and inhibitory trials across task stages and the number of trials to criterion during acquisition. Within-subjects ANOVAs were used except where otherwise stated. Significant main effects or interactions were followed by pairwise comparisons using the emmeans package (Searle et al., 1980; Lenth, 2017), with Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) correction. Between-subject ANOVAs tested sex and sample effects on BDI-II scores. To examine individual differences, we used regression and linear mixed models (lmerTest; fit by REML, t tests using Satterthwaite's method; Bates et al., 2015; Kuznetsova et al., 2017) to assess BDI-II scores effects on task performance. To account for multiple comparisons, the Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). We present only the BDI-II analyses in the main text, while corresponding analyses for BAI scores are presented in Extended Data (Extended Data Figs. 2-1, 4-1; Extended Data Tables 3-1, 3-3).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Study 2 (reward-seeking/avoidance)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Participants&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Undergraduate participants (N = 771) from the University of British Columbia Psychology Human Subjects Pool were recruited to perform a reward-seeking/avoidance task. Power analysis procedures were identical to Study 1. Recruitment focused exclusively on undergraduates, as effects in Study 1 were strongest in this population. Compensation was identical to the undergraduate sample in Study 1. To motivate performance during reward-seeking trials, participants were told their accumulated points would contribute to the value of a gift card, although participants ultimately received a $5 gift card regardless of performance. Exclusion criteria were similar to Study 1, with the added requirement that participants reach criterion accuracy during acquisition for both reward-seeking and avoidance trials independently. Because the task was designed as a reinforcement-based learning paradigm—with minimal instructions, no explicit information about contingencies, and no practice trials—and given variability in motivation among undergraduates completing online studies for credit, exclusions rates were higher than expected, resulting in lower-than-ideal power. For details on participant exclusion rates, see Discussion and Extended Data (Extended Data Table 1-1). After cleaning, the final sample included N = 330 participants (Nfemale = 245; Nmale = 85). The study was approved by the University of British Columbia Behavioral Research Ethics Board (BREB) under certificate H20-01388. Demographic information for Study 2 can be found in Table 1.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Materials&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Stimuli and measures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The task was implemented using PsychoPy and Pavlovia (same as Study 1) with modification to incorporate reward-seeking trials. Stimuli included four simple shapes (blue; square, circle, triangle, hexagon) counterbalanced across response type (active vs inhibitory) and motivational context (reward-seeking vs avoidance). As in Study 1, participants completed questionnaire measures, effort, and volume calibrations procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Mixed-motivation go/no-go task&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mixed-motivation task consisted of two stages: (1) an acquisition stage, where participants learned active reward-seeking and active avoidance responses, and (2) an intermixed stage, which required the flexible expression of active and inhibitory responses across reward-seeking and avoidance contexts. During the acquisition stage, participants had to reach 80% accuracy within the previous 20 trials, independently for both active reward-seeking and active avoidance trials. After reaching the acquisition criterion, participants completed 24 “over-learning” trials (12 reward-seeking and 12 avoidance) before an unsignaled transition into the intermixed stage. Participants who failed to reach criterion were excluded from analysis. The intermixed stage consisted of 240 trials (60 of each type—active reward-seeking, inhibitory reward-seeking, active avoidance, inhibitory avoidance), presented in a pseudorandomized order. The reversal stage used in Study 1 was omitted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trials began with a fixation cross (ISI; 2,000 ms; jittered 1,200 ms). Active responses required 3, 4, or 5 button presses within the 1,200 ms cue period (threshold determined during effort calibration). On successful trials, participants either earned 5 points or avoided an aversive sound, depending on the motivational context. Successful reward-seeking trials provided a reward signal (1,000 ms; white border), while successful avoidance trials were followed by a safety signal (1,000 ms; white border). On failed trials, participants either received no points (reward-seeking) or were presented with an aversive sound (avoidance). Points accumulated were displayed on reward-seeking trials, and a musical tone (C major chord; 1,100 ms) played each time participants earned an additional 25 points.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Statistical analysis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analytical procedures followed Study 1. Accuracy (proportion correct) and trials to criterion during acquisition were the primary outcomes. Linear mixed models tested BDI-II symptom scores effects on active and inhibitory accuracy across motivational contexts. FDR corrections were used for multiple comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Code accessibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No computational neuroscience models were developed for this study. However, extended data and code used to conduct the linear mixed models are available at https://osf.io/5sepm/.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Study 1 (avoidance)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Demographics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To assess differences between undergraduates and online workers, we first compared self-reported depressive and anxiety symptom scores. There was no difference in depressive symptom scores (F(1,463) = 0.34, p = 0.56; Fig. 2A), but undergraduates reported significantly higher anxiety symptom scores compared with online workers (F(1,463) = 13.84, p &amp;lt; 0.001; Extended Data Fig. 2-1). Sex and gender responses were highly congruent (&amp;gt;96%); due to limited statistical power for non-cis gender categories, subsequent analyses refer to sex only. Females reported higher depressive (F(1,463) = 7.96, p &amp;lt; 0.01; Fig. 2B) and higher anxiety (F(1,463) = 33.63, p &amp;lt; 0.001; Extended Data Fig. 2-1) symptom scores than males. Finally, there was a significant age difference between samples (F(1,462) = 299.8, p &amp;lt; 0.001), with undergraduates being younger on average compared with online workers (Extended Data Fig. 2-2).&lt;/p&gt;

A) Anxiety score distributions by sample: Undergraduates (red) and Online Workers (blue). B) Anxiety score distributions by sex: Female (red) and Male (blue). The x-axis represents proportion scores, where raw BAI scores, ranging from 0-63, have been divided by the maximum possible score (63) to produce a proportion between 0 and 1. This adjustment was made for comparability between the BDI-II and BAI scales. The labels on the x-axis -- Minimal (0-7), Mild-Moderate (8-25), Severe (26-63) -- reflect typical ranges of raw scores for ease of interpretation. Dashed vertical lines represent the mean BAI score for each group. In panel A, a significant difference in anxiety levels between sample groups is indicated (p &amp;lt; .001), with undergraduates scoring higher on average than online workers.

    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Within-subject results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Acquisition. The acquisition task stage assessed initial learning of the active avoidance response. Participants showed robust acquisition, with an average accuracy of 0.79 (SD = 0.15; Fig. 3A). The mean number of trials to reach criterion (≥80% correct in 20 trial period) was 29.65 (SD = 18.42; range, 16–120 trials; Fig. 4A). Higher BDI-II scores were associated with a greater number of trials needed to reach criterion during acquisition, but this effect was specific to undergraduates (Fig. 4B; see https://osf.io/5sepm/).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Figure 4-1&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Study 1: Trials to Criterion for Active Avoidance During the Acquisition Stage. A) Number of trials required to reach criterion for all participants in the avoidance task. Individual data points (green circles) represent the number of trials each participant required to reach the criterion of 80% correct responses within 20-trial period during acquisition. B) Interaction between anxiety scores (BAI proportion scores) and the sample group (Undergraduates vs. Online Workers) predicting trials to criterion for active avoidance. The regression lines show the relationship between anxiety scores and trials to criterion for each sample, with a stronger effect observed in undergraduates (β = 16.14) compared to online workers (β = -3.81). A significant main effect of BAI scores (p &amp;lt; .01) and a significant BAI × Sample interaction (p &amp;lt; .05) are indicated. Download Figure 4-1, TIF file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intermixed and reversal. The intermixed task stage assessed participants’ ability to switch between active and inhibitory responses using discriminative cues, while the reversal task stage assessed behavioral flexibility when cue–response contingencies were reversed. A 2 × 2 within-subjects ANOVA assessing proportion correct, with Avoidance Type (active, inhibitory) and Task Stage (intermixed, reversal) as within-subjects factors, revealed a significant effect of Avoidance Type and Task Stage, and a significant interaction (Table 2). Follow-up analysis revealed higher accuracy on inhibitory compared with active trials in both the intermixed (MInhibitory = 0.90, SD = 0.06; MActive = 0.87, SD = 0.12; t(711) = −4.74, p &amp;lt; 0.001; Fig. 3B) and reversal stages (MInhibitory = 0.90, SD = 0.07; MActive = 0.82, SD = 0.15; t(711) = −12.18, p &amp;lt; 0.001; Fig. 3C). Accuracy on active trials was also higher in the intermixed compared with the reversal stage (t(877) = 10.49, p &amp;lt; 0.001), whereas inhibitory accuracy did not differ by stage (t(877) = 0.81, p = 0.42).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Between-subject results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depressive symptom scores and active avoidance accuracy. To examine the relationship between depressive symptom scores and active avoidance accuracy, we used a linear mixed model with BDI-II symptom scores (z-normalized, grand-mean centered) as the primary predictor. The model included Sex (female, male), Task Stage (acquisition, intermixed, reversal), and Sample (undergraduates, online workers) as fixed effects and Participant as a random intercept. Proportion correct on active trials was also z-normalized (grand-mean centered). To ensure model stability, we adopted a simplified random-effects structure that excluded a random slope for Task Stage. As shown in Table 3, the model revealed a significant main effect of BDI-II (β = −0.230, SE = 0.074, p = 0.009), indicating that higher depressive symptoms were associated with lower active avoidance accuracy when all other variables were at their reference levels (i.e., female, acquisition, undergraduates). After controlling for multiple comparisons, there were no significant interactions between BDI-II and Sex or Sample. However, we observed a significant interaction between BDI-II and Task Stage, with the relationship between depressive symptoms and active avoidance accuracy changing in the intermixed (β = 0.300, SE = 0.083, p = 0.003) and reversal stages (β = 0.215, SE = 0.083, p = 0.041), relative to acquisition. These interactions suggest that the negative relationship between depressive symptoms and active avoidance accuracy was strongest during initial learning (acquisition) and was attenuated at later stages when avoidance responses are well-learned or inhibitory control was required (Fig. 5).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Depressive symptom scores and inhibitory avoidance accuracy. A similar linear mixed model was used to examine the relationship between depressive symptom scores (BDI-II symptom scores, z-normalized, grand-mean centered) and inhibitory avoidance accuracy (z-normalized, grand-mean centered). The model included Sex (female, male), Task Stage (intermixed, reversal), and Sample (undergraduates, online workers) as fixed effects and Participant as a random intercept. No main effects or interactions involving BDI-II were significant (Extended Data Table 3-2), suggesting that depressive symptoms were not associated with inhibitory avoidance performance using this task.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Study 2 (reward-seeking/avoidance)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Study 1, participants showed lower accuracy on active compared with inhibitory avoidance trials. However, it remained unclear whether this effect was driven by conflict arising from a prepotent tendency to inhibit action under threat (Bolles, 1970; Pessoa, 2009; Wendt et al., 2017) or by a preference to reduce effort expenditure due to the additional demands of effortful active responses (Hogan et al., 2020; Forys et al., 2023). To address this, Study 2 used a mixed-motivation task that assesses both active and inhibitory responses within reward-seeking and avoidance contexts in undergraduates. Here, the design manipulated the congruency between motivational context (reward-seeking vs avoidance) and instrumental response (active vs inhibitory), allowing for analysis of how motivational context shapes action tendencies. Moreover, because the ACDM framework proposes that depression is associated with altered reward-seeking and effort-related decision-making (Bishop and Gagne, 2018), we examined whether individual differences in depressive symptom scores would differentially affect behavior across motivational contexts. This design allowed for a detailed examination of both reward-seeking and avoidance behaviors, considering their active and inhibitory dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We hypothesized that task accuracy would be highest for inhibitory avoidance and active reward-seeking, as these behaviors are contextually aligned with prepotent response tendencies—inhibiting action to avoid threat and initiating action to obtain reward. Furthermore, we expected that participants with higher depressive symptom scores would exhibit reduced accuracy in active reward-seeking, consistent with predictions of diminished behavioral engagement due to effort demand overestimation and/or reward undervaluation. A graphical overview of the mixed-motivation task is provided in Figure 6.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Demographics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Females reported marginally higher levels of depressive symptoms (F(1,328) = 3.24, p = 0.0729) and significantly higher levels of anxiety symptoms (F(1,328) = 12.99, p &amp;lt; 0.001) compared with males (Fig. 7B; Extended Data Fig. 7-1). There was no significant age difference between sex (F(1,328) = 0.112, p = 0.738).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Acquisition&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Participants successfully learned both active reward-seeking and avoidance responses, as indicated by the number of trials to criterion (reward-seeking: M = 46.94, SD = 18.09; avoidance: M = 51.72, SD = 19.90). A one-way within-subjects ANOVA revealed a significant effect of Motivational Context on the number of trials to criterion, with more trials needed to acquire active avoidance than reward-seeking (F(1,329) = 30.96, p &amp;lt; 0.001; Fig. 8A). To test whether depressive symptoms predicted trials to criterion, we fit a linear mixed model including BDI-II scores, Sex, and Motivational Context. No main or interaction effect of BDI-II was observed. Motivational context significantly affected acquisition accuracy, with lower proportion correct on active avoidance (M = 0.774, SD = 0.135) compared with active reward-seeking (M = 0.819, SD = 0.137; F(1,329) = 52.59, p &amp;lt; 0.001; Fig. 8B). To assess how this difference varied over time, we analyzed accuracy across the first six trial blocks (where all participants had data). Accuracy improved across blocks (main effect of block) and remained higher for reward-seeking trials compared with avoidance trials (main effect of Motivational Context; Table 4). While this difference persisted across blocks 1–5 (t's(1629) &amp;gt; 2.56, p's &amp;lt; 0.01), it converged by block 6 (t(1,629) = 1.59, p = 0.11; Fig. 8C), suggesting slower acquisition for active avoidance than reward-seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Intermixed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The intermixed stage assessed participants’ ability to flexibly select actions or inhibit responses based on motivational contexts (i.e., reward-seeking vs avoidance). A 2 × 2 within-subjects ANOVA (Motivational Context × Response Type) revealed a significant main effect of Response Type and a significant interaction but no main effect of Motivational Context (Table 5). Follow-up analysis revealed higher accuracy for active reward-seeking than active avoidance (t(658) = 9.92, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and higher accuracy for inhibitory avoidance compared with inhibitory reward-seeking (t(658) = 9.60, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). In the avoidance context, inhibitory responses were more accurate compared with active responses (t(658) = 10.73, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), consistent with Study 1. There were no accuracy differences in Response Type in the reward-seeking context (t(498) = 1.95, p = 0.21; Fig. 9).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Depressive symptom scores and active response accuracy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We used a linear mixed model to examine whether depressive symptoms (BDI-II, z-normalized, grand-mean centered) predicted accuracy on active trials (also z-normalized). Fixed effects included Sex (female, male), Task Stage (acquisition, intermixed), and Motivational Context (reward-seeking, avoidance), with Participant as a random intercept. This structure matched Study 1, with motivational context added. Motivational Context significantly influenced accuracy, with lower performance on avoidance trials (avoidance; β =−0.307, SE = 0.075, t(978) = −4.11, p &amp;lt; 0.001). However, BDI-II symptom scores were not significantly associated with active accuracy (β = 0.035, SE = 0.063, t(1,050.90) = 0.56, p = 0.85), nor did they interact with Motivational Context (avoidance; β = 0.038, SE = 0.076, t(978) = 0.496, p = 0.85). Thus, although avoidance reduced active accuracy this effect was not associated with depressive symptom scores. Full model results can be found at https://osf.io/5sepm/.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether observed effects were sensitive to reference level selection, we conducted an exploratory series of eight linear mixed models, systematically varying the reference levels for Sex, Task Stage, and Motivational Context. This resulted in 128 tested effects (16 per model, including main effects and interactions), and p values were adjusted using Benjamini–Hochberg FDR across all 128 effects. While no significant effects of BDI-II emerged in the initial model, exploratory analyses identified a significant BDI-II × Sex interaction (β = −0.365, SE = 0.121, t(1,050.90) = −3.02, padjusted = 0.026), specifically in the avoidance context during the intermixed stage. This exploratory finding suggests the possibility that sex differences in the relationship between depressive symptoms and instrumental behavior may emerge when active responses are well-learned and inhibitory demands are newly introduced—potentially reflecting sex-specific dynamics in threat processing during later phases of learning. Full model results can be found at https://osf.io/5sepm/.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Depressive symptom scores and inhibitory response accuracy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A similar linear mixed model was used to examine whether depressive symptom scores (BDI-II, z-normalized) predicted accuracy on inhibitory trials. Fixed effects include Sex (female, male) and Motivational Context (reward-seeking, avoidance) and Participant as a random intercept. Motivational Context significantly affected inhibitory accuracy, with higher performance in the avoidance context (avoidance; β = 0.570, SE = 0.064, t(326) = 8.95, p &amp;lt; 0.001). However, BDI-II symptom scores were not significantly associated with inhibitory accuracy (β = −0.074, SE = 0.063, t(534.47) = −1.18, p = 0.28), nor was there a significant interact with BDI-II and Motivational Context (avoidance; β = 0.030, SE = 0.065, t(326) = 0.47, p = 0.64). Thus, although participants showed lower accuracy for inhibitory reward-seeking trials compared with avoidance trials, this pattern was not associated with depressive symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Discussion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this study we report that higher depressive scores are associated with a reduced capacity to learn active avoidance behaviors, while no relationship was observed with inhibitory avoidance. Specifically, Study 1 extended rodent research on active and inhibitory avoidance to a human nonclinical sample, revealing that higher depressive symptoms predicted lower accuracy during the acquisition phase of active avoidance (Fig. 5) and a greater number of trials required to reach criterion performance (Fig. 4B). In contrast, depressive symptom scores were not related to performance on inhibitory avoidance trials. Additionally, within-subjects analyses indicated that overall, inhibitory avoidance was performed more readily compared with active avoidance, as indicated by higher accuracy during the intermixed and reversal stages (Fig. 3B,C). Altogether, these findings highlight a selective impairment in active avoidance learning associated with depressive symptoms and underscore the importance of considering how this relationship may vary across different learning phases. This dynamic pattern warrants further investigation into the underlying cognitive and neural processes that constrain avoidance behavior in depression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our findings in Study 1 partially support the predictions of the ACDM framework, which posit that depression is associated with a greater tendency toward inaction in avoidance contexts (Bishop and Gagne, 2018). Using this framework, the decision to act is calculated as the difference between the product of estimated outcome value and probability and the estimated cost of deploying effort to obtain a desired outcome. In depression, inaction may arise from overestimating effort costs, undervaluing outcomes, or underestimating outcome probability. Notably, because our task used a deterministic reinforcement schedule, outcome uncertainty is unlikely to account for the observed deficit. If overestimation of effort costs were solely responsible for these deficits, one would expect consistent active avoidance impairments across all task stages. However, since effort demands remained constant (i.e., the number of button presses required to obtain the desired outcome) and inaction was most pronounced during the acquisition phase—when fatigue-related effort costs were likely minimal—alternative explanations must be considered. Another possibility is that individuals with elevated levels of depressive symptoms became increasingly sensitive to the aversive outcome over time—effectively overvaluing the punishment and potentially overriding initial biases against deploying effort. Consistent with this interpretation, several studies have demonstrated that individuals with depression show increased sensitivity to negative feedback (Elliott et al., 1997; Eshel and Roiser, 2010), particularly in probabilistic reversal learning tasks, where they are more likely to switch following misleading negative feedback (Murphy et al., 2003; Taylor Tavares et al., 2008). However, other work suggests that the negativity bias in depression may not reflect punishment hypersensitivity per se, but rather blunted responsiveness to reward, resulting in a relative overweighting of negative outcomes (Robinson et al., 2012). Still other studies have reported reduced sensitivity to both reward and punishment in depressed individuals (Mukherjee et al., 2020). This heterogeneity likely reflects differences in task structure (i.e., deterministic vs probabilistic reinforcement), cognitive control demands (i.e., attending to and memorizing cue–response associations), and sample characteristics such as comorbid anxiety, sex, IQ, and medication status. Regardless, our findings suggest that the relationship between depressive symptoms and active avoidance is dynamic, with experience-dependent shifts across phases of avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clarifying how the neural circuits regulating active avoidance are dynamically engaged over time may offer critical insight into motivational dysfunction in depression. Evidence from both human and animal studies highlights the role of species-specific defensive reactions (SSDRs), where freezing is a prepotent response in aversive contexts (Bolles, 1970; Fanselow, 1994; LeDoux et al., 2017). For successful active avoidance, both humans and rodents must overcome these prepotent defensive responses to engage in instrumental, goal-directed action. From a neural circuitry perspective, considerable progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying the acquisition of active avoidance (LeDoux et al., 2017; Cain, 2019). Early in avoidance training, SSDRs are largely driven by amygdala circuits that promote behavioral suppression. With repeated training, however, ventromedial prefrontal systems (homologs of infralimbic cortex, Area 25 of anterior cingulate) increasingly suppress amygdala activity to reduce freezing and facilitate goal-directed avoidance responses (Moscarello and LeDoux, 2013). These dynamics suggest that individuals with elevated depressive symptoms may exhibit difficulty in suppressing prepotent defensive responses during early learning—potentially due to dysfunction in cortico-limbic-striatal circuits that support the shift from reactive to goal-directed control. This provides a plausible neurobiological mechanism for the symptom-related impairments in active avoidance observed during the acquisition phase, while performance at later stages remains unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving to research in humans, the dual competition model (Pessoa, 2009) proposes the effects of emotionally salient stimuli on task performance depends both on the level of arousal evoked by a stimulus and on whether the stimulus aligns with or opposes the action tendency evoked by the stimulus. Prepotent behavioral responses to avoid punishment and approach reward, mediated in part by prefrontal regions, have been reliably observed in human neuroimaging studies (Guitart-Masip et al., 2012; Asci et al., 2019). In depression, disruptions in top-down regulatory control have been linked to reduced activity in dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dlPFC, dmPFC) and rostral ACC (rACC), along with elevated and sustained amygdala activity in response to negative feedback or emotional salient stimuli (Siegle et al., 2007; Fales et al., 2008; Taylor Tavares et al., 2008). This pattern may indicate that emotionally salient cues disproportionately influence behavior due to weakened regulatory input from cognitive control systems. As a result, the capacity to override prepotent defensive responses—particularly during early stages of active avoidance learning—may be compromised in depression. Recent work further supports this interpretation, showing that reductions in GABA within the rACC were associated with decreased functional connectivity across cortico-striatal-limbic circuits in females with MDD (Ironside et al., 2021)—a finding especially relevant given our predominantly female sample.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Avoidance mechanisms in depression and related disorders&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To contextualize our findings, it is important to position them within the broader literature on avoidance across psychiatric disorders, highlighting key conceptual differences and points of convergence. For instance, many studies define avoidance as the decreased selection of high-loss options in probabilistic selection tasks—a definition that differs meaningfully from the framework used here but useful for understanding sensitivity to reward and negative feedback. Chase et al. (2010) used a probabilistic selection task to examine feedback learning in individuals with MDD and found reduced learning rates for both positive and negative feedback during training, particularly among individuals with higher anhedonia. This suggests blunted reinforcement learning rather than a valence-specific bias such as altered sensitivity to negative feedback. Nonetheless, this profile is consistent with our observed impairment in active avoidance acquisition, despite differences in task design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mukherjee et al. (2020) extended this work using probabilistic reversal learning and found that MDD patients—most of whom were medicated—selected fewer rich options following reversals and exhibited reduced win-stay behavior (i.e., less likely to repeat a rewarded choice), but no difference in lose-shift behavior (i.e., switching after punishment). If depression involved heightened punishment sensitivity, an increase in lose-shift behavior would be expected. The absence of this effect supports the idea of diminished reward sensitivity rather than increased responsiveness to punishment. This interpretation aligns with the possibility that symptom-related impairments in active avoidance reflect deficits in safety learning rather than heightened punishment sensitivity that interacts with effort-related biases. Safety learning—the process of learning about cues that predict the absence of threat (Laing et al., 2025)—has been shown to promote instrumental avoidance learning in animals and humans (Fernando et al., 2014; Fisher and Urcelay, 2024). Impaired learning of safety signals may contribute to reduced active avoidance performance, even in aversively motivated contexts. Given that safety learning is supported by amygdala and vmPFC circuitry (Kong et al., 2014), this may offer a more parsimonious explanation for acquisition-specific effects than models emphasizing the accumulation of punishment sensitivity and effort-related bias.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neuromodulator systems may further complicate interpretation, as both serotonin and dopamine are implicated in punishment and reward learning. SSRIs, commonly prescribed in MDD, are known to blunt negative feedback sensitivity (Herzallah et al., 2013). Supporting this, low doses of the antidepressant citalopram—which attenuate serotonin signaling—increase lose-shift behavior and sensitivity to punishment in both rodents and humans (Chamberlain et al., 2006; Bari et al., 2010). However, findings from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) populations highlight more nuanced effects of serotonergic modulation: Endrass et al. (2011) found greater sensitivity to negative feedback in medicated OCD patients with elevated depressive symptoms, but only after initial learning—consistent with the idea that punishment sensitivity may build with experience. In contrast, Palminteri et al. (2012) reported no valence-specific effects of medication status in OCD patients using a task previously linking dopamine to punishment learning (Palminteri et al., 2009).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Motivational impairments similar to those in depression are also evident in schizophrenia, particularly in relation to altered dopamine signaling. In unmedicated patients, Reinen et al. (2016) found blunted prediction error BOLD signals in the striatum and mPFC for rewards, but intact response to punishment, suggesting D2 tone may selectively dampen reward while keeping punishment signaling intact. Similarly, Waltz et al. (2018) reported reduced differential activation to gain versus loss-avoidance in vmPFC, ACC, and ventral striatum (VS), with diminished activation in VS associated with higher negative symptom scores. Sex differences in dopaminergic responses to loss versus gain have also been observed. Using PET during the monetary incentive delay task, Hahn et al. (2021) found females exhibited heightened VS dopaminergic responses to punishment relative to gain. Together, these findings suggest that disrupted valuation and motivational processes, linked to both dopamine and serotonin signaling, may reflect cortico-striatal-limbic dysfunction as a transdiagnostic mechanism across conditions like OCD, schizophrenia, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, these studies underscore the dynamic nature of avoidance, which may shift with experience (i.e., acquisition, expression, habit) and neuromodulatory state. If punishment sensitivity increases with experience, it may eventually override early inaction driven by effort-related biases. Alternatively, if deficits are more prominent for reward-related signals, disrupted safety learning may play a greater role. Future computational modeling that integrates effort costs, punishment and reward sensitivity, and safety learning mechanisms will be critical for disentangling these processes and clarifying how depressive symptoms influence active avoidance behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Motivational context influences accuracy of instrumental actions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Study 2 examined whether poorer active avoidance performance reflect a general bias toward effort minimization or context-specific effects by assessing active and inhibitory responses across both reward-seeking and avoidance contexts. While depressive symptom scores were not significantly related to performance, robust within-subjects effects emerged. Participants performed more accurately on trials aligned with their prepotent tendencies—active reward-seeking and inhibitory avoidance—consistent with prior research demonstrating approach biases for reward and withdrawal biases for punishment (Crockett et al., 2009; Guitart-Masip et al., 2012; Mkrtchian et al., 2017; Asci et al., 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prefrontal regions such as the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) and orbitofrontal (OFC) are implicated in overcoming these motivational-action conflicts (Roelofs et al., 2009; Volman et al., 2011). If the poorer performance for active versus inhibitory avoidance observed in Study 1 were driven by a general preference to minimize effort, we would expect a similar pattern for active reward-seeking in Study 2. However, this pattern did not emerge, suggesting that effort bias alone does not account for these findings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parallel findings in humans and animals suggest that newly learned discriminative cues can differentially influence instrumental behavior depending on whether the context is appetitive or aversive (Talmi et al., 2008; Geurts et al., 2013; Mkrtchian et al., 2017; Nord et al., 2018; Campese, 2021). Consistent with this, participants in the current study more readily inhibited responses in avoidance context than in reward-seeking contexts. Remarkably, rats display similar patterns, with greater accuracy for active responses during reward seeking and greater inhibitory accuracy during avoidance (Dalton et al., 2025).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although these performance differences could be attributed to differences in the motivational value of the reward and the punishment outcomes, this explanation is unlikely. No significant main effect of motivational context was found during the intermixed task stage. Specifically, the average accuracy for reward-seeking and avoidance trials (irrespective of response type) did not differ. This suggests that the outcomes were equally motivating overall and not biased toward one context. Instead, the observed interaction is more consistent with the context-dependent effect of prepotent response tendencies influencing instrumental actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While depression is typically associated with reduced reward-seeking, the ACDM framework predicts a broader bias toward inaction across both reward-seeking and avoidance contexts, driven by overestimation of effort costs. In Study 1, higher depressive symptom scores were associated with reduced active avoidance performance—consistent with this framework. However, contrary to our hypotheses, depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with active or inhibitory response accuracy in either motivational context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several key differences may account for these null findings. First, the mixed-motivation task employed an interleaved design, requiring participants to frequently switch between responding to appetitive and aversive stimuli, rather than engaging with each in distinct blocks. This design placed avoidance trials within a broader reward-rich context, attenuating depression-related impairments in active avoidance—potentially due to the prepotent tendency to approach reward. This interpretation aligns with findings from approach-avoidance conflict paradigms—where conditions involving potential reward despite the risk of punishment are more likely to elicit active approach behavior than avoidance-only conditions (Aupperle et al., 2011). Second, the four-condition task structure (active vs inhibitory and reward-seeking vs avoidance) likely imposed greater working memory demands, which have been implicated in reward/punishment learning (Van Der Schaaf et al., 2014). These cognitive demands may have masked the influence of depressive symptoms on performance. Future studies may consider controlling for cognitive load to better isolate symptom-specific effects. Finally, Study 1 took place during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, a contextual factor that may have influenced affective states and task engagement in ways that were not present during Study 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although no association between depressive symptoms were found in Study 2, the robust within-subjects effects suggest this task may be useful for assessing motivated behavior in other psychiatric populations. For example, research on substance use disorder emphasizes the strong motivational salience of reward and punishment related cues, particularly those associated with drug use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although depression is often linked with reward-processing deficits like anhedonia (Treadway and Zald, 2011; Treadway et al., 2012), our findings reveal a novel link between symptom severity and impaired active avoidance learning in aversive contexts. A key limitation is whether these results generalize to clinical populations. Depression is increasingly understood as a dimensional condition, with clinical diagnoses reflecting the more severe end of a broader symptom spectrum and avoidance impairments representing a potential transdiagnostic feature (Eaton et al., 2023). Our sample included a wide range of depressive symptom scores, with many participants self-reporting prior diagnoses or scoring above clinical cutoffs, supporting the relevance of our findings to clinical populations. Furthermore, this dimensional approach may offer a more nuanced understanding of symptom-related effects on avoidance behavior and extend to other psychiatric conditions, such as OCD and schizophrenia, that share overlapping motivational and affective features with depression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another limitation of our study was the higher than expected exclusion rates, which warrant a closer examination of their potential impact on results. Both tasks were designed as reinforcement-based learning paradigms with minimal instructions, no explicit information on cue–response contingencies, and no practice trials. While this design enhances translational relevance, it likely contributed to the variability in participants’ ability to acquire the task contingencies. Although higher exclusion rates were anticipated, the rates observed—39.37% in Study 1 and 57.20% in Study 2—exceeded expectations and were primarily due to failure to meet behavioral performance criteria. However, when considering only exclusions related to questionnaire failures or task noncompletion, rates were consistent with typical online studies (Study 1: 19.17%, Study 2: 19.20%; Suzuki et al., 2021). To assess potential bias, we compared included participants to those who passed attention checks but were later excluded for other reasons (see https://osf.io/5sepm/). In Study 1, excluded participants had significantly higher BAI scores, but not BDI-II scores. While the ACDM framework does not explicitly make predictions about how depressive and anxiety symptoms interact, it implies that their effects may counterbalance one another. In the context of our study, anxiety symptoms could offset the depressive impairments in active avoidance by promoting increased avoidance effort. This antagonistic dynamic suggests that higher exclusion rates may have reduced confounding influences rather than introduce bias. Importantly, BDI-II scores did not differ between included and excluded groups, preserving the validity of our primary analyses. Sex differences in exclusion rates were also observed, with a higher proportion of females excluded. However, both final samples remained predominantly female—the group in which we observed our strongest effects—suggesting any bias would likely underestimate, rather than inflate our findings. For these reasons, we believe the interpretation and relevance of our findings are still valid. However, future adaptations of this task may benefit from optimizing the trade-off between ecological validity and participant retention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across two studies, we sought to extend rodent research to investigate patterns of active and inhibitory avoidance and reward-seeking in a nonclinical sample varying in depressive symptoms. By integrating self-report and behavioral measures, we aimed to strengthen translational links between preclinical models and depressive symptom severity in humans. Our findings highlight the value of transdiagnostic approaches in a community sample for bridging bench and clinic in understanding psychiatric disorders. Results demonstrate an important link between depressive symptoms and reduced efficacy at learning to override a prepotent response to inhibit action to avoid unpleasant events. Future work should test whether these effects replicate in clinically diagnosed MDD populations, use computational models to probe underlying mechanisms, and apply neuroimaging to evaluate cross-species convergence in neural circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Scoop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic is in the midst of a splashy media tour in Washington, but its refusal to allow its models to be used for some law enforcement purposes has deepened hostility to the company inside the Trump administration, two senior officials told Semafor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic recently declined requests by contractors working with federal law enforcement agencies because the company refuses to make an exception allowing its AI tools to be used for some tasks, including surveillance of US citizens, said the officials, who spoke to Semafor on the condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tensions come at a moment when Donald Trumpâs White House has championed American AI companies as patriotic bulwarks of global competition âÂ and expect the companies to repay that loyalty. The officials said they worried that Anthropic was selectively enforcing its policies based on politics and using vague terminology to allow its rules to be interpreted broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, Anthropic currently limits how the FBI, Secret Service and Immigration, and Customs Enforcement can use its AI models because those agencies conduct surveillance, which is prohibited by Anthropicâs usage policy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the officials said Anthropicâs position, which has long been in effect, amounts to making a moral judgment about how law enforcement agencies do their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The policy doesnât specifically define what it means by âdomestic surveillanceâ in a law enforcement context and appears to be using the term broadly, creating room for interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other AI model providers also list restrictions on surveillance, but offer more specific examples and often have carveouts for law enforcement activities. OpenAIâs policy, for instance, prohibits âunauthorized monitoring of individuals,â implying consent for legal monitoring by law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this article:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Know More&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropicâs decision to limit how law enforcement and national security agencies use its models has turned into a headache for some private contractors that work with those agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thatâs because in some cases, Anthropicâs Claude models â available through Amazon Web Services GovCloud system â are the only top-tier models cleared for top secret security situations, the officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic has a specific service aimed at national security customers and struck a deal with the federal government to offer its services to government agencies for $1 fee.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic also does work with the US Department of Defense, although its policies still prohibit the use of its models for making weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic has clashed with Trump administration officials in the past, when it opposed a proposed law that would have preempted US states from passing AI regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Reedâs view&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropicâs kerfuffle with law enforcement contractors âÂ coming as larger rivals like Google have quietly backed off attempts to enforce progressive politics through their corporate policies âÂ raises a difficult question for the most powerful companies in Silicon Valley: How much should software providers be able to control how their products are used, particularly once they are sold into government agencies?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, an agency could pay for a subscription or negotiate a pay-per-use contract with an AI provider, only to find out that it is prohibited from using the AI model in certain ways, limiting its value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional software isnât like that. Once a government agency has access to Microsoft Office, it doesnât have to worry about whether it is using Excel to keep track of weapons or pencils.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itâs also just been generally frowned upon in the government contracting world to âpick and chooseâ how software can be used. But activist employees over the last decade also often pressed their employers to stay out of the defense industry in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tensions between Anthropic and the White House are part of a broader battle between the AI âsafetyâ movement, which has allies at the independent AI startup, and many of its rivals and the Republican administration, which prefer to move faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing protecting Anthropic in all this is that its models perform extremely well. Eventually, though, its politics could end up hurting its government business.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Published on September 17, 2025 by Andreas Rossberg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three years ago, version 2.0 of the Wasm standard was (essentially) finished, which brought a number of new features, such as vector instructions, bulk memory operations, multiple return values, and simple reference types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the Wasm W3C Community Group and Working Group have not been lazy. Today, we are happy to announce the release of Wasm 3.0 as the new “live” standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a substantially larger update: several big features, some of which have been in the making for six or eight years, finally made it over the finishing line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;64-bit address space. Memories and tables can now be declared to use &lt;code&gt;i64&lt;/code&gt; as their address type instead of just &lt;code&gt;i32&lt;/code&gt;. That expands the available address space of Wasm applications from 4 gigabytes to (theoretically) 16 exabytes, to the extent that physical hardware allows. While the web will necessarily keep enforcing certain limits — on the web, a 64-bit memory is limited to 16 gigabytes — the new flexibility is especially interesting for non-web ecosystems using Wasm, as they can support much, much larger applications and data sets now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple memories. Contrary to popular belief, Wasm applications were always able to use multiple memory objects — and hence multiple address spaces — simultaneously. However, previously that was only possible by declaring and accessing each of them in separate modules. This gap has been closed, a single module can now declare (define or import) multiple memories and directly access them, including directly copying data between them. This finally allows tools like wasm-merge, which perform “static linking” on two or more Wasm modules by merging them into one, to work for all Wasm modules. It also paves the way for new uses of separate address spaces, e.g., for security (separating private data), for buffering, or for instrumentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Garbage collection. In addition to expanding the capabilities of raw linear memories, Wasm also adds support for a new (and separate) form of storage that is automatically managed by the Wasm runtime via a garbage collector. Staying true to the spirit of Wasm as a low-level language, Wasm GC is low-level as well: a compiler targeting Wasm can declare the memory layout of its runtime data structures in terms of struct and array types, plus unboxed tagged integers, whose allocation and lifetime is then handled by Wasm. But that’s it. Everything else, such as engineering suitable representations for source-language values, including implementation details like method tables, remains the responsibility of compilers targeting Wasm. There are no built-in object systems, nor closures or other higher-level constructs — which would inevitably be heavily biased towards specific languages. Instead, Wasm only provides the basic building blocks for representing such constructs and focuses purely on the memory management aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typed references. The GC extension is built upon a substantial extension to the Wasm type system, which now supports much richer forms of references. Reference types can now describe the exact shape of the referenced heap value, avoiding additional runtime checks that would otherwise be needed to ensure safety. This more expressive typing mechanism, including subtyping and type recursion, is also available for function references, making it possible to perform safe indirect function calls without any runtime type or bounds check, through the new &lt;code&gt;call_ref&lt;/code&gt; instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tail calls. Tail calls are a variant of function calls that immediately exit the current function, and thereby avoid taking up additional stack space. Tail calls are an important mechanism that is used in various language implementations both in user-visible ways (e.g., in functional languages) and for internal techniques (e.g., to implement stubs). Wasm tail calls are fully general and work for callees both selected statically (by function index) and dynamically (by reference or table).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exception handling. Exceptions provide a way to locally abort execution, and are a common feature in modern programming languages. Previously, there was no efficient way to compile exception handling to Wasm, and existing compilers typically resorted to convoluted ways of implementing them by escaping to the host language, e.g., JavaScript. This was neither portable nor efficient. Wasm 3.0 hence provides native exception handling within Wasm. Exceptions are defined by declaring exception tags with associated payload data. As one would expect, an exception can be thrown, and selectively be caught by a surrounding handler, based on its tag. Exception handlers are a new form of block instruction that includes a dispatch list of tag/label pairs or catch-all labels to define where to jump when an exception occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Relaxed vector instructions. Wasm 2.0 added a large set of vector (SIMD) instructions, but due to differences in hardware, some of these instructions have to do extra work on some platforms to achieve the specified semantics. In order to squeeze out maximum performance, Wasm 3.0 introduces “relaxed” variants of these instructions that are allowed to have implementation-dependent behavior in certain edge cases. This behavior must be selected from a pre-specified set of legal choices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deterministic profile. To make up for the added semantic fuzziness of relaxed vector instructions, and in order to support settings that demand or need deterministic execution semantics (such as blockchains, or replayable systems), the Wasm standard now specifies a deterministic default behavior for every instruction with otherwise non-deterministic results — currently, this includes floating-point operators and their generated NaN values and the aforementioned relaxed vector instructions. Between platforms choosing to implement this deterministic execution profile, Wasm thereby is fully deterministic, reproducible, and portable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Custom annotation syntax. Finally, the Wasm text format has been enriched with generic syntax for placing annotations in Wasm source code. Analogous to custom sections in the binary format, these annotations are not assigned any meaning by the Wasm standard itself, and can be chosen to be ignored by implementations. However, they provide a way to represent the information stored in custom sections in human-readable and writable form, and concrete annotations can be specified by downstream standards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to these core features, embeddings of Wasm into JavaScript benefit from a new extension to the JS API:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With these new features, Wasm has much better support for compiling high-level programming languages. Enabled by this, we have seen various new languages popping up to target Wasm, such as Java, OCaml, Scala, Kotlin, Scheme, or Dart, all of which use the new GC feature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of all these goodies, Wasm 3.0 also is the first version of the standard that has been produced with the new SpecTec tool chain. We believe that this makes for an even more reliable specification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wasm 3.0 is already shipping in most major web browsers, and support in stand-alone engines like Wasmtime is on track to completion as well. The Wasm feature status page tracks support across engines.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Kirks politics have murdered two boat fulls of people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The “Debate Me Bro” Grift: How Trolls Weaponized The Marketplace Of Ideas&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;from the debate-me-now-or-you-lose dept&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among the attempts to create hagiographic eulogies of Charlie Kirk, I’ve seen more than a few people suggest that Kirk should be respected for being willing to talk to “those who disagree with him” as a sign that he was engaging in good faith. Perhaps the perfect example of this is Ezra Klein’s silly eulogy claiming that Kirk was “practicing politics the right way” because he would debate students who disagreed with him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Kirk was practicing politics in exactly the right way. He was showing up to campuses and talking with anyone who would talk to him. He was one of the era’s most effective practitioners of persuasion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many problems with this statement, but Klein’s fundamental error reveals something much more dangerous: he’s mistaking performance for discourse, spectacle for persuasion. Kirk wasn’t showing up to campuses to “talk with anyone who would talk to him.” He was showing up armed with a string of logical fallacies, nonsense talking points, and gotcha questions specifically designed to enrage inexperienced college students so he could generate viral social media clips of himself “owning the libs.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Klein is eulogizing not a practitioner of good-faith political discourse, but one of the most successful architects of “debate me bro” culture—a particularly toxic form of intellectual harassment that has become endemic to our political discourse. And by praising Kirk as practicing “politics the right way,” Klein is inadvertently endorsing a grift that actively undermines the kind of thoughtful engagement our democracy desperately needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “debate me bro” playbook is simple and effective: demand that serious people engage with your conspiracy theories or extremist talking points. If they decline, cry “censorship!” and claim they’re “afraid of the truth.” If they accept, turn the interaction into a performance designed to generate viral clips and false legitimacy. It’s a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose proposition that has nothing to do with genuine intellectual discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fundamental issue with “debate me bro” culture isn’t just that it’s obnoxious, it’s that it creates a false equivalence between good-faith expertise and bad-faith trolling. When you agree to debate someone pushing long-debunked conspiracy theories or openly hateful ideologies, you’re implicitly suggesting that their position deserves equal consideration alongside established facts and expert analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is exactly backwards from how the actual “marketplace of ideas” is supposed to work. Ideas don’t deserve platforms simply because someone is willing to argue for them loudly. They earn legitimacy through evidence, peer review, and sustained engagement with reality. Many of the ideas promoted in these viral “debates” have already been thoroughly debunked and rejected by that marketplace—but the “debate me bro” format resurrects them as if they’re still worth serious consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps most insidiously, these aren’t actually debates at all. They’re performances designed to generate specific emotional reactions for viral distribution. Participants aren’t trying to persuade anyone or genuinely engage with opposing viewpoints. They’re trying to create moments that will get clipped, shared, and monetized across social media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kirk perfected this grift. As a recent detailed analysis of one of Kirk’s debates demonstrates, when a student showed up prepared with nuanced, well-researched arguments, Kirk immediately tried pivoting to culture war talking points and deflection tactics. When debaters tried to use Kirk’s own standards against him, he shifted subjects entirely. The goal was never understanding or persuasion—it was generating content for social media distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, of course, this broader “debate me bro” culture has become so commonplace and expected online that it has now been fully industrialized into content farming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most toxic evolution of this grift is Jubilee Media’s “Surrounded” series on YouTube (on which Kirk once appeared, because of course he did), which The New Yorker’s Brady Brickner-Wood aptly describes as an attempt to “anthropomorphize the internet, turning incendiary discourse into live-action role-play.” The format is simple: put one public figure in a room with 20 ideologically opposed people and let them duke it out in rapid-fire rounds designed for maximum conflict and viral potential.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Brickner-Wood notes, these aren’t actual debates in the classical sense of trying to persuade, they’re spectacles designed to set up bad faith dipshits with the opportunity to dunk on others for social media clout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Surrounded” videos are a dizzying and bewildering watch, as gruelling as they are compelling. The participants who fare best seem to be familiar with the conventions of interscholastic debate, spouting off statistics and logic puzzles with the alacrity of an extemporaneous-speaking champion. To win an argument in such a condensed amount of time, debaters attempt to short-circuit their opponent’s claim as swiftly and harshly as possible, treating their few minutes of airtime as a domination game rather than, say, a path toward truth or understanding. The goal here is not to inform or educate, to listen or process, to build or intellectualize but to win, to own, to dunk on, to break the opponent’s brain, to spawn an argument of such devastating definitiveness that the matter can be considered, once and for all, closed. Wave the flag, run the clock out—next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Surrounded is just the most recent manifestation of a much older problem. We’ve seen multiple bad faith trolls, beyond just Kirk, turn the “debate me bro” model into large media empires. When people point out their bad faith nonsense, we’re told “what are you complaining about, they’re doing things the ‘right way’ by debating with those they disagree with.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are, of course, times and places where actual debates can be valuable. I’ve been involved in many debates over the years with people who vehemently disagreed with me. But I think it’s important for people to recognize that, in the same way not all information is equally valuable, not all debates are equally productive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s nothing in how Charlie Kirk “debated” that aimed to get at nuances or understanding. They were entirely designed to seek to humiliate his opponent. They’re full of red herrings, lies, and attempts to deflect from any actual logic, as the video link above showed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The point is not about getting to any level of understanding. It’s to try to quip and dunk in the manner most likely to go viral when shared on social media in 20-second snippets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The format actively discourages the kind of thoughtful, nuanced discussion that might actually change minds—the kind actually designed for persuasion. Instead, it rewards the most inflammatory takes, the most emotionally manipulative tactics, and the most viral-ready soundbites. Anyone going into these situations with good faith gets steamrolled by participants who understand they’re playing a different game entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When trolls demand debates, they’re not interested in having their minds changed or genuinely testing their ideas. They want one of two outcomes: either you decline and they get to claim victory by default, or you accept and they get to use your credibility to legitimize their nonsense while farming viral moments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of this means we should avoid authentically engaging with different viewpoints or challenging ideas. But there’s a crucial difference between good-faith intellectual engagement and feeding trolls who are just looking for their next viral moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Real intellectual discourse happens in contexts where participants are genuinely interested in truth-seeking rather than performance. It requires shared standards of evidence, mutual respect, and actual expertise on the topics being discussed. It takes time, nuance, and careful consideration—all things that are antithetical to the “debate me bro” format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Klein’s eulogy of Kirk represents a broader failure to understand what’s happening to our discourse. When we praise bad-faith performers for “engaging” with their critics, we’re not celebrating democratic norms—we’re rewarding those who exploit them.&lt;/p&gt;
