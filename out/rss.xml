    &lt;p&gt;What happens when I use all my Roam 100GB data?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will my service stop when I reach the 100GB data limit?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What can I do with low-speed data?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do I get high-speed Roam data again?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happened to buying additional data billed per GB?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I received an email about Roam 100GB. Do I have to accept or upgrade?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can I use Roam 100GB on the ocean?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roam 100GB Availability&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On January 13, 2026, Starlink doubled the amount of high-speed data on Roam 50GB to 100GB, at no additional cost and in most markets. Here is all you need to know about what's changed and what hasn't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you’ve used 100GB of your high-speed Roam data, your service automatically continues with unlimited low-speed data for the remainder of your billing period. You’ll still be connected for basic use like calls and texts, but activities such as streaming, downloading, and video calls may be limited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll notify you when you reach 80% and 100% of your monthly high-speed Roam data. To restore high-speed Roam service, you can upgrade to Roam Unlimited. Please note that this upgrade will remain in effect for future billing cycles. You can switch back to Roam 100GB as needed. If you want to switch back before your next biling cycle, you'll need to manually change plans in your account portal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. Your service will not stop. You’ll continue to have internet access--with unlimited data--at reduced speeds until your next billing cycle begins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low-speed data supports basic connectivity such as email, calls, and texts. Activities that rely on higher speeds—like streaming video, large downloads, or video calls—will be limited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can upgrade anytime to Roam Unlimited to restore high-speed service. Please note that upgrading to Roam Unlimited will remain in effect for future billing cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the exception of Ocean Mode, per-GB data purchases are no longer available on Roam plans. Customers now automatically move to unlimited low-speed data after reaching their high-speed Roam 100GB limit, with the option to upgrade to Roam Unlimited for continued high-speed access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. You don’t need to take any action. Roam 100GB is a new plan that’s now widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your service is currently paused in Standby Mode or cancelled, you don’t need to upgrade unless you want active service. Roam 100GB will be available whenever you’re ready to roam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, with the same previous conditions as Roam 50GB:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the following markets, Roam 50GB is still available and Roam 100GB is not available:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Professional aviation surveillance relies on a specific piece of hardware: the EO/IR (Electro-Optical/Infra-Red) gimbal. These are the gyro-stabilized turrets you see on the nose of police helicopters or military drones, capable of keeping a rock-solid lock on a target regardless of how the aircraft maneuvers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to replicate this capability to help track aircraft from the ground—building a tool that allows a consumer camera to lock onto and follow a target with similar stability, but without the defense-contractor budget.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Hardware Constraint&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core of this build is a generic PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) camera, the kind typically used for streaming church services or campus lectures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While cost-effective, these cameras present a major engineering challenge for tracking any object, let alone aircraft. Their motors are designed for slow, dampened pans across a stage, not for tracking a jet moving at 300 knots. The mechanical and electronics latency is significant; if you simply tell the camera to “follow that plane,” by the time the motors react, the target has often moved out of the frame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make this hardware viable, the heavy lifting has to move from mechanics to mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The Software Stack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built a custom control loop to bridge the gap between the camera’s sluggish motors and the dynamic speed of the targets. The stack fuses three main concepts to help the system maintain a visual lock:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visual Processing (OpenCV &amp;amp; CSRT)&lt;lb/&gt;Once the camera is pointed at a target, the backend initializes a CSRT (Discriminative Correlation Filter with Channel and Spatial Reliability) tracker. Unlike simple contrast-based detection which can be easily fooled by clouds or changing lighting, CSRT tracks the specific visual features and texture of the aircraft. It calculates the error—how far off-center the target is in pixels—frame by frame to drive the control loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prediction (Kalman Filter)&lt;lb/&gt;Raw visual data is noisy and processing introduces latency. To combat this, I implemented a Kalman Filter that models the aircraft’s state (position and velocity).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Smoothing: It filters out sensor noise and jitter from the tracker.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prediction: Crucially, it predicts where the aircraft will be roughly 200ms in the future (accounting for system latency).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Feed-Forward Control: Instead of just reacting to the error (Feedback), the system feeds the predicted velocity directly to the motors (Feed-Forward). This allows the camera to “lead” the target, eliminating the drag/lag typical of reactive PID loops.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Control (PID + Feed-Forward Loop)&lt;lb/&gt;The control logic combines a standard PID controller with the Kalman velocity vector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Proportional: Corrects the immediate position error.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Integral: Corrects steady-state error (e.g., wind resistance or motor deadbands).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Derivative: Dampens the movement to prevent overshoot.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dynamic Speed Limiting: I also implemented a dynamic velocity clamp that scales the motor aggressivity based on the distance to the target. This allows for high-speed slew when acquireing a target, but precision micro-stepping when the target is centered.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The “Virtual” Gimbal&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even with a tuned PID loop, the plastic gears in a consumer PTZ camera have physical limitations. There is always some mechanical play that results in jitter at high zoom levels and the onboard control electronics (including their dampening/smoothing algorithms) introduce latency that prevent perfect mechanical stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To solve this, I implemented a digital stabilization layer—essentially a “virtual gimbal.” The software crops into the sensor slightly and shifts the image frame-by-frame to counteract the imperfect mechanical stabilization. The result is an incredibly stable image that mimics the expensive mechanical stabilization of professional EO/IR turrets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Data Fusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An optical lock is useful, but context is better. Since the system knows the camera’s precise azimuth and elevation, I can correlate the visual data with live ADS-B telemetry. When tracking a target, the system queries local ADS-B traffic to find an aircraft at those specific coordinates. This data comes from a local ADS-B receiver with a script monitoring tar1090.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Why Build This?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project is an experiment in sousveillance—monitoring the monitors. It involves taking the technologies used for ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) and adapting them for civilian use. By understanding how these tracking systems work, we gain a better understanding of the airspace above us and the tools often used to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Tesla Cybertruck program is in shambles. The latest data indicate production is running at roughly 10% of its planned capacity. Meanwhile, the Ford F150 Lightning outsold the Tesla Cybertruck in 2025 and was then canceled for not selling enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this what is coming for the Cybertruck?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tesla is actively trying to hide its Cybertruck sales performance. We have to do the math ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike virtually every other automaker that reports sales by model and region, Tesla bundles its vehicles into two broad categories: “Model 3/Y” and “Other Models.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “Other Models” category includes the Model S, Model X, Cybertruck, and the Tesla Semi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Model S and Model X sales have been relatively stable at a low volume, typically hovering around 5,000 to 6,000 units combined per quarter globally. If we assume a generous 6,000 units for S and X in Q4 2025 (aided by a slight update), that leaves only roughly 5,600 units for the Cybertruck and Semi combined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Considering the Semi is still in pilot production with negligible volume, we are looking at roughly 5,500 for the entire quarter globally (though it is still mostly North American).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a disaster compared to the truck’s peak and the company’s stated capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We previously reported in July that Tesla confirmed Cybertruck sales were down to ~5,000 units in Q2 2025. It seems the “recovery” never happened, despite price cuts and the introduction of a short-lived, cheaper trim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the full year 2025, it could bring the total to about 21,500 Cybertrucks globally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to 2025 full-year data, the Ford F-150 Lightning delivered approximately 27,300 units in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think about that for a second. Ford officially announced it was ending F-150 Lightning production in December to pivot to its new EREV (extended-range electric vehicle) strategy. Yet, even as a “lame duck” product with widely publicised retirement plans, the Lightning still managed to find more buyers than Tesla’s Cybertruck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Ford’s sales dipped about 18% year-over-year as they wound down the program, Tesla’s numbers crashed by nearly 50% despite the company doing everything it can to keep the program alive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tesla and Elon Musk have thrown everything at the Cybertruck program, and it’s not working. They released a cheaper stripped-down version and canceled it months later because it wasn’t selling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last quarter, Musk even had his private company SpaceX buy over 1,000 Cybertrucks, which is about 20% of Tesla’s quarterly Cybertruck sales, and sales were still down more than 50% year-over-year in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happens with the Cybertruck from here?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Electrek’s Take&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SpaceX can’t keep buying Cybertrucks, and I don’t know of any vehicle program that sells at 10% of its production capacity and survives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s such a big hill to climb.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I previously said, I think if Tesla were to distance itself from Musk’s toxic brand and do things such as give up on the 4680 cells, which appear to have contributed to the Cybertruck being more expensive and having a shorter range than originally announced, it could likely significantly boost Cybertruck sales.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Top comment by Realist&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the practice of following Elon's gut feelings has not abated. No lessons learned. The Cybercab is a sleek two-seater that, I guess, will not have a steering wheel. There is little demand for a consumer version two-seater which presumably would have steering controls, and cab riders mostly are concerned with getting from A to B with their stuff. The inside stories that are reported from Tesla are that many people did in fact warn him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Model 2 has been forgotten (Mexico, thanks for the millions you spent to facilitate our factory!). The Roadster, a halo car, has been abandoned for all practical purposes (Customers who put down a deposit, thanks!).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elon personally handles PR, and he's gone backwards in Brand Image. He prides himself on doing no consumer research, and it's resulted in the worst new car introduction in the history of automobiles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enough to fill production capacity? Probably not, but it could get a lot closer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Short of that, I don’t know where this can go. I think most other automakers would have written off the program already, but Musk can’t because of his ego. It would be admitting defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It shows just how much he has changed in the last few years (beyond the obvious white-nationalist stuff), as Musk originally said Tesla would pivot to a more traditional design if the Cybertruck failed. It has failed. Now what?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Sparrow-1 is a specialized, multilingual audio model for real-time conversational flow and floor transfer. It predicts when a system should listen, wait, or speak, enabling response timing that mirrors human conversation rather than simply responding as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite major advances in LLMs and TTS, conversational AI still lacks reliable human-level timing. Traditional voice systems wait for silence, then respond. Sparrow-1 instead models conversational timing continuously. This allows it to respond quickly, even instantaneously when the speaker is clearly done, all while deliberately waiting when theyâre not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The difference is subtle but transformative: Sparrow-1 doesn't just respond as fast as possible. It responds at the moment a human listener would.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Timing Is the Hard Part&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conversation is not just an exchange of words. It is a real-time coordination task where participants continuously anticipate when to respond, drawing on rhythm, hesitation, intonation, and meaning at the same time. Sparrow-1 models this coordination directly, aligning its behavior with the timing patterns humans use subconsciously during dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research in conversation analysis and psycholinguistics has identified several key categories of signals that govern conversational-flow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Semantic completeness: whether an utterance constitutes a complete thought, question, or request that projects a relevant response.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lexical structure: grammatical structure and speech act boundaries that create transition-relevance places.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prosodic boundary markers: pitch contours, lengthening, and intensity changes that signal utterance completion.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disfluencies and hesitation phenomena: filled pauses, false starts, and repairs that indicate ongoing cognitive processing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-verbal cues are invisible to text: Transcription-based models discard sighs, throat-clearing, hesitation sounds, and other non-verbal vocalizations that carry critical conversational-flow information. Sparrow-1 hears what ASR ignores.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Overlap management: the negotiation of simultaneous speech, which occurs in approximately 40% of turn transitions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Affective silences: pauses that carry emotional or pragmatic weight distinct from planning delays.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When timing fails in conversational AI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you talk to an AI with a human voice, you expect human timing. When timing breaks down, you notice immediately. Delayed responses, premature interruptions, and awkward pauses shatter the rhythm of natural dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Todayâs voice AI sounds increasingly human, yet still feels mechanical in conversation. Systems on platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok decide when to speak using endpoint detection, waiting for silence thresholds before responding. They react to the absence of sound rather than conversational intent, leading to missed hesitation cues and poorly timed responses. The voice sounds real, but the interaction does not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Human-level conversation requires more:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Near-instant response when intent is clear&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Contextual fluidity that adapts to pacing and tone&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Graceful handling of interruptions, backchannels, and overlapping speech&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most systems fall short since they treat conversational-flow as an afterthought, a threshold to tune rather than a problem to model.Â &lt;lb/&gt;Sparrow-1 takes a different approach: it models humanlike floor transfer with intent, timing, and tone, ensuring that conversational timing matches the realism of the voice delivering it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is Sparrow-1?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sparrow-1 is a conversational flow control model built for real-time conversational video in Tavusâs Conversational Video Interface. It treats timing as a first-class modeling problem rather than an artifact of endpoint detection, extending Sparrow-0 with a more capable architecture and richer supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most existing turn-taking systems are built around endpoint detection. They wait for speech to stop, apply silence thresholds, and then trigger a response. This reactive design introduces latency, misinterprets hesitation as turn completion, and fails to support natural conversational behaviors such as backchanneling, overlap, and interruption. Silence is treated as a proxy for intent, even though the absence of speech does not reliably signal that a speaker has yielded the conversational floor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sparrow-1 takes a different approach. Instead of asking whether speech has ended, it models who owns the conversational floor at every moment, allowing it to anticipate turn transitions rather than react to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Core Properties and Capabilities&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Audio-native, streaming-first: Operates directly on continuous audio with persistent state, preserving prosody, rhythm, and timing cues that are lost in transcription-based systems.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Explicit floor ownership modeling: Predicts conversational floor ownership at frame-level granularity instead of relying on silence or fixed timeouts, enabling responses at the moment of handoff rather than after a delay buffer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trained on continuous utterances: Learns from real conversational streams where turn boundaries are probabilistic and context-dependent, reflecting the messiness of natural dialogue.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Designed for interruption and overlap: Actively reasons about hesitation, overlap, and mid-speech interruptions to decide whether to yield, pause, or continue speaking.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Speaker-adaptive in real time: Uses a recurrent architecture to converge on user-specific timing patterns within a single session, without explicit calibration or fine-tuning.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Optimized for latency and correctness: Responds immediately when intent is clear and deliberately waits when uncertainty remains, avoiding both interruptions and unnatural delays.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enables speculative inference: Predicts floor transfer proactively, allowing downstream components to begin response generation before the user finishes speaking, committing or discarding output based on real-time floor predictions.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A new architecture for conversational flow&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sparrow-1 is not a general language model or even strictly a turn-taking model. It is a timing and control system that governs when a conversational system should speak, wait, or get out of the way: a conversational-flow model&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This distinction matters because conversational timing is not handled cleanly by most real-time voice architectures. Today, two dominant approaches exist:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;End-to-end speech-to-speech models handle timing implicitly but are expensive, opaque, and difficult to control or customize. They achieve fluency by tightly coupling perception, reasoning, and generation, but sacrifice efficiency and controllability in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modular pipelines (ASR â LLM â TTS) are flexible and scalable but suffer from a coordination problem: timing decisions fall between components, with no dedicated mechanism for deciding when the system should speak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sparrow-1 fills this gap. By explicitly modeling conversational floor transfer as a standalone timing and control layer, it brings human-level conversational-flow to modular pipelines, preserving their flexibility while restoring the conversational feel users expect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Benchmarking Human ConversationÂ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conversational-flow systems are often evaluated on clean endpoints and average latency, but these metrics are not representative of the true human dance, and miss the failures that matter most in real conversation: cutting users off, waiting too long, or behaving inconsistently during hesitation.Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To evaluate these cases, we benchmarked Sparrow-1 against representative industry approaches using 28 challenging real world audio samples of real conversations designed to expose hesitation, overlap, and ambiguous turn endings, rather than clean silence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Interpreting the Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each system was evaluated on the same set of 28 real-world conversational samples. Performance was measured across response latency, correct floor transfer, and interruptions. Correct floor transfer was measured using precision and recall within a 400ms grace window that reflects human conversational tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Correct floor transfer is quantified using precision and recall, with a 400ms grace window that reflects the tolerance humans naturally allow in conversation. Detections occurring within 400ms before a speaker finishes are treated as correct, while earlier responses are classified as interruptions. Precision captures how often a system avoids cutting users off, while recall measures how reliably it responds when a turn is actually complete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across existing approaches, the benchmark exposes a consistent speed and correctness tradeoff. Conservative systems minimize interruptions by waiting for extended silence, but impose multi-second delays that feel unnatural in dialogue. More aggressive systems reduce latency by lowering detection thresholds, but interrupt users frequently. In practice, systems are forced to choose between being slow or being wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These results show that this tradeoff is not inherent to conversation, but a consequence of endpoint-based turn-taking design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;â&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Speed-Correctness Tradeoff&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Existing systems force a choice between responsiveness and correctness:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Conservative approaches like LiveKit avoid most interruptions by waiting for extended silence, but impose unnatural delays. Median latency: 1504ms.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Aggressive approaches like Smart-Turn respond faster by lowering detection thresholds, but interrupt users frequently. Median latency: 237ms. Interruptions: 21 across 28 samples.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;â&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sparrow-1 Breaks the Tradeoff&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sparrow-1 avoids this compromise by responding quickly when a turn is complete and waiting when the user is still speaking, achieving both speed and correctness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This performance reflects a fundamentally different approach. Sparrow-1 treats conversational flow as continuous, frame-level floor ownership prediction, aligning its behavior with human conversational timing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Performance and Latency&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Human conversation optimizes for appropriateness, not speed. People respond quickly when intent is clear and wait when meaning is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Sparrow-1 models conversational certainty directly, its response latency is dynamic. It responds in under 100ms when confident and waits during hesitation or trailing speech, typically producing response times of 200 to 500ms without multi-second delays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This ability to be simultaneously fast and patient creates the perception of zero-latency conversation. The system responds not as quickly as possible, but at the moment it should.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Modeling human-like turn-taking behavior&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These design choices manifest as concrete runtime behaviors that govern how Sparrow-1 adapts, interrupts, and listens during live conversation. At runtime, turn-taking emerges from continuous speaker adaptation, interruption-aware control, and audio-native perception rather than fixed rules or thresholds. The result is behavior that closely matches how humans manage conversational flow in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Adaptation without fine-tuning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sparrow-1 behaves as a meta in-context learner, adapting to individual speaking patterns continuously as a conversation unfolds. Using a recurrent architecture, each 40ms frame updates internal state that encodes prosody, pacing, historical turn timing, and response latency preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early in a conversation, the model operates with higher uncertainty. As evidence accumulates, predictions sharpen around user-specific patterns, producing progressive synchronization without explicit calibration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Interruption handling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interruptions are treated as first-class conversational signals. Incoming speech during system output immediately pauses playback while the model continues evaluating floor ownership. If confidence rises, Sparrow-1 yields the turn. If not, it resumes speaking. This process distinguishes intentional interruptions from incidental overlap within tens of milliseconds without introducing delay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Listening beyond words&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sparrow-1 models conversational intent using acoustic and temporal cues that extend beyond lexical content: interpreting not just what is said, but how it is said:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fillers and hesitations: Vocalizations such as "uh," "um," and partial restarts that signal cognitive load or turn-holding.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trailing vocalizations: Soft completions, rising tones, or fading energy that indicate uncertainty or invite response.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prosodic rhythm: Variations in pacing, pause structure, and intonation that distinguish finished thoughts from mid-utterance pauses.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Emotional cadence: Patterns in energy, timing, and speech continuity that reflect speaker engagement and conversational stance.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By incorporating these paralinguistic signals into its floor predictions, Sparrow-1 aligns with how humans naturally infer attention, hesitation, and intent during conversation: resulting in listening that feels responsive rather than reactive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Access and Closing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built Sparrow-1 as part of a broader mission: teaching machines to participate in human conversation. Our Conversational Video Interface (CVI) powers AI experiences that look, sound, and interact like real people: and poor timing breaks that illusion faster than almost anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In conversational AI, the uncanny valley is rarely about what the AI says. It's about when it says it. Responses that arrive too early feel rude; too late, artificial. In conversational video, these errors are amplified, reminding users they're speaking to a system rather than a partner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use Sparrow-1 to solve this at the level it must be solved: as a first-class timing and control system. By modeling conversational uncertainty directly and responding with human-like precision, it enables interactions that feel attentive, patient, and natural.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sparrow-1 is now available to GA across the Tavus APIs and platform, and already powers conversational experiences in the Tavus PALs and enterprise deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;We presented MayaNAS and MayaScale at OpenZFS Developer Summit 2025 in Portland, Oregon. The centerpiece of our presentation: objbacker.io—a native ZFS VDEV implementation for object storage that bypasses FUSE entirely, achieving 3.7 GB/s read throughput directly from S3, GCS, and Azure Blob Storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Presenting at OpenZFS Summit&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OpenZFS Developer Summit brings together the core developers and engineers who build and maintain ZFS across platforms. It was the ideal venue to present our approach to cloud-native storage: using ZFS's architectural flexibility to create a hybrid storage system that combines the performance of local NVMe with the economics of object storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our 50-minute presentation covered the complete Zettalane storage platform—MayaNAS for file storage and MayaScale for block storage—with a deep technical dive into the objbacker.io implementation that makes ZFS on object storage practical for production workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Cloud NAS Challenge&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud storage economics present a fundamental problem for NAS deployments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;$96K/year&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;100TB on EBS (gp3)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;$360K/year&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;100TB on AWS EFS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insight that drives MayaNAS: not all data needs the same performance tier. Metadata operations require low latency and high IOPS. Large sequential data needs throughput, not IOPS. ZFS's special device architecture lets us place each workload on the appropriate storage tier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;objbacker.io: Native ZFS VDEV for Object Storage&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traditional approach to ZFS on object storage uses FUSE-based filesystems like s3fs or goofys to mount buckets, then creates ZFS pools on top. This works, but FUSE adds overhead: every I/O crosses the kernel-userspace boundary twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; objbacker.io takes a different approach. We implemented a native ZFS VDEV type (&lt;code&gt;VDEV_OBJBACKER&lt;/code&gt;) that communicates directly with a userspace daemon via a character device (&lt;code&gt;/dev/zfs_objbacker&lt;/code&gt;). The daemon uses native cloud SDKs (AWS SDK, Google Cloud SDK, Azure SDK) for direct object storage access.

Aligned writes go directly as PUT requests without caching. This alignment is critical for performance—object storage performs best with large, aligned operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;bucket/00001&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bucket/00002&lt;/code&gt;, etc.
          &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Validated Performance Results&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We presented benchmark results from AWS c5n.9xlarge instances (36 vCPUs, 96 GB RAM, 50 Gbps network):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3.7 GB/s&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sequential Read from S3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.5 GB/s&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sequential Write to S3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to this throughput: parallel bucket I/O.

    &lt;p&gt;Threat Intelligence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Claude Cowork Exfiltrates Files&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Cowork is vulnerable to file exfiltration attacks via indirect prompt injection as a result of known-but-unresolved isolation flaws in Claude's code execution environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Context&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two days ago, Anthropic released the Claude Cowork research preview (a general-purpose AI agent to help anyone with their day-to-day work). In this article, we demonstrate how attackers can exfiltrate user files from Cowork by exploiting an unremediated vulnerability in Claudeâs coding environment, which now extends to Cowork. The vulnerability was first identified in Claude.ai chat before Cowork existed by Johann Rehberger, who disclosed the vulnerability â it was acknowledged but not remediated by Anthropic. &lt;lb/&gt;Anthropic warns users, âCowork is a research preview with unique risks due to its agentic nature and internet access.â Users are recommended to be aware of âsuspicious actions that may indicate prompt injectionâ. However, as this feature is intended for use by the general populace, not just technical users, we agree with Simon Willisonâs take:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;âI do not think it is fair to tell regular non-programmer users to watch out for 'suspicious actions that may indicate prompt injectionâ!â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Anthropic has acknowledged this risk and put it on users to âavoid granting access to local files with sensitive informationâ (while simultaneously encouraging the use of Cowork to organize your Desktop), we have chosen to publicly disclose this demonstration of a threat users should be aware of. By raising awareness, we hope to enable users to better identify the types of âsuspicious actionsâ mentioned in Anthropicâs warning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Attack Chain&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This attack leverages the allowlisting of the Anthropic API to achieve data egress from Claude's VM environment (which restricts most network access).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The victim connects Cowork to a local folder containing confidential real estate files&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victim uploads a file to Claude that contains a hidden prompt injection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;For general use cases, this is quite common; a user finds a file online that they upload to Claude code. This attack is not dependent on the injection source - other injection sources include, but are not limited to: web data from Claude for Chrome, connected MCP servers, etc. In this case, the attack has the file being a Claude âSkillâ (although, as mentioned, it could also just be a regular document), as it is a generalizable file convention that users are likely to encounter, especially when using Claude.&lt;lb/&gt;Note: If you are familiar with Skills, they are canonically Markdown files (which users often do not heavily scrutinize). However, we demonstrate something more interesting: here, the user uploads a .docx (such as may be shared on an online forum), which poses as a Skill - the contents appear to be Markdown that was just saved after editing in Word. In reality, this trick allows attackers to conceal the injection using 1-point font, white-on-white text, and with line spacing set to 0.1 â making it effectively impossible to detect.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The victim asks Cowork to analyze their files using the Real Estate âskillâ they uploaded&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The injection manipulates Cowork to upload files to the attackerâs Anthropic account&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The injection tells Claude to use a âcurlâ command to make a request to the Anthropic file upload API with the largest available file. The injection then provides the attackerâs API key, so the file will be uploaded to the attackerâs account.&lt;lb/&gt;At no point in this process is human approval required.&lt;p&gt;If we expand the 'Running command' block, we can see the malicious request in detail:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Code executed by Claude is run in a VM - restricting outbound network requests to almost all domains - but the Anthropic API flies under the radar as trusted, allowing this attack to complete successfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The attackerâs account contains the victim's file, allowing them to chat with it&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The exfiltrated file contains financial figures and PII, including partial SSNs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A Note on Model-specific Resilience&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above exploit was demonstrated against Claude Haiku. Although Claude Opus 4.5 is known to be more resilient against injections, Opus 4.5 in Cowork was successfully manipulated via indirect prompt injection to leverage the same file upload vulnerability to exfiltrate data in a test that considered a 'user' uploading a malicious integration guide while developing a new AI tool:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the focus of this article was more for everyday users (and not developers), we opted to demonstrate the above attack chain instead of this one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;DOS via Malformed Files&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An interesting finding: Claude's API struggles when a file does not match the type it claims to be. When operating on a malformed PDF (ends .pdf, but it is really a text file with a few sentences in it), after trying to read it once, Claude starts throwing an API error in every subsequent chat in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We posit that it is likely possible to exploit this failure via indirect prompt injection to cause a limited denial of service attack (e.g., an injection can elicit Claude to create a malformed file, and then read it). Uploading the malformed file via the files API resulted in notifications with an error message, both in the Claude client and the Anthropic Console.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Agentic Blast Radius&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the key capabilities that Cowork was created for is the ability to interact with one's entire day-to-day work environment. This includes the browser and MCP servers, granting capabilities like sending texts, controlling one's Mac with AppleScripts, etc. &lt;lb/&gt;These functionalities make it increasingly likely that the model will process both sensitive and untrusted data sources (which the user does not review manually for injections), making prompt injection an ever-growing attack surface. We urge users to exercise caution when configuring Connectors. Though this article demonstrated an exploit without leveraging Connectors, we believe they represent a major risk surface likely to impact everyday users.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The aim of this app is to model the orbital relationship between the Earth and the Sun that results in what we see as relative solar motion. As well as displaying a full 3D Sun-path diagram at the selected site location, you can easily switch between geo-centric and helio-centric views as well as overlaying some information useful for understanding various characteristics of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, turn on the 'Twilight' and 'Circles' overlays and then select 'Summer Soltice' in the 'Useful Dates' menu (). Click the 'Play' button () to animate the time and then look at the North and South poles to clearly see why the Arctic and Antarctic Circles are located where they are. You can do something similar with the 'Sub-Solar' and 'Tropics' options. There are several more that are worth exploring for yourself, such as looking at the Sun-path as you adjust the site latitude and seeing how Declination angle changes with date. Worth it if you can spend a bit of time playing around and experimenting with the model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is another HTML5 version of one of my Java applets in Processing. Having recently done some low-level optimisation of my solar calculations, I needed a better way to actually see the code in action and to interactively put it through its paces. Even the most extensive test suite is never a substitute for a good hands-on visualisation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just doing this app I found really useful and even insightful. Working out different ways to show the various characteristics and how best to handle the two planetary projections actually changed how I thought about the calculations and led to some useful improvements. Hopefully some others might find it similarly useful as a way of better understanding solar motion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following are some of the more interesting features of this app that I had quite a bit of fun implementing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can interactively adjust the 3D view of the model using a mouse, pen or stylus, or by touch on a tablet or phone. You can also use the items in the 3D View Settings popup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE: You can use the Shift and Ctrl/Meta keys to adjust the increment of each scroll event or key press.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Shift and Ctrl/Meta keys are used pretty extensively to modify interactive data entry. This applies to all increment buttons, scroll wheel motion, slider controls and input elements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE: You can use the scroll wheel to edit a data value when hovering over any slider, numeric input or even table rows that indicate their editibility.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The State of OpenSSL for &lt;code&gt;pyca/cryptography&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Published: January 14, 2026&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past 12 years, we (Paul Kehrer and Alex Gaynor) have maintained the Python &lt;code&gt;cryptography&lt;/code&gt; library (also known as &lt;code&gt;pyca/cryptography&lt;/code&gt; or cryptography.io). For that entire period, we’ve relied on OpenSSL to provide core cryptographic algorithms. This past October, we gave a talk at the OpenSSL Conference describing our experiences. This talk focuses on the growing problems we have with OpenSSL’s direction. The mistakes we see in OpenSSL’s development have become so significant that we believe substantial changes are required — either to OpenSSL, or to our reliance on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, OpenSSL’s trajectory can be understood as a play in three acts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the pre-Heartbleed era (pre-2014), OpenSSL was under-maintained and languishing, substantially lagging behind expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the immediate post-Heartbleed era, OpenSSL’s maintenance was reinvigorated and it made substantial progress and improvements. It grew a real code review process, began running tests in CI, adopted fuzz testing, and matured its release process.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finally, in 2021 OpenSSL 3 was released. OpenSSL 3 introduced new APIs and had large internal refactors. Relative to previous OpenSSL versions, OpenSSL 3 had significant regressions in performance, complexity, API ergonomics, and didn’t make needed improvements in areas like testing, verification, and memory safety. Over the same period, OpenSSL’s forks have all made progress in these areas. Many of our concerns about OpenSSL’s direction in this time have substantial overlap with those highlighted by HAProxy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The remainder of this post describes the problems we have with OpenSSL in more detail, and concludes with the changes we are making to our own policies in response. To avoid burying the lede, we intend to pursue several approaches to reducing our reliance on OpenSSL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compared to OpenSSL 1.1.1, OpenSSL 3 has significant performance regressions in areas such as parsing and key loading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several years ago, we filed a bug reporting that elliptic curve public key loading had regressed 5-8x between OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 3.0.7. The reason we had noticed this is that performance had gotten so bad that we’d seen it in our test suite runtimes. Since then, OpenSSL has improved performance such that it’s only 3x slower than it used to be. But more significantly, the response to the issue was that, ‘regression was expected with OpenSSL 3, and while there might be some optimizations, we shouldn’t expect it to ever get back to 1.1.1 levels’. Performance regressions can be acceptable, and even appropriate, when they improve other areas of the library, however as we’ll describe, the cause of these regressions has been other mistakes, and not offsetting improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result of these sorts of regressions, when &lt;code&gt;pyca/cryptography&lt;/code&gt; migrated X.509 certificate parsing from OpenSSL to our own Rust code, we got a 10x performance improvement relative to OpenSSL 3 (n.b., some of this improvement is attributable to advantages in our own code, but much is explainable by the OpenSSL 3 regressions). Later, moving public key parsing to our own Rust code made end-to-end X.509 path validation 60% faster — just improving key loading led to a 60% end-to-end improvement, that’s how extreme the overhead of key parsing in OpenSSL was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that we are able to achieve better performance doing our own parsing makes clear that doing better is practical. And indeed, our performance is not a result of clever SIMD micro-optimizations, it’s the result of doing simple things that work: we avoid copies, allocations, hash tables, indirect calls, and locks — none of which should be required for parsing basic DER structures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Complexity and APIs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenSSL 3 started the process of substantially changing its APIs — it introduced &lt;code&gt;OSSL_PARAM&lt;/code&gt; and has been using those for all new API surfaces (including those for post-quantum cryptographic algorithms). In short, &lt;code&gt;OSSL_PARAM&lt;/code&gt; works by passing arrays of key-value pairs to functions, instead of normal argument passing. This reduces performance, reduces compile-time verification, increases verbosity, and makes code less readable. To the extent there is an argument in favor of it, we infer that the benefit is that it allows OpenSSL to use the same API (and ABI) for different algorithms with different parameters, allowing things like reading algorithm parameters from configuration files with generic configuration parsing code that doesn’t need to be updated when new algorithms are added to OpenSSL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a concrete comparison of the verbosity, performing an ML-KEM encapsulation with OpenSSL takes 37 lines with 6 fallible function calls. Doing so with BoringSSL takes 19 lines with 3 fallible function calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to making public APIs more frustrating and error prone to use, OpenSSL internals have also become more complex. For example, in order to make managing arrays of &lt;code&gt;OSSL_PARAM&lt;/code&gt; palatable, many OpenSSL source files are no longer simply C files, they now have a custom Perl preprocessor for their C code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenSSL 3 also introduced the notion of “providers” (obsoleting, but not replacing, the previous ENGINE APIs), which allow for external implementations of algorithms (including algorithms provided by OpenSSL itself). This was the source of innumerable performance regressions, due to poorly designed APIs. In particular, OpenSSL allowed replacing any algorithm at any point in program execution, which necessitated adding innumerable allocations and locks to nearly every operation. To mitigate this, OpenSSL then added more caches, and ultimately RCU (Read-Copy-Update) — a complex memory management strategy which had difficult to diagnose bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From our perspective, this is a cycle of compounding bad decisions: the providers API was incorrectly designed (there is no need to be able to redefine SHA-256 at arbitrary points in program execution) leading to performance regressions. This led to additional complexity to mitigate those regressions in the form of caching and RCU, which in term led to more bugs. And after all that, performance was still worse than it had been at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, taking an OpenSSL public API and attempting to trace the implementation to see how it is implemented has become an exercise in self-flagellation. Being able to read the source to understand how something works is important both as part of self-improvement in software engineering, but also because as sophisticated consumers there are inevitably things about how an implementation works that aren’t documented, and reading the source gives you ground truth. The number of indirect calls, optional paths, &lt;code&gt;#ifdef&lt;/code&gt;, and other obstacles to comprehension is astounding. We cannot overstate the extent to which just reading the OpenSSL source code has become miserable — in a way that both wasn’t true previously, and isn’t true in LibreSSL, BoringSSL, or AWS-LC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Testing and Verification&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We joke that the Python Cryptographic Authority is a CI engineering project that incidentally produces a cryptography library. The joke reflects our real belief that investment in testing and automation enables Pareto improvements in development speed and correctness — to the point that it can make other work look trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OpenSSL project does not sufficiently prioritize testing. While OpenSSL’s testing has improved substantially since the pre-Heartbleed era there are quite significant gaps. The gaps in OpenSSL’s test coverage were acutely visible during the OpenSSL 3.0 development cycle — where the project was extremely reliant on the community to report regressions experienced during the extended alpha and beta period (covering 19 pre-releases over the course of 16 months), because their own tests were insufficient to catch unintended real-world breakages. Despite the known gaps in OpenSSL’s test coverage, it’s still common for bug fixes to land without an accompanying regression test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenSSL’s CI is exceptionally flaky, and the OpenSSL project has grown to tolerate this flakiness, which masks serious bugs. OpenSSL 3.0.4 contained a critical buffer overflow in the RSA implementation on AVX-512-capable CPUs. This bug was actually caught by CI — but because the crash only occurred when the CI runner happened to have an AVX-512 CPU (not all did), the failures were apparently dismissed as flakiness. Three years later, the project still merges code with failing tests: the day we prepared our conference slides, five of ten recent commits had failing CI checks, and the day before we delivered the talk, every single commit had failing cross-compilation builds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This incident also speaks to the value of adopting tools like Intel SDE, which allows controlled testing against CPUs with different subsets of x86-64 extension instructions. Using Intel SDE to have dedicated test jobs with and without AVX-512 would have made the nature of the failure immediately legible and reproducible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenSSL is not keeping pace with the state of the art in formal verification. Formal methods have gone from academic novelty to practical reality for meaningful chunks of cryptographic code. BoringSSL and AWS-LC have incorporated formally verified implementations and use automated reasoning to increase assurance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Memory Safety&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time OpenSSL was created, there were no programming languages that meaningfully provided performance, embeddability, and memory safety — if you wanted a memory safe language, you were committing to giving up performance and adding a garbage collector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The world has changed. Nearly 5 years ago, &lt;code&gt;pyca/cryptography&lt;/code&gt; issued our first release incorporating Rust code, and since then we have migrated nearly all functionality to Rust, using a mix of pure-Rust for all parsing and X.509 operations combined with using OpenSSL for providing cryptographic algorithms — gaining performance wins and avoiding several OpenSSL CVEs. We know these transitions are possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A library committed to security needs to make a long-term commitment to a migration to a memory safe programming language. OpenSSL has shown no initiative at all on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Contributing Causes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whenever issues with an open source project are raised, many will suggest this is an issue of funding or tragedy of the commons. This is inapposite, in the past decade, post-Heartbleed, OpenSSL has received considerable funding, and at this moment the OpenSSL Corporation and Foundation employ more software engineers than work full time on either BoringSSL or LibreSSL. The problems we have described are not ones caused by underfunding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We do not fully understand the motivations that led to the public APIs and internal complexity we’ve described here. We’ve done our best to reverse engineer them by asking “what would motivate someone to do this” and often we’ve found ourselves coming up short. The fact that none of the other OpenSSL forks have made these same design choices is informative to the question of “was this necessary”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Future Directions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our experience with OpenSSL has been on a negative trajectory for several years. As a result of these issues, we are making the following changes to our (admittedly undocumented) policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, we will no longer require OpenSSL implementations for new functionality. Where we deem it desirable, we will add new APIs that are only on LibreSSL/BoringSSL/AWS-LC. Concretely, we expect to add ML-KEM and ML-DSA APIs that are only available with LibreSSL/BoringSSL/AWS-LC, and not with OpenSSL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, we currently statically link a copy of OpenSSL in our wheels (binary artifacts). We are beginning the process of looking into what would be required to change our wheels to link against one of the OpenSSL forks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we are able to successfully switch to one of OpenSSL’s forks for our binary wheels, we will begin considering the circumstances under which we would drop support for OpenSSL entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, in the long term, we are actively tracking non-OpenSSL derived cryptography libraries such as Graviola as potential alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recognize that changes in which libraries we use to provide cryptographic implementations have substantial impact on our users — particularly redistributors. We do not contemplate these steps lightly, nor do we anticipate making them hastily. However, due to the gravity of our concerns, we are compelled to act. If you rely on &lt;code&gt;pyca/cryptography&lt;/code&gt;’s support for OpenSSL, the best way to avoid the most drastic steps contemplated here is to engage with the OpenSSL project and contribute to improvements on these axes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Scaling long-running autonomous coding&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've been experimenting with running coding agents autonomously for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our goal is to understand how far we can push the frontier of agentic coding for projects that typically take human teams months to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post describes what we've learned from running hundreds of concurrent agents on a single project, coordinating their work, and watching them write over a million lines of code and trillions of tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The limits of a single agent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today's agents work well for focused tasks, but are slow for complex projects. The natural next step is to run multiple agents in parallel, but figuring out how to coordinate them is challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our first instinct was that planning ahead would be too rigid. The path through a large project is ambiguous, and the right division of work isn't obvious at the start. We began with dynamic coordination, where agents decide what to do based on what others are currently doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Learning to coordinate&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our initial approach gave agents equal status and let them self-coordinate through a shared file. Each agent would check what others were doing, claim a task, and update its status. To prevent two agents from grabbing the same task, we used a locking mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This failed in interesting ways:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Agents would hold locks for too long, or forget to release them entirely. Even when locking worked correctly, it became a bottleneck. Twenty agents would slow down to the effective throughput of two or three, with most time spent waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The system was brittle: agents could fail while holding locks, try to acquire locks they already held, or update the coordination file without acquiring the lock at all.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We tried replacing locks with optimistic concurrency control. Agents could read state freely, but writes would fail if the state had changed since they last read it. This was simpler and more robust, but there were still deeper problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With no hierarchy, agents became risk-averse. They avoided difficult tasks and made small, safe changes instead. No agent took responsibility for hard problems or end-to-end implementation. This lead to work churning for long periods of time without progress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Planners and workers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our next approach was to separate roles. Instead of a flat structure where every agent does everything, we created a pipeline with distinct responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Planners continuously explore the codebase and create tasks. They can spawn sub-planners for specific areas, making planning itself parallel and recursive.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Workers pick up tasks and focus entirely on completing them. They don't coordinate with other workers or worry about the big picture. They just grind on their assigned task until it's done, then push their changes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of each cycle, a judge agent determined whether to continue, then the next iteration would start fresh. This solved most of our coordination problems and let us scale to very large projects without any single agent getting tunnel vision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Running for weeks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test this system, we pointed it at an ambitious goal: building a web browser from scratch. The agents ran for close to a week, writing over 1 million lines of code across 1,000 files. You can explore the source code on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the codebase size, new agents can still understand it and make meaningful progress. Hundreds of workers run concurrently, pushing to the same branch with minimal conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While it might seem like a simple screenshot, building a browser from scratch is extremely difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another experiment was doing an in-place migration of Solid to React in the Cursor codebase. It took over 3 weeks with +266K/-193K edits. As we've started to test the changes, we do believe it's possible to merge this change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another experiment was to improve an upcoming product. A long-running agent made video rendering 25x faster with an efficient Rust version. It also added support to zoom and pan smoothly with natural spring transitions and motion blurs, following the cursor. This code was merged and will be in production soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a few other interesting examples still running:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Java LSP: 7.4K commits, 550K LoC&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Windows 7 emulator: 14.6K commits, 1.2M LoC&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Excel: 12K commits, 1.6M LoC&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What we've learned&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've deployed billions of tokens across these agents toward a single goal. The system isn't perfectly efficient, but it's far more effective than we expected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Model choice matters for extremely long-running tasks. We found that GPT-5.2 models are much better at extended autonomous work: following instructions, keeping focus, avoiding drift, and implementing things precisely and completely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Opus 4.5 tends to stop earlier and take shortcuts when convenient, yielding back control quickly. We also found that different models excel at different roles. GPT-5.2 is a better planner than GPT-5.1-codex, even though the latter is trained specifically for coding. We now use the model best suited for each role rather than one universal model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of our improvements came from removing complexity rather than adding it. We initially built an integrator role for quality control and conflict resolution, but found it created more bottlenecks than it solved. Workers were already capable of handling conflicts themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best system is often simpler than you'd expect. We initially tried to model systems from distributed computing and organizational design. However, not all of them work for agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The right amount of structure is somewhere in the middle. Too little structure and agents conflict, duplicate work, and drift. Too much structure creates fragility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A surprising amount of the system's behavior comes down to how we prompt the agents. Getting them to coordinate well, avoid pathological behaviors, and maintain focus over long periods required extensive experimentation. The harness and models matter, but the prompts matter more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What's next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multi-agent coordination remains a hard problem. Our current system works, but we're nowhere near optimal. Planners should wake up when their tasks complete to plan the next step. Agents occasionally run for far too long. We still need periodic fresh starts to combat drift and tunnel vision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the core question, can we scale autonomous coding by throwing more agents at a problem, has a more optimistic answer than we expected. Hundreds of agents can work together on a single codebase for weeks, making real progress on ambitious projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The techniques we're developing here will eventually inform Cursor's agent capabilities. If you're interested in working on the hardest problems in AI-assisted software development, we'd love to hear from you at hiring@cursor.com.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;archive.today has recently (I noticed this, like, 3 days ago) started automatically making requests to someone's personal blog on their CAPTCHA page. Here's a screenshot of what I'm talking about: https://files.catbox.moe/20jsle.png&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The relevant JS is:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;quote&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;   setInterval(function() {
     fetch("https://gyrovague.com/?s=" + Math.round(new Date().getTime() % 10000000), {
       referrerPolicy: "no-referrer",
       mode: "no-cors"
     });
   }, 300);
&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt; Looking at this blog, there seems to be exactly one article mentioning archive.today - "archive.today: On the trail of the mysterious guerrilla archivist of the Internet" (https://gyrovague.com/2023/08/05/archive-today-on-the-trail-of-the-mysterious-guerrilla-archivist-of-the-internet/), where the person running the blog digs up some information about archive's owner.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So perhaps this is some kind of revenge/DOS attack attempt/deliberately wasting their bandwidth in response to this article? Maybe an attempt to silence them and force to delete their article? But if it is, then I have so many questions. Like, why would the owner of the archive do that 2.5 years after the article was published? Or why would they even do that in the first place, do they not know about Streisand effect?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I'm confused.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;New Safari developer tools provide insight into CSS Grid Lanes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might have heard recently that Safari Technology Preview 234 landed the final plan for supporting masonry-style layouts in CSS. It’s called Grid Lanes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CSS Grid Lanes adds a whole new capability to CSS Grid. It lets you line up content in either columns or rows — and not both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This layout pattern allows content of various aspect ratios to pack together. No longer do you need to truncate content artificially to make it fit. Plus, the content that’s earlier in the HTML gets grouped together towards the start of the container. If new items get lazy loaded, they appear at the end without reshuffling what’s already on screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can be tricky to understand the content flow pattern as you are learning Grid Lanes. The content is not flowing down the first column to the very bottom of the container, and then back up to the top of the second column. (If you want that pattern, use CSS Multicolumn or Flexbox.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Grid Lanes, the content flows perpendicular to the layout shape you created. When you define columns, the content flows back and forth across those columns, just like to how it would if rows existed. If you define rows, the content will flow up and down through the rows — in the column direction, as if columns were there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having a way to see the order of items can make it easier to understand this content flow. Introducing the CSS Grid Lanes Inspector in Safari. It’s just the regular Grid Inspector, now with more features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Safari’s Grid Inspector already reveals the grid lines for Grid Lanes, and labels track sizes, line numbers, line names, and area names. Now it has a new feature — “Order Numbers”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By turning on the order numbers in the example above, we can clearly see how Item 1, 2, 3, and 4 flow across the columns, as if there were a row. Then Item 5 is in the middle right, followed by Item 6 on the far right, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might be tempted to believe the content order doesn’t matter. With pages like this photo gallery — most users will have no idea how the photos are ordered in the HTML. But for many users, the content order has a big impact on their experience. You should always consider what it’s like to tab through content — watching one item after another sequentially come into focus. Consider what it’s like to listen to the site through a screenreader while navigating by touch or keyboard. With Grid Lanes, you can adjust &lt;code&gt;flow-tolerance&lt;/code&gt; to reduce the jumping around and put items where people expect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To know which value for flow tolerance to choose, it really helps to quickly see the order of items. That makes it immediately clear how your CSS impacts the result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Order Numbers in the Grid Inspector is an extension of a feature Safari’s Flexbox Inspector has had since Safari 16.0 — marking the order of Flex items. Seeing content order is also helpful when using the &lt;code&gt;order&lt;/code&gt; property in Flexbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Order Numbers in Safari’s Grid Inspector works for CSS Grid and Subgrid, as well as Grid Lanes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Try out Safari’s layout tooling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Grid and Flexbox layout inspectors might seem similar across browsers, but the team behind Safari’s Web Inspector has taken the time to finely polish the details. In both the Grid and Flexbox Inspectors, you can simultaneously activate as many overlays as you want. No limits. And no janky scrolling due to performance struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Safari’s Flexbox Inspector visually distinguishes between excess free space and Flex gaps, since knowing which is which can solve confusion. It shows the boundaries of items, revealing how they are distributed both on the main axis and the cross axis of Flexbox containers. And it lists all the Flexbox containers, making it easier to understand what’s happening overall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our Grid Inspector has a simple and clear interface, making it easy to understand the options. It also lists all Grid containers. And of course, you can change the default colors of the overlays, to best contrast with your site content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Safari’s Grid and Flexbox Inspectors are the only browser devtools that label content order. We hope seeing the order of content in Grid Lanes helps you understand it more thoroughly and enjoy using this powerful new layout mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Try out Order Numbers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Order Numbers in Safari’s Grid Inspector shipped today in Safari Technology Preview 235. Let us know what you think. There’s still time to polish the details to make the most helpful tool possible. You can ping Jen Simmons on Bluesky or Mastodon with links, comments and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Furiosa NXT RNGD Server: Efficient AI inference at data center scale&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;News&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are excited to introduce FuriosaAI’s NXT RNGD Server—our first branded, turnkey solution for AI inference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Built around our RNGD accelerators, NXT RNGD Server is an optimized system that delivers high performance on today’s most important AI workloads while fitting seamlessly into existing data center environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With NXT RNGD Server, enterprises can move from experimentation to deployment faster than ever. The system ships with the Furiosa SDK and Furiosa LLM runtime preinstalled, so applications can serve immediately upon installation. We optimized the platform over standard PCIe interconnects, eliminating the need for proprietary fabrics or exotic infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designed for compatibility, NXT RNGD Server runs at just 3 kW per system, allowing organizations to scale AI within the power and cooling limits of most modern facilities. This makes NXT RNGD Server a practical and cost-effective system to build out AI factories inside the data centers enterprises already operate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Technical Specifications&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Compute: Up to 8 × RNGD accelerators (4 petaFLOPS FP8 per server) with dual AMD EPYC processors. Supports BF16, FP8, INT8, and INT4&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Memory: 384 GB HBM3 (12 TB/s bandwidth) plus 1 TB DDR5 system memory&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Storage: 2 × 960 GB NVMe M.2 (OS), 2 × 3.84 TB NVMe U.2 (internal)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Networking: 1G management NIC plus 2 × 25G data NICs&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Power &amp;amp; Cooling: 3 kW system power, redundant 2,000 W Titanium PSUs, air-cooled&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Security &amp;amp; Management: Secure Boot, TPM, BMC attestation, dual management paths (PCIe + I2C)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Software: Preinstalled Furiosa SDK and Furiosa LLM runtime with native Kubernetes and Helm integration&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Real-world benefits and proven performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NXT RNGD Server’s superior power efficiency significantly lowers businesses’ TCO. Enterprise customers can run advanced AI efficiently at scale within current infrastructure and power limitations – using on-prem servers or cloud data centers. This is crucial for leveraging existing infrastructure, since more than 80% of data centers today are air-cooled and operate at 8 kW per rack or less. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For businesses with sensitive workloads, regulatory compliance requirements, or enhanced privacy and security needs, NXT RNGD Server offers complete control over enterprise data, with model weights running entirely on local infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Global enterprises have validated NXT RNGD Server’s performance. In July, LG AI Research announced that it has adopted RNGD for inference computing with its EXAONE models. Running LG’s EXAONE 3.5 32B model on a single server with four RNGD cards and a batch size of one, LG AI Research achieved 60 tokens/second with a 4K context window and 50 tokens/second with a 32K context window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are now working with LG AI Research to supply NXT RNGD servers to enterprises using EXAONE across key sectors, including electronics, finance, telecommunications, and biotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Making rapid deployment of advanced AI available to everyone&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With global data center demand at 60 GW in 2024 and expected to triple by the end of the decade, the industry faces a once-in-a-generation transformation. More than 80 percent of facilities today are air-cooled and operate at 8 kW per rack or less, making them poorly suited for GPU-based systems that require liquid cooling and 10 kW+ per server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NXT RNGD Server provides a practical path forward. It allows organizations to deploy advanced AI within their existing facilities, without prohibitive energy costs or disruptive retrofits.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With research done till date, what according to you is the best way to provide context to a model. Are there any articles that go into depth of how Cursor does it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the emerging best way is to do "agentic search" over files. If you think about it, Claude Code is quite good at navigating large codebases and finding the required context for a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further, instead of polluting the context of your main agent, you can run a subagent to do search and retrieve the important bits of information and report back to your main agent. This is what Claude Code does if you use the keyword "explore". It starts a subagent with Haiku which reads ten of thousands of tokens in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From my experience the only shortcoming of this approach right now is that it's slow, and sometimes haiku misses some details in what it reads. These will get better very soon (in one or two generations, we will likely see opus 4.5 level intelligence at haiku speeds/price). For now, if not missing a detail is important for your usecase, you can give the output from the first subagent to a second one and ask the second one to find important details the first one missed. I've found this additional step to catch most things the first search missed. You can try this for yourself with Claude Code: ask it to create a plan for your spec, and then pass the plan to a second Claude Code session and ask it to find gaps and missing files from the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gemini 3 Flash is very good at the search task (it benchmarks quite close to 3 Pro in coding tasks but is much faster). I believe Amp switch to Gemini Flash for their search agent because it is better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What works best for me using Claude Code is to let the CC engineer its own context. You need to provide it with tools that it can use to engineer its context. CC comes with a lot of tools already (grep, sed, curl, etc), but for specific domain you may want to add more, e.g., access to a database, a cms, a parser for a bespoke language, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With these i'll mostly just give it questions: what are some approaches to implement x, what are the pros and cons, what libraries are available to handle x? What data would you need to create x screen, or y report? And then let it google it, or run queries on your data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll have it create markdown documents or skills to persist the insights it comes back with that will be useful in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs are pretty good at plan/do/check/act: create a plan (maybe to run a query to see what tables you have in your database), run the query, understand the output, and then determine the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your main goal should be to enable the PDCA loop of the LLM through tools you provide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every time you send a request to a model you're already providing all of the context history along with it. To edit the context, just send a different context history. You can send whatever you want as history, it's entirely up to you and entirely arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We only think in conversational turns because that's what we've expected a conversation to 'look like'. But that's just a very deeply ingrained convention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forget that there is such a thing as 'turns' in a LLM convo for now, imagine that it's all 'one-shot'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So you ask A, it responds A1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when you and B, and expect B1 - which depends on A and A1 already being in the convo history - consider that you are actually sending that again anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes when you think you're sending just 'B' (next prompt) you're actually sending A + A1 + B aka including the history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A and A1 are usually 'cached' but that's not the simplest way to do it, the caching is an optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without caching the model would just process all of A + A1 + B and B1 in return just the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then A + A1 + B + B1 + C and expect C1 in return.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It just so happens it will cache the state of the convo at your previous turn, and so it's optimized but the key insight is that you can send whatever context you want at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If after you send A + A1 + B + B1 + C and get C1, if you want to then send A + B + C + D and expect D1 ... (basically sending the prompts with no responses) - you can totally do that. It will have to re-process all of that aka no cached state, but it will definitely do it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heck you can send Z + A + X, or A + A1 + X + Y - or whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in that sense - what you are really sending (if you're using the simplest form API), is sending 'a bunch of content' and 'expecting a response'. That's it. Everything is actually 'one shot' (prefill =&amp;gt; response) and that's it. It feels conversational but structural and operational convention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the very simple answer to your question is: send whatever context you want. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you know you will be pruning or otherwise reusing the context across multiple threads, the best place for context that will be retained is at the beginning due to prompt caching - it will reduce the cost and improve the speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If not, inserting new context any place other than at the end will cause cache misses and therefore slow down the response and increase cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Models also have some bias for tokens at start and end of the context window, so potentially there is a reason to put important instructions in one of those places.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I open 4 chat windows with Gemini 3.0 Pro. I paste in all file contents to each window. I ask them "which files would an AI need to do $TASK effectively?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each of the 4 responses will disagree, despite some overlap. I take the union of the 4 responses as the canonical set of files that an implementer would need to see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This reduces the risk of missing key files, while increasing the risk of including marginally important files. An easy trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I paste the subset of files into GPT 5.2 Pro, and give it $TASK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could replace the upstream process with N codex sessions instead of N gemini chat windows. It doesn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This process can be automated with structured json outputs, but I haven't bothered yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It uses much inference compute. But it's better than missing key inputs and wasting time with hallucinated output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That sounds cumbersome and even more wasteful than my own method of simply dumping a fixed selection of project code in Gemini for each set of requests. Is there any benefit to pruning?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We ran into this while building GTWY.ai. What worked for us wasn’t trying to keep a single model “continuously informed”, but breaking work into smaller steps with explicit context passed between them. Long-lived context drifted fast. Short-lived, well-scoped context stayed predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no such thing as continuous context. There is only context that you start and stop, which is the same as typing those words in the prompt. To make anything carry over to a second thread, it must be included in the second thread's context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rules are just context, too, and all elaborate AI control systems boil down to these contexts and tool calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, you can rig it up anyway you like. Only the context in the actual thread (or "continuation," as it used to be called) is sent to the model, which has no memory or context outside that prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Furthermore, all of the major LLM APIs reward you for re-sending the same context with only appended data in the form of lower token costs (caching).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a little more flexibility than that. You can strip of some trailing context before appending some new context. This allows you to keep the 'long-term context' minimal, while still making good use of the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i dont understand why these questions are so common? is it not obvious how one should use these capabilities? i compose my context in md file and send it through API. i wrote a simple lms.exe to send context and append response to the same file. why doesn't everyone else do that? i never believed in agents that compose their own context like Cursor. and i always pass the lowest reasoning value parameter to the API I can. why doesn't anyone else do this? you become dependent on a tool, you're already dependent some of you on fancy IDEs and agents. we're already dependent on top 3 vendors and openai is the only one that no one complains about from API key configuration side. you're gonna become dependent not only on LLMs but on the tooling as well? no thanks. anyone with a different opinion regarding this down to exact work flow, you are walking down the wrong path. you have to become efficient at converting electricity to text. admit it, some are just better than others while some will never get it at all. you know you won't because you know people in your life that never change their opinions about something, or always get into car accidents because they're a bad driver. you cant change these people and you might be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A free, open source, and extensible speech-to-text application that works completely offline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Handy is a cross-platform desktop application built with Tauri (Rust + React/TypeScript) that provides simple, privacy-focused speech transcription. Press a shortcut, speak, and have your words appear in any text field—all without sending your voice to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Handy was created to fill the gap for a truly open source, extensible speech-to-text tool. As stated on handy.computer:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Free: Accessibility tooling belongs in everyone's hands, not behind a paywall&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open Source: Together we can build further. Extend Handy for yourself and contribute to something bigger&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Private: Your voice stays on your computer. Get transcriptions without sending audio to the cloud&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simple: One tool, one job. Transcribe what you say and put it into a text box&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Handy isn't trying to be the best speech-to-text app—it's trying to be the most forkable one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Press a configurable keyboard shortcut to start/stop recording (or use push-to-talk mode)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Speak your words while the shortcut is active&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Release and Handy processes your speech using Whisper&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Get your transcribed text pasted directly into whatever app you're using&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The process is entirely local:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Silence is filtered using VAD (Voice Activity Detection) with Silero&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transcription uses your choice of models: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Whisper models (Small/Medium/Turbo/Large) with GPU acceleration when available&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Parakeet V3 - CPU-optimized model with excellent performance and automatic language detection&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download the latest release from the releases page or the website&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install the application following platform-specific instructions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Launch Handy and grant necessary system permissions (microphone, accessibility)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configure your preferred keyboard shortcuts in Settings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start transcribing!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For detailed build instructions including platform-specific requirements, see BUILD.md.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Handy is built as a Tauri application combining:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Frontend: React + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS for the settings UI&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Backend: Rust for system integration, audio processing, and ML inference&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Core Libraries: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;whisper-rs&lt;/code&gt;: Local speech recognition with Whisper models&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;transcription-rs&lt;/code&gt;: CPU-optimized speech recognition with Parakeet models&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;cpal&lt;/code&gt;: Cross-platform audio I/O&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;vad-rs&lt;/code&gt;: Voice Activity Detection&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rdev&lt;/code&gt;: Global keyboard shortcuts and system events&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rubato&lt;/code&gt;: Audio resampling&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Handy includes an advanced debug mode for development and troubleshooting. Access it by pressing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;macOS: &lt;code&gt;Cmd+Shift+D&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Windows/Linux: &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+Shift+D&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project is actively being developed and has some known issues. We believe in transparency about the current state:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whisper Model Crashes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Whisper models crash on certain system configurations (Windows and Linux)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Does not affect all systems - issue is configuration-dependent &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;If you experience crashes and are a developer, please help to fix and provide debug logs!&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wayland Support (Linux):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Limited support for Wayland display server&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Requires &lt;code&gt;wtype&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;dotool&lt;/code&gt;for text input to work correctly (see Linux Notes below for installation)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Text Input Tools:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For reliable text input on Linux, install the appropriate tool for your display server:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Display Server&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Recommended Tool&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Install Command&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;X11&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;xdotool&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;sudo apt install xdotool&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Wayland&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;wtype&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;sudo apt install wtype&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Both&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;dotool&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt install dotool&lt;/code&gt; (requires &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; group)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;X11: Install &lt;code&gt;xdotool&lt;/code&gt;for both direct typing and clipboard paste shortcuts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wayland: Install &lt;code&gt;wtype&lt;/code&gt;(preferred) or&lt;code&gt;dotool&lt;/code&gt;for text input to work correctly&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dotool setup: Requires adding your user to the &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt;group:&lt;code&gt;sudo usermod -aG input $USER&lt;/code&gt;(then log out and back in)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without these tools, Handy falls back to enigo which may have limited compatibility, especially on Wayland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recording overlay is disabled by default on Linux (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Overlay Position: None&lt;/code&gt;) because certain compositors treat it as the active window. When the overlay is visible it can steal focus, which prevents Handy from pasting back into the application that triggered transcription. If you enable the overlay anyway, be aware that clipboard-based pasting might fail or end up in the wrong window.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are having trouble with the app, running with the environment variable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1&lt;/code&gt;may help&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can manage global shortcuts outside of Handy and still control the app via signals. Sending&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SIGUSR2&lt;/code&gt;to the Handy process toggles recording on/off, which lets Wayland window managers or other hotkey daemons keep ownership of keybindings. Example (Sway):&lt;quote&gt;bindsym $mod+o exec pkill -USR2 -n handy&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;code&gt;pkill&lt;/code&gt;here simply delivers the signal—it does not terminate the process.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;x64 Windows&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;x64 Linux&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following are recommendations for running Handy on your own machine. If you don't meet the system requirements, the performance of the application may be degraded. We are working on improving the performance across all kinds of computers and hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Whisper Models:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;macOS: M series Mac, Intel Mac&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Windows: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Parakeet V3 Model:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CPU-only operation - runs on a wide variety of hardware&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Minimum: Intel Skylake (6th gen) or equivalent AMD processors&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Performance: ~5x real-time speed on mid-range hardware (tested on i5)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatic language detection - no manual language selection required&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're actively working on several features and improvements. Contributions and feedback are welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Debug Logging:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Adding debug logging to a file to help diagnose issues&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;macOS Keyboard Improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for Globe key as transcription trigger&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A rewrite of global shortcut handling for MacOS, and potentially other OS's too.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Opt-in Analytics:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Collect anonymous usage data to help improve Handy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Privacy-first approach with clear opt-in&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Settings Refactoring:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cleanup and refactor settings system which is becoming bloated and messy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Implement better abstractions for settings management&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tauri Commands Cleanup:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Abstract and organize Tauri command patterns&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Investigate tauri-specta for improved type safety and organization&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're behind a proxy, firewall, or in a restricted network environment where Handy cannot download models automatically, you can manually download and install them. The URLs are publicly accessible from any browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open Handy settings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Navigate to the About section&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Copy the "App Data Directory" path shown there, or use the shortcuts: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;macOS: &lt;code&gt;Cmd+Shift+D&lt;/code&gt;to open debug menu&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Windows/Linux: &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+Shift+D&lt;/code&gt;to open debug menu&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;macOS: &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The typical paths are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;macOS: &lt;code&gt;~/Library/Application Support/com.pais.handy/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Windows: &lt;code&gt;C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\com.pais.handy\&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux: &lt;code&gt;~/.config/com.pais.handy/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inside your app data directory, create a &lt;code&gt;models&lt;/code&gt; folder if it doesn't already exist:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# macOS/Linux
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.pais.handy/models

# Windows (PowerShell)
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:APPDATA\com.pais.handy\models"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download the models you want from below&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whisper Models (single .bin files):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Small (487 MB): &lt;code&gt;https://blob.handy.computer/ggml-small.bin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Medium (492 MB): &lt;code&gt;https://blob.handy.computer/whisper-medium-q4_1.bin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Turbo (1600 MB): &lt;code&gt;https://blob.handy.computer/ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Large (1100 MB): &lt;code&gt;https://blob.handy.computer/ggml-large-v3-q5_0.bin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parakeet Models (compressed archives):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;V2 (473 MB): &lt;code&gt;https://blob.handy.computer/parakeet-v2-int8.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;V3 (478 MB): &lt;code&gt;https://blob.handy.computer/parakeet-v3-int8.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Whisper Models (.bin files):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simply place the &lt;code&gt;.bin&lt;/code&gt; file directly into the &lt;code&gt;models&lt;/code&gt; directory:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{app_data_dir}/models/
├── ggml-small.bin
├── whisper-medium-q4_1.bin
├── ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin
└── ggml-large-v3-q5_0.bin
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Parakeet Models (.tar.gz archives):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extract the &lt;code&gt;.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt;file&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Place the extracted directory into the &lt;code&gt;models&lt;/code&gt;folder&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The directory must be named exactly as follows: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Parakeet V2: &lt;code&gt;parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-int8&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Parakeet V3: &lt;code&gt;parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parakeet V2: &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Final structure should look like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{app_data_dir}/models/
├── parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-int8/     (directory with model files inside)
│   ├── (model files)
│   └── (config files)
└── parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8/     (directory with model files inside)
    ├── (model files)
    └── (config files)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For Parakeet models, the extracted directory name must match exactly as shown above&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Do not rename the &lt;code&gt;.bin&lt;/code&gt;files for Whisper models—use the exact filenames from the download URLs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After placing the files, restart Handy to detect the new models&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Restart Handy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Open Settings → Models&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your manually installed models should now appear as "Downloaded"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Select the model you want to use and test transcription&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Check existing issues at github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fork the repository and create a feature branch&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Test thoroughly on your target platform&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Submit a pull request with clear description of changes&lt;/item&gt;
