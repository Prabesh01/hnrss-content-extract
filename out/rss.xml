  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality close-up appearances. We propose Skyfall-GS, the first city-block scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and photorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyfall-GS provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures compared to state-of-the-art approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our method synthesizes immersive and free-flight navigable city-block scale 3D scenes solely from multi-view satellite imagery in two stages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(a) Reconstruction Stage&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(b) Synthesis Stage&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a follow-up to my previous article, Terminal Emulators Battle Royale â Unicode Edition! from 2023, in which I documented Unicode support across terminal emulators. Since then, the ucs-detect tool and its supporting blessed library have been extended to automatically detect support of DEC Private Modes, sixel graphics, pixel size, and software version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ucs-detect program tests terminal cursor positioning by sending visible text followed by control sequences that request the cursor position. The terminal responds by writing the cursor location as simulated keyboard input. The ucs-detect program reads and compares these values against the Python wcwidth library result, logging any discrepancies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Width Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terminal emulators face a fundamental challenge: mapping the vast breadth of Unicode scripts into a fixed-width grid while maintaining legibility. A terminal must predict whether each character occupies one cell or two, whether combining marks overlay previous characters, and how emoji sequences collapse into single glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These predictions fail routinely. Zero-width joiners, variation selectors, and grapheme clustering compound in complexity. When terminals and CLI applications guess wrong, text becomes unreadable - cursors misalign and corrupt output and so then also corrupt the location of our input.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our results share which terminals have the best "Unicode support" -- the least likely to exhibit these kinds of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Gentleman Errant&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before presenting the latest results, Ghostty warrants particular attention, not only because it scored the highest among all terminals tested, but that it was publicly released only this year by Mitchell Hashimoto. It is a significant advancement. Developed from scratch in zig, the Unicode support implementation is thoroughly correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, Mitchell published Grapheme Clusters and Terminal Emulators, demonstrating a commitment to understanding and implementing the fundamentals. His recent announcement of libghostty provides a welcome alternative to libvte, potentially enabling a new generation of terminals on a foundation of strong Unicode support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Errant Champion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kovid Goyal's Kitty scored just as well, only outranked by the arbitrary weights that are not necessarily fair. More important than scoring is Kovid's publication of a text-splitting algorithm description that closely matches the Python wcwidth specification. This is unsurprising since both are derived from careful interpretation of Unicode.org standards and that it scores so highly in our test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kitty and Ghostty are the only terminals that correctly support Variation Selector 15, I have not written much about it because it is not likely to see any practical use, but, it will be added to a future release of Python wcwidth now that there are multiple standards and reference implementations in agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Testing Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first table, General Tabulated Summary describes unicode features of each terminal, then, a brief summary of DEC Private Modes, sixel support, and testing time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second table, DEC Private Modes Support (not pictured), contains the first feature capability matrix of DEC Private Modes for Terminals of any length. I hope this is useful most especially to developers of CLI libraries and applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Long Road&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most notable finding relates to performance. That many terminals perform so slowly was surprising, so I have included the elapsed time in the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;iTerm2 and Extraterm consume a majority of the CPU and perform so slowly that the test parameters were reduced to finish within the hour what many other terminals manage in a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GNOME Terminal and its VTE-based derivatives also perform too slowly for a full test, taking over 5 hours while consuming very little CPU. Many terminals exhibit stalls or inefficiencies in their event loops that result in slow automatic responses, but we should be forgiving; nobody really considered the need to handle hundreds of automatic sequence replies per second!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I expected Python wcwidth to consume the most CPU resources during testing, as it is frequently called and always the "highest-level" language in the mix, but it keeps up pretty well for most terminals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I dedicated effort to optimizing the Python wcwidth implementation using techniques including bit vectors, bloom filters, and varying sizes of LRU caches. The results confirmed that the existing implementation performed best: a binary search with a functools.lru_cache decorator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LRU cache is effective because human languages typically use a small, repetitive subset of Unicode. The ucs-detect tool tests hundreds of languages from the UDHR dataset, excluding only those without any interesting zero or wide characters. This dataset provides an extreme but practical demonstration of LRU cache benefits when processing Unicode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I previously considered distributing a C module with Python wcwidth for greater performance, but the existing Python implementation keeps up well enough with the fastest terminals. When fully exhausted the text scroll speed is fast enough to produce screen tearing artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tilting at Edges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terminology produces inconsistent results between executions. Our tests are designed to be deterministic, so these kinds of results suggest possible state corruption. Despite this issue, Terminology offers interesting visual effects that would be a welcome feature in other terminals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;iTerm2 reports "supported, but disabled, and cannot be changed" status for all DEC Private Modes queried, including fictional modes like 9876543. For this reason, the summary of DEC Private Modes shows only those modes that are changeable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Konsole does not reply to queries about DEC Private modes, but does support several modes when they are enabled. For this reason, ucs-detect cannot automatically infer which DEC Modes Konsole supports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, ucs-detect reports "No DEC Private Mode Support" for Contour. I investigated this discrepancy because Contour's author also authored a Mode 2027 specification dependent on this functionality. The issue was that Contour responded with a different mode number than the one queried. While developing a fix, Contour's latest release from December 2024 presented an additional complication: a bad escape key configuration. Each instance of being stuck in vi required typing CTRL + [ as a workaround!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terminals based on libvte with software version label VTE/7600 continue to show identical performance with low scores in our tests, unchanged from 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My attempt to discuss improving Unicode support in libvte received substantial criticism. However, recent libvte project issue Support Emoji Sequences is a positive indicator for improved language and Emoji support in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;On Mode 2027&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I included DEC Private Mode 2027 in the results to accompany Mitchell's table from his article, Grapheme Clusters and Terminal Emulators, and to verify for myself that it has limited utility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In theory, a CLI program can query this mode to classify a terminal as "reasonably supporting" unicode, but not which specific features or version level. Since other terminals with similar capabilities do not respond to Mode 2027 queries, this binary indicator has limited utility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only practical approach to determining Unicode support of a terminal is to interactively test for specific features, codepoints, and at the Unicode version levels of interest, as ucs-detect does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Beyond Fixed Widths&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terminals cannot reproduce many of the world's languages legibly when constrained to monospace cells. The measurements dictated by rapidly expanding Unicode standards and varying implementation levels create inherent tension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The text sizing protocol published early this year represents a significant development. Kovid Goyal describes the motivation in a recent interview:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;And then my next windmill that I'm looking at is variable-sized text in the terminal. So when I'm catting a markdown file, I want to see the headings big.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this feature may enable more advanced typesetting-like capabilities in terminal apps, it also promises to increase accessibility. Allowing text to escape monospace constraints enables legible support of the diverse set of the world's languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, using Contour with ucs-detect --stop-at-error=lang, stopping to take a look at a result of the language KhÃ¼n:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case Contour and Python wcwidth disagree on measurement, but more important is the legibility. We can compare this given KhÃ¼n text to the Kate editor:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are clearly different. I regret I cannot study it more carefully, but I suggest that terminals could more easily display complex scripts by switching to a variable size text mode, allowing the font engine to drive the text without careful processing of cell and cursor movement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although I have yet to experiment with it, I am encouraged to see some resolution to this problem by the progressive changes suggested by the text sizing protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cyberpunk is a genre of science fiction about high tech, urban sprawl, and do-it-yourself counterculture. It’s usually associated with the early days of computer hackers and AI. This is the first in a series of blog posts about how high tech, urban sprawl, and do-it-yourself counterculture were just as much a part of the rapid progress of 17th century natural science as they were of the rapid progress of 20th century computer science; and about what we can learn by drawing this comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"If I were to choose a patron saint for cybernetics... I should have to choose Leibniz"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-Norbert Wiener&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"if we could find characters or signs appropriate for expressing all our thoughts as definitely and as exactly as arithmetic expresses numbers or geometric analysis expresses lines, we could in all subjects in so far as they are amenable to reasoning accomplish what is done in arithmetic and geometry."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-Gottfried Leibniz&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"...especially in all those subjects where use of [such a language] may be free and where interest and authority do not intercept, the regular exercise thereof which I conceive to be the great antagonists which may impede its progress..."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-Robert Hooke&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last quote is from an archival text which I've been trying to transcribe on and off for the past few months. It comes from a scan of a letter which Robert Hooke wrote to Gottfried Leibniz in 1681. I am fascinated by this letter for a couple of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Hooke and Leibniz had exchanged any letters at all. I found the letter by chance, when browsing through the Royal Society's online archives.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The letter is about one of my favourite topics: Leibniz's project to create a universal language of science, which could be mechanically applied to automate any piece of scientific reasoning (apart from the collection of new experimental data).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For these reasons, this letter from Hooke to Leibniz has become one of my favourite pieces of niche archival material. (The other two are this popular science article which Alan Turing wrote to introduce computational undecidability to a general audience, and this speech which Ove Arup gave to his employees to reassure them that the new industrial computer his engineering firm had bought wasn't going to replace them in their jobs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think my transcription is about 90% accurate so far. Hooke's handwriting is quite hard to read. The original section quoted looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But from what I have transcribed, I think this letter is a particularly nice example of the originality and prescience of Hooke's way of thinking about the world. Almost as fascinating as the letter itself, are the events surrounding the time in which it was written. I hope to write more soon about Hooke's life, about his relationship with cryptography, and about the way in which he bridged the gap between technician and scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common thread I find myself drawing across much of Hooke's work - albeit anachronistically - is an early expression of the hacker mindset which flourished among computer scientists in the second half of the 20th century, coincided with the explosion of computing innovations that took place during that period, and came to be romanticised in cyberpunk science fiction. And I think that if I had to pick one piece of Hooke's writing that expresses this attitude most clearly, I would have to pick this letter. To explain why, I'll first talk a bit more about why Hooke was writing to Leibniz in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You likely know Robert Hooke from studying his laws about the motion of springs in high-school physics, for his role in the foundation of the Royal Society, or for his beef with Isaac Newton. You likely know about Gottfried Leibniz from hearing about his philosophy of monads, for his role in the invention of calculus, or for his beef with Isaac Newton.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that, aside from their common interest in antagonising Isaac Newton, Hooke and Leibniz also shared an interest in mechanising scientific reasoning through the invention of a universal language for science. Leibniz called his project the "Characteristica Universalis". The philosopher Norbert Wiener credited this idea as a precursor to his own notion of “cybernetics” – which, incidentally, is the word he coined from which we get the “cyber” in "cyberpunk". One thing I took away from reading Wiener was that you can think of the Characteristica Universalis as a kind of proto computer programming language. Hooke liked Leibniz’ ideas on this topic so much that he sent him the above letter just to say so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What makes Hooke’s letter cyberpunk as opposed to just cybernetic is that it adds to Leibniz’s worldview an explicit (and perhaps naively optimistic) hope that individual freedom might be enabled by the proliferation of this early programming language. In particular he saw the effect of a language for mechanised scientific reasoning as especially useful when used by individuals to express, explore and test ideas freely, without interference from unjust authorities who might seek to censor or interfere with their work. In 1681, Hooke was already imagining the countercultural edge of cybernetic systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This should not be surprising, given Hooke's own politically uneasy upbringing, his tendency to skip lectures at university in order to tinker (in Robert Boyle's lab) with designs for experiments and novel instruments that went on to occupy his scientific career, or his habit of falling out with the interfering authorities of his time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If my reading of this letter is accurate then - just as Wiener calls Leibniz the patron saint of cybernetics, we should call Hooke the patron saint of cyberpunk.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;it's not working&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Written January 19, 2024&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arthur Whitney is an esteemed computer scientist who led the design on a few well-known pieces of software:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The A, K, and Q programming languages&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;kdb, a high-performance database built on K used in fintech&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shakti, which is like kdb but faster, designed for trillion-row datasets.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've never even seen a trillion numbers, much less calculated them, but kdb is apparently a standard tool on Wall Street. They probably care about money, so I'll assume kdb does its job well. His languages take significantly after APL, which was a very popular language for similar applications before the invention of (qwerty) keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I'm not here to talk about boring things like "using software to make incomprehensible amounts of money in finance" or "human beings and their careers", I'm here to talk about how a guy writes C code weird. For a very simple version of the programming language K, there's a publicly available interpreter he wrote in a few days using about 50 lines of C to show the basics of interpreter writing. This is the C (specifically the January 16, 2024 version #2):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is the entire interpreter, and this is apparently how he normally writes code. Opinions on his coding style are divided, though general consensus seems to be that it's incomprehensible. As daunting as it is, I figured I should give it a chance for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As I work on larger and larger codebases, scrolling up and down to track information has become a more common annoyance. Whitney's talked about coding the way he does to avoid exactly that: he wants to keep his logic on one screen. Perhaps learning to read code like this could give me ideas on writing my own code more compactly.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In a Hacker News comments section, somebody asked "would you rather spend 10 days reading 100,000 lines of code, or 4 days reading 1000?", and that raises a good point. The complexity of the code is because even a simple interpreter is pretty complex. Writing it in 500 lines wouldn't make the complexity go away, it just spreads it out. Does writing in this more compact format feel more daunting because you're exposed to more of the complexity at once? I think so. Does showing it all at once actually help you understand the whole thing faster? I don't know.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reading code has become a more important part of my job than writing it, so I should challenge my reading skills, regardless.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It confuses people, and that's basically the same as being smart.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I'm going to go line by line and explain my understanding. I tried to use the notes provided in the repo only when I was stuck, which was a few times early on, but by the end I could understand it pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A reading of a.h&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;typedef char*s,c;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This already shows some funky C. It defines &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, because the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; attaches to the name, not the type. It's an oddity of C syntax that I've never been a fan of. Otherwise this is pretty straight forward: &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is for string, and &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is for character.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;s Q=(s)128;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fuck. Shit. He assigned 128 to a string named &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt;. What does it mean? &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt;. Why is Q a pointer to the address 128? I thought I must have misunderstood, and &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; was actually a character or something, but it's clearly specified as &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is for string!&amp;#13;
I couldn't figure out the meaning, so I soon gave up and looked at the annotated code. The &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;unsigned long long&lt;/code&gt; in other versions, and they explain that the type is used for both integers and pointers. The code operates on vectors of 8-bit integers, either as ASCII or numbers, so it makes some sense to use &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt; from a memory layout perspective, but I don't use pointers as integers very often.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define _(e...) ({e;})&amp;#13;
#define x(a,e...) _(s x=a;e)&amp;#13;
#define $(a,b) if(a)b;else&amp;#13;
#define i(n,e) {int $n=n;int i=0;for(;i&amp;lt;$n;++i){e;}}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are all pretty straight forward, with one subtle caveat I only realized from the annotated code. They're all macros to make common operations more compact: wrapping an expression in a block, defining a variable &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and using it, conditional statements, and running an expression &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The subtle thing the annotations point out is the first macro, &lt;code&gt;({e;})&lt;/code&gt;. The parentheses around curly brackets make this a statement expression, a non-standard C extension that allows you to treat a block of statements as a single expression, if the last statement is an expression that provides a value. In other words, &lt;code&gt;int x = ({int a = func1(); int b = func2(a); a+b;});&lt;/code&gt; sets &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to whatever &lt;code&gt;a+b&lt;/code&gt; is. This is used everywhere in the code after this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define Q(e) if(Q==(e))return Q;&amp;#13;
#define Qs(e,s) if(e)return err(__func__,s);&amp;#13;
#define Qr(e) Qs(e,"rank")&amp;#13;
#define Qd(e) Qs(e,"domain")&amp;#13;
#define Qz(e) Qs(e,"nyi")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are error macros using that mysterious &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; defined earlier. &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; seems to have been used to represent errors, possibly short for "Quit". The &lt;code&gt;Qr/d/z&lt;/code&gt; functions seem to be types of errors. I have no idea what "nyi" means (I figure it out later).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define _s(f,e,x...) s f(x){return _(e);}&amp;#13;
#define _i(f,e) _s(f,e,c x)&amp;#13;
#define f(f,e)  _s(f,e,s x)&amp;#13;
#define F(f,e)  _s(f,e,s a,s x)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These replace function declarations, and we can see that &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; macro being used to add an implicit return.&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;_s&lt;/code&gt; could be used like&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;_s(my_function, puts("I rock!!!"); x*5+e, s x, int e)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;, which would create basically this standard C:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;char *my_function(char *x, int e) {&amp;#13;
	puts("I rock!!!");&amp;#13;
	return x*5+e;&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the macros except the base &lt;code&gt;_s&lt;/code&gt; also add implicit arguments like &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and you bet it's hard to tell them apart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define ax (256&amp;gt;x)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was another one that baffled me until I looked at the annotations. Remember how I said &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; values were either integers or pointers? 256 is the cutoff value for these integers, which the annotations call atoms, so ax means "is &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; an atom?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define ix (c)x&amp;#13;
#define nx x[-1]&amp;#13;
#define xi x[i]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These aren't too confusing. &lt;code&gt;ix&lt;/code&gt; casts &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt; implies &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is some sort of fat pointer, meaning there's probably a length at &lt;code&gt;x[-1]&lt;/code&gt;, but we'll see. &lt;code&gt;xi&lt;/code&gt; just indexes &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as a normal pointer, using our implicitly defined &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;i(...)&lt;/code&gt; macro.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define aa x(a,ax)&amp;#13;
#define ia x(a,ix)&amp;#13;
#define na x(a,nx)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These copy &lt;code&gt;ax&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ix&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt; respectively to work on the &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; variable, which is an implicit argument in functions defined using the &lt;code&gt;F(f,e)&lt;/code&gt; macro. You remembered the &lt;code&gt;x(name, expression)&lt;/code&gt; macro for assigning to a locally-scoped &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define oo w("oo\n")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It prints &lt;code&gt;oo&lt;/code&gt;. It's not used anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;a reading of a.c&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wound up not needing to refer to the annotated code at all to understand this. The C code is mostly using everything in the headers to build the interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define r(n,e) _(s r=m(n);i(n,r[i]=e)r)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We create a vector &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;m(n)&lt;/code&gt; (which is defined later (it's malloc)), fill &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; with the results of &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;, and return it out of the statement expression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(w,write(1,ax?&amp;amp;x:x,ax?1:strlen(x));x)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This defines &lt;code&gt;s w(s x)&lt;/code&gt;, which is our print function. If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is an atom (&lt;code&gt;ax?&lt;/code&gt;), we print it as a single character by getting its address (&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;x&lt;/code&gt;) and providing a length of 1. If it's a vector, we print it as a string using &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt; to calculate how long it is, so now we also know vectors must be null-terminated here.&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt; are standard functions that we call without including the headers, because fuck headers. Let the linker figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;F(err,w(a);w((s)58);w(x);w((s)10);Q)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our fancy shmancy error printing function, &lt;code&gt;s err(s a, s x)&lt;/code&gt;. The confusing thing is that &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; and the newline are represented by their ASCII numbers 58 and 10, respectively. This just prints a message in the format &lt;code&gt;{a}:{x}\n&lt;/code&gt; and returns our special error value &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;_i(wi,s b[5];sprintf(b,"%d ",x);w(b);0)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defines &lt;code&gt;s wi(c x)&lt;/code&gt;, which takes &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, formats it as an integer in up to &lt;code&gt;5*sizeof(char*)/sizeof(char)&lt;/code&gt; characters (40 on 64-bit machines), and writes that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(W,Q(x)$(ax,wi(ix))i(nx,wi(xi))w(10);x)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another print function, &lt;code&gt;s W(s x)&lt;/code&gt; either writes &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as an integer or a list of integers. It also refuses to print the &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; vector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(srt,Qz(1)0) f(uni,Qz(1)0) F(Cut,Qz(1)0) F(Drp,Qz(1)0)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I figured out what &lt;code&gt;nyi&lt;/code&gt; means! It means "Not yet implemented", as we can see from these function definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;_i(m,s a=malloc(1+x);*a++=x;a)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we find our previously-used function &lt;code&gt;s m(c x)&lt;/code&gt;, which allocates our buffer and returns a fat pointer (with the size at &lt;code&gt;x[-1]&lt;/code&gt;, hence the &lt;code&gt;1+x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;a++&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is the length we're allocating here, which means our vectors are limited to 255 bytes. The repo suggests upgrading capacity as an exercise to the reader, which could be fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define A(c) ((s)memchr(a,c,na)?:a+na)-a&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This macro finds the first occurence of the character &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; in our vector &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; as an index into the string (hence the &lt;code&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt;, since &lt;code&gt;memchr&lt;/code&gt; returns a pointer). If the result is null, it just returns the length of the string (&lt;code&gt;a+na - a&lt;/code&gt;). We see another fun bit of non-standard syntax, &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt;, which I had to look up. &lt;code&gt;a ?: b&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;a ? a : b&lt;/code&gt; without evaluating &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; twice. Pretty snazzy!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define g(a,v) ax?255&amp;amp;a:r(nx,v)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strange little operation, I'll have to see it in action. If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is an atom, it clamps &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; to be an atom with a simple mask (&lt;code&gt;255&amp;amp;a&lt;/code&gt;), otherwise it creates a new vector the same size as &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; filled with the result from &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(not,g(!ix,!xi)) f(sub,g(-ix,-xi)) F(At,Qr(aa)g(a[ix],a[xi])) F(_A,Qr(aa)g(A(ix),A(xi)))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah, I see now. &lt;code&gt;g(a, v)&lt;/code&gt; lets us define functions that work on both atoms and vectors. If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is an atom, it returns the atom result clamped within the correct bounds. Otherwise it allocates a new vector and computes the other expression.&amp;#13;
All the above functions work either on &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as an integer (&lt;code&gt;ix&lt;/code&gt;), or on every element of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;xi&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;s not(s x)&lt;/code&gt;does boolean negation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;s sub(s x)&lt;/code&gt;does arithmetic negation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;s At(s a, s x)&lt;/code&gt;indexes into&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, either to get one value or to shuffle them into a new vector.&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;has to be a vector.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;s _A(s a, s x)&lt;/code&gt;searches a vector&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;for the value of&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;and gives us the index, either one value or every value in the vector.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a lot of functionality in such a small bit of code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(ind,Qr(!ax)0&amp;gt;ix?r(-ix,-ix-1-i):r(ix,i))&amp;#13;
F(Ind,Qr(!aa)Qd(1&amp;gt;ia)g(ix%ia,xi%ia))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are some atom-only functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;s ind(s x)&lt;/code&gt;creates a vector of length |x| containing&lt;code&gt;0, 1... x-1&lt;/code&gt;if&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;is positive, otherwise it contains&lt;code&gt;-x-1, -x-2... 0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;s Ind(s a, s x)&lt;/code&gt;does&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;modulo&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, either on&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;as an integer or every value of the vector&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, I can buy that this method of coding produces fewer bugs, once you can actually write it, since you work only on small building blocks of the logic and reuse them. Like, where could a bug for &lt;code&gt;ind&lt;/code&gt; even be? Maybe an off-by-one in &lt;code&gt;-ix-1-i&lt;/code&gt;, but it's hard to miss what's happening once you can see the trees through the forest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define G(f,o) F(f,ax?aa?255&amp;amp;ia o ix:Ltn==f?f(sub(x),sub(a)):f(x,a):r(nx,(aa?ia:a[i])o xi))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's too many trees! I can't understand this many nested ternary operators at the same time because I'm not the alien from Arrival. I process things in linear time. I have to chunk this up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;F(f, ax ?&amp;#13;
		aa ?&amp;#13;
			255 &amp;amp; ia o ix&amp;#13;
			: Ltn==f ? &amp;#13;
				f(sub(x),sub(a))&amp;#13;
				: f(x,a)&amp;#13;
		: r(nx,(aa?ia:a[i])o xi))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, I see. It's 3 cases from 2 conditions: &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is an atom or a vector, and &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is an atom or a vector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;are atoms: apply some operator&lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt;to both values and clamp to 8 bits. I also didn't realize the bitwize and (&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;) had a lower precedence than the operators this macro is used on, meaning it's always&lt;code&gt;`C 255 &amp;amp; (ia o ix)&lt;/code&gt;`.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;is an atom and&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;is a vector: run this function with the arguments swapped. If the function is&lt;code&gt;Ltn&lt;/code&gt;, also negate the arguments, since less-than depends on argument order.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;is a vector: create a new vector, either applying&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;or each value of&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;to&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;using the operator. It assumes vector&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;is at least as long as&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, or it'll index past the end of&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;G(Ltn,&amp;lt;)G(Eql,==)G(Not,!=)G(Sum,+)G(Prd,*)G(And,&amp;amp;)G(Or,|)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using our fancy new macro, we quickly define seven new functions for the vectors, where they're all element-wise applications of binary operators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(cat,Qr(!ax)r(1,ix)) F(Cat,a=aa?cat(a):a;x=ax?cat(x):x;s r=m(na+nx);memcpy(r+na,x,nx);memcpy(r,a,na))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was confused by the first function, but I see now these are &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; as in "concatenate". For an atom, it creates a vector of length 1 containing that atom. &lt;code&gt;Cat&lt;/code&gt; does the more complex work of joining two vectors together, running &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; on each value if it's an atom to get a list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(at,At(x,0)) f(rev,Qr(ax)At(x,ind(255&amp;amp;-nx))) f(cnt,Qr(ax)nx)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some more simple functions. Lil &lt;code&gt;at&lt;/code&gt; gets the first item of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;rev&lt;/code&gt; reverses the list using our &lt;code&gt;ind&lt;/code&gt; function to generate the list of indeces in reverse, which is a little overkill but vectors are 256 bytes at max and memory is never freed so who cares; and &lt;code&gt;cnt&lt;/code&gt; gets the size of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;F(Tak,Qr(!aa||ax)Qd(0&amp;gt;ia||ia&amp;gt;nx)At(x,ind(a))) F(Sub,Sum(a,sub(x))) F(Mtn,Ltn(x,a)) f(qz,Qz(1)0)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some more simple functions. &lt;code&gt;Tak&lt;/code&gt; returns the first &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; characters from the vector &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as a new list; &lt;code&gt;Sub&lt;/code&gt; subtracts; &lt;code&gt;Mtn&lt;/code&gt; is "more than"; and &lt;code&gt;qz&lt;/code&gt; returns our "not yet implemented" error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define v(e) ((strchr(V,e)?:V)-V)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A shorthand to get the first occurence of a character from a string &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt;, returning an offset into the array or zero if it's not present. This seems ambiguous, since that's also the result if we match with the first character, but we'll see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;s U[26],V=" +-*&amp;amp;|&amp;lt;&amp;gt;=~!@?#_^,",&amp;#13;
(*f[])()={0,abs,sub,qz ,qz,rev,qz ,qz, qz ,not,ind,at,uni,cnt,qz ,srt,cat},&amp;#13;
(*F[])()={0,Sum,Sub,Prd,And,Or,Ltn,Mtn,Eql,Not,Ind,At,_A ,Tak,Drp,Cut,Cat};&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah, we have seen. The first character of &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt; is a space, and it looks like the arrays of function pointers match up with the characters of &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt; to give us our functions, with space being null. However, I think &lt;code&gt;abs&lt;/code&gt; is from the standard library here, since it's not defined anywhere else? That seems like a bug. It'd work for atoms, but it'd break vectors.&amp;#13;
This also defines an array of 26 vectors, which I assume will be our variables. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;_i(n, 10u&amp;gt;x-48? x-48 : 26u&amp;gt;x-97? U[x-97] : 0)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;s n(c x)&lt;/code&gt; reads a char and returns one of several things. I'll have to consult an ASCII table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;is between 48 and 57 (inclusive), we subtract 48 and return that. Meaning, if&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;is an ASCII character representing 0-9, we subtract 48 so it's the integer 0-9, rather than the character. It's phrased strangely,&lt;code&gt;10u &amp;gt; x-48&lt;/code&gt;, instead of the more obvious&lt;code&gt;x&amp;gt;47&amp;amp;&amp;amp;58&amp;gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. Maybe it's because it's two characters shorter. Maybe Arthur wanted to show the length of the span of characters (10) more than the start and end, which this does once you understand it. Maybe he just thought the underflow trickery was neat.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;is between 97 and 122 (inclusive), it's a lowercase character of the alphabet in ASCII, in which case the function returns one of our variables from the&lt;code&gt;U&lt;/code&gt;array, mapping 'a' to 'z'.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Otherwise, the function returns 0.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it looks like this function is specifically to read values, either numerals or variables, all of which are one character.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(e,s z=x;c i=*z++;!*z?n(i):v(i)?x(e(z),Q(x)f[v(i)](x)):x(e(z+1),Q(x)58==*z?U[i-97]=x:_(c f=v(*z);Qd(!f)F[f](n(i),x))))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uh, let's spread this out a little.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(e, s z=x; c i=*z++; !*z ? n(i)&amp;#13;
	: v(i) ? x(e(z), Q(x) f[v(i)](x))&amp;#13;
		: x(e(z+1), Q(x) 58==*z ? U[i-97]=x &amp;#13;
			: _(c f=v(*z); Qd(!f) F[f](n(i),x))))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, easy. It's a recursive function that checks each character of vector &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, called &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#13;
If we're at the end of the string, we check if &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is a value and return it.&amp;#13;
Otherwise, we first check if it's an operator (from our &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt; string). If it is, we evaluate the rest of the string, check for errors, and then apply the operation to the result from the rest of the evaluation.&amp;#13;
If it wasn't an operation, we evaluate the rest of the string, skipping one character. If the skipped character is a colon (ASCII 58), we assign the result of the evaluation to one of the slots in &lt;code&gt;U&lt;/code&gt; (if the character &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is not a lowercase ASCII letter, this will corrupt memory, so don't write bugs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm pretty sure spaces are a syntax error in every location, and I don't see code to create array literals. If the skipped character is an operator, we instead apply that binary operator on the evaluation result and &lt;code&gt;n(i)&lt;/code&gt;, which is either a variable or a number.&amp;#13;
This means code is executed from right to left, with no operator precedent, which is standard for APL-type languages from what I understand.&amp;#13;
Because this language has only single-character variable names, numbers, and operators, this is all the tokenizing, parsing, and evaluation we need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;C int main(){c b[99]; while(1) if(w(32),b[read(0,b,99)-1]=0,*b) 58==b[1] ? e(b) : W(e(b));}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And finally, &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#13;
In an infinite loop, we read up to 99 characters from a user, and then write the evaluated result of that text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Et voila. We have a tiny interpreter for a simple array language. It's not exactly production-ready, but it does quite a lot in its tiny footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think I can say I understand this code pretty well, even more than most code I read. I don't know how much of that is because of the coding style, or because I spent eight hours writing several thousand words about fifty lines of code in a borderline-delusional fugue state brought on by drinking one small Starbucks™ Frapuccino® (Mocha® Flavored*) I bought from a gas station at 10 PM on a Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had some fun dreams about macros with one-character names applying operations on scalars and vectors that morning (I went to sleep at 6:40 AM).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a fun exercise. To summarize my thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Good ideas&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Well-considered primitives. I've read and written a lot of macro-ridden C, but this feels like a proper little language designed with composable, useful macros that removed enough repetition to make common operations, like iteration, easy to decipher. In other languages, higher-order functions and similar constructs could be used the same way.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fewer lines. I didn't have to scroll so much when I forgot what a macro or a function did! I have a wide screen monitor, I don't need lines limited to 10-20 characters of actual code most of the time. If people can read English in compact paragraphs, why not code?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Bad ideas&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-semantic types. I was completely baffled by the &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt;being treated as an integer at first, and simply assumed I was misunderstanding the code somehow until I checked the annotated version. In my own code, I use types as one of the core building blocks. What the data is defines how I use it. For a full interpreter, this would be a custom type anyway, since right now it assumes&lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;will never give it a pointer to an address less than 256, which is probably true but not guaranteed, and also the integer 128 is reserved for invalid results, which is probably the bigger limitation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code golf. I can understand the large gains to density like macros, and even the medium gains like short names, but there's a point where the code becomes significantly harder to follow for very minor gains, such as the use of ASCII codes like &lt;code&gt;58&lt;/code&gt;instead of character literals like&lt;code&gt;':'&lt;/code&gt;, or the use of&lt;code&gt;10u&amp;gt;x-48&lt;/code&gt;instead of&lt;code&gt;x&amp;gt;48&amp;amp;&amp;amp;58&amp;gt;x&lt;/code&gt;for checking if&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;is within a range. And while I think more code can be put on a line, I'm not throwing out my space key just yet, epecially between function declarations.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ideas I'm ambivalent about&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-standard syntax. There's some very interesting features in this code that utilize GCC-specific extensions, like &lt;code&gt;a ?: b&lt;/code&gt;ternaries and statement expressions. I don't typically need to compile for everything on earth, so learning the tricks of one reasonably cross-platform compiler isn't a bad idea. At the same time, even using clang, the same compiler Arthur was using, I had to include&lt;code&gt;stdio.h&lt;/code&gt;due to not linking&lt;code&gt;sprintf&lt;/code&gt;otherwise. If I wanted to build using Visual Studio I'd just have to rewrite a bunch of stuff. Also, compiling without&lt;code&gt;-w&lt;/code&gt;generates almost three compiler warnings per line of code. Those are useful sometimes, if they aren't flooded!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Implicit arguments. Many of the density gains in this code come from using the variables &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;in nearly every context, allowing macros to use them by default and skip listing other parameters. I didn't find it to be a problem after a brief adjustment, but it's also a very small codebase. Implicit arguments are a feature in many dynamically typed languages, and in "point-free" or "tacit" programming, but it's fallen out of style due to its difficulty to parse at first glance. Whitney's languages all being based around tacit programming is surely an influence on his tendency to make arguments implicit.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Short names. Beyond the very first introduction, there'd be virtually no benefit to renaming &lt;code&gt;ax&lt;/code&gt;as&lt;code&gt;vector_is_atom(x)&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;_(...)&lt;/code&gt;as 'execute(...)', or most other primitives after they're introduced. Most are small enough that you can parse what it does right away. However, this doesn't lend any signal as to why it does. You have to figure out what it does from context. For code that's meant to be read by another person, there should probably be some explanation as to why a primitive does what it does, even if it has a short name. This is especially true of more complex operations, like the evaluation function&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nested ternary operators. Too confusing for me to follow without parentheses, especially without whitespace.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This coding style feels most appropriate for "done" code, or code that's been worked out on paper or some other environment and is now being written down in a compact way. It's more like finalized mathematical notation than typical code. I don't see myself being able to effectively write code like this, since I tend to quickly jot down ideas, compile and run to validate, and edit what I've done based on the results. Making a small set of good primitives and building heavily on those requires basically having solved the problem before writing a single line. Otherwise you get bad primitives that cause more confusion than help, and adjusting those primitives would involve rewriting all the code that depends on them, which is all the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I think that's my key takeaway: I tend to work out problems in the code, which can lead to messy results. I write the dumbest possible solution, and then have to try and refactor as I develop a better mental model of the problem. What I like most about this code isn't how few characters are used, or everything fitting in one screen. I like how it seems the code was well-understood before it was written. You can't refactor a 500-line jumble of C into code like this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real lesson is that I'm probably too quick to jump into coding things. I could spend more time working out how I want to model a problem in a more free-form way, like writing notation on paper, before jumping into the rigid world of programming syntax. With a clear mental model, I can then write code in terms of how I was thinking about the problem, instead of thinking about the problem in terms of how I wrote the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Next time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think a fun exercise would be to extend this interpreter while maintaining its code style, to see how I fare actually working with it. The repository this came from has various suggested exercises, but my ideas would be adding the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Swapping the bytes for float vectors&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vectors longer than 255 values&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-character numbers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Array literals (you can do it with comma, but that runs &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;on every value, which isn't ideal)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Whitespace insensitivity&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory management&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The unimplemented functions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-character variable names&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-character operators&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Indication for syntax errors&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45800777</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 16:23:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Why we migrated from Python to Node.js</title><link>https://blog.yakkomajuri.com/blog/python-to-node</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="26f311d55ce5b00f"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We just did something crazy: we completely rewrote our backend from Python to Node just one week after our launch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We did this so we can scale. Yes, scale. A week in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some ways, it's a good time right? The codebase is still small and we don't have too many users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, it goes completely against the advice given to early-stage startups which is to just ship and sell, and worry about scale once you've hit product-market-fit. "Do things that don't scale", as PG put it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You see, we didn't have a magical launch week that flooded us with users and force us to scale. And generally you can expect that any stack you pick should be able to scale reasonably well for a long time until you actually get to the point where you should consider changing frameworks or rewriting your backend in a different language (read: Rust).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So why do it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Python async sucks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm a big fan of Django. I was introduced to it at PostHog and it's become my go-to backend for most projects since. It gets you off the ground really fast, has great tooling and abstractions, and is still flexible enough to tweak to your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So naturally, when I started writing our backend at Skald, I started us off with Django too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, we make a lot of calls to LLM and embedding APIs at Skald, so we're generally doing a lot of network I/O that we'd like to be async. Not only that, we often want to fire a lot of requests concurrently, such as when need to generate vector embeddings for the various chunks of a document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And things quickly got really messy in Django.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll preface this by saying that neither of us has a lot of experience writing Python async code (I've mostly worked on async-heavy services in Node) but I think this is partly the point here: it's really hard and unintuitive to write solid and performant Python async code. You need to go deep into the foundations of everything in order to be able to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm actually really interested in spending proper time in becoming more knowledgeable with Python async, but in our context you a) lose precious time that you need to use to ship as an early-stage startup and b) can shoot yourself in the foot very easily in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I thought I was to blame. "Bad programmer! Bad programmer!" was what I was hearing in my head as I tried to grasp everything. But while more knowledgeable folks would certainly have a better time, we discovered that the foundations of Python async are actually a bit shaky too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike JavaScript, which had the event loop from the beginning, and Go, that created the concept of goroutines (both concurrency models that I quite like and have used in production), Python async support was patched on later, and that's where the difficulty lies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two blog posts that cover this really well are "Python has had async for 10 years -- why isn't it more popular?" and "Python concurrency: gevent had it right", both conveniently published not long before I started digging into all this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for us, we learned a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Python doesn't have native async file I/O.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Django still doesn't have full async support. Async in the ORM is not done yet and the colored functions problem really shines here. You can technically use Django with async, but their docs on this have so many caveats that it should scare anyone.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You gotta write &lt;code&gt;sync_to_async&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;async_to_sync&lt;/code&gt;everywhere.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All sorts of models have emerged to bring better async support to different parts of the Python ecosystem, but as they're not native they have their own caveats. For instance, aiofiles brings async API-compatible file operations but uses a thread pool under the hood, and Gevent with its greenlets is pretty cool but it literally patches the stdlib in order to work.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Due to a lot of async support in Python relying on layers that sit on top of the language rather than being native, you need to be careful about the async code you write as it will have different implications depending on e.g. the Gunicorn worker type you run (good luck learning much about those from the Gunicorn docs, btw).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, just getting an equivalent of &lt;code&gt;Promise.all&lt;/code&gt; to work, while understanding all of its gotchas was not simple at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Faced with this, I went into the PostHog codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I worked at PostHog for three years and we had no async in the Django codebase back then but they're a massive company and they have AI features now so they must have figured this out!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And what I realized was that they're still running WSGI (not ASGI) with Gunicorn Gthread workers (where the max concurrent requests you're able to handle is usually max 4x CPU cores), thus not getting much benefit from running things async. The codebase also has a lot of utils to make async work properly, like their own implementation of &lt;code&gt;async_to_sync&lt;/code&gt;. So I guess way they're handling a lot of load is probably just horizontal scaling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's simply no great way to run async in Django.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ok, now what?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We essentially concluded that Django was going to hurt us really soon, not just when we started to have a lot of load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without too many users we'd already need to start running multiple machines in order to not have terrible latency, plus we'd be writing clunky code that would be hard to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could of course just "do things that don't scale" for now and just solve the problem with money (or AWS credits), but it didn't feel right. And being so early would make the migration to another framework much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, some people are probably screaming at their screens going: "just use FastAPI!" -- and we did indeed consider it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FastAPI does have proper async support and is quite a loved framework said to be performant. And if you want an ORM with it you could use SQLAlchemy which also supports async.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Migrating to FastAPI would have probably saved us a day or two (our migration took 3 days) due to being able to reuse a lot of code without translating it, but at this point we weren't feeling great about the Python async ecosystem overall, and we had actually already written our background worker service in Node, so we thought it would be a good opportunity to go all-in on one ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so migrate to Node we did. We took a little time picking the framework + ORM combo but settled on Express + MikroORM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah sure Express is old but it's battle-tested and feels familiar. Coming over to the JS event loop was the main point of all this anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What we gained, what we lost&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Gained: Efficiency&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our initial benchmarks show we've gained ~3x throughput out of the box and that's just with us running what is mostly sequential code in an async context. Being over on Node now, we're planning on doing a lot concurrent processing when chunking, embedding, reranking, and so on. This means this change should have an even greater payoff over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Lost: Django&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Losing Django hurts, and we've already found ourselves building a lot more middleware and utilities ourselves on the Express side. Adonis exists, which is a more fully-featured Node framework, but moving to a whole new ecosystem felt like more work to us than just using something minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I'm missing the most is the ORM, which in my opinion is really ergonomic. And while you always have to be careful with ORMs when looking to extract the best possible performance, the Django ORM does do some nice things under the hood in order to make it performant enough to write queries in Python, and I learned a bit more about this when migrating our Django models over to MikroORM entities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Gained: MikroORM&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MikroORM was a consolation prize in this whole migration. I still much prefer the Django ORM but at the same time different ecosystems call for different tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd never used it before and was positively surprised to find Django-like lazy loading, a migrations setup that felt much better than Prisma's, as well as a reasonably ergonomic API (once you manually set up the foundations right).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, we're early into this change, but currently happy to have picked MikroORM over the incumbent Prisma.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Lost: The Python ecosystem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think this is pretty self-explanatory. While most tools for building RAGs and agents have Python and TypeScript SDKs, Python still takes priority, and we're just talking about API wrappers here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you want to actually get into ML stuff yourself, there's just no competition. I suspect that as we get more sophisticated we'll end up having a Python service, but for now we're ok.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Gained: Unified codebase&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We'd always realized that migrating to Node would mean we'd have two Node services instead of a Python one and a Node one, but it didn't occur to us until a day in that we could actually merge the codebases and that that would be extremely helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a lot of duplicate logic across the Node worker and the Django server, and now we've unified the Express server and background worker into one codebase, which feels so much better. They can both use the ORM now (previously the worker was running raw SQL) and share a bunch of utils.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Gained: Much better testing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a &lt;code&gt;pytest&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;jest&lt;/code&gt; thing, it's just that in order to make sure everything was working as expected after migrating, we just wrote a ton more tests. This and some refactoring were welcome side benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How we did it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it's about time to wrap this post up, but here are some quick notes about the actual migration process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It took us three days.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We barely used AI code generation at all until the final bits -- it felt important to us to understand the foundations of our new setup really well, particularly the inner workings of the new ORM. Once we had the foundations of everything down Claude Code was quite helpful in generating code for some less important endpoints, and also helped us in scanning the codebase for issues.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We almost quit multiple times. We were getting customer requests for new features and had some bugs in the Django code and it felt like we were wasting time migrating instead of serving customers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Would we do it again?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, we're quite happy with our decision and would 100% do it again. Not only will this pay off in the long term but it's already paying off today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We learned a lot of stuff in the process too, and if the whole point of this whole post is that someone comes to tell me that we're dumb and we should just have done X or Y, or comes to teach me about how Python async works, then that will honestly be great. For my part, I gladly recognize my inexperience with Python async and if I can learn more about it, that's a win.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And if you're interested in actually seeing the code, check out the following PRs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skald is an MIT-licensed RAG API platform, so if you have any thoughts or concerns, you can come yell at us on GitHub, or open a PR to rewrite the backend to your framework of choice :D&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve just open-sourced Agent-o-rama, a library for building scalable and stateful LLM agents on the JVM. Agent-o-rama provides two first-class APIs, one for Java and one for Clojure, with feature parity between them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI tooling today is overwhelmingly centered on Python, and while the JVM ecosystem has seen growing support through libraries like LangChain4j, it lacks the kind of integrated tooling that lets developers evaluate, observe, and deploy LLM-based systems rigorously and at scale. Available tools are fragmented or complex to set up, and nothing handles the entire workflow from development to production with proper observability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agent-o-rama fills that gap. It brings the same ideas popularized by LangGraph and LangSmith – structured agent graphs, tracing, datasets, experiments, evaluation – but makes them native to Java and Clojure. LLMs are powerful but inherently unpredictable, so building applications with LLMs that are helpful and performant with minimal hallucination requires being rigorous about testing and monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents are defined as simple graphs of Java or Clojure functions that execute in parallel. Agent-o-rama automatically captures detailed traces and includes a web UI for offline experimentation, online evaluation, and time-series telemetry (e.g. model latency, token usage, database latency). It also supports streaming, with a simple client API to stream model calls or other outputs from nodes in real time. Agent-o-rama extends the ideas from LangGraph and LangSmith with far greater scalability, full parallel execution, and built-in high-performance data storage and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agent-o-rama is deployed onto your own infrastructure on a Rama cluster. Rama is free to use for clusters up to two nodes and can scale to thousands with a commercial license. Every part of Agent-o-rama is built-in and requires no other dependency besides Rama. Agent-o-rama also integrates seamlessly with any other tool, such as databases, vector stores, external APIs, or anything else. Unlike hosted observability tools, all data and traces stay within your infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Example agent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at an example agent! This is a research agent from the examples/ directory in the project. In that directory you’ll find equivalent Java and Clojure versions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll need Java 21 installed and API keys for OpenAI and Tavily (Tavily’s free tier is sufficient). Put the API keys in environment variables like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;export TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_key_here&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To run the agent, clone Agent-o-rama and follow these instructions (for Java or Clojure, whichever you prefer):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;8&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;9&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;# Java instructions&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;cd examples/java&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;./run-example com.rpl.agent.research.ResearchAgentExample&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;# Clojure instructions&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;cd examples/clj&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;lein repl&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;(require '[com.rpl.agent.research-agent :as research-agent] :reload)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;(research-agent/run-agent)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This runs Rama’s “in-process cluster” (IPC) and launches the research agent on it. You’ll get a prompt at the terminal to enter a research topic. The agent will generate a set of analyst personas to analyze the topic, and you’ll be prompted again whether you want to give feedback on the generated analysts. Once you tell the agent you have no more feedback, it will spend a few minutes generating the report, including using information it finds through web searches and through Wikipedia, and then the final report will be printed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the report is being generated or when it’s finished, you can open the Agent-o-rama UI at &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:1974&lt;/code&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s an example back and forth:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you click on the research agent in the UI, you’ll see this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The invoke there is what we just ran. Clicking on it brings up the trace for the invoke:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the right is aggregated statistics of everything that happened during the agent’s execution. You can see how many tokens it used, and if it did any database reads/writes you’d see stats about those too. If the agent invokes other agents, you can see a breakdown of stats by agent as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clicking on the “write-report” node brings up a detailed trace of what happened when that node executed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This node did one LLM call, and you can see the arguments to that LLM, what was returned, and stats on the call in the “Operations” section. The code for this node is just this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;8&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;9&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;.node("write-report", "finish-report", (AgentNode agentNode, String sections, String topic) -&amp;gt; {&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;ChatModel openai = agentNode.getAgentObject("openai");&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;String instructions = String.format(REPORT_WRITER_INSTRUCTIONS, topic, sections);&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;List&amp;lt;ChatMessage&amp;gt; chatMessages = Arrays.asList(&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;new SystemMessage(instructions),&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;new UserMessage("Write a report based upon these memos."));&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;String report = openai.chat(chatMessages).aiMessage().text();&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;agentNode.emit("finish-report", "report", report);&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;})&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;8&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;9&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;10&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;11&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;12&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;(aor/node&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;"write-report"&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;"finish-report"&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;(fn [agent-node sections topic]&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;(let [openai (aor/get-agent-object agent-node "openai")&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;instr (report-writer-instructions topic sections)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;text (chat-and-get-text&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;openai&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;[(SystemMessage. instr)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;(UserMessage. "Write a report based upon these memos.")])]&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;(aor/emit! agent-node "finish-report" "report" text)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;)))&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This code says that the node’s name is “write-report”, the node emits to the node “finish-report”, and the node’s implementation is the given function. The &lt;code&gt;agentNode&lt;/code&gt;

/

&lt;code&gt;agent-node&lt;/code&gt;

argument is how you interact with the graph to return a result, emit to other nodes, or get agent objects like models, database connections, or anything else. When you emit to other nodes, you simply say what node you want to emit to and what arguments to pass to that node. Agent nodes run on virtual threads, so they can be efficiently written in a blocking style like this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s most of what’s involved in programming agents with Agent-o-rama! There’s a bit more to learn with aggregation and how to declare agent objects, and this is all documented on the programming agents guide. The rest of using Agent-o-rama is creating and managing datasets, running experiments, setting up online evaluation and other actions on production runs, and analyzing agent telemetry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, you can see from this code and the trace that model calls are automatically traced – this node didn’t have to record any tracing info explicitly. Though you can include your own info in traces with a simple API (see this Javadoc and this Clojuredoc).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at running this on a real cluster! Let’s quickly set up a cluster locally by following these instructions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download the latest Rama release from here.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unpack the release somewhere.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Run: &lt;code&gt;./rama devZookeeper &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Run: &lt;code&gt;./rama conductor &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Run: &lt;code&gt;./rama supervisor &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Visit: &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8888&lt;/code&gt;. When the page loads, the cluster is ready.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download the latest Agent-o-rama release from here.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unpack it somewhere.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Run: &lt;code&gt;./aor --rama /path/to/rama-root &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, to deploy you need to build a jar first. Here’s how to build either the Java or Clojure version from the Agent-o-rama project:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;# For Java version &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;cd examples/java&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;# For Clojure version&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;cd examples/clj&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;lein uberjar&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Java version will build &lt;code&gt;target/java-examples-with-dependencies.jar&lt;/code&gt;

, and the Clojure version will build

&lt;code&gt;target/agent-o-rama-examples-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar&lt;/code&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, to deploy the module just run this command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;8&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;9&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;10&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;11&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;12&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;13&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;14&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;15&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;16&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;17&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;# Deploy the module (Java uberjar)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;./rama deploy \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--action launch \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--jar /path/to/java-examples-with-dependencies.jar \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--module com.rpl.agent.research.ResearchAgentModule \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--tasks 4 \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--threads 2 \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--workers 1&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;# Deploy the module (Clojure uberjar)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;./rama deploy \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--action launch \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--jar /path/to/agent-o-rama-examples-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--module com.rpl.agent.research-agent/ResearchAgentModule \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--tasks 4 \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--threads 2 \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--workers 1&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now it’s up and running! You can view the agent in the UI at &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:1974&lt;/code&gt;

and play with it. From the agent screen you can invoke the agent with the arguments

&lt;code&gt;["", {"topic": "your topic here"}]&lt;/code&gt;

. On the trace, you’ll be able to see any human input prompts the agent makes and respond to them there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rama handles all of storage, deployment, and scaling. There are no other dependencies needed to run this. Setting up a production cluster is only slightly more work, and there are one-click deploys for AWS and for Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agent-o-rama lets developers gain the benefits of Rama without needing to learn it. Rama’s distributed programming model is powerful but has a learning curve: it introduces a rich dataflow API and uses compound data structures for indexing instead of fixed data models. Agent-o-rama abstracts away those concepts into a familiar API so developers can take advantage of Rama’s strengths for the specific domain of building LLM agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those who want to learn how to program Rama directly, Agent-o-rama also serves as a great example of Rama in practice. The backend is about 15K lines of code and the front-end about 11K, yet together they form a complete, end-to-end distributed system with a diverse feature set. Along with our Twitter-scale Mastodon implementation, it shows the breadth of what can be built with Rama.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’d love to hear what you build with Agent-o-rama. Join the rama-user mailing list or the #rama channel on the Clojurians Slack to ask questions, share feedback, or discuss ideas with others using Agent-o-rama.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’d like to talk directly with us about Agent-o-rama, whether to exchange ideas, get technical guidance, or explore working together on building an LLM agent, you can book a call with us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FreakWAN is an effort to create a LoRa-based open WAN network, completely independent from Internet and the cellular phones networks. The network built with FreakWAN has two main goals:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To provide both a plaintext and an encrypted distributed chat system, that can be used by technology amateurs, or in places where internet is not available and during disasters.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As a side effect of the first goal, to create a robust protocol over LoRa to support other applications, like sensors data collection, home automation applications, not having the usual range limitations of OOK/FSK communcation, and so forth.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our goal is to cover parts of the Sicily with such a network. The code will be freely available to anyone wanting to build their own LoRa WANs on top of this software. The main features of our implementation and protocol are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A distributed network based on LoRa and broadcast routing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Basic chat features, ability to send medias (like small images).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Different group chat or data channels (including one-to-one chats) using encryption to separate them.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configurable number of retransmissions with random delays.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;First-hop acknowledges of messages sent.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Symmetric encryption with AES in CBC mode, with support for integrity detection and multiple concurrent keys: each group of clients knowing a given key is part of a virtual group. The network is collaborative for encrypted messages: even nodes that are not able to decrypt a given message can broadcast it, since the encrypted part is not vital to perform relaying of messages.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sensing of nearby nodes, via &lt;code&gt;HELLO&lt;/code&gt;messages (advertising).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bandwidth usage mitigation features.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Duty cycle tracking.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Local storage of messages in the device flash, with automatic deletion of old messages.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simple home-made driver for the SX1276 and SX1262 LoRa chip. In general, no external dependencies. Runs with vanilla MicroPython installs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OLED terminal alike output. OLED burning pixels protection.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CLI interface via USB serial and Bluetooth LE.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IRC interface: the device can work as a bot over the IRC protocol.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simple to understand, hackable code base.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This code is currently a functional work in progress, designed to work with the following ESP32-based devices:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LILYGO TTGO T3 v2 1.6 LoRa module.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LILYGO TTGO T3-S3 v1.2 LoRa module (2.4 Ghz version not tested/supported).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LILYGO TTGO T Beam LoRa module.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;LILYGO T-WATCH S3.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However changing the pins in the configuration, to adapt it to other ESP32 modules that have an SX1276, SX1262 LoRa chips, and an SSD1306 or ST7789 display (or no dislay, in headless mode), should be very little work. T-ECHO devices are also supported, even if with less features, in the C port of FreanWAN, under the &lt;code&gt;techo-port&lt;/code&gt; directory, but the T-ECHO port is still alpha quality software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FreakWAN is implemented in MicroPython, making use only of default libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install MicroPython on your device. Follow this instructions to get the right MicroPython version:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MicroPython versions &amp;gt; 1.19.1 and &amp;lt; 1.22.2 have buggy bluetooth stack, so make sure to use 1.22.2 (or greater) or if you want to stick with something old, use 1.19.1.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don't bother installing a MicroPython specific for the LILYGO devices. Just grab the standard ESP32 image (but not for the T3-S3, read more).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The T3-S3 (and probably the T-BEAM S3, which we don't support at the moment, because we don't have the device) have a 4MB flash which is not compatible with the default MicroPython image for 8MB flash. You can find a working image directly inside this repository under the &lt;code&gt;device&lt;/code&gt;directory.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To flash your device, follow the MicroPython instructions in the download page of your device. For the T3-S3, don't forget to press the boot button while powering it up, otherwise you will not be able to flash it. Then, with &lt;code&gt;esptool.py&lt;/code&gt;, perform the&lt;code&gt;erase_flash&lt;/code&gt;command followed by the&lt;code&gt;write_flash&lt;/code&gt;with the parameters specified in the MicroPython download page.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clone this repository, and edit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;wan_config.py&lt;/code&gt;to set your nickname and status message, set the frequency according to your device. Warning: make sure to set the right frequency based on the LoRa module you own, and make sure your antenna is already installed before using the software, or you may damage your hardware, (but I would like to report that we started the device with the wrong freuqnecy several times and nothing happened: still, proceed at your own risk).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copy one of the files inside the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;devices&lt;/code&gt;folder in the main folder as&lt;code&gt;device_config.py&lt;/code&gt;, for instance if I have a T3 v2 1.6 device, I will do:&lt;p&gt;cp devices/device_config.t3_v2_1.6.py ./device_config.py&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transfer all the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.py&lt;/code&gt;files in the root directory of this project in your device. To transfer the files, you can use mpremote (&lt;code&gt;pip3 install mpremote&lt;/code&gt;should be enough), or an alternative (and slower, but sometimes more compatible) tool that we wrote, called talk32. Talk32 is not as fast as mpremote at transferring files, but sometimes mpremote does not work with certain devices and talk32 does (and the other way around).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(NOTE: you need the &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; below, is not an error)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mpremote cp *.py :
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;talk32 /dev/tty.usbserial001 put *.py
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please note that you don't need both the command lines. Just one depending on the tool you use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Restart your device: you can either power it off/on, or use &lt;code&gt;mpremote repl&lt;/code&gt;and hit&lt;code&gt;Ctrl_D&lt;/code&gt;to trigger a soft reset. Sometimes devices also have a reset button. If everything is fine you will see the splash screen and then the program version.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you are using a T-WATCH S3, or other recent Lyligo devices based on ESP32-S3, and your splash screen freezes (the waves should move and then the splash screen should disappear, if everything works well), please try to disable BLE from &lt;code&gt;wan_config.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two simplest ways to send commands to the device, write messages that will be broadcasted and also receive messages sent by other users, it is to use the USB or Bluetooth serial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To obtain a serial command line interface, make sure the device is connected via an USB cable with your computer. Than connect to the device serial with &lt;code&gt;talk32&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;minicom&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;screen&lt;/code&gt; or whatever serial terminal you want to use.
Normally the bound rate is 115200. Example of command lines and tools you could use:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mpremote repl
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;talk32 /dev/tty.usbserial001 repl
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;screen /dev/tty.usbserial001 115200
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course the name of the device is just an example. Try &lt;code&gt;ls /dev/tty*&lt;/code&gt; to see the list of possible device names in your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you connect, you will see the device logs, but you will also be able to send bang commands or messages to the chat (see below).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is possible to use the device via Bluetooth LE, using one of the following applications:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Android: install one of the many BLE UART apps available. We recommend the Serial Bluetooth Terminal app. It works great out of the box, but for the best experience open the settings, go to the Send tab, and select clear input on send. An alternative is nRF Toolbox, select the UART utility service, connect to the device and send a text message or just &lt;code&gt;!help&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;iPhone: BLE Terminal HM-10 works well and is free. There are other more costly options.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux Desktop: install Freakble following the project README.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For MacOS, there is a BLE UART app directly inside this software distribution under the &lt;code&gt;osx-bte-cli&lt;/code&gt;directory. Please read the README file that is there.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using one of the above, you can talk with the device, and chat with other users around, sending CLI commands. If you just type some text, it will be sent as message in the network. Messages received from the network are also shown in the serial console. If you send a valid command starting with the &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; character, it will be executed as a command, in order to show information, change the device configuration and so forth. For now you can use:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;!automsg&lt;/code&gt;[on/off] to disable enable automatic messages used for testing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;!bat&lt;/code&gt;to show the battery level.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;!preset &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;to set a LoRa preset. Each preset is a specific spreading, bandwidth and coding rate setup. To see all the available presets write&lt;code&gt;!preset help&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;!sp&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;!bw&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;!cr&lt;/code&gt;to change the spreading, bandwidth and coding rate independently, if you wish.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;!pw&lt;/code&gt;changes the TX power. Valid values are from 2 to 20 (dbms). Default is 17dbms.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;!ls&lt;/code&gt;shows nodes around. This is the list of nodes that your node is able to sense, via HELLO messages.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;!font big|small&lt;/code&gt;will change between an 8x8 and a 5x7 (4x6 usable area) font.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;!image &amp;lt;image-file-name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;send an FCI image (see later about images).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;!last [&amp;lt;count&amp;gt;]&lt;/code&gt;show the last messages received, taking them from the local storage of the device.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;!config [save|reset]&lt;/code&gt;to save (or reset) certain configuration parameters (LoRa radio parameters, automsg, irc, wifi, ...) that will be reloaded at startup.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;!irc &amp;lt;stop|start&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;starts or stops the IRC interface.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;!telegram &amp;lt;start|stop|token&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;starts, stops and sets the token of the Telegram bot.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;!wifi help&lt;/code&gt;, to see all the WiFi configuration subcommands. Using this command you can add and remove WiFi networks, connect or disconnect the WiFi (required for the IRC and Telegram interface), and so forth.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;!quiet &amp;lt;yes|no&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, to enable quiet mode (default is off). In this mode, the device sends only the smallest amount of data needed, that is the data messages that we want to send. No ACKs are sent in reply to data messages, nor HELLO messages to advertise our presence in the network. Packets are not relayed in this mode, nor data is transmitted multiple times. Basically this mode is designed to save channel bandwidth, at the expense of advanced FreakWAN features, when there are many active devices and we want to make sure the LoRa channel is not continuously busy.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;!b0&lt;/code&gt;, this is the same as pressing the button 0 on the devices (if they have one). Will switch the device screen to the next view.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New bang commands are added constantly, so try &lt;code&gt;!help&lt;/code&gt; to see what is available. We'll try to take this README in sync, especially after the first months of intense development will be finished.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When FreakWAN is located in some fixed location with WiFi access, it is possible to put it online as a Telegram bot. This way it is possible to receive the messages the device receives via LoRa as Telegram messages, and at the same time it is possible to send commands and messages writing to the bot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use this feature, follow the instructions below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Create your bot using the Telegram @BotFather.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;After obtaining your bot token (it's basically the bot API key) use the following commands in the FreakWAN cli (either via USB or BLE) or alternatively edit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;wan_config.py&lt;/code&gt;to set the same parameters.&lt;p&gt;!wifi add networkname password !wifi start networkname !telegram token !telegram start&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now use your Telegram application in order to sent &lt;code&gt;!help&lt;/code&gt; to the bot, and wait for the reply. If you can receive the reply correclty, Freakwan will also set the target of your messages, that is, the account you used to talk with the bot the first time. Now you are ready to save your configuration with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;!config save
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FreakWAN is able to join IRC, as a bot. It can receive messages and commands via IRC, and also show messages received via LoRa into an IRC channel. Edit &lt;code&gt;wan_config.py&lt;/code&gt; and enable IRC by setting the enabled flag to True, and configuring a WiFi network. Upload the modified file inside the device and restart it. Another way to enable IRC is to use bang commands via Bluetooth, like that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;!wifi add networkname password
!wifi start networkname
!irc start
!config save (only if you want to persist this configuration)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The device, by default, will enter the &lt;code&gt;##Freakwan-&amp;lt;nickname&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; channel of &lt;code&gt;irc.libera.chat&lt;/code&gt; (please, note the two &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; in the channel name), and will listen for commands there. The same commands you can send via Bluetooth are also available via IRC. Because of limitations with the ESP32 memory and the additional MicroPython memory usage, SSL is not available, so FreakWAN will connect to IRC via the TCP port 6667, which is not encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default LoRa messages are sent in clear text and will reach every device that is part of the network, assuming it is configured with the same LoRa frequency, spreading, bandwidth and coding rate. However, it is possible to send encrypted messages that will reach only other users with a matching symmetric key. For instance, if Alice and Bob want to communicate in a private way, they will set the same key, let's say &lt;code&gt;abcd123&lt;/code&gt;, in their devices. Bob will do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;!addkey alice abcd123
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Alice will do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;!addkey bob abcd123
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Note: they need to use much longer and hard to guess key! A good way to generate a key is to to combine a number of words and numbers together, or just generate a random 256 bit hex string with any available tool).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, Alice will be able to send messages to Bob, or the other way around, just typing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#bob some message
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bob will see, in the OLED display of the device, and in the Android application, if connected via BTE, something like that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#alice Alice&amp;gt; ... message ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encrypted messages that are correctly received and decoded are shown as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#&amp;lt;keyname&amp;gt; Nick&amp;gt; message
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each device can have multiple keys. The device will try to decrypt each encrypted message with all the keys stored inside the key chain (the device flash memory, under the &lt;code&gt;keys&lt;/code&gt; directory -- warning! keys are not encrypted on the device storage).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If many users will set the same key with the same name, they are effectively creating something like an IRC channel over LoRa, a chat where all such individuals can talk together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the set of commands to work with encrypted messages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#&amp;lt;keyname&amp;gt; some message     -- send message with the given key.
!addkey keyname actual-key-as-a-string  -- add the specified key.
!delkey keyname             -- remove the specified key.
!keys                       -- list available keys.
!usekey keyname             -- set the specified key as default to send all the next messages, without the need to resort to the #key syntax.
!nokey                      -- undo !usekey, return back to plaintext.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FreakWAN implements its own very small, losslessy compressed 1 bit images, as a proof of concept that we can send small media types over LoRa. Images are very useful in order to make the protocol more robust when working with very long packets (that have a very large time on air). Inside the &lt;code&gt;fci&lt;/code&gt; directory of this repository you will find the specification of the image format and run length compression used, and a tool to convert small PNG files (255x255 max) into FCI images. For now, only images that are up to 200 bytes compressed can be transmitted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have the FCI images, you should copy them into the &lt;code&gt;images&lt;/code&gt; directory inside your device (again, using ampy or talk32 or any other tool). Then you can send the images using the &lt;code&gt;!image&lt;/code&gt; command using the bluetooth CLI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find a couple test FCI images under &lt;code&gt;fci/testfci&lt;/code&gt;. They are all less than 200 bytes, so it is possible to send them as FreakWAN messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now, for the LILYGO TTGO T3 device, we support reading the battery level and shutting down the device when the battery is too low, since the battery could be damaged if it is discharged over a certain limit. To prevent such issues, when voltage is too low, the device will go in deep sleep mode, and will flash the led 3 times every 5 seconds. Then, once connected again to the charger, when the battery charges a bit, it will restart again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the T Beam, work is in progress to provide the same feature. For now it is better to disable the power management at all, by setting &lt;code&gt;config['sleep_battery_perc']&lt;/code&gt; to 0 in the &lt;code&gt;wan_config.py&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you plan to power your device with a battery that is not 3.7v, probably it's better to disable this feature from the configuration, or the device may shut down because it is sensing a too low voltage, assuming the battery is low.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rest of this document is useful for anybody wanting to understand the internals of FreakWAN. The kind of messages it sends, how messages are relayed in order to reach far nodes, the retransmission and acknowledge logic, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goals of the design is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Allow far nodes to communicate using intermediate nodes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;To employ techniques to mitigate missed messages due to the fact LoRa is inherently half-duplex, so can't hear messages when transmitting.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Do 1 and 2 considering the available data rate, which is very low.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The low level (layer 2) format is the one with the explicit header selected, so it is up to the chip to add a length, a CRC and so forth. This layer is not covered here, as from the SX1276 / SX1262 driver we directly get the clean bytes received. So this covers layer 3, that is the messages format implemented by FreakWAN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first byte is the message type byte. The following message types are defined:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MessageTypeData = 0&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MessageTypeAck = 1&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MessageTypeHello = 2&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MessageTypeBulkStart = 3&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MessageTypeBulkData = 4&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MessageTypeBulkEND = 5&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MessageTypeBulkReply = 6&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second byte of messages of all the message types is the flag byte. Bits have the following meaning:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bit 0: &lt;code&gt;Relayed&lt;/code&gt;. Set if the message was repeated by some node that is not the originator of the message. Relayed messages are not acknowledged.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bit 1: &lt;code&gt;PleaseRelay&lt;/code&gt;. If this flag is set, other receivers of the message will try to repeat the message, so that it can travel further in the WAN.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bit 2: &lt;code&gt;Fragment&lt;/code&gt;. This flag means that this message is a fragment of many, that should be reassembled in order to retrieve the full Data message.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bit 3: &lt;code&gt;Media&lt;/code&gt;. For message of type 'Data' this flag means that the message is not text, but some kind of media. See the Data messages section for more information.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bit 4: &lt;code&gt;Encr&lt;/code&gt;. For messages of type 'Data' this flag means that the message is encrypted.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bit 5-7: Reserved for future uses. Should be 0.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently not all the message types are implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Format:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;+--------+---------+---------------+-------+-----------+------------------//
| type:8 | flags:8 | message ID:32 | TTL:8 | sender:48 | Message string:...
+--------+---------+---------------+-------+-----------+------------------//
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that there is no message length, as it is implicitly encoded in the previous layer. The message string is in the following format:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;+--------+---------------------//
| nlen:8 | nick+message text
+--------+---------------------//
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;nlen&lt;/code&gt; is a byte representing the nick name length inside the
message, as an unsigned 8 bit integer, and the rest is just the nickname
of the specified length concatenated with the actual message text, without
any separator, like in the following example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"\x04AnnaHey how are you?"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The TTL is set to 255 normally, and decreased at every retransmission. The sender ID is the HMAC returned by the device API, while the 32 bit message ID is generated randomly, and is used in order to mark a message as already processed, in order to discard duplicates (and there are many since the protocol uses broadcasted retransmissions in order to build the WAN).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that on retransmissions of the same message by other nodes, with the scope of reaaching the whole network, the message sender remains set to the same sender of the original message, that is, the device that created the message the first time. So there is no way to tell who sent a given retransmission of a given message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data messages may contain media in case this flag is set in the header of the message:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bit 3: &lt;code&gt;Media&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When this happens, the data inside the message is not some text in the form &lt;code&gt;nick&lt;/code&gt;+&lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt;. Instead the first byte of the message is the media type ID, from 0 to 255. Right now only two media types are defined:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Media type 0: FreakWAN Compressed Image (FCI). Small 1 bit color image.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Media type 1: Sensor reading.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;+--------+------//------+-----------+-------------+----//
| type:8 | other fields | sender:48 | mediatype:8 | ... media data ...
+--------+------//------+-----------+-------------+----//
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devices receiving this message should try to show the bitmap on the screen, if possible, or if the image is too big or they lack any graphical display ability, some text should be produced to make the user aware that the message contains an image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ACK message is used to acknowledge the sender that some nearby device actually received the message sent. ACKs are sent only when receiving messages of type: DATA, and only if the &lt;code&gt;Relayed&lt;/code&gt; flag is not set.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal of ACK messages are two:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;They inform the sender of the fact at least some near nodes (immediately connected hops) received the message. The sender can't know, just by ACKs, the total reach of the message, but it will know if the number of receivers is non-zero.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each sender takes a list of directly connected nodes, via the HELLO messages (see later in this document). When a sender transmits some data, it will resend it multiple times, in order to make delivery more likely. To save channel time, when a sender receives an ACK from all the known neighbor nodes, it must suppress further retransmissions of the message. In practice this often means that, out of 3 different transmission attempts, only one will be performed.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason why nodes don't acknowledge with ACKs messages that are relayed (and thus have the &lt;code&gt;Relayed&lt;/code&gt; flag set) is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We can't waste channel time to make the sender aware of far nodes that received the message. For each message we would have to produce &lt;code&gt;N-1&lt;/code&gt;ACKs (with N being the number of nodes), and even worse such ACKs would be relayed as well to reach the sender. This does not make sense, in practice: LoRa bandwidth is tiny. So the only point of sending ACKs to relayed messages would be to suppress retransmissions of relayed messages: this, however, is used in the first hop (as described before) only because we want to inform the original sender of the fact somebody received the message. However using this mechanism to just suppress retransmissions is futile: often the ACKs would waste more channel bandwidth than the time saved.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Format:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;+--------+---------+---------------+-----------------+---------------+
| type:8 | flags:8 | message ID:32 | 8 bits ack type | 48 bit sender |
+--------+---------+---------------+-----------------+---------------+
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The type id is MessageTypeAck&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Flags are set to 0. Ack messages should never be repeated.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The 32 bit message ID is the ID of the acknowledged message. ACKs don't have a message ID for the ACK itself, as they are fire and forget and it would not be useful.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The ACK type is the message type of the original message we are acknowledging.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sender is the sender node, the one that is acknowledging the message, so this is NOT the sender of the original massage. The sender field is used so that who sent the acknowledged message can know which node acknowledged it.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This message has the unique goal of advertising our presence to other devices in the network. This way, when a new device, part of the WAN, is powered on, it can tell if it is alone or surrounded by one or more other participants that are near enough to be received.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello messages are sent periodically, with a random period between 60000 and 120000 milliseconds (one to two minutes).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devices receiving HELLO messages will compile a list of neighbors. A device is removed from the list if we don't receive a HELLO message from it for 10 minutes (this means we need to miss many successive hello messages, in order to remove a device -- this is an important point, since we need to account for the high probability of losing messages for being in TX mode while some other node broadcasts).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Format:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;+--------+---------+---------------+--------+------------\\
| type:8 | flags:8 | 48 bit sender | seen:8 | status message
+--------+---------+---------------+--------+------------\\
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The type id is set to the HELLO message type.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Flags are currently unused for the HELLO message.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The sender is the device ID of the sender.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Seen is the number of devices this device is currently sensing, that is, the length of its neighbors list.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The status message is exactly like in the DATA message format: a string composed of one byte length of the nickname, and then the nickname of the owner and the message that was set as status message. Like:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"\x07antirezHi there! I'm part of FreakWAN."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data messages with the &lt;code&gt;PleaseRelay&lt;/code&gt; flag set are retransmitted by the nodes receiving them. The retransmission is the fundamental way in which the WAN is built. Imagine the following FreakWAN set of devices:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;A &amp;lt;------ 10 km -------&amp;gt; B &amp;lt;----- 10km -----&amp;gt; C
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a message sent by A to reach C, if we imagine a range of, for instance, 12 km, When B receives the messages created by A it must repeat the messages, so that C can also receive them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To do so, FreakWAN uses the following mechanism:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A data message that has the &lt;code&gt;PleaseRelay&lt;/code&gt;bit set, when received, is retransmitted multiple times, assuming its TTL is still greater than 1. The TTL of the message is decremented by one, the&lt;code&gt;Relayed&lt;/code&gt;flag is set in the message, finally the message is sent again as it is, without changing the sender address, but maintaining the original one.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Devices may chose to avoid retransmitting messages with a too high RSSI, in order to avoid using precious channel time without a good reason. It is of little interest that two very nearby devices retransmit their messages.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Retransmitted messages have the &lt;code&gt;Relayed&lt;/code&gt;flag set, so ACKs are not transmitted by the receivers of those messages. FreakWAN ACKs only serve to inform the originator of the message that some neighbor device received the message, but are not used in order to notify of the final destinations of the message, as this would require a lot of channel time and is quite useless. For direct messages between users, when they will be implemented, the acknowledge of reception can be created on top of the messaging system itself, sending an explicit reply.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Each message received and never seen before is relayed N times, with N being a configuration inside the program defaulting to 3. However users may change it, depending on the network nodes density and other parameters.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FreakWAN implementations are required to implement Listen Before Talk, in order to avoid sending messages if they detect some other valid LoRa transmission (either about FreakWAN or not) currently active. In this implementation, this feature is accomplished by reading the LoRa radio status register and avoiding transmitting if the set of bits reports an incoming packet being received.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LBT is a fundamental improvement for the performance of this protocol, since a major issue with this kind of routing, where every packet is sent and then relayed to everybody on the same frequency, is packet collisions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FreakWAN default mode of operation is as unencrypted everybody-can-talk open network. In this mode, messages can be spoofed, and different persons (nicks) or nodes IDs can be impersonated by other devices very easily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this reason it is also possible to use encryption with pre-shared symmetric keys. Because of the device limitations and the standard library provided by MicroPython, we had to use an in-house encryption mode based on AES and SHA256.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each device can store multiple symmetric keys, associated with a key name. Every time an encrypted message is received, all the keys are tested against the packet, and if a matching key is found (see later about the mechanism to validate the key) the message is correctly received, and displayed with the additional information of the key name, in order to make the user aware that this is an encrypted message that was decrypted with a specific key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, for example, if a key is shared between only two users, Alice and Bob, then Alice will store the &lt;code&gt;xyz&lt;/code&gt; key with the name "BoB", ad Bob
will store the same &lt;code&gt;xyz&lt;/code&gt; key with the name "Alice". Every time Alice
receives an encrypted message with such key, it will see:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#Bob bob&amp;gt; Hi Alice, how are you?
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where the first part is &lt;code&gt;#&amp;lt;keyname&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and the rest of the message is
the normal message, nick and text, or media type, as normally displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly if the same key is shared among a group of users, the effect will be to participate into a group chat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keys must be shared using a protected channel: either via messaging systems like Whatsapp or Signal, or face to face with the interested users. Optionally the system may decide to encrypt local keys using a passphrase, so that keys can't be extracted from the device when it is non operational.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only data messages are encrypted. ACKs, HELLO and other messages remain unencrypted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first four standard header fields of an encrypted packet are not encrypted at all: receivers, even without a key at hand, need to be able to check the message type and flags, the TTL (in case of relay), the message UID (to avoid reprocessing) and so forth. The only difference between the first 7 bytes (message type, flags, UID, TTL) of an ecrpyted and unencrypted message is that the &lt;code&gt;Encr&lt;/code&gt; flag is set. Then, if such
flag is set and the packet is thus encrypted, a 4 bytes initialization
vector (IV) follows. This is the unencrypted part of the packet. The
encrypted part is as the usual data as found in the DATA packet type: 6 bytes
of sender and the data payload itself. However, at the end of the packet,
there is an additional (not encrypted) 10 bytes of HMAC (truncated
HMAC-256), used to check integrity, and even to see if a given key is actually
decrypting a given packet correctly. The checksum computation is specified later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the representation of the message described above:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;+--------+---------+-------+-------+-------+-----------+--//--+------+
| type:8 | flags:8 | ID:32 | TTL:8 | IV:32 | sender:48 | data | HMAC |
+--------+---------+-------+-------+-------+-----------+--//--+------+
                                           |                  |
                                           `- Encrypted part -'
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 'IV' is the initialization vector for the CBC mode of AES, that is the algorithm used for encryption. However it is used together with all the unencrypted header part, from the type field, at byte 0, to the last byte of the IV. So the initialization vector used is a total 11 bytes, of which at least 64 bits of pseudorandom data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final 10 bytes HMAC is computed using HMAC-SHA256, truncated to 10 bytes, but the last 4 bits are set to the padding length of the message, so actually of the 80 bits HMAC, only the first 76 are used. The last byte least significant four bits tell us how many bytes to discard from the decrypted payload, because of AES padding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AES key and the HMAC key are different, but derived from the same master key. The derivation is performed as such: Given the unique key &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;, we derive the two keys with as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;aes-key = first 16 bytes of HMAC-SHA256(k,"AES14159265358979323846")
mac-key = HMAC-SHA256(k,"MAC26433832795028841971")
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To encrypt:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build the first four fields of the packet header as described above.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Renerate a random 4 bytes IV and append it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set TTL to 0 (but save the original value), and clear the &lt;code&gt;Relayed&lt;/code&gt;flag bit, also saving the original flag value.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Encrypt the payload with AES in CBC mode, using aes-key as key, and using as IV the first 11 bytes of the packet. Pad the packet with zeroes so that it is multiple of 16 bytes (AES block). Remember the padding used to reach the AES block size as "PADLEN". Append the encrypted payload to the packet.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Perform HMAC-SHA256(mac-key,packet) of all the packet built so far.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Append the first 10 bytes of the HMAC to the packet, but replace the last 4 bits with PADLEN as unsigned 4 bit integer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Restore TTL and &lt;code&gt;Relayed&lt;/code&gt;flag.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Decrypting is very similar. When a packet arrives, we clear the TTL and &lt;code&gt;Relayed&lt;/code&gt; bit (saving the original values). We also store the last 4 bits
of the HMAC as PADLEN, and clear those bits. Then, for all the all the keys
we have in memory, one after the other, we see if we can find one for which
we can recompute the HMAC of the message (minus the last 10 bytes), trucate
it to 10 bytes, clearing the last 4 bits, and check if it matches with the
final 10 bytes of the packet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a match is found, we can decrpyt the message with AES in CBC mode, discard the final PADLEN zero bytes (checking they are actually zero as an additional check against implementation bugs), and process it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The receiver of the packet has all the information required in order to relay the packet: we want the network to be collaborative even for messages that are not public. If the PleaseRelay flag is set, nodes should retransmit the message as usually, decrementing that TTL and setting the &lt;code&gt;Relayed&lt;/code&gt; flag: the TTL and this flag are not part of the CHECKSUM computation, nor of the IV (they are set to 0), so can be modified by intermediate nodes without invalidating the packet. Similarly, the message UID is exposed in the unencrypted header, so
nodes without a suitable key for the message can yet avoid re-processing the
message just saving its UID in the messages cache.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The encryption scheme described here was designed in order to use few bytes of additional space and the only encryption primitive built-in in MicroPython that was stable enough: the SHA256 hash and AES.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Because of the device and LoRa packets size and bandwidth limitations, the IV is shorter than one would hope. However it is partially compensated by the fact that the message UID is also part of the set of bytes used as initialization vector (see the encryption algorithm above). So the IV is actually at least 64 bits of pseudorandom data. For the attacker, it will be very hard to find two messages with the same IV, and even so the information disclosed would be minimal.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The &lt;code&gt;sender&lt;/code&gt;field of the message is part of the encrypted part, thus encrypted messages don't discose nor the sender, that is encrypted, nor the received, that is implicit (has the key) of the message.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LoRa packets are limited to 256 bytes. There is no way to go over such limitation (it is hardcoded in the hardware), and it would also be useless, since the long time on air means that, after a certain length, it is hard to take a good frequency reference: communication errors would be inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the FreakWAN protocol supports fragmentation, for use cases when it is useful to transmit messages up to a few kilobytes at max. Fragmentation is only supported for DATA type message (the other message types don't need, to be larger than the LoRa packet size), and works both for clear text and encrypted messages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the sender size, when the total length of the packet would be more than &lt;code&gt;MAXPACKET&lt;/code&gt; total bytes (that may be configured inside the app), the data
payload is split in roughly equally sized packets. The last packet may have a
byte more in case the data length is not multiple of the number of packets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important: &lt;code&gt;MAXPACKET&lt;/code&gt; must be choosen so that it is always possible to transmit
two bytes more than its value, since the data section will have two additional
bytes used for the fragmentation metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, for instance, if the data section (nick + data o media) of a DATA packet is 1005 bytes, and &lt;code&gt;MAXPACKET&lt;/code&gt; is set to 200 bytes, the number of total packets
required is the integer result of the following division:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;NUMPACKETS = (DATALEN+MAXPACKET-1) / MAXPACKET
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;NUMPACKETS = (1005+199)/200 = 6
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each of the packets will have the following size:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;BASESIZE = 1005/6 = 167
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However &lt;code&gt;167*6&lt;/code&gt; = just 1002 bytes. So we also calculate a reminder size:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;REM = DATALEN - BASESIZE*NUMPACKETS
REM = 1005 - (167*6) = 3
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we add a single additional byte of data to the first REM packets we generate during the fragmentation, so the length of the packets will be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Packet 1: 168&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Packet 2: 168&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Packet 3: 168&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Packet 4: 167&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Packet 5: 167&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Packet 6: 167&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is a total of 1005 bytes. The strategy used attempts at generating packets of roughly the same size, so that each packet has a better probability of being transmitted correctly. For our use case, to transmit the first N-1 full packets at the maximum length, and then a final small packet, would not be optimal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each fragment will be sent as a DATA message is exactly like a normal DATA message, with the following differences:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Fragment&lt;/code&gt;flag is set in the header flags section.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;At the end of the fragment data, there are two 8 bit unsigned integers, appended to the data itself.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, in the example above, the first packet would have 168 bytes of data terminated by two additional bytes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;//-----------------------+------------+-------------+
... 168 byts of data ... | frag-num:8 | tot-frags:8 |
/.-----------------------+------------+-------------+
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;frag-num&lt;/code&gt; is the number of the fragment, identifying its position
among all the fragmnets, and &lt;code&gt;tot-frags&lt;/code&gt; is the total number of
fragments. The total length of the data is implicit, and is not direcly
available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The receiver will accumulate (for a given maximum time) message fragments having the same Message ID field value. Once all the fragments are received, the origianl message is generated from the fragments, where the &lt;code&gt;Fragment&lt;/code&gt; flag is cleared, the data sections of all the fragments are glued
together (but discarding the last two bytes of each packet), and finally the
message is passed for processing to the normal FreakWAN path inside the
FreakWAN stack. The software should make sure that fragments don't accumulate
forever in case some fragment is missing: after a given time, if no full
reassembly was possible, fargments should expire and the memory should be
freed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, I said there would never be a version three of htmx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, technically, I never said anything about a version four…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In The Future of htmx I said the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are going to work to ensure that htmx is extremely stable in both API &amp;amp; implementation. This means accepting and documenting the quirks of the current implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, on a whim, I created fixi.js, a hyperminimalist implementation of the ideas in htmx. That work gave me a chance to get a lot more familiar with the &lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt; and, especially, the
async infrastructure
available in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In doing that work I began to wonder if that, while the htmx API is (at least reasonably) correct, maybe there was room for a more dramatic change of the implementation that took advantage of these features in order to simplify the library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, changing from ye olde &lt;code&gt;XMLHttpRequest&lt;/code&gt;
(a legacy of htmx 1.0 IE support) to &lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt; would
be a pretty violent change, guaranteed to break at least some stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I began thinking: if we are going to consider moving to fetch, then maybe we should also use this update as a chance address at least some of the quirks &amp;amp; cruft that htmx has acquired over its lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, eventually &amp;amp; reluctantly, I have changed my mind: there will be another major version of htmx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in order to keep my word that there will not be a htmx 3.0, the next release will instead be htmx 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With htmx 4.0 we are rebuilding the internals of htmx, based on the lessons learned from fixi.js and five+ years of supporting htmx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three major simplifying changes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest internal change is that &lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt; will replace &lt;code&gt;XMLHttpRequest&lt;/code&gt; as the core ajax infrastructure.  This
won’t actually have a huge effect on most usages of htmx except that the events model will necessarily change due
to the differences between &lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;XMLHttpRequest&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel that my biggest mistake in htmx 1.0 &amp;amp; 2.0 was making attribute inheritance implicit. I was inspired by CSS in doing this, and the results have been roughly the same as CSS: powerful &amp;amp; maddening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In htmx 4.0, attribute inheritance will be explicit rather than implicit, via the &lt;code&gt;:inherited&lt;/code&gt; modifier:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &amp;lt;div hx-target:inherited="#output"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;button hx-post="/up"&amp;gt;Like&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;button hx-post="/down"&amp;gt;Dislike&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;output id="output"&amp;gt;Pick a button...&amp;lt;/output&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here the &lt;code&gt;hx-target&lt;/code&gt; attribute is explicitly declared as &lt;code&gt;inherited&lt;/code&gt; on the enclosing &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; and, if it wasn’t, the
&lt;code&gt;button&lt;/code&gt; elements would not inherit the target from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be the most significant upgrade change to deal with for most htmx users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another constant source of pain for both us and for htmx users is history support. htmx 2.0 stores history in local cache to make navigation faster. Unfortunately, snapshotting the DOM is often brittle because of third-party modifications, hidden state, etc. There is a terrible simplicity to the web 1.0 model of blowing everything away and starting over. There are also security concerns storing history information in session storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In htmx 2.0, we often end up recommending that people facing history-related issues simply disable the cache entirely, and that usually fixes the problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In htmx 4.0, history support will no longer snapshot the DOM and keep it locally. It will, rather, issue a network request for the restored content. This is the behavior of 2.0 on a history cache-miss, and it works reliably with little effort on behalf of htmx users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will offer an extension that enables history caching like in htmx 2.0, but it will be opt-in, rather than the default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tremendously simplifies the htmx codebase and should make the out-of-the-box behavior much more plug-and-play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core functionality of htmx will remain the same, &lt;code&gt;hx-get&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;hx-post&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;hx-target&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;hx-boost&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;hx-swap&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;hx-trigger&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except for adding an &lt;code&gt;:inherited&lt;/code&gt; modifier on a few attributes, many htmx projects will “just work” with htmx 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes will make the long term maintenance &amp;amp; sustainability of the project much stronger. It will also take pressure off the 2.0 releases, which can now focus on stability rather than contemplating new features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, htmx 2.0 users will face an upgrade project when moving to 4.0 in a way that they did not have to in moving from 1.0 to 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am sorry about that, and want to offer three things to address it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;latest&lt;/code&gt; and htmx 4.x is &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it isn’t all bad. Beyond simplifying the implementation of htmx significantly, switching to fetch also gives us the opportunity to add some nice new features to htmx&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By switching to &lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt;, we can take advantage of its support for
readable streams, which
allow for a stream of content to be swapped into the DOM, rather than a single response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;htmx 1.0 had Server Sent Event support integrated into the library. In htmx 2.0 we pulled this functionality out as an extension. It turns out that SSE is just a specialized version of a streaming response, so in adding streaming support, it’s an almost-free free two-fer to add that back into core as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will make incremental response swapping much cleaner and well-supported in htmx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years ago I had an idea for a DOM morphing algorithm that improved on the initial algorithm pioneered by morphdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea was to use “id sets” to make smarter decisions regarding which nodes to preserve and which nodes to delete when merging changes into the DOM, and I called this idea “idiomorph”. Idiomorph has gone on to be adopted by many other web project such as Hotwire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We strongly considered including it in htmx 2.0, but I decided not too because it worked well as an extension and htmx 2.0 had already grown larger than I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 4.0, with the complexity savings we achieved by moving to &lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt;, we can now comfortably fit a &lt;code&gt;morphInner&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;morphOuter&lt;/code&gt; swap into core, thanks to the excellent work of Michael West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;htmx has, since very early on, supported a concept of “Out-of-band” swaps: content that is removed from the main HTML response and swapped into the DOM elsewhere. I have always been a bit ambivalent about them, because they move away from Locality of Behavior, but there is no doubt that they are useful and often crucial for achieving certain UI patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out-of-band swaps started off very simply: if you marked an element as &lt;code&gt;hx-swap-oob='true'&lt;/code&gt;, htmx would swap the element
as the outer HTML of any existing element already in the DOM with that id.  Easy-peasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, over time, people started asking for different functionality around Out-of-band swaps: prepending, appending, etc. and the feature began acquiring some fairly baroque syntax to handle all these needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have come to the conclusion that the problem is that there are really two use cases, both currently trying to be filled by Out-of-band swaps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we are introducing the notion of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;partial&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s in htmx 4.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A partial element is, under the covers, a template element and, thus, can contain any sort of content you like. It specifies on itself all the standard htmx options regarding swapping, &lt;code&gt;hx-target&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hx-swap&lt;/code&gt; in particular, allowing
you full access to all the standard swapping behavior of htmx without using a specialized syntax.  This tremendously
simplifies the mental model for these sorts of needs, and dovetails well with the streaming support we intend to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out-of-band swaps will be retained in htmx 4.0, but will go back to their initial, simple focus of simply replacing an existing element by id.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;htmx 2.0 has had View Transition support since April of 2023. In the interceding two years, support for the feature has grown across browsers (c’mon, safari, you can do it) and we’ve gained experience with the feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that has become apparent to us while using them is that, to use them in a stable manner, it is important to establish a queue of transitions, so each can complete before the other begins. If you don’t do this, you can get visually ugly transition cancellations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, in htmx 4.0 we have added this queue which will ensure that all view transitions complete smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CSS transitions will continue to work as before as well, although the swapping model is again made much simpler by the async runtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may enable View Transitions by default, the jury is still out on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wonderful thing about &lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt; and the async support in general is that it is much easier to guarantee a stable
order of events.  By linearizing asynchronous code and allowing us to use standard language features like try/catch,
the event model of htmx should be much more predictable and comprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are going to adopt a new standard for event naming to make things even clearer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;htmx:&amp;lt;phase&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;system&amp;gt;[:&amp;lt;optional-sub-action&amp;gt;]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, for example, &lt;code&gt;htmx:before:request&lt;/code&gt; will be triggered before a request is made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another opportunity we have is to take advantage of the &lt;code&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; behavior of &lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt; for much better performance in our
preload extension (where we issue a speculative (&lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; only!) request in anticipation of an actual trigger).  We have
also added an optimistic update extension to the core extensions, again made easy by the new async features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, we have opened up the internals of the htmx request/response/swap cycle much more fully to extension developers, up to and including allowing them to replace the &lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt; implementation used by htmx for a particular request.  There
should not be a need for any hacks to get the behavior you want out of htmx now: the events and the open “context” object
should provide the ability to do almost anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;hx-on&lt;/code&gt; Support&lt;p&gt;In htmx 2.0, I somewhat reluctantly added the &lt;code&gt;hx-on&lt;/code&gt; attributes to support light
scripting inline on elements.  I added this because HTML does not allow you to listen for arbitrary events via &lt;code&gt;on&lt;/code&gt;
attributes: only standard DOM events like &lt;code&gt;onclick&lt;/code&gt; can be responded to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hemmed and hawed about the syntax and so, unfortunately, there are a few different ways to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In htmx 4.0 we will adopt a single standard for the &lt;code&gt;hx-on&lt;/code&gt; attributes: &lt;code&gt;hx-on:&amp;lt;event name&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  Additionally, we are
working to improve the htmx JavaScript API (especially around async operation support) and will make those features
available in &lt;code&gt;hx-on&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;button hx-post="/like"
        hx-on:htmx:after:swap="await timeout('3s'); ctx.newContent[0].remove()"&amp;gt;
    Get A Response Then Remove It 3 Seconds Later
&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;htmx will never support a fully featured scripting mechanism in core, we recommend something like Alpine.js for that, but our hope is that we can provide a relatively minimalist API that allows for easy, light async scripting of the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should note that htmx 4.0 will continue to work with &lt;code&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt; disabled, but you will need to forego a few features like
&lt;code&gt;hx-on&lt;/code&gt; if you choose to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, our hope is that htmx 4.0 will feel an awful lot like 2.0, but with better features and, we hope, with fewer bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, software takes as long as it takes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, our current planned timeline is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;htmx@4.0.0-alpha1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;latest&lt;/code&gt; in early-2027ish&lt;p&gt;You can track our progress (and see quite a bit of dust flying around) in the &lt;code&gt;four&lt;/code&gt; branch on
github and at:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience and pardon our dust!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Well, when events change, I change my mind. What do you do?” –Paul Samuelson or John Maynard Keynes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Lead image: Philip Goldstein) – In the early 1960s the New York City Fire Department was facing a host of problems. The world around them was growing ever taller, ever more compact, and ever more dangerous with respect to fire. There were times when the very infrastructure that was supposed to be supplying them the water to extinguish a blaze simply stopped flowing, there were other times that the equipment they had proved to be woefully insufficient to stop a fire that should have been controlled, resulting in massive blazes that ate up homes, businesses, lives, and millions upon millions of dollars. In April of 1963, a massive fire on Staten Island taxed the city’s fire service to the absolute breaking point while destroying millions and millions in property.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The day is still referred to as Black Saturday by the people who lived through it. Due to the lack of suitable water supplies, the fire was far larger than it should have been. There was a drought that year and many of the sources that the firemen were used to pulling water from had literally run dry. This began a series of events that led to the construction of the most powerful land based fire fighting truck ever created, the Mack Super Pumper System. It was actually five trucks that worked as a brigade to battle the worst flaming disasters that the city could throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From 1965 through the early 1980s, the Mack Super Pumper System responded to more than 2,200 calls with more than 900 firefighters serving to operate it in some capacity. The five trucks that made up the super pumper system were a massive, locomotive-engined central pumping truck, a tender truck full of hoses, manifolds, and other gear, and three satellite trucks that looked like standard fire engines but were not equipped with their own pumps. It cost the city of New York $875,000 when it was new and we’ll wager to say that it was probably the best money ever spent to keep Gotham safe. There’s never been anything else like it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pumping unit –&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The keystone of the whole operation was the massive central pumping unit that could draw water from eight hydrants at once, drop lines into bodies of water, supply a mind-boggling number of lines with water simultaneously, and flow over 10,000 gallons per minute at low pressures if the situation called for it. When the pressure was ramped up to to 350psi, it could move 8,800 GPM. This was enough to supply the other satellite trucks as well as feed a massive water cannon on the tender truck that could heave water over 600ft. That’s right, nearly and eight of a mile in whatever direction you wanted it to go. How was this possible? It was possible because of innovations in diesel engine technology during WWII. The grunt for the Super Pumper system came from a Napier-Deltic diesel engine. This was an engine designed by the British during WWII as a lightweight, high speed means to propel their ships. Making 2,400 horsepower and even more prodigious torque numbers, the engine was “light” enough to be mounted in a trailer behind a tractor and carted around. The Napier-Deltic was used to power locomotives and other massive land craft as well for a while. The engine’s design is interesting in the fact that it had three crankshafts and was an opposed piston style engine meaning that the pistons travel at each other. With turbochargers and a two stroke design, it was as mighty a compact piston powered engine the world had ever known to that point. It was thirsty and noisy as well. When working at full song, the engine would consume 137 gallons of diesel fuel per hour and the noise was so deafening that firemen near the truck had to wear strong ear protection to prevent hearing damage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mack was awarded the contract to build the truck in 1964 and by the end of the year, the unit was nearly ready to hit the streets of NYC. The tractor employed to drag the pumping unit around was a F715FSTP cab over that used a 255hp Mack END864 engine. The top speed of the whole rig was 42mph but since it was intended for responding to calls in the city, high mph was not as much a concern as maneuverability, and the ability to zip around at lower speeds happily. There were custom built PTOs to power the priming pump for the water pump and to to run an air compressor that needed 450psi to light off the pump engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The custom built trailer housed the engine and all of the stuff needed to keep it alive like the cooling system, fuel tanks, etc. At the rear of the trailer was the enormous six stage pump which was built by a company called DeLaval and that’s where the real magic happened. When the big Deltic was put to work turning that bad boy, fire, at least any on the first 60 stories of a building, didn’t stand a chance. The whole rig weighed in at 68,000lbs and for as much reading and research as we have done, there are no accounts of it ever faltering, failing, or leaving firefighters without the resources they needed to battle a fire. Often times we read about awesome machines like this and discover that they were unreliable or prone to fail but not this big guy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some pretty stunning facts about the truck and the pumper:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At 8,800 GPM it was throwing nearly 70,000lbs of water on a fire per minute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During a fire in the Bronx, firemen laid 7,000ft of hose to get to a suitable water supply and the truck pumped as though it was dipping its feet into the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1967 the Super Pumper responded to a fire at a postal annex in NYC and managed to supply water to the massive gun on the tender truck, its three satellite units, two tower ladder trucks, and a portable manifold with multiple hand lines all by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hoses on the truck were pressure tested to 1,000psi of pressure but typically operated anywhere in the 350-800psi range depending on the situation. This is way higher (by several times!) what modern trucks use by our understanding. The hoses were a derivative of hoses developed by the Navy in WWII for high pressure applications and while incredibly heavy when compared to modern hoses, they were cutting edge at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The truck still exists, living at a museum in Michigan and standing as a great reminder that human beings are amazingly inventive and creative beings when forced to find solutions to problems that endanger lots of lives or lots of valuable property!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your computer modem screeches as it tries to connect to something called the internet. Maybe it works. Maybe you try again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the first time in history, you can exchange letters with someone across the world in seconds. Only 2000-something websites exist1, so you could theoretically visit them all over a weekend. Most websites are just text on gray backgrounds with the occasional pixelated image2. Loading times are brutal. A single image takes a minute, a 1-minute video could take hours. Most people do not trust putting their credit cards online. The advice everyone gives: don’t trust strangers on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People split into two camps very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Optimists predict grand transformations. Some believe digital commerce will overtake physical retail within years. Others insist we’ll wander around in virtual reality worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“I expect that within the next five years more than one in ten people will wear head-mounted computer displays while traveling in buses, trains, and planes.” - Nicholas Negroponte, MIT Professor, 1993&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pessimists call the internet a fad and a bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you told the average person in 1995 that within 25 years, we’d consume news from strangers on social media over newspapers, watch shows on-demand in place of cable TV, find romantic partners through apps more than through friends, and flip “don’t trust strangers on the internet” so completely that we’d let internet strangers pick us up in their personal vehicles and sleep in their spare bedrooms, most people would find that hard to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re in 1995 again. This time with Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And both sides of today’s debate are making similar mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One side warns that AI will eliminate entire professions and cause mass unemployment within a couple of years. The other claims that AI will create more jobs than it destroys. One camp dismisses AI as overhyped vaporware destined for a bubble burst, while the other predicts it will automate every knowledge task and reshape civilization within the decade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both are part right and part wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Employment Paradox: Why Automation’s Impact Depends On The Industry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Geoffrey Hinton, who some call the Father of AI, warned in 2016 that AI would trigger mass unemployment. “People should stop training radiologists now,” he declared, certain that AI would replace them within years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet as Deena Mousa, a researcher, shows in “The Algorithm Will See You Now,” AI hasn’t replaced radiologists, despite predictions. It is thriving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In 2025, American diagnostic radiology residency programs offered a record 1,208 positions across all radiology specialties, a four percent increase from 2024, and the field’s vacancy rates are at all-time highs. In 2025, radiology was the second-highest-paid medical specialty in the country, with an average income of $520,000, over 48 percent higher than the average salary in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mousa identifies a few factors for why the prediction failed - real-world complexity, the job involves more than image recognition, and regulatory/insurance hurdles. Most critical she points is Jevons Paradox, which is the economic principle that a technological improvement in resource efficiency leads to an increase in the total consumption of that resource, rather than a decrease. Her argument is that as AI makes radiologists more productive, better diagnostics and faster turnaround at lower costs mean more people get scans. So employment doesn’t decrease. It increases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is also the Tech world’s consensus. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella agrees, as does Box CEO Aaron Levie, who suggests:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“The least understood yet most important concept in the world is Jevons Paradox. When we make a technology more efficient, demand goes well beyond the original level. AI is the perfect example of this—almost anything that AI is applied to will see more demand, not less.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re only half right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, as Andrej Karpathy, the computer scientist who coined the term vibe coding, points out, radiology is not the right job to look for initial job displacements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Radiology is too multi-faceted, too high risk, too regulated. When looking for jobs that will change a lot due to AI on shorter time scales, I’d look in other places - jobs that look like repetition of one rote task, each task being relatively independent, closed (not requiring too much context), short (in time), forgiving (the cost of mistake is low), and of course automatable giving current (and digital) capability. Even then, I’d expect to see AI adopted as a tool at first, where jobs change and refactor (e.g. more monitoring or supervising than manual doing, etc).”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, the tech consensus that we will see increased employment actually depends on the industry. Specifically, how much unfulfilled demand can be unlocked in that industry, and whether this unfulfilled demand growth outpaces continued automation and productivity improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand this better, look at what actually happened in three industries over a 200-year period from 1800 to 2000. In the paper Automation and jobs: when technology boosts employment, James Bessen, an economist, shows the employment, productivity, and demand data for textile, iron &amp;amp; steel, and motor vehicle industries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After automation, both textile and iron/steel workers saw employment increase for nearly a century before experiencing a steep decline. Vehicle manufacturing, by contrast, holds steady and hasn’t seen the same steep decline yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To answer why those two industries saw sharp declines but motor vehicle manufacturing did not, first look at the productivity of workers in all three industries:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then look at the demand across those three industries:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What the graphs show is a consistent pattern (note: the productivity and demand graphs are logarithmic, meaning productivity and demand grew exponentially). Early on, a service or product is expensive because many workers are needed to produce it. Most people can’t afford it or use them sparingly. For example, in the early 1800s, most people could only afford a pair of pants or shirt. Then automation makes workers dramatically more productive. A textile worker in 1900 could produce fifty times more than one in 1800. This productivity explosion crashes prices, which creates massive new demand. Suddenly everyone can afford multiple outfits instead of just one or two. Employment and productivity both surge (note: employment growth masks internal segment displacement and wage changes. See footnote3)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once demand saturates, employment doesn’t further increase but holds steady at peak demand. But as automation continues and workers keep getting more productive, employment starts to decline. In textiles, mechanization enabled massive output growth but ultimately displaced workers once consumption plateaued while automation and productivity continued climbing. We probably don’t need infinite clothing. Similarly, patients will likely never need a million radiology reports, no matter how cheap they become and so radiologists will eventually hit a ceiling. We don’t need infinite food, clothing, tax returns, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Motor vehicles, in Bessen’s graphs, tell a different story because demand remains far from saturated. Most people globally still don’t own cars. Automation hasn’t completely conquered manufacturing either (Tesla’s retreat from full manufacturing automation proves the current technical limits). When both demand and automation potential remain high, employment can sustain or even grow despite productivity gains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software presents an even more interesting question. How many apps do you need? What about software that generates applications on demand, that creates entire software ecosystems autonomously? Until now, handcrafted software was the constraint. Expensive software engineers and their labor costs limited what companies could afford to build. Automation changes this equation by making those engineers far more productive. Both consumer and enterprise software markets suggest significant unmet demand because businesses have consistently left projects unbuilt4. They couldn’t justify the development costs or had to allocate limited resources to their top priority projects. I saw this firsthand at Amazon. Thousands of ideas went unfunded not because they lacked business value, but because of the lack of engineering resources to build them. If AI can produce software at a fraction of the cost, that unleashes enormous latent demand. The key question then is if and when that demand will saturate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So to generalize, for each industry, employment hinges on a race between two forces:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The magnitude and growth of unmet market demand, and&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Whether that demand growth outpaces productivity improvements from automation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Different industries will experience different outcomes depending on who’s winning that demand and productivity race.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Bubble: Irrational Exuberance Builds the Future&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second debate centers on whether this AI boom is a bubble waiting to burst.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dotcom boom of the 1990s saw a wave of companies adding “.com” to their name to ride the mania and watch their valuations soar. Infra companies poured billions into fiber optics and undersea cables - expensive projects only possible because people believed the hype5. All of this eventually burst in spectacular fashion in the dotcom crash in 2000-2001. Infrastructure companies like Cisco briefly became the most valuable in the world only to come tumbling down6. Pets.com served as the poster child of this exuberance raising $82.5 million in its IPO, spending millions on a Super Bowl ad only to collapse nine months later7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the dotcom bubble also got several things right. More importantly, it eventually bought us the physical infrastructure that made YouTube, Netflix, and Facebook possible. Sure, companies like Worldcom, NorthPoint, and Global Crossing making these investments went bankrupt, but they also laid the foundation for the future. Although the crash proved the skeptics right in the short term, it proved the optimists were directionally correct in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s AI boom shows similar exuberance. Consider the AI startup founded by former OpenAI executive Mira Murati, which raised $2 billion at a $10 billion valuation, the largest seed round in history8. This despite having no product and declining to reveal what it’s building or how it will generate returns. Several AI wrappers have raised millions in seed funding with little to no moat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet some investments will outlast the hype and will likely help future AI companies even if this is a bubble. For example, the annual capital expenditures of Hyperscalers9 that have more than doubled since ChatGPT’s release - Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon are collectively spending almost half a trillion dollars on data centers, chips, and compute infrastructure. Regardless of which specific companies survive, this infrastructure being built now will create the foundation for our AI future - from inference capacity to the power generation needed to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The infrastructure investments may have long-term value, but are we already in bubble territory? Azeem Azhar, a tech analyst and investor, provides an excellent practical framework to answer the AI bubble question. He benchmarks today’s AI boom using five gauges: economic strain (investment as a share of GDP), industry strain (capex to revenue ratios), revenue growth trajectories (doubling time), valuation heat (price-to-earnings multiples), and funding quality (the resilience of capital sources). His analysis shows that AI remains in a demand-led boom rather than a bubble, but if two of the five gauges head into red, we will be in bubble territory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The demand is real. After all OpenAI is one of the fastest-growing companies in history10. But that alone doesn’t prevent bubbles. OpenAI will likely be fine given its product-market fit, but many other AI companies face the same unit economics questions that plagued dotcom companies in the 1990s. Pets.com had millions of users too (a then large portion of internet users), but as the tech axiom goes, you can acquire infinite customers and generate infinite revenue if you sell dollars for 85 cents11. So despite the demand, the pattern may rhyme with the 1990s. Expect overbuilding. Expect some spectacular failures. But also expect the infrastructure to outlast the hype cycle and enable things we can’t yet imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Predictably Unpredictable Future&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where does this leave us?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re early in the AI revolution. We’re at that metaphorical screeching modem phase of the internet era. Just as infrastructure companies poured billions into fiber optics, hyperscalers now pour billions into compute. Startups add “.ai” to their names like companies once added “.com” as they seek higher valuations. The hype will cycle through both euphoria and despair. Some predictions will look laughably wrong. Some that seem crazy will prove conservative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Different industries will experience different outcomes. Unlike what the Jevons optimists suggest, demand for many things plateaus once human needs are met. Employment outcomes in any industry depend on the magnitude and growth of unmet market demand and whether that demand growth outpaces productivity improvements from automation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cost reduction will unlock market segments. Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor, (in)famously undervalued Uber assuming it would only capture a portion of the existing taxi market12. He missed that making rides dramatically cheaper would expand the market itself as people took Ubers to destinations they’d never have paid taxi prices to reach. AI will similarly enable products and services currently too expensive to build with human intelligence. A restaurant owner might use AI to create custom supply chain software that say at $100,000 with human developers would never have been built. A non-profit might deploy AI to contest a legal battle that was previously unaffordable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can predict change, but we can’t predict the details. No one in 1995 predicted we’d date strangers from the internet, ride in their ubers, or sleep in their airbnbs. Or that a job called influencers would become the most sought-after career among young people. Human creativity generates outcomes we can’t forecast with our current mental models. Expect new domains and industries to emerge. AI has already helped us decode more animal communication in the last five years than in the last fifty. Can we predict what jobs a technology that allows us to have full-blown conversations with them will unlock? A job that doesn’t exist today will likely be the most sought-after job in 2050. We can’t name it because it hasn’t been invented yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Job categories will transform. Even as the internet made some jobs obsolete, it also transformed others and created new categories. Expect the same with AI. Karpathy ends with a question:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;About 6 months ago, I was also asked to vote if we will have less or more software engineers in 5 years. Exercise left for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To answer this question, go back to 1995 and ask the same question but with journalists. You might have predicted more journalists because the internet would create more demand by enabling you to reach the whole world. You’d be right for 10 or so years as employment in journalism grew until the early 2000s. But 30 years later, the number of newspapers and the number of journalists both have declined, even though more “journalism” happens than ever. Just not by people we call journalists. Bloggers, influencers, YouTubers, and newsletter writers do the work that traditional journalists used to do13.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same pattern will play out with software engineers. We’ll see more people doing software engineering work and in a decade or so, what “software engineer” means will have transformed. Consider the restaurant owner from earlier who uses AI to create custom inventory software that is useful only for them. They won’t call themselves a software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So just like in 1995, if the AI optimists today say that within 25 years, we’d prefer news from AI over social media influencers, watch AI-generated characters in place of human actors, find romantic partners through AI matchmakers more than through dating apps (or perhaps use AI romantic partners itself), and flip “don’t trust AI” so completely that we’d rely on AI for life-or-death decisions and trust it to raise our children, most people would find that hard to believe. Even with all the intelligence, both natural and artificial, no one can predict with certainty what our AI future will look like. Not the tech CEOs, not the AI researchers, and certainly not some random guy pontificating on the internet. But whether we get the details right or not, our AI future is loading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approximately 2,879 websites were established before 1995, expanding to 23,500 by June 1995. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_websites_founded_before_1995&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historical data from the Industrial Revolution shows that even as aggregate textile employment grew, workers shifted between job types within the industry as some roles became redundant. And correspondingly, some jobs saw wages collapse while others saw increases. For example, domestic hand-loom weavers were displaced by power looms and saw their wages collapse, while self-acting mule spinners (a newly created role) and factory workers saw stable employment and steady compensation growth. Additionally, Britain’s deflationary period (1815-1850) saw food prices fall by half, meaning real purchasing power often rose even when nominal wages declined. Despite all this, the psychological reality was harsh. Even with falling prices, watching your paycheck shrink while neighbors lost jobs and debts grew harder to pay (lower wages but fixed obligations) created real instability regardless of aggregate statistics improvements. Also see Acemoglu &amp;amp; Johnson, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask any tech product leader about their roadmap planning, and they’ll all universally report far more worthwhile projects than resources to build them, forcing ruthless prioritization to decide what gets built.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hyperscalers are large cloud computing companies like Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon that operate massive data centers and provide the computing infrastructure necessary to train and run AI models at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Damodaran valued Uber at $6B, assuming a 10% market share of the then $100B taxi market. Uber’s market cap as of October 2025 is $190B.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Job transformation doesn’t guarantee comparable compensation. Much of this new “journalism” or content creation happens for free or at rates far below what traditional news organizations paid, separating the work from stable employment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on and off on a new linker. To my surprise, I’ve discovered in talking about this that some people, even some computer programmers, are unfamiliar with the details of the linking process. I’ve decided to write some notes about linkers, with the goal of producing an essay similar to my existing one about the GNU configure and build system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I only have the time to write one thing a day, I’m going to do this on my blog over time, and gather the final essay together later. I believe that I may be up to five readers, and I hope y’all will accept this digression into stuff that matters. I will return to random philosophizing and minding other people’s business soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Personal Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who am I to write about linkers?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote my first linker back in 1988, for the AMOS operating system which ran on Alpha Micro systems. (If you don’t understand the following description, don’t worry; all will be explained below). I used a single global database to register all symbols. Object files were checked into the database after they had been compiled. The link process mainly required identifying the object file holding the main function. Other objects files were pulled in by reference. I reverse engineered the object file format, which was undocumented but quite simple. The goal of all this was speed, and indeed this linker was much faster than the system one, mainly because of the speed of the database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote my second linker in 1993 and 1994. This linker was designed and prototyped by Steve Chamberlain while we both worked at Cygnus Support (later Cygnus Solutions, later part of Red Hat). This was a complete reimplementation of the BFD based linker which Steve had written a couple of years before. The primary target was a.out and COFF. Again the goal was speed, especially compared to the original BFD based linker. On SunOS 4 this linker was almost as fast as running the cat program on the input .o files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The linker I am now working, called gold, on will be my third. It is exclusively an ELF linker. Once again, the goal is speed, in this case being faster than my second linker. That linker has been significantly slowed down over the years by adding support for ELF and for shared libraries. This support was patched in rather than being designed in. Future plans for the new linker include support for incremental linking–which is another way of increasing speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is an obvious pattern here: everybody wants linkers to be faster. This is because the job which a linker does is uninteresting. The linker is a speed bump for a developer, a process which takes a relatively long time but adds no real value. So why do we have linkers at all? That brings us to our next topic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Technical Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does a linker do?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s simple: a linker converts object files into executables and shared libraries. Let’s look at what that means. For cases where a linker is used, the software development process consists of writing program code in some language: e.g., C or C++ or Fortran (but typically not Java, as Java normally works differently, using a loader rather than a linker). A compiler translates this program code, which is human readable text, into into another form of human readable text known as assembly code. Assembly code is a readable form of the machine language which the computer can execute directly. An assembler is used to turn this assembly code into an object file. For completeness, I’ll note that some compilers include an assembler internally, and produce an object file directly. Either way, this is where things get interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the old days, when dinosaurs roamed the data centers, many programs were complete in themselves. In those days there was generally no compiler–people wrote directly in assembly code–and the assembler actually generated an executable file which the machine could execute directly. As languages liked Fortran and Cobol started to appear, people began to think in terms of libraries of subroutines, which meant that there had to be some way to run the assembler at two different times, and combine the output into a single executable file. This required the assembler to generate a different type of output, which became known as an object file (I have no idea where this name came from). And a new program was required to combine different object files together into a single executable. This new program became known as the linker (the source of this name should be obvious).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linkers still do the same job today. In the decades that followed, one new feature has been added: shared libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Friendly Tour of Process Memory on Linux&lt;/head&gt;- 24 mins&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Friendly Tour of Process Memory on Linux&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;You run a program. It reads and writes addresses as if a giant, continuous slab of memory had been waiting there all along. It didn’t. Linux builds that illusion on the fly, one page at a time. This is a walk through what your process actually owns, what happens on the first touch of a byte, how protections and huge pages fit in, how to see the truth from &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;, and why modern kernels do a little extra dance to defend against Meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: This tour targets Linux on x86‑64, other architectures differ in details (page sizes, cache rules), but the ideas carry over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Intro&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The picture below is a quick introduction. It is a simple map you can keep in mind as you read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical RAM is the real memory. It is a bunch of frames scattered around. The virtual view is the clean line your program sees. It does not match the real layout. The page table is a list. It tells which spot on the virtual line points to which frame in RAM. Disk is extra space the system can use when RAM is full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is how it plays out. When you read or write, the CPU looks in the page table. If there is an entry it goes to that frame. If there is no entry you get a page fault. The system then fills a frame and adds the entry, or it stops you with an error. We will explain faults later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When RAM is tight the system makes room. It moves pages you have not used in a while to disk, or drops file pages it can load again. If you touch one of those later it brings it back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainers appear throughout so anyone can follow along, regardless of background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;is a virtual filesystem the kernel builds in memory. It exposes process and kernel state as files. You can read them with normal tools like&lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The floor plan you never see&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the kernel, your process owns one object that represents its whole address space. Think of it as a floor plan. Each room on that plan is a virtual memory area (VMA) a contiguous range with the same permissions (read, write, execute) and the same kind of backing (anonymous memory or a file).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: VMA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;A VMA is a continuous virtual address range with one set of rights and one kind of backing.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the plan sit the page tables that the hardware reads to translate your virtual addresses to real page frames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: page tables and PTE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Page tables are lookup structures the CPU walks to translate addresses. A page table entry (PTE) maps one virtual page to one physical page and holds bits like present and writable.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All threads in the process share the same plan. When the scheduler runs you, the CPU is pointed at your page tables, so pointer dereferences don’t need a syscall once a mapping exists, the hardware does the translation on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You change the plan in three ways: &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt; draws a room, &lt;code&gt;mprotect&lt;/code&gt; changes the sign on its door (R/W/X), and &lt;code&gt;munmap&lt;/code&gt; tears it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;reserves a virtual range with given permissions and a backing source.&lt;lb/&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;code&gt;mprotect&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;mprotect&lt;/code&gt;changes the permissions on an existing range.&lt;lb/&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;code&gt;munmap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;munmap&lt;/code&gt;removes a mapping from the address space.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything else (creating pages, reading file data, swapping) happens lazily when you touch memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: page&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Hardware manages memory in fixed chunks called pages. On many x86‑64 machines a base page is 4 KiB. Bigger pages exist at 2 MiB and 1 GiB.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A quick glance at your own house&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run:&lt;code&gt;cat /proc/self/maps | sed -n '1,80p'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll see your main binary’s segments (code, data, bss), the heap, anonymous mappings (allocators use these for big chunks), shared libraries, and thread stacks near the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll typically also see two small regions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;[vdso]&lt;/code&gt;: a tiny shared object the kernel maps in so a few calls like&lt;code&gt;gettimeofday&lt;/code&gt;can run without a kernel trap.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;[vvar]&lt;/code&gt;: read‑only data those helpers use.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;vdso&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;vvar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;vdso&lt;/code&gt;is code the kernel maps into your process to make some syscalls fast.&lt;code&gt;vvar&lt;/code&gt;holds data that code reads.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re why asking the time is fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;, without the fog&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you call &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;, you’re not “allocating memory” so much as drawing a promise on the floor plan. You say give me a range of addresses with these rights and back it by this file plus offset or by anonymous memory. Linux picks an address, makes sure it doesn’t collide, adjusts VMAs so each remains uniform, and records the promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: ASLR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Address Space Layout Randomization places mappings at randomized locations to make exploits harder.&lt;lb/&gt;Tiny explainer: anonymous vs file mapping&lt;lb/&gt;Anonymous memory is not tied to a file and starts as zeros. File mappings mirror file contents.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does not allocate pages yet. That comes later at first touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two gotchas come up over and over:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;File mappings: &lt;code&gt;offset&lt;/code&gt;must be page aligned or&lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;returns&lt;code&gt;EINVAL&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Mapping past end of file is allowed, but touching beyond the true end raises &lt;code&gt;SIGBUS&lt;/code&gt;. The VMA exists, the data does not.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAP_PRIVATE&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;MAP_SHARED&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAP_SHARED&lt;/code&gt;means writes go back to the file and are visible to others that share it.&lt;code&gt;MAP_PRIVATE&lt;/code&gt;means you see the file but writes go to private copy‑on‑write pages.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anonymous mappings start life as zeroes. File mappings mirror the file. If the file ends mid page the tail of that last page reads as zeros but still belongs to the file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAP_FIXED&lt;/code&gt; means exactly here and it overwrites anything already mapped at that address. Prefer &lt;code&gt;MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE&lt;/code&gt; to fail instead of clobbering. Without either flag your &lt;code&gt;addr&lt;/code&gt; is just a hint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Ask for an exact address and fail if something is already there. Safer than overwriting.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The first touch&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine &lt;code&gt;*p = 42;&lt;/code&gt; to a fresh mapping. The CPU tries to translate the address. It finds no entry so it raises a page fault that includes the address and an error code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: page fault&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;A page fault is the CPU asking the kernel to handle a missing or illegal translation for an address.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kernel’s handler runs on your behalf and asks three questions in this order:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Is the address inside any VMA&lt;lb/&gt;If not you are poking a hole in the plan →&lt;code&gt;SIGSEGV&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Do the rights allow this access&lt;lb/&gt;Write to a read only page or execute from non exec →&lt;code&gt;SIGSEGV&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If it is valid but missing make it real&lt;lb/&gt;For an anonymous mapping the kernel allocates a zero filled physical page, wires a page table entry with your requested permissions, and returns to your instruction. For a file mapping it first checks the page cache. If the data is not in RAM it reads from storage, then installs the translation and retries your instruction. Your store lands. You keep going.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: page cache&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The page cache is the kernel’s cache of file data in RAM. File mappings read and write through it.&lt;lb/&gt;Tiny explainer: zero page&lt;lb/&gt;Some reads from fresh anonymous memory can be satisfied by a shared read only page of zeros. A private page is created on the first write.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;People count these faults:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;A minor fault means the data was already in RAM and only the translation was missing.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;A major fault means the kernel had to wait for I/O which is expensive.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: stack guard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;User stacks have a guard page. Touching just below the current stack can grow it. Touching far below looks like a bug and gets a&lt;code&gt;SIGSEGV&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This same lazy first touch explains how memory is shared after &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; and how &lt;code&gt;MAP_PRIVATE&lt;/code&gt; works. The next section shows that path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Copy on write with &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MAP_PRIVATE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why this is here. We just talked about first touch. The same rule explains why pages do not copy on &lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt; and why &lt;code&gt;MAP_PRIVATE&lt;/code&gt; does not change the file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt; does not duplicate pages. The child points at the same physical pages as the parent. The kernel flips those pages to read only for both. The first write hits a copy on write fault. The kernel allocates a new page, copies the bytes, updates the writer’s page table entry to the new page with write permission, and returns. Reads still share the original page. That is why RSS stays flat after &lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt; until you write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: RSS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Resident Set Size is how many pages of this process are currently in RAM. Tiny explainer: copy on write&lt;lb/&gt;Share the same page for reads. Make a private copy only when a write happens.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAP_PRIVATE&lt;/code&gt; uses the same idea. You read file data through the page cache. When you write, the kernel gives you a private page. The file stays unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things you will also run into:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt;then&lt;code&gt;execve&lt;/code&gt;. The child replaces its whole address space soon after. That avoids most CoW work.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;vfork&lt;/code&gt;. The child runs in the parent’s address space until it calls&lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;_exit&lt;/code&gt;. The parent waits. Do not touch memory in the child.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;clone&lt;/code&gt;with&lt;code&gt;CLONE_VM&lt;/code&gt;. This makes a thread. One address space. No copy.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAP_SHARED&lt;/code&gt;. Writes go to the shared page and to the file or shmem. No CoW.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;MADV_DONTFORK&lt;/code&gt;. Leave this mapping out of the child.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;MADV_WIPEONFORK&lt;/code&gt;. The child sees zeros for this mapping.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Transparent huge pages. Breaking CoW on a huge page may split it first. Small extra cost.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Changing rights, and the little pause you feel&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why you care. JITs and loaders flip a region from writable to executable after codegen which is W^X. That flip is not free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: W^X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Write xor Execute is a policy. A page is never writable and executable at the same time.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mprotect(addr, len, prot)&lt;/code&gt; changes permissions. Internally the kernel may split VMAs so each remains uniform, edits the page table entries for the range, and then does one more necessary thing. It invalidates old translations from the CPU’s small cache of address translations which is the TLB. That invalidation is the small pause you sometimes feel when a JIT flips RW to RX or back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: TLB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The Translation Lookaside Buffer caches recent translations so the CPU does not walk page tables every time.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most systems enforce W^X. A page should not be writable and executable at the same time. JITs keep to that by flipping after codegen or by keeping two virtual mappings of the same memory so no single mapping is both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember there are two layers of permission checks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Filesystem or mount policy like &lt;code&gt;noexec&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Page permissions like &lt;code&gt;PROT_EXEC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either layer can block execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Seeing what’s really mapped&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;For everyday questions the friendly view is enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/maps&lt;/code&gt;shapes: addresses, rights, file names&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/smaps&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;smaps_rollup&lt;/code&gt;add per region accounting like how much is resident which is RSS, private vs shared, and whether huge pages were used like&lt;code&gt;AnonHugePages&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;FilePmdMapped&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you need truth at the per page level Linux exposes sharper tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/pagemap&lt;/code&gt; has one 64 bit entry per virtual page. It tells you whether a page is present, swapped, soft dirty, exclusively mapped with caveats for huge pages, whether it is write protected via userfaultfd, or part of a guard region. It can also reveal the page frame number which is PFN but modern kernels hide PFNs from unprivileged users. You need the right capability or root.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: PFN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Page Frame Number is the physical page index used inside the kernel. Tiny explainer: userfaultfd&lt;lb/&gt;A file descriptor that lets a userspace thread handle faults and write protect events for a range.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc/kpagecount&lt;/code&gt; is indexed by PFN and tells you how many mappings point at a given physical page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc/kpageflags&lt;/code&gt; is also indexed by PFN and tells you what kind of page it is and what is happening to it like anonymous or file backed, part of a transparent huge page, in the LRU, dirty, under writeback, a page table page, or the shared zero page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Common wrinkles&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Sparse files. To tell hole vs data, combine &lt;code&gt;mincore()&lt;/code&gt;which says resident or not with&lt;code&gt;lseek(..., SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE)&lt;/code&gt;on the backing file.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Shared memory and swap. Shared and shmem pages may be non present at the PTE level while still logically allocated. Expect swap entries and non present PTEs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Privileges. Modern kernels restrict PFN and some flag visibility to privileged users for security.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mincore&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;mincore&lt;/code&gt;tells you which pages of a mapping are in RAM.&lt;lb/&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;code&gt;SEEK_DATA&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;SEEK_HOLE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;File offsets that let you skip to the next data chunk or the next hole in a sparse file.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: soft dirty vs written&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Soft dirty marks pages dirtied by userland but it can get lost across swaps or VMA merges. Newer kernels offer an ioctl named&lt;code&gt;PAGEMAP_SCAN&lt;/code&gt;that scans a range for pages written since last write protect and can in the same step write protect them again. It pairs with userfaultfd write protect to give fast and race free userspace dirty tracking for snapshotting and live migration.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When your page suddenly gets bigger&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your CPU would rather cover more ground with fewer entries in its TLB. Linux can help by backing hot memory with bigger pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: THP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Transparent Huge Pages automatically try to use larger pages for performance when safe.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transparent Huge Pages do this automatically for anonymous memory and shmem or tmpfs. A fault can be satisfied with a 2 MiB page instead of 512 small ones. A background thread named khugepaged can also collapse adjacent base pages into a huge page when it is safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;khugepaged&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;A kernel thread that scans and merges adjacent small pages into huge pages when conditions are right.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern kernels add multi size THP which is mTHP on some architectures. Groups of base pages like 16 KiB or 64 KiB reduce fault count and TLB pressure without always jumping to 2 MiB. They are still PTE mapped but behave as larger folios inside the VM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: mTHP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Multi size THP allows variable order large folios so you get some of the benefit without a full 2 MiB page.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can ask for THP in a region with &lt;code&gt;madvise(..., MADV_HUGEPAGE)&lt;/code&gt; or opt out with &lt;code&gt;MADV_NOHUGEPAGE&lt;/code&gt;. System wide behavior lives under &lt;code&gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/&lt;/code&gt; with per size controls. &lt;code&gt;enabled&lt;/code&gt; can be &lt;code&gt;always&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;madvise&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;never&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;inherit&lt;/code&gt;. Shmem or tmpfs have their own knobs like a &lt;code&gt;huge=&lt;/code&gt; mount option with &lt;code&gt;always&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;advise&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;within_size&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;never&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to tell if it worked. In &lt;code&gt;/proc/self/smaps&lt;/code&gt; the lines for a region include &lt;code&gt;AnonHugePages&lt;/code&gt; for anonymous THP and &lt;code&gt;FilePmdMapped&lt;/code&gt; for file or shmem huge mappings. System wide &lt;code&gt;/proc/meminfo&lt;/code&gt; has &lt;code&gt;AnonHugePages&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ShmemPmdMapped&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ShmemHugePages&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;/proc/vmstat&lt;/code&gt; keeps a diary of THP events allocated on fault, fell back, split, swapped as a whole, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controls plain map:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Top level: &lt;code&gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled&lt;/code&gt;which is&lt;code&gt;always&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;madvise&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;never&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Defrag effort: &lt;code&gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag&lt;/code&gt;tunes how hard the kernel tries on the fault path vs deferring to khugepaged&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Shmem or tmpfs: &lt;code&gt;huge=always|within_size|advise|never&lt;/code&gt;plus shmem specific knobs&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern kernels may also create variable order large folios that are bigger than 4 KiB but PTE mapped not full 2 MiB PMD. This reduces fault count and TLB pressure without always jumping to 2 MiB. Behavior differs by kernel and architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One trade off. Assembling a huge page may require compaction which moves other pages to free a contiguous chunk and this can add a small pause. If first touch latency matters more than steady state speed the defrag knob lets you temper how hard the kernel tries which pushes work to khugepaged instead of doing it inline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: THP vs hugetlbfs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;THP is automatic and pageable. Explicit huge pages from&lt;code&gt;MAP_HUGETLB&lt;/code&gt;or hugetlbfs are quota managed and non swap.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dirty‑tracking in userspace, without racing the kernel&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you want to copy only the pages an application modified since your last snapshot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Give yourself the ability to catch write protect faults with userfaultfd in write protect mode.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;PAGEMAP_SCAN&lt;/code&gt;over your range with the category written since last write protect. Ask the kernel to write protect matching pages and to return compact ranges of what it found.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Copy those ranges. When the app later writes to one of them userfaultfd wakes your thread. Log the dirtied page, clear write protect, and let it proceed.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;This avoids walking every PTE and avoids the classic race where a page is dirtied while you were looking. It is also fast because scan plus write protect happens as one atomic operation inside the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;PAGEMAP_SCAN&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;An ioctl that scans a virtual range for pages with properties like written since last protect and can also apply write protect in the same step.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The TLB, and why &lt;code&gt;mprotect&lt;/code&gt; costs a little&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Translation Lookaside Buffer remembers recent translations so the CPU does not walk page tables on every access. If Linux changes a mapping or its permissions it must make sure stale entries are not used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On x86 there are two broad ways to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Precise invalidation. Invalidate one page at a time with &lt;code&gt;INVLPG&lt;/code&gt;. Good for small changes. A single invalidation on a huge page mapping drops the whole 2 MiB entry.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Broader flushes. Drop many or all entries for example by reloading the page table root register. Fewer instructions now and more misses later while refilling.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is better depends on how big a change you made, whether you are changing small or huge pages, and the microarchitecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: PCID&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Process Context Identifiers tag TLB entries so switching page tables does not flush everything.&lt;lb/&gt;Tiny explainer: INVPCID&lt;lb/&gt;Allows targeted invalidation of TLB entries for a given tag without switching to it.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a debug knob on some x86 builds named &lt;code&gt;tlb_single_page_flush_ceiling&lt;/code&gt; that nudges when the kernel switches from per page invalidations to a broad flush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;INVLPG&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;A privileged instruction that invalidates TLB entries for the page containing a given address in the current address space tag.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Meltdown, and why the kernel sometimes switches maps on entry&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early 2018 brought Meltdown. Speculative execution plus a cache side channel could leak data across the user and kernel boundary. Even if a user mode load from a kernel address would fault, the CPU might speculatively execute it and touch data that leaves a measurable cache trace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux’s defense on x86‑64 is Page Table Isolation which is PTI. Keep two views and switch between them on entry and exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: CR3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;CR3 holds the current page table root and on x86 switching it changes the active address space.&lt;lb/&gt;Tiny explainer: PTI&lt;lb/&gt;PTI keeps a reduced userspace view without normal kernel data mapped and a full kernel view used while in the kernel.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost. More page table switches, different TLB sharing behavior, and a small memory bump for extra top level tables and the per CPU entry area. With PCID Linux keeps separate TLB tags for the two views to reduce flushes. Some systems allow opting out with &lt;code&gt;nopti&lt;/code&gt; when acceptable. Default is on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: what Meltdown reads&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Permissions never turn off. The architectural access still faults. The leak is in transient speculation which leaves a timing trace.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How the kernel changes mappings safely&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Linux edits page tables the order is deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Handle cache rules first on architectures that need it.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modify page tables by adding, removing, or changing PTEs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Invalidate the TLB so the CPU forgets stale translations.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the hood are functions that match the granularity of the change like flush an address space, flush a range, or flush a single page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a parallel story for kernel only mappings made with &lt;code&gt;vmap&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;vmalloc&lt;/code&gt;. Before I/O the kernel flushes the vmap range so the physical page sees the latest bytes. After I/O it invalidates the vmap range so speculative reads do not go stale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;vmap&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;vmalloc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;APIs that create kernel virtual mappings to non contiguous physical pages for use inside the kernel.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On x86 you rarely think about the instruction cache because it is coherent with data stores. On others, copying code into executable memory requires an explicit instruction cache flush before running it. The VM has hooks like &lt;code&gt;copy_to_user_page&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;flush_icache_range&lt;/code&gt; where architectures do this housekeeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: icache flush&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Some CPUs need an instruction cache sync after writing new code so execution sees the new bytes.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A tiny x86 aside: stacks and calls, without the haze&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 64 bit mode registers wear an R. &lt;code&gt;RIP&lt;/code&gt; is the instruction pointer, &lt;code&gt;RSP&lt;/code&gt; is the stack, &lt;code&gt;RBP&lt;/code&gt; is the frame. The stack grows down. &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt; decrements &lt;code&gt;RSP&lt;/code&gt; and stores. &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt; loads then increments. &lt;code&gt;CALL&lt;/code&gt; pushes the return address and jumps. &lt;code&gt;RET&lt;/code&gt; pops it into &lt;code&gt;RIP&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Linux the System V AMD64 ABI passes the first arguments in registers which are &lt;code&gt;RDI&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RSI&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RDX&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RCX&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;R8&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;R9&lt;/code&gt; and returns values in &lt;code&gt;RAX&lt;/code&gt;. Large objects go by pointer. Your stack must be readable and writable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: System V AMD64 ABI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The calling convention for 64 bit Unix like systems on x86‑64 that defines where arguments and return values go.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;User code runs in ring 3. The kernel runs in ring 0. Crossings like syscalls, interrupts, and exceptions go through CPU defined gates. In 64 bit mode Linux uses a flat segmentation model and relies on paging for isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: rings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Rings are CPU privilege levels. Ring 3 is user mode. Ring 0 is kernel mode.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny note for ARM64 readers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The ideas like stack growth and user vs kernel separation are similar. Register names, calling conventions, and syscall entry differ.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When things go sideways (and what that usually means)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;→&lt;code&gt;EINVAL&lt;/code&gt;often a misaligned file&lt;code&gt;offset&lt;/code&gt;which must be page aligned or an impossible flag combo&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;→&lt;code&gt;ENOMEM&lt;/code&gt;you may be out of virtual space or VMA count or you hit strict overcommit&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Store to a file mapping → &lt;code&gt;SIGBUS&lt;/code&gt;you walked past EOF. The VMA existed, the data did not&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;mprotect(PROT_EXEC)&lt;/code&gt;→&lt;code&gt;EACCES&lt;/code&gt;could be a&lt;code&gt;noexec&lt;/code&gt;mount or a W^X policy&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Big &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;creates a new line in&lt;code&gt;maps&lt;/code&gt;your allocator used&lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;for that size&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;RSS balloons after &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt;copy on write did its job and you wrote to lots of shared pages&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Accidentally clobbered a mapping you probably used &lt;code&gt;MAP_FIXED&lt;/code&gt;. Prefer&lt;code&gt;MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE&lt;/code&gt;to fail instead of overwrite&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it is mysterious, look. Start friendly with &lt;code&gt;smaps_rollup&lt;/code&gt; for the big picture and &lt;code&gt;maps&lt;/code&gt; for shapes. Drop to &lt;code&gt;pagemap&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;kpage*&lt;/code&gt; files only when you truly need per page truth and expect to need privileges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A small checklist to keep nearby&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Need memory now. &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;anonymous with&lt;code&gt;PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Generating code.

Touching beyond real EOF is&lt;code&gt;SIGBUS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Lots of major faults. Nudge the kernel with &lt;code&gt;MADV_WILLNEED&lt;/code&gt;or touch earlier. Watch page cache and storage&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Where did memory go. Start with &lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/smaps_rollup&lt;/code&gt;then&lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/maps&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Forking big processes. Expect CoW.

    &lt;p&gt;UnitedHealth Group pays its own physician practices much more than it pays competing practices, a new study finds, reinforcing STAT’s own analysis on the subject and presenting fresh evidence that the conglomerate may be skirting a rule designed to curb health insurer profits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UnitedHealth’s insurance arm, UnitedHealthcare, pays practices under its UnitedHealth-owned Optum umbrella 17% more on average for common services than it pays non-Optum practices in the same region, according to the study, published today in Health Affairs. In areas where its insurance arm has a large market share, it pays Optum practices 61% more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study’s lead author, Daniel Arnold, said his research was inspired in part by STAT’s reporting from last year, which found that UnitedHealthcare paid 13 of 16 Optum practices more than others in the same market, ranging from as little as 3% more to 111% more. UnitedHealth paid the other 3 practices less than the market average. UnitedHealth paid roughly two times the market average for some common services, STAT found.&lt;/p&gt;
