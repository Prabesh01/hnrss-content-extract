    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I just want working RCS messaging&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m in over a month now with non-working RCS on my iPhone 15 Pro. Apple blames the carriers, the carriers tell me it’s not them (mostly T-Mobile since I have good contacts there). They tell me they can’t really do anything about iPhones not working on RCS, go back to Apple. This is what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, it’s probably Apple or Google and there’s zero accountability from Apple. I have AppleCare+ and really hoped they’d actually try to troubleshoot and fix this rather than waste my time working around it (in a stupidly expensive way for me and Apple).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;My background #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m OS agnostic as much as possible, I daily both Android and iOS devices and previously used BlackBerry 10 and Harmattan (Nokia N9’s OS). If Windows Phone was still around I’d probably still be running that as well. If it’s possible to gather information on how all this works under the hood, I can and do. The OnePlus Android devices I’m running are my own LineageOS builds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Previous history fixing MMS failures for Carriers/Vendors #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m also happy to blame carriers and vendors: I previously brought and helped resolve an issue with Verizon Wireless on LineageOS phones due to how MMS messaging works. Here’s my initial submission, their developer LuK found a better way to go about it, but it at least started the ball rolling: https://review.lineageos.org/c/LineageOS/android_device_oneplus_sm8250-common/+/333379&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short: When you received a picture message on Verizon in the past their network would notify your device that a new message arrived. When the device went to grab and download the image, it sends something similar to browser User Agent, called a UAProf. This is a link to a file that describes what the phone can handle, so a smartphone gets a high resolution image and a featurephone gets a lower resolution one. Verizon’s management sucks and decommissioned the domain that hosts all the UAProfs for their devices. Of note, Verizon is uniquely affected by this issue, T-Mobile doesn’t care what UAProf a device advertises, it’s not required on their network. I haven’t done enough testing with AT&amp;amp;T to answer whether it’s an issue for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;MMS Failure Demonstrations #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a former link to a Verizon UAProf for a Samsung device: http://uaprof.vtext.com/sam/i515/i515.xml&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice it doesn’t load? Apple/Blackberry and basically any non-Android manufacturers didn’t trust carriers to host these files. Some manager at Verizon decided to kill the vtext service and also fucked over any MMS users on their network not using an iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s Apple’s: https://www.apple.com/mms/uaprof.rdf. &lt;lb/&gt; And here’s Blackberry’s: https://www.blackberry.com/go/mobile/profiles/uaprof/9700/5.0.0.rdf&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m getting off-topic though, I just wanted to post some context that this is not my first rodeo with fixing these kinds of issues. Carriers are incompetent with this sort of interoperability and they gave up on running their own RCS servers to let Google do it through something called Google Jibe, I’ll talk about that soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Google breaking RCS on LineageOS #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting around the end of 2023, Google started to maliciously break RCS for custom Android OS’s. I say maliciously because it was a silent failure, RCS reported as working, but messages wouldn’t go through, and incoming messages would fail to receive. Google could have remained silent about it and rumors probably would have swirled: Perhaps it was a technical issue or the custom ROM developers’ faults?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, Google intentionally broke it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They straight up admitted to blocking it: https://www.androidauthority.com/google-silently-blocking-rcs-rooted-android-phones-custom-roms-3421652/ and it wasn’t until months later that they even showed a notification that it was disabled on affected devices. I really hope some lawyer or regulator reading this will get to extract their pound of blood because Google loves to boast about doing 911 over RCS: https://blog.google/products/messages/google-messages-rcs-911-emergency/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually for my own devices I would spoof to the fingerprint of Google PIxel devices to be able to use RCS. It has mostly continued to work since then, but it begs the question: If I could reliably work around the blocking, then what excuse do you have about it being to prevent spam? Since those spammers will just use the same methods I’ve used, which are hardly secret. It just aims to hurt users that want some control of their device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Apple launches RCS #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At some point Apple was dragged kicking and screaming into RCS interoperability. I actually have some sympathy here because MMS was really a terrible protocol that nobody should have adopted and Apple was dragged into supporting that years after the original iPhone launch in iOS 3. Regardless, with iOS 18, Apple brought in baseline RCS (version 2.4) support. It is hoped that they will update it sometime in the iOS 26 series to include E2E encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;My iPhone Background, Start of RCS Issues #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RCS always worked on my phone in iOS 18 until the past month when I upgraded to iOS 26. I should note that unlike Android, I do not modify iOS device in any way, basically I expect it should ‘just work’. The only unusual thing I run is Mullvad’s DNS to act as an adblocker, but so does my family and their iDevices don’t have RCS issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a dual-sim user on T-Mobile and US Mobile (usually on the AT&amp;amp;T network). With iOS 26 both lines have been stuck on “Waiting for activation…”. If I transfer the lines off to any other iPhone, the lines activate in seconds. I additionally took a Verizon Wireless line from my Mom’s 14 Pro Max and it also displayed the same issue. My girlfriend has a 14 Pro Max and a SE3, both can activate my RCS lines when I transfer them over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Troubleshooting Steps I Did #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve done an absolutely exhaustive level of testing to see if these lines would activate on my phone, there’s probably more than this but this is what I could think of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rebooted/Toggled Airplane Mode/Toggled RCS&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Resetting Network Settings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Removed all my VPN profiles and apps. (Mullvad/Orbot/Mullvad’s DNS profile/my server’s wireguard profile)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Deactivated one of my lines and tried reactivating RCS.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disabling 5G and trying to activate RCS.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reissuing both eSIM’s from the carriers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Toggling iMessage.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Resetting All settings 9 Resetting everything on device. &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Restoring from iTunes backup&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Restoring from iCloud backup (literally activated a trial to be able to do this)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Tested resetting with and without eSIM.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recovering device (recovery mode, setting up as new device) &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Both with and without eSIM’s on device.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disabling RCS and waiting days before attempting to reactivate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Updating my e911 addresses, disabling/renabling wifi calling. Testing on Wifi.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reissuing just T-Mobile eSIM but to the other IMEI on the phone that it’s normally not on.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Deleting the numbers out numerous times in Carrier settings (I have no idea what this does but it does make the signal reconnect).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Testing sending messages from devices that work with RCS to this device in hopes it upgrades.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Testing the iOS beta releases.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I brought up the Gentoo Linux packages for libimobiledevice so I could run idevicesyslog and dump hundreds of megabytes of live logs in hopes of being able to see what the phone is failing on: (the packages) https://github.com/joecool1029/joecool-overlay/tree/master/app-pda &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;This is a small T-Mobile related excerpt of what looks like the problem could be. Specifically, UserInteractionRequired.xml. I don’t know what interaction is needed and why Apple’s software isn’t presenting more information, but this is the best I could do from digging through a ton of redacted logs: &lt;code&gt;Nov 9 15:54:14.294398 CommCenter[101] &amp;lt;Debug&amp;gt;: #D supportsHOVirtualInterfaces: ret = false Nov 9 15:54:14.294406 CommCenter[101] &amp;lt;Notice&amp;gt;: #I --&amp;gt; switch: true, bundle_support: false, entitlement_support: true, enabled_by_default: true, disabled_by_profile: false, is_store_demo_device: false Nov 9 15:54:14.294415 CommCenter[101] &amp;lt;Debug&amp;gt;: #D supportsHOVirtualInterfaces: ret = false Nov 9 15:54:14.294424 CommCenter[101] &amp;lt;Notice&amp;gt;: #I --&amp;gt; encryption_supported: false, push_supported: false, push_enabled: false, private_relay_supported: false, msisdn_source: (empty) Nov 9 15:54:14.294432 CommCenter[101] &amp;lt;Debug&amp;gt;: #D supportsHOVirtualInterfaces: ret = false Nov 9 15:54:14.294440 CommCenter[101] &amp;lt;Notice&amp;gt;: #I --&amp;gt; Changed: (nothing) Nov 9 15:54:14.294448 CommCenter[101] &amp;lt;Debug&amp;gt;: #D supportsHOVirtualInterfaces: ret = false Nov 9 15:54:14.294455 CommCenter[101] &amp;lt;Notice&amp;gt;: #I Ims registration interface: kUnknown --&amp;gt; kCellular Nov 9 15:54:14.294463 CommCenter[101] &amp;lt;Debug&amp;gt;: #D supportsHOVirtualInterfaces: ret = false Nov 9 15:54:14.294471 CommCenter[101] &amp;lt;Notice&amp;gt;: #I Lazuli model not allowed: [provisioning style: kUsingToken, sms online: false, msisdn OK: true] Nov 9 15:54:14.294479 CommCenter[101] &amp;lt;Debug&amp;gt;: #D supportsHOVirtualInterfaces: ret = false Nov 9 15:54:14.294487 CommCenter[101] &amp;lt;Notice&amp;gt;: #I Provisioning not possible Nov 9 15:54:14.294494 CommCenter[101] &amp;lt;Debug&amp;gt;: #D supportsHOVirtualInterfaces: ret = false Nov 9 15:54:14.294505 CommCenter[101] &amp;lt;Notice&amp;gt;: #I Infinite validity of UserInteractionRequired.xml xml Nov 9 15:54:14.294514 CommCenter[101] &amp;lt;Notice&amp;gt;: #I [config.rcs.mnc260.mcc310.jibecloud.net] Declaring IMS not ready.

      &lt;item&gt;This is a small T-Mobile related excerpt of what looks like the problem could be. Specifically, UserInteractionRequired.xml. I don’t know what interaction is needed and why Apple’s software isn’t presenting more information, but this is the best I could do from digging through a ton of redacted logs: &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So this last entry probably tells us where to look. The carrier (T-Mobile here) is provisioned for RCS, it’s receiving this interaction required file with infinite validity. So long as that’s in place, it fails to activate. (This is a guess, but it’s certainly more information than the KB articles give on Apple’s sites).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Apple does not provide their employees with correct information on troubleshooting this issue. They do not empower them to properly troubleshoot the issue. #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard instruction given to them is: “Do not take accountability, blame the carrier.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So then I come in and say I have failures with all 3 major carriers and categorically refuse to accept that explanation, when I know my lines work just fine on other iDevices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Apple Store initially blamed software, this would be reasonable except we’ve reloaded the state of my phone 3 times now (once from iTunes, and twice now from iCloud, tomorrow will be the 4th time). I gave them permission to wipe any setting and recover the phone, but I go a step further and request they transfer my T-Mobile eSIM to another store device preferably in the 15 Pro line. They cannot do this because of user privacy reasons. This is a dealbreaker from troubleshooting, I am not made of money and I do not have any additional 15 pro devices to test with, it’s already crazy enough I have multiple carriers at the ready to test, 2 14 Pro Max’s and a SE3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Google Jibe #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think this is where we need information. As I said before, the carriers in the US gave up running their own RCS infrastructure and Apple’s employees aren’t really trained about this situation. With the exception of my own knowledge and the logs I pulled from the phone, Jibe was not mentioned once in the 3 phone calls and the multiple hours onsite in Apple Store today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have no business relationship with Google Jibe, and there’s no way for me to interact with or contact them. Their documentation is probably here but I can’t read it, since I’m not a carrier partner: https://docs.jibemobile.com/ Apple knows there’s a ‘carrier’ issue, but in reality, RCS is run through Google Jibe in the US and this was never once disclosed to me. I never brought it up until this blog post, I cannot go into a store and say “I have been using opensource tools to analyze the logs from this phone and think it’s a failure with Jibe”. Do you get how crazy this sounds?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What Apple’s Going To Do Tomorrow #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since they hit a wall and I refuse to continue to entertain the “go bug T-Mobile/US Mobile” direction, Apple is swapping the board in my phone. Of course they didn’t have the parts in the store to do it, so I have to wait to drive back tomorrow for them to do it. This will have new IMEI numbers and given the experience I’ve had with these lines activating on 3 other iDevices, it should probably work. The only way it wouldn’t is if this was a generational issue, but they have not given me a way to test this. They adamantly tell me: “We are doing you the favor as a courtesy, we don’t believe this is our problem.” I know they are trained to say this but it’s terrible customer service. I shelled out for Applecare+, if it might be the phone just swap it and analyze it back at Apple HQ, I’ve done enough testing now to know it’s something with just this specific device. I referred people to use iPhones because in general they do not often have these issues and the customer support was good. The board swap solution they are offering only wastes my time/fuel and punts the problem down the road. Since we never actually looked at the logs I might hit it again, other users might be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I’d rather Apple actually fix the problem #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use opensource software not because it’s inherently better, but rather because I can at least triage, understand, and fix problems. Give me a radar Apple. I’m a rare dual-SIM user in the US with a Google Jibe RCS failure. Where did it fail? Dig into my logs and tell me: Is it because I hop between primary data carriers (because the whole reason I have dual-carrier is better service coverage). I don’t spend a lot of time on WiFI, I run my house on mobile carriers. The only thing I know is I didn’t change my configuration from iOS 18 to iOS 26, but things stopped working and there’s no way for me to downgrade to 18 because you stopped signing it!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While thinking-aware generation aims to improve performance on complex tasks, we identify a critical failure mode where existing sequential, autoregressive approaches can paradoxically degrade performance due to error propagation. To systematically analyze this issue, we propose ParaBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis using ParaBench reveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image. To resolve this, we propose a parallel multimodal diffusion framework that enables continuous, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory. This model, MMaDA-Parallel, is trained with supervised finetuning and then further optimized by Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL), a novel strategy that applies semantic rewards along the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency. Experiments validate that our approach significantly improves cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency, achieving a 6.9% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench compared to the state-of-the-art model, Bagel, establishing a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Architecture of MMaDA-Parallel. During Training, image and text responses are masked and predicted in parallel with a uniform mask predictor. During Sampling, the model performs parallel decoding to generate both image and text responses jointly, enabling continuous cross-modal interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;[2025-11-11] We release our codes and models for MMaDA-Parallel, with two released 8B models MMaDA-Parallel-A and MMaDA-Parallel-M.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;[2025-11-10] We release our research paper for Parallel Multimodal Large Diffusion Language Models for Thinking-Aware Editing and Generation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: Our model has been successfully validated on synthetic datasets focusing on environments, still life, architecture, and natural landscapes. Its performance on out-of-distribution inputs—such as human faces or real-world photographic imagery—has not yet been fully explored. We are actively expanding our training corpus to include more diverse datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, start with a torch environment with torch 2.3.1 or higher version, then install the following dependencies:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install -r requirements.txt
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We provide two varients of MMaDA-Parallel with different tokenizers. MMaDA-Parallel-A is trained with tokenizer Amused-VQ, and MMaDA-Parallel-M is trained with tokenizer Magvitv2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can directly use the local gradio app to experience the parallel generation with MMaDA-Parallel-A:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;python app.py&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or you can use the inference script to generate the parallel generation results:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd MMaDA-Parallel-A
python inference.py \
    --checkpoint tyfeld/MMaDA-Parallel-A \
    --vae_ckpt tyfeld/MMaDA-Parallel-A \

    &lt;code&gt;cd MMaDA-Parallel-M
python inference.py interleave_root=./interleave_validation  &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Release the MMaDA-Parallel code and paper.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Evaluation on ParaBench code.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Refine MMaDA-Parallel-M and update the corresponding checkpoint.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I've been using AWS since around 2007. Back then, EC2 storage was entirely ephemeral and stopping an instance meant losing all your data. The platform has come a long way since then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even after nearly two decades with the platform, there's always something new to learn. And sometimes those lessons come with a $1,000 price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recently moved over to using S3 for mirroring some large internal data files for Geocodio. We're talking about geographic datasets (things like address points, boundary data, and census information) that range from a few gigabytes to hundreds of gigabytes each. Some of these files are updated almost daily with fresh data, while others are refreshed less frequently. They need to be synced regularly from our ETL platform (which is hosted with Hetzner) to our processing infrastructure on AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AWS has notoriously high data transfer costs. Cloudflare has written extensively about this, and it's a common complaint across the industry. Corey Quinn from Last Week in AWS has also called out the AWS Managed NAT Gateway for being particularly expensive. AWS charges $0.09 per GB for data transfer out to the internet from most regions, which adds up fast when you're moving terabytes of data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So before starting this project, I did my homework. I carefully researched the costs involved and confirmed two critical things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great! I had a clear picture of the costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;...Or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few days after deploying the new S3 sync process, I got a notification from AWS Cost Anomaly Detection. (Boy, was I happy that I had that enabled!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alert showed something alarming: 20,167.32 GB of "NAT Gateway" data transfers in a single day, which amounted to $907.53.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Month to date, this had already surpassed $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I stared at the dashboard in disbelief. How could this be happening? I had specifically confirmed that EC2-to-S3 transfers were free!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After some frantic investigating (and a bit of panic), I discovered the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you're using VPCs with a NAT Gateway (which most production AWS setups do), S3 transfers still go through the NAT Gateway by default. Even though you're making requests to an AWS service that's in the same region, the traffic is routed out through your NAT Gateway and back in, incurring data transfer charges at $0.045 per GB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution? VPC Endpoints for S3, specifically what AWS calls a "Gateway Endpoint."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Gateway Endpoint is a special type of VPC endpoint that allows you to privately route traffic to S3 without going through your NAT Gateway or Internet Gateway. It's essentially a direct pipe from your VPC to S3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even better, Gateway Endpoints for S3 are completely free. No hourly charges, no data transfer charges. Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution is to create a VPC Gateway Endpoint for S3. This is a special type of VPC endpoint that creates a direct route from your VPC to S3, bypassing the NAT Gateway entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our case, we manage infrastructure with Terraform, so it was just a matter of adding the Gateway Endpoint resource and associating it with our route tables. AWS automatically handles the routing updates to direct S3 traffic through the endpoint instead of the NAT Gateway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've built countless VPCs, configured security groups, set up load balancers, and optimized costs in dozens of ways over the years. But somehow, VPC Endpoints for S3 had slipped through the cracks of my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AWS's networking can be deceptively complex. Even when you think you've done your research and confirmed the costs, there are layers of configuration that can dramatically change your bill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't make my mistake. Here are a few things I'd suggest checking to help you avoid your own surprise $1,000 bill:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AWS Cost Anomaly Detection is worth setting up. It caught this issue within days, saving us from an even larger surprise at the end of the month. If you haven't enabled it yet, do it now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VPC Endpoints are your friend. If you're using S3 or DynamoDB from EC2 instances in a VPC with a NAT Gateway, you absolutely need Gateway Endpoints. There's literally no reason not to use them. They're free and improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Always validate your assumptions. I thought "EC2 to S3 is free" was enough. I should have tested with a small amount of data and monitored the costs before scaling up to terabytes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cloud is complicated. There's always more to learn, even after nearly two decades. And that's okay. It just means we need to be careful and vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we're not alone in this. Just last year, Recall.ai discovered they were paying $1M annually in unexpected AWS WebSocket data processing fees. Even experienced teams hit these surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've since audited our entire AWS infrastructure to make sure we have Gateway Endpoints configured for all VPCs that communicate with S3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're using AWS and you haven't checked your VPC Endpoint configuration lately, I'd recommend taking a look. That $1,000 lesson doesn't need to be repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: NAT Gateways charge for ALL data processing, even for traffic to AWS services like S3 that have no data transfer fees. Use VPC Endpoints to bypass this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What Killed Perl?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trick question! Perl is not dead. I’ll show you what I mean, and then still answer what I think killed Perl.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cpan Report 2023 put together by Neil Bowers quite clearly illustrates that Perl’s popularity is somewhere in the same range it was during the dotcom bubble.1 I realise cpan usage isn’t a perfect proxy. There are probably a lot of people like me who use Perl specifically for things where they don’t need to interact with third-party libraries. These wouldn’t show up in the cpan records either, obviously. But it’s the best proxy I have. If anything, it’s higher: popularity increased ever so slightly after 2022, as next year’s cpan report will show. (Neil says he will publish it in January, so follow his blog for the latest news.) But it is also clear that newcomers make up a decreasing portion of the Perl crowd, and this has been the case since 2011. Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some people seem to think Raku (formerly known as “Perl 6”) sucked momentum out of Perl, but I don’t believe that. Everyone I talked to back then knew Perl wasn’t going anywhere. Humanity had chained too much of the infrastructure of the growing internet to it. Even if Raku turned out to be a wild success, someone would have to keep maintaining Perl for many years to come. There was never any danger of obsolescence in starting a new project in Perl.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Besides, Raku was first announced in 2000, and the major burst of activity around Raku implementations seems to have been at the end of that decade. Through that period, Perl grew rapidly, as indicated by the graph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still struggle to understand why Perl went out of favour, which is understandable if you know what I think about it. But I have heard two reasons that resonate with me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The people who grew up on Unixy systems in the 1990s and early 2000s would know shell, C, awk, sed, Vim, etc. To these people, Perl is a natural extension of what they were already doing. Then in the 2000s came a new generation of programmers brought up on … I don’t know, Microsoft systems, Visual Basic and Java? These people were more attracted to something like Python as a second language, which then became popular enough to become the first language of the generation after that.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Back when people learned Perl, you didn’t just go online and download development tools for a programming language on a whim. Binary package managers that chase down dependencies on their own weren’t a thing until the early 2000s, I think? And even then they didn’t have all that many packages. So even if, I don’t know, Oberon or Eiffel would be a better fit for someone in the 1990s, they might have opted to go with Perl anyway because that was what they had. These days, this is not as much of a problem anymore.2 You’ll find that the invention of many of the popular languages of today, such as Rust, Kotlin, Elixir, TypeScript, and Go happen to coincide with the growth of the internet and increased power of package managers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So to state my hypothesis briefly: people today are both less predisposed to understand Perl, and have easy access to so many other alternatives. It’s a rather unsatisfactory explanation, but it’s the closest I can get.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Learning to boot from PXE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Posted on&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bought a new laptop, the GPD Pocket 4. It came with windows installed by default, and I wanted to install nix on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I grabbed a usb, &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt;'d the nixos iso image on it and tried to boot.
The laptop did not recognize the drive.
Turns out, the drive crapped out, no computer would boot off it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The normal thing to do would've been to just go get a new usb and install off of and go about setting the laptop up. That meant I would either have to go outside or wait for a new usb to arrive. I don't want to outside and I don't want to wait to setup my laptop. I have free time now and I have no clue when I will have free time next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The menu had two other boot options. Something about PXE over ipv4 or ipv6. I only knew that PXE allowed networked boot. So hey, let's use this time to learn something new.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;# DHCP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I've learned, the first half of this process is DHCP. When a device is connected to the network it sends out a "HEY GIVE ME AN IP" message (I don't actually know how it works and didn't bother to look it up). Then your DHCP service see's this message and responds back with an IP. As part of these requests the client and server can set "options" on these requests which can send additional information. I don't know what the client sets first, but I do know the server needs to set a boot file name and location of a TFTP server. TFTP sort of like FTP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PXE reads the boot file (usually something.pxe) from the TFTP server and then executes its code. Other boot files are then retrieved as needed from the TFTP server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While learning this, folks on the internet dont seem too fond of TFTP, saying it could be slow. There exists iPXE which is supposed to be a better PXE. PXE (like bioses), tend to be manufacturer specific and are not created equal. iPXE tries to be better and supports a bunch of other stuff like (like booting from an ISO, and talking in HTTP). So if this all goes well i get iPXE going, point it to the iso I've already downloaded and I'm off to the races!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert, I didn't get to the races.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get iPXE running, the iPXE.pxe executable needs to be served by TFTP. I am running an OPNsense box for my router/firewall and it as enough disk space and ram that I should be able to do this whole process of it. Setting the DHCP stuff is easy enough via the UI. the iPXE client sets a client option on its DHCP requests, so you want to create a tag in OPNsense off it's user-class (iPXE) and respond with a DHCP boot (what the tab in the UI is called) value of the http server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The flow should be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PXE -&amp;gt; Gets TFTP Address -&amp;gt; Downloads and run iPXE iPXE -&amp;gt; Gets HTTP address -&amp;gt; Does iPXE stuff like run our iso&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DHCP stuff can be done through the UI so it was. The TFTP stuff was not availble the web ui so has to be done through ssh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;# TFTP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was my first time shelling into a BSD box. After this whole process I was left feeling that (Free)BSD is oddly cozy. I can't explain how or why, but it just does. The login prompt from opnsense, the simple shell prompt (csh?), the man pages, the disk layout, the programs. Like even if I didn't have access to all the new version of tools (nvim / rg vs vim / grep) I still got what I wanted done and it just felt cute and cozy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, OPNsense ships with dnsmasq and dnsmasq can also act as a TFTP server. I found this out when trying to search for a TFTP program to install via the UI. I don't know how to enable it, nor did I want to look it up (via the internet), so I just read the man page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;man dnsmasq
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading the man page was a pleasant experience (or maybe it was just my first time reading something from section 8). It told me exactly what the program could do and how to configure it (just searched for tftp). The conf files were listed in at the bottom, the first being &lt;code&gt;/etc/dnsmasq.conf&lt;/code&gt; which did not exist on my system but &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf&lt;/code&gt; did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first line of that file warns you not to manually edit the file and near the bottom you see the conf-dir option set to &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf.d&lt;/code&gt;
I saw a README in that conf dir and, doing a cat resulted in this message:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf.d/README
# Dnsmasq plugin directory:
# Add your *.conf files here, read in alphabetical order
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well sure why not lets do that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;vim /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf.d/10-tftp.conf
enable-tftp
tftp-root=/srv/tftp
:x
mkdir -p /srv/tftp
fetch -r https://boot.ipxe.org/ipxe.efi -o /srv/tftp/
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used the web ui to restart dnsmasq, but you can also use &lt;code&gt;configctl&lt;/code&gt; to do it via shell.
Now when I boot up the laptop I see it load up iPXE but then fail as the http server does not exist. That is progress though, now we just need to serve our iso over http.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing to note is that nearly all the instructions online focus on legacy/bios boot. All my devices boot via UEFI (which is why we downloaded the efi above instead of the .kpxe file). There are ways to setup DHCP to respond with the appropriate files for both uefi or bios boot, but I dont care enough. There are also other things that try to simplify this whole process like pixieboot and netboot.xyz but I am not interested in them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;# HTTP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OPNsense runs lighttpd for serving its web ui and I would like to piggy back off it for the iPXE stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The trickest part here was finding out the web ui configuration lives at &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/etc/lighttpd_webgui/&lt;/code&gt; via &lt;code&gt;ps&lt;/code&gt;.
I had to disable the ssl redirect option from the web ui and instead add it myself to end of my conf file, due how the confs are loaded. I could not think of a different way of getting the 443 port redirect disabled just for the ipxe paths&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat /usr/local/etc/lighttpd_webgui/conf.d/00-ipxe.conf
# Serve /srv/tftp under http://&amp;lt;ip&amp;gt;/ipxe/
alias.url += ( "/ipxe/" =&amp;gt; "/srv/tftp/" )
url.redirect += ( "^/ipxe$" =&amp;gt; "/ipxe/" )

$SERVER["socket"] == "0.0.0.0:80" {
    ssl.engine = "disable"
    $HTTP["url"] !~ "^/ipxe(?:/|$)" {
        $HTTP["host"] =~ "(.*)" {
            url.redirect = ( "^/(.*)" =&amp;gt; "https://%1/$1" )
        }
    }
}

$SERVER["socket"] == "[::]:80" {
    ssl.engine = "disable"
    $HTTP["url"] !~ "^/ipxe(?:/|$)" {
        $HTTP["host"] =~ "(.*)" {
            url.redirect = ( "^/(.*)" =&amp;gt; "https://%1/$1" )
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started off with a basic boot.ixpe file&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#!ipxe
menu Choose an ISO
item nix-minmal NixOS 25.04 Minimal
item nix-gui   NixOS 25.04 GUI
choose target &amp;amp;&amp;amp; goto ${target}

:nix-minimal
sanboot http://10.0.0.1/ipxe/nixos-minimal-25.05.812242.3de8f8d73e35-x86_64-linux.iso
goto menu

:nix-gui
sanboot http://10.0.0.1/ipxe/nixos-graphical-25.05.812242.3de8f8d73e35-x86_64-linux.iso
goto menu
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here is what I spoiled eariler, it didnt work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would get a boot but then nixos would complain about &lt;code&gt;/mnt/iso&lt;/code&gt; or something being missing and failing to go further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This discussion has better information on why it doesn't work: https://github.com/ipxe/ipxe/discussions/962&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;# Proper netboot files&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So my dreams of network booting off an iso are crushed, so where do I go from here?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well it turns out the ISO comes with a bootloader, which contains instructions on how to boot a kernel with an initial ram disk (hint this when I learned what &lt;code&gt;initrd&lt;/code&gt; means).
So can't we do the same?
The answer is yes! (or so I think).
I didnt try to extract the files out the iso, but use nix's built in netboot image generator which builds the necessary files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I only had to tweak the generated .ixpe file to include the http urls but everything worked out in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat netboot.ipxe
#!ipxe
# Use the cmdline variable to allow the user to specify custom kernel params
# when chainloading this script from other iPXE scripts like netboot.xyz
kernel http://10.0.0.1/ipxe/bzImage init=/nix/store/hrgkskx4jqdz4nl3p1f4m1dvrr9b3lij-nixos-system-nixos-kexec-25.11pre708350.gfedcba/init initrd=initrd nohibernate loglevel=4 lsm=landlock,yama,bpf ${cmdline}
initrd http://10.0.0.1/ipxe/initrd
boot
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still wonder if I can extract the files from the graphical installer and boot KDE off the network, but now that the OS is installed my interest has waned. Maybe one day I will revisit&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Thunderbird Adds Native Microsoft Exchange Email Support&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your organization uses Microsoft Exchange-based email, you’ll be happy to hear that Thunderbird’s latest monthly Release version 145, now officially supports native access via the Exchange Web Services (EWS) protocol. With EWS now built directly into Thunderbird, a third-party add-on is no longer required for email functionality. Calendar and address book support for Exchange accounts remain on the roadmap, but email integration is here and ready to use!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What changes for Thunderbird users&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until now, Thunderbird users in Exchange hosted environments often relied on IMAP/POP protocols or third-party extensions. With full native Exchange support for email, Thunderbird now works more seamlessly in Exchange environments, including full folder listings, message synchronization, folder management both locally and on the server, attachment handling, and more. This simplifies life for users who depend on Exchange for email but prefer Thunderbird as their client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to get started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For many people switching from Outlook to Thunderbird, the most common setup involves Microsoft-hosted Exchange accounts such as Microsoft 365 or Office 365. Thunderbird now uses Microsoft’s standard sign-in process (OAuth2) and automatically detects your account settings, so you can start using your email right away without any extra setup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this applies to you, setup is straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create a new account in Thunderbird 145 or newer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In the new Account Hub, select Exchange (or Exchange Web Services in legacy setup).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Let Thunderbird handle the rest!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important note: If you see something different, or need more details or advice, please see our support page and wiki page. Also, some authentication configurations are not supported yet and you may need to wait for a further update that expands compatibility, please refer to the table below for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What functionality is supported now and what’s coming soon&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, EWS support in version 145 currently enables email functionality only. Calendar and address book integration are in active development and will be added in future releases. The chart below provides an at-a-glance view of what’s supported today.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Exchange Web Services and Microsoft Graph&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While many people and organizations still rely on Exchange Web Services (EWS), Microsoft has begun gradually phasing it out in favor of a newer, more modern interface called Microsoft Graph. Microsoft has stated that EWS will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future, but over time, Microsoft Graph will become the primary way to connect to Microsoft 365 services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because EWS remains widely used today, we wanted to ensure full support for it first to ensure compatibility for existing users. At the same time, we’re actively working to add support for Microsoft Graph, so Thunderbird will be ready as Microsoft transitions to its new standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Exchange email is available now, calendar and address book integration is on the way, bringing Thunderbird closer to being a complete solution for Exchange users. For many people, having reliable email access is the most important step, but if you depend on calendar and contact synchronization, we’re working hard to bring this to Thunderbird in the near future, making Thunderbird a strong alternative to Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on future releases for additional support and integrations, but in the meantime, enjoy a smoother Exchange email experience within your favorite email client!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;If you want to know more about Exchange support in Thunderbird, please refer to the dedicated page on support.mozilla.org. Organization admins can also find out more on the Mozilla wiki page. To follow ongoing and future work in this area, please refer to the relevant meta-bug on Bugzilla.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the people who run Open Source projects are mortal. Recent history shows us that they will all eventually die, or get bored, or win the lottery, or get sick, or be conscripted, or lose their mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you've ever visited a foreign country's national history museum, I guarantee you've read this little snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;King Whatshisface was a wise and noble ruler who bought peace and prosperity to all the land.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Upon his death, his heirs waged bloody war over rightful succession which plunged the country into a hundred years of hardship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The great selling point of democracy is that it allows for the peaceful transition of power. Most modern democracies have rendered civil war almost unthinkable. Sure, you might not like the guy currently in charge, but there are well established mechanisms to limit their power and kick them out if they misbehave. If they die in office, there's an obvious and understood hierarchy for who follows them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most Open Source projects start small - just someone in their spare room tinkering for fun. Unexpectedly, they grow into a behemoth which now powers half the world. These mini-empires are fragile. The most popular method of governance is the Benevolent Dictator For Life model. The founder of the project controls everything. But, as I've said before, BDFL only works if the D is genuinely B. Otherwise the FL becomes FML.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last year has seen several BDFLs act like Mad Kings. They become tyrannical despots, lashing out at their own volunteers. They execute takeovers of community projects. They demand fealty and tithes. Like dragons, they become quick to anger when their brittle egos are tested. Spineless courtiers carry out deluded orders while pilfering the coffers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which is why I am delighted that the Mastodon project has shown a better way to behave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In "The Future is Ours to Build - Together" they describe perfectly how to gracefully and peacefully transfer power. There are no VCs bringing in their MBA-brained lackeys to extract maximum value while leaving a rotting husk. No one is seizing community assets and jealously hoarding them. Opaque financial structures and convoluted agreements are prominent in their absence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eugen Rochko, the outgoing CEO, has a remarkably honest blog post about the transition. I wouldn't wish success on my worst enemy. He talks plainly about the reality of dealing with the pressure and how he might have been a limiting factor on Mastodon's growth. That's a far step removed from the ego-centric members of The Cult of The Founder with their passionate belief in the Divine Right of Kings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does your tiny OSS script need a succession plan? Probably not. Do you have several thousand NPM installs per day? It might be worth working out who you can share responsibility with if you are unexpectedly raptured. Do you think that your project is going to last for a thousand years? Build an organisation which won't crumble the moment its founder is arrested for their predatory behaviour on tropical islands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm begging project leaders everywhere - please read up on the social contract and the consent of the governed. Or, if reading is too woke, just behave like grown-ups rather than squabbling tweenagers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a sad inevitability that, eventually, we will all be nothing but memories. The bugs that we create live after us, the patches are oft interrèd with our code. Let it be so with all Open Source projects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Your Smartphone, Their Rules: How App Stores Enable Corporate-Government Censorship&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Who controls what you can do on your mobile phone? What happens when your device can only run what the government decides is OK? We are dangerously close to this kind of totalitarian control, thanks to a combination of government overreach and technocratic infrastructure choices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most Americans have a smartphone, and the average American spends over 5 hours a day on their phone. While these devices are critical to most people’s daily lives, what they can actually do is shaped by what apps are readily available. A slim majority of American smartphone users use an iPhone, which means they can only install apps available from Apple’s AppStore. Nearly all the rest of US smartphone users use some variant of Android, and by default they get their apps from Google’s Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collectively, these two app stores shape the universe of what is available to most people as they use the Internet and make their way through their daily lives. When those app stores block or limit apps based on government requests, they are shaping what people can do, say, communicate, and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently, Apple pulled an app called ICEBlock from the AppStore, making it unavailable in one fell swoop. This app was designed to let people anonymously report public sightings of ICE agents. In the United States people absolutely have a First Amendment right to inform others about what they have seen government officials doing and where — very much including immigration agents whose tactics have been controversial and violent. Apple pulled the ICEBlock app at the demand of the US Department of Justice. The following day, Google pulled a similar app called Red Dot from the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOJ’s pressuring of Apple is an unacceptable, censorious overreach. And Google’s subsequent removal of Red Dot looks like troubling premature capitulation. While some experts and activists have expressed concerns over ICEBlock’s design and development practices, those concerns are no reason for the government to meddle in software distribution. The administration’s ostensible free speech warriors are trying to shape how Americans can communicate with each other about matters of pressing political concern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infrastructure choices&lt;lb/&gt; But the government’s overreach isn’t the whole story here. The current structure of the mobile phone ecosystem enables this kind of abuse and control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple’s iOS (the operating system for any iPhone) is designed to only be able to run apps from the AppStore. If Apple hasn’t signed off on it, the app won’t run. This centralized control is ripe for abuse:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Apple has handed the Chinese government control over what apps are available to iPhone users in China, including banning gay dating apps.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The corporation has used its authority over the AppStore to block a game that critiqued its labor practices.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Apple’s guidelines say that “‘Enemies’ within the context of a game cannot solely target a specific … government, corporation, or any other real entity.” That represents a potential for sweeping censorship of anyone who wants to use the art of games to criticize companies or otherwise advance political messages.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It banned the popular game Fortnite from the App Store as it was battling the gamemaker to get a bigger cut of money from user transactions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In 2012 Apple rejected an app that compiled reports of highly controversial overseas drone strikes by the U.S. government during the “War on Terror.”&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike Apple, Google’s Android operating system has traditionally allowed relatively easy access to “sideloading”, which just means installing apps through means other than Google’s Play Store. Although most installations default to getting apps from the Play Store, the availability of sideloading means that even if Google censors apps in the Play Store, people can still install them. Even apps critical of Google can make it onto an Android device. It’s also possible to run a variant of Android without the Play Store at all, such as GrapheneOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately that is all set to change with a recent Google announcement that it will block apps from “certified Android” devices (which is nearly all Android phones) unless they come from what Google calls a “verified developer.” This means that the common Android user trying to install an app will have to get Google’s blessing: does this app come from someone that Google has “verified”? How Google will decide who is allowed to be verified and who is not is still unclear. Can a developer become “unverified”?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This upcoming change is framed by Google as a security measure, but merely knowing the identity of the developer of an app doesn’t provide any security. So the only way that the “verified developer” requirement can offer security is if Google withholds “verified developer” status from people it deems bad actors. But Google’s ability to withhold that status can be abused in the same way that Apple’s AppStore lock-in is being abused. A government will simply make a demand: “treat this developer as a bad actor” and effectively cut off any app by targeting its developer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a lever of control is available, the would-be censors will try to use it. It has never been true that someone who buys a Lenovo or Dell laptop, for example, has to let Lenovo or Dell tell them what programs they can and cannot install on their computer. Yet that will soon be the situation with regards to nearly all cell phones used in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that American iPhones are limited to only apps from the AppStore, but European Union (EU) iPhones don’t have that restriction. The EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) required Apple to permit alternate app stores and sideloading (which Apple calls “web distribution”). As a result, marketplaces like AltStore are starting to become available — but Apple only lets EU customers use them. The European regime is not perfect, however; while sideloaded apps and alternative app stores aren’t subject to the app store’s constraints, they are still obliged to follow Apple’s “Notarization” requirements, which requires Apple to review all iOS apps – even from these alternate sources – on the basis of several vaguely worded rationales. For example, if the DoJ were to claim that ICEBlock “promoted physical harm” (even though it clearly does not), Apple could use this as an excuse to justify revoking their notarization of the app, which would prevent it from being installed even from these alternate channels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;App store security and surveillance&lt;lb/&gt; Both Apple and Google make claims that their app distribution mechanisms improve security for their users. And clearly, these tech giants do block some abusive apps by exercising the control they have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But both of them also regularly allow apps that contain common malicious patterns, including many apps built with surveillance tooling that sell their users’ data to data brokers. If either tech giant were serious about user security, they could ban these practices, but they do not. Google’s security claims are also undermined by the fact that the cellphone hacking company Cellebrite tells law enforcement that Google’s Pixel phones can be hacked, while those running GrapheneOS, created by a small non-profit, cannot. (Asked by a reporter why that was so, Google did not respond.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Making matters worse, organizations like Google are unclear about their policies, and some of their policy statements can put developers and users at risk. Discussing blocking Red Dot, for example, Google told 404Media that “apps that have user generated content must also conduct content moderation.” This implies that Google could become unwilling to distribute fully end-to-end encrypted apps, like Signal Private Messenger or Delta Chat, since those app vendors by design are incapable of reviewing user-generated content. End-to-end encrypted apps are the gold standard for secure communications, and no app store that signals a willingness to remove them can claim to put security first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, even if you’ve carefully curated the apps you have installed from these dominant app stores to avoid spyware and use strongly secure apps, the stores themselves monitor the devices, keeping dossiers of what apps are installed on each device, and maybe more. Being a user of these app stores means being under heavy, regular surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other options exist&lt;lb/&gt; These centralized, surveilled, censorship-enabling app stores are not the only way to distribute software. Consider alternative app stores for Android, like Accrescent, which prioritizes privacy and security requirements in its apps, and F-Droid, which enables installation of free and open source apps. In addition to offering quality tools and auditing, F-Droid’s policies incentivize the apps distributed on the platform to trim out overwhelming amounts of corporate spyware that infest both Google and Apple’s app stores. Neither F-Droid nor Accrescent do any surveillance of their users at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The F-Droid developers recently wrote about the impact that Google’s upcoming developer registration requirements are likely to have on the broader ecosystem of privacy-preserving Android apps. The outcome doesn’t look good: the ability to install free and open source software on a common device might be going away. Those few people left using unusual devices (“uncertified” Android deployments like GrapheneOS, or even more obscure non-Android operating systems like phosh) will still have the freedom to install tools that they want, but the overwhelming majority of people will be stuck with what can quickly devolve into a government-controlled cop-in-your-pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How we can push back&lt;lb/&gt; In an increasingly centralized world, it will take very little for an abusive government to cause an effective organizing tool to disappear, to block an app that belongs to a critical dissenting media outlet, or to force invasive malware into a software update used by everyone. We need a shared infrastructure that doesn’t permit this kind of centralized control. We can disrupt oligopolistic control over software through user choice (e.g., preferring and installing free software), building good protocol frameworks (e.g., demanding tools that use open standards for interoperability), and through regulatory intervention (e.g., breaking up monopolistic actors, or mandating that an OS must allow sideloading, as the EU did with the DMA).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The device you carry with you that is privy to much of your life should be under your control, not under the control of an abusive government or corporations that do its bidding.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After years of staring down the world’s biggest tech companies and setting the bar for tough regulation worldwide, Europe has blinked. Under intense pressure from industry and the US government, Brussels is stripping protections from its flagship General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — including simplifying its infamous cookie permission pop-ups — and relaxing or delaying landmark AI rules in an effort to cut red tape and revive sluggish economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Europe is scaling back its landmark privacy and AI laws&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EU folds under Big Tech’s pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The EU folds under Big Tech’s pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The changes, proposed by the European Commission, the bloc’s executive branch, changes core elements of the GDPR, making it easier for companies to share anonymized and pseudonymized personal datasets. They would allow AI companies to legally use personal data to train AI models, so long as that training complies with other GDPR requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proposal also waters down a key part of Europe’s sweeping artificial intelligence rules, the AI Act, which came into force in 2024 but had many elements that would only come into effect later. The change extends the grace period for rules governing high-risk AI systems that pose “serious risks” to health, safety, or fundamental rights, which were due to come into effect next summer. The rules will now only apply once it’s confirmed that “the needed standards and support tools are available” to AI companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One change that’s likely to please almost everyone is a reduction in Europe’s ubiquitous cookie banners and pop-ups. Under the new proposal, some “non-risk” cookies won’t trigger pop-ups at all, and users would be able to control others from central browser controls that apply to websites broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other amendments in the new Digital Omnibus include simplified AI documentation requirements for smaller companies, a unified interface for companies to report cybersecurity incidents, and centralizing oversight of AI into the bloc’s AI Office.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is being done in the European way.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We have all the ingredients in the EU to succeed. But our companies, especially our start-ups and small businesses, are often held back by layers of rigid rules,” said Henna Virkkunen, executive vice-president for tech sovereignty at the European Commission. “By cutting red tape, simplifying EU laws, opening access to data and introducing a common European Business Wallet we are giving space for innovation to happen and to be marketed in Europe. This is being done in the European way: by making sure that fundamental rights of users remain fully protected.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proposal now heads to the European Parliament and the EU’s 27 member states — where it will need a qualified majority — for approval, a process that could drag on for months and potentially introduce significant changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proposed overhaul won’t land quietly in Brussels, and if the development of the GDPR and AI Act are anything to go by, a political and lobbying firestorm is on its way. The GDPR is a cornerstone of Europe’s tech strategy and as close to sacred as a policy can be. Leaked drafts have already provoked outrage among civil rights groups and politicians, who have accused the Commission of weakening fundamental safeguards and bowing to pressure from Big Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The decision follows months of intense pressure from Big Tech and Donald Trump — as well as high-profile internal figures like ex-Italian prime minister and former head of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi — urging the bloc to weaken burdensome tech regulation. The Commission has sought to frame the changes as simplifying the EU’s tech laws, not weakening them – a way of soothing growing fears in Brussels that its tough rules are hampering its ability to compete globally. With very few exceptions, Europe doesn’t have any credible competitors in the global AI race, which is dominated by US and Chinese companies like DeepSeek, Google, and OpenAI.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I was working on something else and as a side effect accidently vibe coded a prolog interpretor on my phone over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven't used Prolog for 20 years, and but it does seem to be roughly correct.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Emoji Evidence Errors Don’t Undo a Murder Conviction–People v. Harmon&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Delarosa was convicted of murder. (Some background on the case). On appeal, he argues the court should have excluded a Facebook message that indicated he owned a gun a few weeks before the shooting. The Facebook message included some emojis:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The law enforcement investigator who testified described the emojis as “a smiley face emoji and a devil horn emoji.” More specifically, the printed Facebook message that was admitted into evidence shows a face-with-tears-of-joy emoji and a smiling-face-with-horns emoji at the end of the message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that face with tears of joy [😂] has different meanings than a regular smiley [there are many variations; this is the grinning face: 😀]. Thus, the investigator’s testimony introduced avoidable ambiguity about the emojis that was potentially misleading to the jury. I believe the “devil horn” and “smiling face with horns” emojis are synonyms, but visually depicting the emojis would have been a better way to explain them. For example, my software renders the smiling face with horns as red [😈], but often the depiction is purple. The appeals court doesn’t address any possible problems with the investigator’s emoji testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Delarosa’s motion in limine to exclude the Facebook message included a printout of that message as an exhibit. However, in that printout,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;instead of being followed by two emojis, the message is followed by four closely-spaced rectangles. Neither the text of Delarosa’s in limine motion, nor anything said during the in limine hearing would have informed the trial court that the four rectangles represented two emojis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Delarosa argued that the emojis shown at trial could have prompted the jury to infer that he had a “glib attitude towards gun violence.” However, the appeals court says that at the time of the motion in limine, the judge didn’t know about the emojis (they were just the unexplained rectangle symbols in the evidence presented to the judge), so the judge couldn’t have evaluated the inference that Delarosa now objects to. Thus, the appeals court resolves this issue on technical grounds, saying the trial court didn’t abuse its discretion in denying the motion in limine due to the garbled evidence Delarosa presented in the motion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I understand why criminal defendants shouldn’t get a trial do-over if they make mistakes in earlier rounds, but I didn’t love that outcome here. Effectively, Delarosa was exposed to evidence at trial (the message with the emojis) that hadn’t been subject to a motion in limine. In this case, the rectangles should have been a red flag that the printouts weren’t right. One troubling possibility is that Delarosa’s lawyers should have spotted that the exhibit didn’t accurately reflect the evidence, but didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[Note 1: it’s possibly unfair for an outsider ex post to critique how the litigation team handled a specific item of evidence. I imagine Delarosa’s defense team was dealing with a huge volume of evidence, possibly on short turnarounds, and litigation teams make many reasoned choices that are opaque to outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note 2: it’s possible/probable that the trial outcomes would have been the same with or without the Facebook message evidence.]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The broader practice point is clear: lawyers must undertake proper efforts to ensure that the emojis introduced as evidence in court display the correct versions of the emojis. That may be easier said than done, because accurate depictions may require seeing the emojis in both the sender’s and recipient’s contexts and recreating the historical technical environments to depict how the evidence looked at the relevant historical time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This opinion turns on how the emojis appeared in evidence, but frustratingly the opinion didn’t display any of the evidence showing either the emojis or the rectangle replacements.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Build vs Buy: What This Week's Outages Should Teach You&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few years back, I gave a conference talk called “Build vs Buy: Software Systems at Jurassic Park” where I argued that the real villain wasn’t the velociraptors or the T-Rex—it was Dennis Nedry’s custom software. The park’s catastrophic failure wasn’t just about one disgruntled programmer; it was about choosing to build critical infrastructure that should have been bought. You can watch the whole thing here, but this week’s events make the lesson worth revisiting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the span of a few days, we’ve watched some of the internet’s most critical infrastructure go down. Cloudflare had a major outage today that took down huge swaths of the web. GitHub went down. AWS had issues last week. And while each failure had its own specific cause, they all highlight the same fundamental problem: we’ve built our businesses on top of abstractions we don’t understand, controlled by companies we can’t influence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Simple Rule That Everyone Gets Wrong&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing, if your core business function depends on some capability, you should own it if at all possible. You need to control your destiny, and you need to take every opportunity to be better than your competitors. If you just buy “the thing you do,” then why should anyone buy it from you?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But tech leaders consistently get this backwards. They’ll spend months building their own analytics tools while running their entire product on a cloud provider they don’t understand. They’ll craft artisanal monitoring solutions while their actual business logic—the thing customers pay for—runs on someone else’s computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Infrastructure Trap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, there are exceptions. Sometimes you can’t do something you depend on because of expertise or affordability. As a software provider, I need servers, networks, and datacenters to deliver my software, but I couldn’t afford to build a datacenter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here’s where most companies go wrong: just because I need some infrastructure doesn’t mean I should jump to a full-on cloud provider. I need some servers. I don’t need a globally-redundant PaaS that allows me to ignore how computers work. In my experience, that’s an outage waiting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what I mean about controlling your own destiny. Building my product on hardware is transparent. When something goes wrong, it’s understandable. A DIMM went bad. We lost a drive. The system needs to be swapped out. It’s understandable, and I have a timeline and alternatives that I can control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But with cloud providers, there are millions of lines of code between my stuff and anything real. No one really understands how all of it works. When Cloudflare’s Bot Management system started choking on a malformed configuration file today, it took down services that had nothing to do with bot management. When something goes down, it can take hours for anyone to even acknowledge the problem, and there’s little transparency about how long it will take to fix. Meanwhile, customers are screaming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Right Way to Think About It&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has informed our philosophy on how we choose to build or buy software:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build what delivers your value. If I need something to deliver my products, I try as hard as I can to build it myself. I want to own it. I want to control it. I don’t want to depend on someone else or suffer their mistakes. If I can’t build it for cost or expertise reasons, I want to buy something that is as simple as possible. Something that has as thin of an abstraction layer as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Buy everything else. If I don’t need it to deliver my services, I want to buy it. I want to buy analytics. I want to buy CRM. I want to buy business operations products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some things you should probably buy, even if you don’t buy them from me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Error monitoring? Buy it. (TrackJS)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Performance monitoring? Buy it. (Request Metrics)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SSL certificate management? Definitely buy it. (CertKit)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These aren’t your core business. They’re solved problems. Building them yourself is like Jurassic Park deciding to build their own door locks. How did that work out?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Abstraction Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real danger isn’t in buying software, it’s in buying abstractions so complex that you can’t understand what’s happening when they fail. Yesterday’s Cloudflare outage is a perfect example. A permissions change in a database caused a configuration file to double in size, which exceeded a hard-coded limit in their proxy software, which caused 5xx errors across their entire network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How many layers of abstraction is that? How many of those layers could you debug if it was your system?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you build on top of these massive platforms, you’re not just outsourcing your infrastructure—you’re outsourcing your ability to understand and fix problems. You’re trading control for convenience, and when that convenience fails, you’re helpless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Learn from the Dinosaurs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Jurassic Park, they built everything themselves because they thought they were special. They thought their needs were unique. They thought they could do it better. They were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But they would have been just as wrong to outsource everything to InGen Cloud Services™ and hope for the best. The answer isn’t at the extremes—it’s in being thoughtful about what you build and what you buy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build what makes you unique. Buy what makes you run. And whatever you do, make sure you understand how it works well enough to fix it when it breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because it will break. And when it does, “we’re experiencing higher than normal call volumes” isn’t going to cut it with your customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Todd Gardner is the CEO and co-founder of TrackJS, Request Metrics, and CertKit. He’s been building software for over 20 years and has strong opinions about JavaScript, infrastructure, and dinosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Adventures in upgrading Proxmox&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running docker inside LXC is weird. It's containers on top of other container, and there was a fairly recent issue with AppArmor that prevented some functionality from running inside a docker container with very cryptic error. I was trying to deploy &lt;code&gt;coolify&lt;/code&gt; and/or &lt;code&gt;dokploy&lt;/code&gt; in my homelab and hitting all sorts of weird issues. Eventually I've found this GitHub issue for &lt;code&gt;runc&lt;/code&gt;, and, apparently, it was fixed in the new version of &lt;code&gt;pve-lxc&lt;/code&gt; package. But I'm still on Proxmox 8, and the new version seemingly only available in Proxmox 9.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've upgraded one node without much hassle, but the second node, the one that runs my NVR and has the Coral TPU, that one gave me some grief. Because Apex drivers are installed as a DKMS module, it failed to rebuild, which interrupted the system upgrade process. Not sure how exactly, but after the reboot the system did not come back online. The machine is in the basement, which means I have to take my USB KVM and make a trip downstairs...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've recently added another Zigbee dongle, that supports Thread, and it happens to share same VID:PID combo as the old dongle, so due to how these were mapped into guest OS, all my light switches stopped working. I had to fix the issue fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully I was able to reach the GRUB screen and pick previous kernel, so I could boot into the machine. That was a plus, but trying to reboot into the new kernel still caused panic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google suggested that the &lt;code&gt;unable to mount rootfs on unknown-block(0,0)&lt;/code&gt; error indicates an issue with missing &lt;code&gt;initrd&lt;/code&gt;, which needs to be regenerated with &lt;code&gt;update-initramfs -u -k ${KERNEL_VERSION}&lt;/code&gt;. It ran successfully, albeit with somewhat cryptic &lt;code&gt;no /etc/kernel/proxmox-boot-uuids found&lt;/code&gt; message. After reboot it kernel-panicked again, even though the &lt;code&gt;/boot/initrd-${VERSION}&lt;/code&gt; files were present. I guess that error is relevant. After another quick Google search I've found this Reddit thread which provided the steps to solve this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;lsblk -o +FSTYPE | grep /boot/efi # understand which device the EFI partition is on
unount /boot/efi
proxmox-boot-tool init /dev/${DEVICE} # plug in device from step 1
mount /boot/efi
update-initramfs -u -k all
reboot&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This generated the necessary file and after rebooting the system was able to boot again with the new kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While trying to troubleshoot I've also uninstalled the Apex DKMS module, and now I had to re-install it again, but it started failing with errors because of the kernel change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apparently some symbols/API's where obsoleted and I had to patch the source code. Upstream seemingly did not have it, but I found the necessary changes:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I often get very specific infrastructure requests from clients. Most of the time it is some form of hosting. My job is usually to suggest and implement the setup that fits their goals, skills and long term plans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there are competent technicians on the other side, and they are willing to learn or already comfortable with Unix style systems, my first choices are usually one of the BSDs or an illumos distribution. If they need a control panel, or they already have a lot of experience with a particular stack that will clearly help them, I will happily use Linux and it usually delivers solid, reliable results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every now and then someone asks the question I like the least:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;âBut how does it perform compared to X or Y?â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have never been a big fan of benchmarks. At best they capture a very specific workload on a very specific setup. They are almost never a perfect reflection of what will happen in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, I discovered that idle bhyve VMs seem to use fewer resources when the host is illumos than when the host is FreeBSD. It looks strange at first sight, but the illumos people are clearly working very hard on this, and the result is a very capable and efficient platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite my skepticism, from time to time I enjoy running some comparative tests. I already did it with Proxmox KVM versus FreeBSD bhyve, and I also compared Jails, Zones, bhyve and KVM on the same Intel N150 box. That led to the FreeBSD vs SmartOS article where I focused on CPU and memory performance on this small mini PC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This time I wanted to do something simpler, but also closer to what I see every day: static web hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of synthetic CPU or I/O tests, I wanted to measure how different operating systems behave when they serve a small static site with nginx, both over HTTP and HTTPS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not meant to be a super rigorous benchmark. I used the default nginx packages, almost default configuration, and did not tune any OS specific kernel settings. In my experience, careful tuning of kernel and network parameters can easily move numbers by several tens of percentage points. The problem is that very few people actually spend time chasing such optimizations. Much more often, once a limit is reached, someone yells âwe need mooooar powaaaarâ while the real fix would be to tune the existing stack a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the question I want to answer here is more modest and more practical:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;With default nginx and a small static site, how much does the choice of host OS really matter on this Intel N150 mini PC?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spoiler: less than people think, at least for plain HTTP. Things get more interesting once TLS enters the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;These benchmarks are a snapshot of my specific hardware, network and configuration. They are useful to compare relative behavior on this setup. They are not a universal ranking of operating systems. Different CPUs, NICs, crypto extensions, kernel versions or nginx builds can completely change the picture.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Test setup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hardware is the same Intel N150 mini PC I used in my previous tests: a small, low power box that still has enough cores to be interesting for lab and small production workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On it, I installed several operating systems and environments, always on the bare metal, not nested inside each other. On each OS I installed nginx from the official packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Software under test&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the host:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SmartOS, with:&lt;lb/&gt; - a Debian 12 LX zone&lt;lb/&gt; - an Alpine Linux 3.22 LX zone&lt;lb/&gt; - a native SmartOS zone &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FreeBSD 14.3-RELEASE:&lt;lb/&gt; - nginx running inside a native jail &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenBSD 7.8:&lt;lb/&gt; - nginx on the host &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NetBSD 10.1:&lt;lb/&gt; - nginx on the host &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Debian 13.2:&lt;lb/&gt; - nginx on the host &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alpine Linux 3.22:&lt;lb/&gt; - nginx on the host &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also tried to include DragonFlyBSD, but the NIC in this box is not supported. Using a different NIC just for one OS would have made the comparison meaningless, so I excluded it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;nginx configuration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all environments:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;nginx was installed from the system packages&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;worker_processes&lt;/code&gt;was set to&lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the web root contained the same static content&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The important part is that I used exactly the same &lt;code&gt;nginx.conf&lt;/code&gt; file for all operating systems and all combinations in this article. I copied the same configuration file verbatim to every host, jail and zone. The only changes were the IP address and file paths where needed, for example for the TLS certificate and key. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The static content was a default build of the example site generated by BSSG, my Bash static site generator. The web root was the same logical structure on every OS and container type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no OS specific tuning in the configuration and no kernel level tweaks. This is very close to a âpackage install plus minimal configâ situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;TLS configuration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For HTTPS I used a very simple configuration, identical on every host.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Self signed certificate created with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -subj "/CN=localhost"  
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example nginx &lt;code&gt;server&lt;/code&gt; block for HTTPS (simplified): &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;server {  
listen 443 ssl http2;  
listen [::]:443 ssl http2;  

server_name _;  

ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt;  
ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/server.key;  

root /var/www/html;  
index index.html index.htm;  

location / {  
try_files $uri $uri/ =404;  
}  
}  
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The HTTP virtual host is also the same everywhere, with the root pointing to the BSSG example site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Load generator&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tests were run from my workstation on the same LAN:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;client host: a mini PC machine connected at 2.5 Gbit/s&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;switch: 2.5 Gbit/s&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;test tool: &lt;code&gt;wrk&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For each target host I ran:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;wrk -t4 -c50 -d10s http://IP&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;wrk -t4 -c10 -d10s http://IP&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;wrk -t4 -c50 -d10s https://IP&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;wrk -t4 -c10 -d10s https://IP&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each scenario was executed multiple times to reduce noise; the numbers below are medians (or very close to them) from the runs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The contenders&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To keep things readable, I will refer to each setup as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SmartOS Debian LX â SmartOS host, Debian 12 LX zone&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SmartOS Alpine LX â SmartOS host, Alpine 3.22 LX zone&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SmartOS Native â SmartOS host, native zone&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FreeBSD Jail â FreeBSD 14.3-RELEASE, nginx in a jail&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OpenBSD Host â OpenBSD 7.8, nginx on the host&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NetBSD Host â NetBSD 10.1, nginx on the host&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debian Host â Debian 13.2, nginx on the host&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alpine Host â Alpine 3.22, nginx on the host&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything uses the same nginx configuration file and the same static site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Static HTTP results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let us start with plain HTTP, since this removes TLS from the picture and focuses on the kernel, network stack and nginx itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;HTTP, 4 threads, 50 concurrent connections&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approximate median &lt;code&gt;wrk&lt;/code&gt; results: &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Environment&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;HTTP 50 connections&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SmartOS Debian LX&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~46.2 k&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;OpenBSD Host&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~64.1 k&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;NetBSD Host&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~64.0 k&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Debian Host&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~63.8 k&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Alpine Host&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~63.9 k&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two things stand out:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All the native or jail/container setups on the hosts that are not LX zones cluster around 63 to 64k requests per second.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The two SmartOS LX zones sit slightly lower, in the 46 to 49k range, which is still very respectable for this hardware.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, as long as you are on the host or in something very close to it (FreeBSD jail, SmartOS native zone, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Linux on bare metal), static HTTP on nginx will happily max out around 64k requests per second with this small Intel N150 CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Debian and Alpine LX zones on SmartOS are a bit slower, but not dramatically so. They still deliver close to 50k requests per second and, in a real world scenario, you would probably saturate the network or the client long before hitting those numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;HTTP, 4 threads, 10 concurrent connections&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With fewer concurrent connections, absolute throughput drops, but the relative picture is similar:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SmartOS Native around 44k&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NetBSD and Alpine Host around 34 to 35k&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FreeBSD, Debian, OpenBSD around 31 to 33k&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The SmartOS LX zones sit slightly below, around 35 to 37k req/s&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The important conclusion is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For plain HTTP static hosting, once nginx is installed and correctly configured, the choice between these operating systems makes very little difference on this hardware. Zones and jails add negligible overhead, LX zones add a small one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are only serving static content over HTTP, your choice of OS should be driven by other factors: ecosystem, tooling, update strategy, your own expertise and preference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Static HTTPS results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TLS is where things start to diverge more clearly and where CPU utilization becomes interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;HTTPS, 4 threads, 50 concurrent connections&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approximate medians:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Environment&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;HTTPS 50 connections&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;CPU notes at 50 HTTPS connections&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SmartOS Debian LX&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~51.4 k&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;CPU saturated&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SmartOS Alpine LX&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~40.4 k&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;CPU saturated&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SmartOS Native&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~52.8 k&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;CPU saturated&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;FreeBSD Jail&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~62.9 k&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;around 60% CPU idle&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;OpenBSD Host&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~39.7 k&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;CPU saturated&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;NetBSD Host&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~40.4 k&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;CPU at 100%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Debian Host&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~62.8 k&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;about 20% CPU idle&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Alpine Host&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~62.4 k&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;small idle headroom, around 7% idle&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These numbers tell a more nuanced story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;FreeBSD, Debian and Alpine on bare metal form a âfast TLSâ group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;All three sit around 62 to 63k requests per second with 50 concurrent HTTPS connections.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;FreeBSD does this while using significantly less CPU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;During the HTTPS tests with 50 connections, the FreeBSD host still had around 60% CPU idle. It is the platform that handled TLS load most comfortably in terms of CPU headroom.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debian and Alpine are close in throughput, but push the CPU harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Debian still had some idle time left, Alpine even less. In practice, all three are excellent here, but FreeBSD gives you more room before you hit the wall.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmartOS, NetBSD and OpenBSD form a âgood but heavierâ TLS group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Their HTTPS throughput is in the 40 to 52k req/s range and they reach full CPU usage at 50 concurrent connections. OpenBSD and NetBSD stabilize around 39 to 40k req/s. SmartOS native and the Debian LX zone manage slightly better (around 51 to 53k) but still with the CPU pegged.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;HTTPS, 4 threads, 10 concurrent connections&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With lower concurrency:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FreeBSD, Debian and Alpine still sit in roughly the 29 to 31k req/s range&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SmartOS Native and LX zones are in the mid to high 30k range&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NetBSD and OpenBSD sit around 26 to 27k req/s&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The relative pattern is the same: for this TLS workload, FreeBSD and modern Linux distributions on bare metal appear to make better use of the cryptographic capabilities of the CPU, delivering higher throughput or more headroom or both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What TLS seems to highlight&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The HTTPS tests point to something that is not about nginx itself, but about the TLS stack and how well it can exploit the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On this Intel N150, my feeling is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FreeBSD, with the userland and crypto stack I am running, is very efficient at TLS here. It delivers the highest throughput while keeping plenty of CPU in reserve.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debian and Alpine, with their recent kernels and libraries, are also strong performers, close to FreeBSD in throughput, but with less idle CPU.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;NetBSD, OpenBSD and SmartOS (native and LX) are still perfectly capable of serving a lot of HTTPS traffic, but they have to work harder to keep up and they hit 100% CPU much earlier.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This matches what I see in day to day operations: TLS performance is often less about ânginx vs something elseâ and more about the combination of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the TLS library version and configuration&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;how well the OS uses the CPU crypto instructions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;kernel level details in the network and crypto paths&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suspect the differences here are mostly due to how each system combines its TLS stack (OpenSSL, LibreSSL and friends), its kernel and its hardware acceleration support. It would take a deeper dive into profiling and configuration knobs to attribute the gaps precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In any case, on this specific mini PC, if I had to pick a platform to handle a large amount of HTTPS static traffic, FreeBSD, Debian and Alpine would be my first candidates, in that order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Zones, jails and containers: overhead in practice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another interesting part of the story is the overhead introduced by different isolation technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From these tests and the previous virtualization article on the same N150 machine, the picture is consistent:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;FreeBSD jails behave almost like bare metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;For both HTTP and HTTPS, running nginx in a jail on FreeBSD 14.3-RELEASE produces numbers practically identical to native hosts on other OSes. CPU utilization is excellent, especially under TLS.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmartOS native zones are also very close to the metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Static HTTP performance reaches the same 64k req/s region and HTTPS is only slightly behind the âfast TLSâ group, although with higher CPU usage.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmartOS LX zones introduce a noticeable but modest overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Both Debian and Alpine LX zones on SmartOS perform slightly worse than the native zone or FreeBSD jails. For static HTTP they are still very fast. For HTTPS the Debian LX zone remains competitive but costs more CPU, while the Alpine LX zone is slower.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a surprise. LX zones translate Linux system calls on top of the illumos kernel and there is a cost for that. The important point is that the cost is not catastrophic. On a bigger CPU you would probably not notice it unless you are really pushing the limits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What this means for real workloads&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is easy to get lost in tables and percentages, so let us go back to the initial question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A client wants static hosting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Does the choice between FreeBSD, SmartOS, NetBSD or Linux matter in terms of performance?&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For plain HTTP on this hardware, with nginx and the same configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Not really.&lt;lb/&gt;All the native hosts and FreeBSD jails deliver roughly the same maximum throughput, in the 63 to 64k req/s range. SmartOS LX zones are slightly slower but still strong.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For HTTPS:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Yes, it starts to matter a bit more.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;FreeBSD stands out for how relaxed the CPU is under high TLS load.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Debian and Alpine are very close in throughput, with more CPU used but still with some headroom.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SmartOS, NetBSD and OpenBSD can still push a lot of HTTPS traffic, but they reach 100% CPU earlier and stabilize at lower request rates.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does this mean you should always choose FreeBSD or Debian or Alpine for static HTTPS hosting?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not necessarily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In real deployments, the bottleneck is rarely the TLS performance of a single node serving a small static site. Network throughput, storage, logging, reverse proxies, CDNs and application layers all play a role.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, knowing that FreeBSD and current Linux distributions can squeeze more out of a small CPU under TLS is useful when you are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;sizing hardware for small VPS nodes that must serve many HTTPS requests&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;planning to consolidate multiple services on a low power box&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;deciding whether you can afford to keep some CPU aside for other tasks (cache, background jobs, monitoring, and so on)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As always, the right answer depends on the complete picture: your skills, your tooling, your backups, your monitoring, the rest of your stack, and your tolerance for troubleshooting when things go sideways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From these small tests, my main takeaways are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Static HTTP is basically solved on all these platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;On a modest Intel N150, every system tested can push around 64k static HTTP requests per second with nginx set to almost default settings. For many use cases, that is already more than enough.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLS performance is where the OS and crypto stack start to matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;FreeBSD, Debian and Alpine squeeze more HTTPS requests out of the N150, and FreeBSD in particular does it with a surprising amount of idle CPU left. NetBSD, OpenBSD and SmartOS need more CPU to reach similar speeds and stabilize at lower throughput once the CPU is saturated.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jails and native zones are essentially free, LX zones cost a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;FreeBSD jails and SmartOS native zones show very little overhead for this workload. SmartOS LX zones are still perfectly usable, but if you are chasing every last request per second you will see the cost of the translation layer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benchmarks are only part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;If your team knows OpenBSD inside out and has tooling, scripts and workflows built around it, you might happily accept using more CPU on TLS in exchange for security features, simplicity and familiarity. The same goes for NetBSD or SmartOS in environments where their specific strengths shine.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will not choose an operating system for a client just because a benchmark looks nicer. These numbers are one of the many inputs I consider. What matters most is always the combination of reliability, security, maintainability and the human beings who will have to operate the&lt;lb/&gt; system at three in the morning when something goes wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, it is nice to know that if you put a tiny Intel N150 in front of a static site and you pick FreeBSD or a modern Linux distribution for HTTPS, you are giving that little CPU a fair chance to shine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The DNS Benchmark Tool now includes three specialized commands for different workflows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quickly rank resolvers by speed and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Rank resolvers quickly
dns-benchmark top

# Use custom domain list
dns-benchmark top -d domains.txt

# Export results to JSON
dns-benchmark top -o results.json&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Benchmark resolvers side‑by‑side with detailed statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Compare Cloudflare, Google, and Quad9
dns-benchmark compare Cloudflare Google Quad9

# Compare by IP addresses
dns-benchmark compare 1.1.1.1 8.8.8.8 9.9.9.9

# Show detailed per-domain breakdown
dns-benchmark compare Cloudflare Google --show-details

# Export results to CSV
dns-benchmark compare Cloudflare Google -o results.csv&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continuously monitor resolver performance with alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Monitor default resolvers continuously (every 60s)
dns-benchmark monitoring --use-defaults

# Monitor with custom resolvers and domains
dns-benchmark monitoring -r resolvers.json -d domains.txt

# Run monitoring for 1 hour with alerts
dns-benchmark monitoring --use-defaults --interval 30 --duration 3600 \
  --alert-latency 150 --alert-failure-rate 5 --output monitor.log&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Command&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Purpose&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Typical Use Case&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Key Options&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Output&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;top&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Quick ranking of resolvers by speed and reliability&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Fast check to see which resolver is best right now&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;--domains&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--record-types&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--output&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sorted list of resolvers with latency &amp;amp; success rate&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;compare&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Side‑by‑side comparison of specific resolvers&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Detailed benchmarking across chosen resolvers/domains&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;--domains&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--record-types&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--iterations&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--output&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--show-details&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Table of resolvers with latency, success rate, per‑domain breakdown&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;monitoring&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Continuous monitoring with alerts&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Real‑time tracking of resolver performance over time&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;--interval&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--duration&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--alert-latency&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--alert-failure-rate&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--output&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--use-defaults&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Live status indicators, alerts, optional log file&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iteration count: displayed when more than one iteration is run.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cache hits: shows how many queries were served from cache (when &lt;code&gt;--use-cache&lt;/code&gt;is enabled).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Failure tracking: resolvers with repeated errors are counted and can be inspected with &lt;code&gt;get_failed_resolvers()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cache statistics: available via &lt;code&gt;get_cache_stats()&lt;/code&gt;, showing number of cached entries and whether cache is enabled.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Warmup results: warmup queries are marked with &lt;code&gt;iteration=0&lt;/code&gt;in raw data, making them easy to filter out in analysis.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example summary output:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;=== BENCHMARK SUMMARY ===
Total queries: 150
Successful: 140 (93.33%)
Average latency: 212.45 ms
Median latency: 198.12 ms
Fastest resolver: Cloudflare
Slowest resolver: Quad9
Iterations: 3
Cache hits: 40 (26.7%)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Mode&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Recommended Flags&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Purpose&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Quick Run&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;--iterations 1 --timeout 1 --retries 0 --warmup-fast&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Fast feedback, minimal retries, lightweight warmup. Good for quick checks.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Thorough Run&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;--iterations 3 --use-cache --warmup --timeout 5 --retries 2&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Multiple passes, cache enabled, full warmup. Best for detailed benchmarking.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Debug Mode&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;--iterations 1 --timeout 10 --retries 0 --quiet&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Long timeout, no retries, minimal output. Useful for diagnosing resolver issues.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Balanced Run&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;--iterations 2 --use-cache --warmup-fast --timeout 2 --retries 1&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;A middle ground: moderate speed, some retries, cache enabled, quick warmup.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We value your input! Help us improve dns-benchmark by sharing your experience and DNS challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open the feedback form directly from CLI:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;dns-benchmark feedback&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Opens the feedback survey in your default browser&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Takes ~2 minutes to complete&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Directly shapes our roadmap and priorities&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automatically marks feedback as given (won't prompt again)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Survey link: https://forms.gle/BJBiyBFvRJHskyR57&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To avoid being intrusive, dns-benchmark uses intelligent prompting:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When prompts appear:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After your 5th, 15th, and 30th benchmark run&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;With a 24-hour cooldown between prompts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Only if you haven't already given feedback&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Auto-dismiss conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You've already submitted feedback&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You've dismissed the prompt 3 times&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You've opted out via environment variable&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    &lt;p&gt;Method 1: Dismiss the prompt When prompted, type &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; to dismiss:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Show this again? (y/n) [y]: n
✓ Got it! We won't ask again. Thanks for using dns-benchmark!
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After 3 dismissals, prompts stop permanently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Method 2: Environment variable (complete disable)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Bash/Zsh
export DNS_BENCHMARK_NO_FEEDBACK=1

# Windows PowerShell
$env:DNS_BENCHMARK_NO_FEEDBACK="1"

# Permanently (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
echo 'export DNS_BENCHMARK_NO_FEEDBACK=1' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Method 3: Delete state file&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;rm ~/.dns-benchmark/feedback.json&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Method 4: CI/CD environments Feedback prompts are automatically disabled when:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CI=true&lt;/code&gt;environment variable is set (standard in GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--quiet&lt;/code&gt;flag is used&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reset for testing (developers):&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Save results locally&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Is this tool safe to use in production?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes! The tool only performs DNS lookups (read operations). It does NOT:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Modify DNS records&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Perform attacks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Send data to external servers (unless you enable hosted features)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All tests are standard DNS queries that any resolver handles daily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Why do results vary between runs?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DNS performance varies due to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Network conditions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DNS caching (resolver and intermediate)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Server load&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Geographic routing changes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re introducing GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max, our new frontier agentic coding model, available in Codex today. GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is built on an update to our foundational reasoning model, which is trained on agentic tasks across software engineering, math, research, and more. GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is faster, more intelligent, and more token-efficient at every stage of the development cycle–and a new step towards becoming a reliable coding partner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is built for long-running, detailed work. It’s our first model natively trained to operate across multiple context windows through a process called compaction, coherently working over millions of tokens in a single task. This unlocks project-scale refactors, deep debugging sessions, and multi-hour agent loops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is available in Codex today for use in the CLI, IDE extension, cloud, and code review, and API access is coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max was trained on real-world software engineering tasks, like PR creation, code review, frontend coding, and Q&amp;amp;A and outperforms our previous models on many frontier coding evaluations. The model’s gains on benchmarks also come with improvements to real-world usage: GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is the first model we have trained to operate in Windows environments, and the model’s training now includes tasks designed to make it a better collaborator in the Codex CLI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max shows significant improvements in token efficiency due to more effective reasoning. On SWE-bench Verified, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max with ‘medium’ reasoning effort achieves better performance than GPT‑5.1-Codex with the same reasoning effort, while using 30% fewer thinking tokens. For non-latency-sensitive tasks, we’re also introducing a new Extra High (‘xhigh’) reasoning effort, which thinks for an even longer period of time for a better answer. We still recommend medium as the daily driver for most tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We expect the token efficiency improvements to translate to real-world savings for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is able to produce high quality frontend designs with similar functionality and aesthetics, but at much lower cost than GPT‑5.1-Codex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Prompt:&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;code&gt; Generate a single self-contained browser app that renders an interactive CartPole RL sandbox with canvas graphics, a tiny policy-gradient controller, metrics, and an SVG network visualizer.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Features&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Must be able to actually train a policy to make model better at cart pole&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Visualizer for the activations/weights when the model is training or at inference&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Steps in the episode, rewards this episode&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;Last survival time and best survival time in steps&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Save to index.html&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compaction enables GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max to complete tasks that would have previously failed due to context-window limits, such as complex refactors and long-running agent loops by pruning its history while preserving the most important context over long horizons. In Codex applications, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max automatically compacts its session when it approaches its context window limit, giving it a fresh context window. It repeats this process until the task is completed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ability to sustain coherent work over long horizons is a foundational capability on the path toward more general, reliable AI systems. GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max can work independently for hours at a time. In our internal evaluations, we’ve observed GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max work on tasks for more than 24 hours. It will persistently iterate on its implementation, fix test failures, and ultimately deliver a successful result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max performs significantly better on evaluations that require sustained, long-horizon reasoning. Because it can coherently work across multiple context windows using compaction, the model delivers improved results on challenges in areas like long-horizon coding and cybersecurity. We analyzed the results of this model’s performance on first- and third-party evaluations in the GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max system card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max does not reach High capability on Cybersecurity under our Preparedness Framework but it is the most capable cybersecurity model we’ve deployed to date and agentic cybersecurity capabilities are rapidly evolving. As a result, we are taking steps to prepare for High capability on Cybersecurity and are enhancing our safeguards in the cyber domain and working to ensure that defenders can benefit from these improved capabilities through programs like Aardvark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we launched GPT‑5-Codex, we implemented dedicated cybersecurity-specific monitoring to detect and disrupt malicious activity. While we have not observed a meaningful increase in scaled abuse, we are preparing additional mitigations for advanced capabilities. Our teams have already disrupted cyber operations attempting to misuse our models, and suspicious activity is routed for review through our policy monitoring systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Codex is designed to run in a secure sandbox by default: file writes are limited to its workspace, and network access is disabled unless a developer turns it on. We recommend keeping Codex in this restricted-access mode, since enabling internet or web search can introduce prompt-injection risks from untrusted content.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Codex becomes more capable of long-running tasks, it is increasingly important for developers to review the agent’s work before making changes or deploying to production. To assist with this, Codex produces terminal logs and cites its tool calls and test results. While its code reviews reduce the risk of deploying model or human produced bugs to production, Codex should be treated as an additional reviewer and not a replacement for human reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity capabilities can be used for both defense and offense, so we take an iterative deployment approach: learning from real-world use, updating safeguards, and preserving important defensive tools such as automated vulnerability scanning and remediation assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max is available in Codex with ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, and Enterprise plans. For details on how usage limits work for your plan, please see our docs(opens in a new window).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For developers using Codex CLI via API key, we plan to make GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max available in the API soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting today, GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max will replace GPT‑5.1-Codex as the default model in Codex surfaces. Unlike GPT‑5.1, which is a general-purpose model, we recommend using GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max and the Codex family of models only for agentic coding tasks in Codex or Codex-like environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max shows how far models have come in sustaining long-horizon coding tasks, managing complex workflows, and producing high-quality implementations with far fewer tokens. We’ve seen the model combined with steady upgrades to our CLI, IDE extension, cloud integration, and code review tooling result in supercharged engineering productivity: internally, 95% of OpenAI engineers use Codex weekly, and these engineers ship roughly 70% more pull requests since adopting Codex. As we push the frontier of what agents are able to do, we’re excited to see what you'll build with them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The 4-Step Playbook That Launched Pinterest, Harry Potter, and the GameStop Squeeze&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our last edition, we learned the social science that explains why great ideas like new books, apps, or social movements, mostly originate from within small communities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you haven’t read it yet, and you’re curious what Airbnb, Iowa’s corn farmers, and Fifty Shades of Grey have in common, then you check it out here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re going to turn this law into a playbook by answering four key questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What type of community is best for launching a new idea?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Which members of a community should you talk to first?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;How can you maximize the odds that a community will embrace your idea?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a little help from an unruly financial subreddit, a Midwestern blogging conference, and a 1950s farm report, all shall be revealed…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;P.s. More action awaits you in our archives, including how Steve Jobs cultivated great taste, the personality trait shared by 1381 millionaires, and the study that revealed what successful founders, scientists, and terrorists, have in common.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1/4 What type of community is best for launching a new idea?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In September 2019, a small-time financial trader named Keith Gill posted a screenshot online that would rock the financial world. It was a receipt for his $53,000 stock trade in the dying video game retailer, GameStop (GME). Much like a new fashion trend or social app, Gill’s trade was a big idea that he hoped would catch on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gill saw that GME was one of the most heavily 'shorted' stocks, meaning many powerful firms were betting on its collapse. He realized that if the company just stabilized a little, and enough new buyers showed up, those 'shorts' would be trapped. As the stock price rose, they would be forced to buy shares to escape their trade, creating a feedback loop where buying would beget more buying, sending the price violently higher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gill’s trade was a complex contagion, the kind of opportunity that only works if lots of other people decide to believe at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If he had posted his trade in a conventional investing community—say, a cautious value-investing forum or a personal finance subreddit—it likely would have been dismissed as reckless, over-concentrated, or just plain dumb. But Gill chose to post his screenshot in a subreddit called WallStreetBets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WallStreetBets was a rowdy arena of traders who wore their risk tolerance like a badge. Posting your entire net worth in a single trade was a form of entertainment. Members were openly hostile to financial gatekeepers, fluent in an absurd meme language, and narrated their trades in public—turning the markets into an ongoing soap opera.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So when Gill dropped his GameStop trade there, it was like the flap of a butterfly wing that would cause a hurricane. People watched his updates, first with disbelief, then with curiosity, and eventually with admiration as the trading volume in GameStop doubled over the course of the coming year. The number of members following WallStreetBets also doubled in that same timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A narrative began to form: retail underdogs versus smug hedge funds, diamond hands versus paper hands. Just a few months later, GME’s volume was over 20x higher from when Gill first posted, with WSB growing to over 6 million members. An idea that began as an online screenshot quickly vaporized $6.8 billion from one of Wall Street’s biggest hedge funds in a matter of days (an injury from which it never recovered, forcing it to close its doors 18 months later).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gill had found the one community capable of turning his fragile insight into a world-shaping event. Not all communities are created equal in this regard. WallStreetBets had several hallmarks of a high-gain idea community—the kind of place that can amplify a powerful idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WSB shares much in common with other high-gain communities such as the schools and universities that launched social apps like Facebook and Snapchat, the Bronx block parties that gave birth to hip-hop, and the online fan fiction forums that launched Fifty Shades of Grey and more recently, Alchemised. Here are a few of the commonalities they share:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Appetite for risk. Remember that you’re asking people to take a risk when you introduce them to a new idea that’s a complex contagion. Communities that are more open minded and risk tolerant are likely to be receptive to taking on that risk. On WallStreetBets, high-risk bets were the norm. Look for a community that already likes being early and experimental (heck, maybe even a little unhinged)—because those are the people who will actually try something new.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Strong group identity and a clear “other”. WallStreetBets framed itself as degenerate underdogs in a rigged system, with hedge funds as the obvious enemy. Buying and holding GME became a way to perform membership in the tribe. In any niche, if your idea can be adopted as a badge of “people like us” and, implicitly, “not like them,” it can gain an emotional momentum that can’t be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A native storytelling format. There was a common post format on WSB: position screenshot, outrageous caption, unfiltered commentary, then periodic updates. Keith Gill slotted his trade perfectly into that template. A community that has established “story shapes” (build logs, challenges, before/after posts) that your project can inhabit will make it much easier for your idea to spread.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Insider language. “Diamond hands,” apes, tendies—WSB could compress complex feelings about risk, loyalty, and defiance into a few shared symbols. The GameStop trade became shorthand for a whole worldview. For your own launch, communities with lively in-jokes and visual culture can turn your idea into a meme-able token, making it easier to pass along than a carefully worded pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Passionate, single-topic focus. A community that is deeply passionate about one subject is primed for new ideas within that niche. On WallStreetBets, that passion was high-risk trading. A shared passion means members are all paying close attention to the same things, allowing a related idea to capture the entire group's focus quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Keith Gill found the perfect “idea–community fit.” Not only did he choose a community that would be receptive to his idea, he chose one that had all the cultural forces to take it mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how do you find your version of WallStreetBets—the community whose instincts, rituals, and values make it the natural amplifier for your idea? That’s where we’ll go next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2/4 How do you find the right community to introduce your idea to?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2010, Ben Silbermann and his cofounders had a brilliant idea of their own. At the time, almost every app wanted you to generate content from your own life—your status, your photos, your thoughts—to create. But Silbermann believed people would also want an app to gather content based on their own taste—recipes, designs, articles—to curate and collect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This idea was called Pinterest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The good news is that Silbermann was in the perfect place to launch it. He was in the exact same tight-knit Silicon Valley community that launched Twitter, YouTube, and PayPal. Silbermann and his cofounders emailed hundreds of friends and colleagues in the tech community and then excitedly monitored the analytics dashboards for virality. But as the days wore on, their hearts sank.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone tried Pinterest, but few came back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What gives? Silbermann followed our advice from last edition—he targeted a niche community with wide bridges. He even targeted one that had a proven track record of launching big new ideas. Why wasn’t Pinterest sticking?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of desperation, he tried loading up Pinterest on devices in the Apple Store in Palo Alto, and saying loudly, "Wow, this Pinterest thing, it’s really blowing up"... to no avail. As he started to question his faith in his great idea, he noticed something interesting in the dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A small cluster of users were coming back to Pinterest. But they weren't tech bros asking "What should my startup's pitch deck look like?" or "What's the ultimate desk setup?”, these people were asking questions like “What do I want to eat?” and “What do I want my house to look like?” The most engaged persona seemed to be women from the Midwest, much like his own mother and her friends in Des Moines, Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upon realizing this, Silbermann gave up on the tech community and targeted a different one. He flew to Salt Lake City to join a few hundred female design and lifestyle bloggers at a conference called Alt Summit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Alt Summit, the reaction was totally different. As Silbermann talked with attendees, they immediately lit up. He stayed closely connected with them after the event, learning from their behavior and shaping the product around it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This relationship would eventually lead to a simple experiment: bloggers would each make a themed Pinterest board, write a post about it, and pass the baton to the next creator. This became the “Pin It Forward” campaign, and it spread fast—pulling Pinterest into the center of a highly connected blogging community and giving the product its first real wave of growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The takeaway here is simple. Don’t give up on your idea just because one community rejects it. The perfect group may still be out there. And the right community may come as a surprise. The cofounders of Pinterest had no idea their app would strike a chord with female bloggers from the outset. They noticed some unexpected sparks of interest and then followed the smoke until they found the fire. Trial and error is an acceptable strategy when it comes to finding the right seed community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But let’s say you do have a wide-bridged network in your sights, which members do you need to win over first?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3/4 Which members of a community should you talk to first?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our last edition, we learned about Iowa's farmers in the 1930s who were facing a looming drought and severe famine. They famously rejected a 'hybrid corn' seed that was a perfect, life-saving solution, with less than 1% adopting it at first even though 70% knew about it. We learned this was because the new seed was a 'complex contagion'—meaning they didn't need more information, they needed social reinforcement from other farmers in their network before they were willing to take the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the story doesn’t end there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I was researching this case study, I stumbled across a research bulletin from 1950 that went deep into the adoption arc of hybrid corn. As part of the researcher’s analysis, they wanted to know whether certain farmers adopted hybrid corn faster than others. And if so, what made those farmers special? Was it something about their personality, their financial situation, or perhaps their social standing?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They found that there was indeed a huge difference between those who embraced hybrid corn earlier versus later. First off, some of the most obvious assumptions were wrong. The researchers found that being a "leader" in the community—someone who held office in a local organization—had no relationship to being a leader in adopting the new corn seed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, what did make the early adopters special? The key persona was a farmer who was both open-minded and socially active. The faster adopters were significantly younger—where the fastest had an average age of just 38, while the most resistant farmers averaged nearly 56.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Education was another massive factor: almost 66% of the fast adopters had more than an eighth-grade education, and almost 33% had some college experience. But in the most resistant group? Not one single farmer had gone past the eighth grade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The faster adopters were also more hungry for knowledge—reading on average, eleven times more bulletins from the state's agricultural college than the late adopters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But many of the biggest differences between the early and the late were found in their social habits. The fast adopters simply showed up in more places, more often. They belonged to three times as many organizations, took more trips to the "big city" (Des Moines), and were more likely to attend movies, athletic events, and other commercialized recreation. They were the most active participants in their community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This would suggest the people we want to connect with first within a community are those who are most receptive to new ideas and also those who are most socially active.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But can we trust the findings of a study conducted 70 years ago on an event that happened 20 years even prior to that? Modern sociology studies suggest that yes, we can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2016, researchers at Princeton, Rutgers, and Yale Universities published a study that echoes our 1950 bulletin. But they didn’t study the spread of crops, they studied the spread of social norms in 56 New Jersey middle schools. Specifically, they wanted to see if they could get a new idea off the ground—an idea that's notoriously difficult to spread in a middle school: that everyday bullying and conflict just isn’t "cool" anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And provided they could make this idea popular, and measurably reduce instances of bullying, which students would be key to making it happen?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Half of the 56 schools were designated as the control group—they just went about their year as usual with no interference by the researchers. In the other half of the schools, the researchers came in and randomly selected a small "seed group" of 20 to 32 students. They encouraged each seed group to become the public face against bullying. The kids took charge, designing their own anti-conflict posters, creating hashtag slogans, and handing out bright orange wristbands to other students they saw doing something friendly or stopping a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of the full school year, the researchers checked in to figure out whether conflict decreased in the seed schools relative to the control group schools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results were impressive. Across the board, the schools with the anti-bullying program saw their official disciplinary reports for peer conflict drop by an estimated 30% over the school year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here is where our corn farmers come back in. The 30% figure was just the average across schools. Some seed groups were dramatically more successful than others. The researchers found that the success of each school’s program depended almost entirely on who was in its seed group. There was a specific type of student who had an outsized impact. The more of this one persona a group had, the more powerful that group was at changing the school's norms and reducing conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It wasn't the "popular" kids, at least not in the way we usually think. Just like being a "leader" in a farm bureau had no bearing on adopting new corn, the researchers found that traditional, subjective measures like "popularity" or "friendship" weren't the magic ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The students who mattered most were the ones identified by a very specific survey question: "Who did you choose to spend time with in the last few weeks?". The most influential students were ones who spent time with the most number of people. They were the most socially active—those who were present in more social interactions than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can think of these kids as “social dandelions”. Just as a dandelion is one of the most common and widely seen flowers, these students are the ones who are most present and visible to the most different people across the entire social ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The effect of social dandelions was massive: in schools where the seed group had the highest proportion of these key students, the program reduced bullying by 60%—double the average.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of the most influential people in a community are the most present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dandelions are the people you need to win over first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is actually the strategy that Bloomsbury used to seed one of the most viral ideas of all time—the first ever Harry Potter book. In their initial publishing release they only had 500 books to give away for promotions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What community is the most effective target for a children’s book, they asked?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, where did children go to read books in 1997? Libraries of course. And within that community, who are the most present and well connected dandelions? Librarians! So Bloomberg gave away 300 of their 500 books to librarians, who then recommended Harry Potter to kids and parents. By effectively seeding the idea in dozens of targeted communities across the UK, the stage was set for the explosion in popularity and the powerhouse literary universe we all know of today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now you know which type of community to target, how to find the right one for your idea, and who you need to talk to—one question remains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do you convince a dandelion to adopt your new idea?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4/4 How do you convince a dandelion to embrace your idea?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2006, Scott Belsky and his team had done everything right to get their great idea off the ground. Almost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They had created a portfolio website called Behance that allowed creative professionals to showcase their work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scott was deeply embedded in the design community that Behance was founded to serve and he was pitching dandelion designers to upload their portfolios to his site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite following all three steps in the playbook we’ve outlined so far, it still wasn’t good enough. “Inviting top designers to showcase their portfolio on a website they could barely pronounce and had never heard of was a fruitless endeavor,” Scott admits. “Nobody cared or had the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s when Scott’s team realized Behance was a complex contagion. To engage with it, designers had to pay an adoption cost. The cost of using their site was the effort and time required to create an entire portfolio using unfamiliar software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of taking no for an answer, Scott just paid the adoption cost for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We contacted the 100 designers and artists we admired most and instead asked if we could interview them for a blog on productivity in the creative world. Nearly all of them said yes. After asking a series of questions over email, we offered to construct a portfolio on their behalf on Behance, alongside the blog post. Nobody declined. This initiative yielded a v1 of Behance that was jam-packed with projects, each from 100 top creatives, built the way we wanted. This manual labor was the most important thing we ever did.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re pitching an idea to a dandelion that requires any effort whatsoever to engage with—your job is to figure out how to lower that effort to the maximum possible degree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take every risk off the table you can think of, including time, money, effort, decision fatigue, and reputation. Make it as cheap, fast, easy, and safe to engage with your idea as possible (at first!).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Follow the four steps in this playbook and you’ll give your great ideas a fighting chance at reaching escape velocity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because as we like to say around these parts, it’s not about ideas, it’s about making ideas happen.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The order that gave the Netherlands powers to block or revise decisions at Nijmegen-based Nexperia was dropped as “a show of goodwill,” Economic Affairs Minister Vincent Karremans said Wednesday, adding that discussions with Chinese authorities are continuing.&lt;/p&gt;

Abbott's office redacts pages of emails about Elon Musk</title><link>https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-11-19/texas-governor-abbott-elon-musk-emails-redacted</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="f697535916709739"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article is co-published with ProPublica and The Texas Tribune as part of an initiative to report on how power is wielded in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Got something you want us to investigate? Email us at tips@kut.org.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Months after fighting to keep secret the emails exchanged between Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s office and tech billionaire Elon Musk’s companies, state officials released nearly 1,400 pages to The Texas Newsroom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The records, however, reveal little about the two men’s relationship or Musk’s influence over state government. In fact, all but about 200 of the pages are entirely blacked out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of those that were readable, many were either already public or provided minimal information. They included old incorporation records for Musk’s rocket company SpaceX, a couple of agendas for the governor’s committee on aerospace and aviation, emails regarding a state grant awarded to SpaceX and an application from a then-Musk employee to sit on a state commission.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One is an invitation to happy hour. Another is a reminder of the next SpaceX launch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The documents were provided in response to a public records request by The Texas Newsroom, which asked Abbott’s office for communications with Musk and the businessman’s employees dating back to last fall. Abbott’s and Musk’s lawyers fought their release, arguing they would reveal trade secrets, potentially “intimate and embarrassing” exchanges or confidential legal and policymaking discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Abbott’s spokesperson, Andrew Mahaleris, said the governor’s office “rigorously complies with the Texas Public Information Act and releases any responsive information that is determined to not be confidential or excepted from disclosure.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open government experts say the limited disclosure is emblematic of a larger transparency problem in Texas. They pointed to a 2015 state Supreme Court decision that allowed companies to oppose the release of records by arguing that they contain “competitively sensitive” information. The ruling, experts said, made it harder to obtain records documenting interactions between governments and private companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tom Leatherbury, who directs the First Amendment Clinic at Southern Methodist University’s Dedman School of Law, said companies took advantage of the ruling. Among the most prominent examples of the ruling’s effect on transparency was McAllen's refusal to disclose how much money was spent to lure pop star Enrique Iglesias to the city for a concert. The city argued that such disclosures would hurt its ability to negotiate with artists for future performances. Eventually, it was revealed that Iglesias was paid nearly half a million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem has been exacerbated, Leatherbury added, by the fact that the Office of the Attorney General, which referees public records disputes, does not have the power to investigate whether the records that companies want to withhold actually contain trade secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Corporations are willing to assert that information is confidential, commercial information, and more governmental bodies are willing not to second-guess the company’s assertion,” Leatherbury said. (Leatherbury has performed pro bono legal work for The Texas Newsroom.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Musk and his companies’ representatives did not respond to questions about the records.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the richest people in the world, Musk has invested heavily in Texas. He’s relocated many of his businesses’ headquarters to the state and hired lobbyists who successfully pushed for several new laws that will benefit his companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of an effort to track Musk’s clout in the state Capitol, The Texas Newsroom on April 20 asked Abbott’s office for communications with employees from four of the businessman’s companies: SpaceX, car manufacturer Tesla, the social media site X and Neuralink, which specializes in brain nanotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The governor’s office said it would cost $244.64 to review the documents, which The Texas Newsroom paid. After the check was cashed, lawyers representing Abbott’s office and SpaceX each sought to keep the records secret.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s lawyer sent a letter to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dated June 26, saying that publicly releasing the emails would hurt its competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Abbott’s public information coordinator, Matthew Taylor, also asked Paxton’s office for permission to withhold the documents, arguing they included private exchanges with lawyers, details about policymaking decisions and information that would reveal how the state entices companies to invest here. Taylor said some of the records were protected under an exception to public records laws known as “common-law privacy” because they consisted of “information that is intimate and embarrassing and not of legitimate concern to the public.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Releasing the Musk emails, he said, would have a “chilling effect on the frank and open discussion necessary for the decision-making process.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Paxton’s office mostly sided with Abbott and Musk. In a Aug. 11 opinion, Assistant Attorney General Erin Groff wrote that many of the documents could be withheld. Groff, however, ordered the release of some records determined to be “either not highly intimate or embarrassing” or of “legitimate public interest.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A month later, the governor’s office released 1,374 pages of records, the vast majority of which were completely redacted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some records included a note that appeared to explain why. A note on page 401, for example, cited the exemption for competitive bidding records for 974 redacted pages. Names and emails of Musk’s employees were also removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The fact that a governmental body can redact more than 1,000 pages of documents that are directly related to a major business’s activities in Texas is certainly problematic,” said Reid Pillifant, an attorney specializing in public records and media law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He and other experts said such hurdles are becoming more common as legislation and court decisions have weakened the state’s public records laws.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Four years after the 2015 Supreme Court decision, legislators passed a new law that was meant to ensure the release of basic information about government deals with private businesses. But open government experts said the law did not go far enough to restore transparency, adding that some local governments are still objecting to the release of contract information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, lawmakers continue to add carve-outs to what qualifies as public information every legislative session. Just this year, for example, legislators added the following exceptions to public records and open meetings laws: information relating to how government entities detect and deter fraud and discussions during public government meetings about certain military and aerospace issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even with the increasing challenges of accessing public records, Leatherbury and Pillifant were stumped by the governor’s decision to release thousands of pages only to black them out fully. Leatherbury said that the governor’s office may have wanted to show the volume of records responsive to the request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They wanted you to see what little you could get in the context of the entire document, even though that’s kind of meaningless,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Texas Newsroom has asked the Office of the Attorney General to reconsider its decision and order the release of the Musk emails. There is little other recourse to challenge the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a member of the public believes a government agency is violating the law, they can try to sue. But the experts noted that a recent Texas Supreme Court decision made it more difficult to enforce the public records law against the governor and other executive officers. Now, Leatherbury said, it’s not clear how challenging such a records decision would work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Every Texas citizen should care about access to these kinds of records because they shed light on how our public officials are making big decisions that affect the land where people live and how their taxpayer dollars are being spent,” Pillifant said.&lt;/p&gt;
