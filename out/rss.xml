  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Claude is a space to think&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns, and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want Claude to act unambiguously in our users’ interests. So we’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won’t see “sponsored” links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The nature of AI conversations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When people use search engines or social media, they’ve come to expect a mixture of organic and sponsored content. Filtering signal from noise is part of the interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conversations with AI assistants are meaningfully different. The format is open-ended; users often share context and reveal more than they would in a search query. This openness is part of what makes conversations with AI valuable, but it’s also what makes them susceptible to influence in ways that other digital products are not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our analysis of conversations with Claude (conducted in a way that keeps all data private and anonymous) shows that an appreciable portion involve topics that are sensitive or deeply personal—the kinds of conversations you might have with a trusted advisor. Many other uses involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work, or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous—and, in many cases, inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We still have much to learn about the impact of AI models on the people who use them. Early research suggests both benefits—like people finding support they couldn’t access elsewhere—and risks, including the potential for models to reinforce harmful beliefs in vulnerable users. Introducing advertising incentives at this stage would add another level of complexity. Our understanding of how models translate the goals we set them into specific behaviors is still developing; an ad-based system could therefore have unpredictable results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Incentive structures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being genuinely helpful is one of the core principles of Claude’s Constitution, the document that describes our vision for Claude’s character and guides how we train the model. An advertising-based business model would introduce incentives that could work against this principle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider a concrete example. A user mentions they’re having trouble sleeping. An assistant without advertising incentives would explore the various potential causes—stress, environment, habits, and so on—based on what might be most insightful to the user. An ad-supported assistant has an additional consideration: whether the conversation presents an opportunity to make a transaction. These objectives may often align—but not always. And, unlike a list of search results, ads that influence a model’s responses may make it difficult to tell whether a given recommendation comes with a commercial motive or not. Users shouldn’t have to second-guess whether an AI is genuinely helping them or subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even ads that don’t directly influence an AI model’s responses and instead appear separately within the chat window would compromise what we want Claude to be: a clear space to think and work. Such ads would also introduce an incentive to optimize for engagement—for the amount of time people spend using Claude and how often they return. These metrics aren’t necessarily aligned with being genuinely helpful. The most useful AI interaction might be a short one, or one that resolves the user’s request without prompting further conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recognize that not all advertising implementations are equivalent. More transparent or opt-in approaches—where users explicitly choose to see sponsored content—might avoid some of the concerns outlined above. But the history of ad-supported products suggests that advertising incentives, once introduced, tend to expand over time as they become integrated into revenue targets and product development, blurring boundaries that were once more clear-cut. We’ve chosen not to introduce these dynamics into Claude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our approach&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic is focused on businesses, developers, and helping our users flourish. Our business model is straightforward: we generate revenue through enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions, and we reinvest that revenue into improving Claude for our users. This is a choice with tradeoffs, and we respect that other AI companies might reasonably reach different conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expanding access to Claude is central to our public benefit mission, and we want to do it without selling our users’ attention or data to advertisers. To that end, we’ve brought AI tools and training to educators in over 60 countries, begun national AI education pilots with multiple governments, and made Claude available to nonprofits at a significant discount. We continue to invest in our smaller models so that our free offering remains at the frontier of intelligence, and we may consider lower-cost subscription tiers and regional pricing where there is clear demand for it. Should we need to revisit this approach, we’ll be transparent about our reasons for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Supporting commerce&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI will increasingly interact with commerce, and we look forward to supporting this in ways that help our users. We’re particularly interested in the potential of agentic commerce, where Claude acts on a user’s behalf to handle a purchase or booking end to end. And we’ll continue to build features that enable our users to find, compare, or buy products, connect with businesses, and more—when they choose to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re also exploring more ways to make Claude a focused space to be at your most productive. Users can already connect third-party tools they use for work—like Figma, Asana, and Canva—and interact with them directly within Claude. We expect to introduce many more useful integrations and expand this toolkit over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All third-party interactions will be grounded in the same overarching design principle: they should be initiated by the user (where the AI is working for them) rather than an advertiser (where the AI is working, at least in part, for someone else). Today, whether someone asks Claude to research running shoes, compare mortgage rates, or recommend a restaurant for a special occasion, Claude’s only incentive is to give a helpful answer. We’d like to preserve that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A trusted tool for thought&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want our users to trust Claude to help them keep thinking—about their work, their challenges, and their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our experience of using the internet has made it easy to assume that advertising on the products we use is inevitable. But open a notebook, pick up a well-crafted tool, or stand in front of a clean chalkboard, and there are no ads in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We think Claude should work the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

In its standard form, self-attention incurs costs that increase with context length, driving demand for storage, compute, and energy that is now outstripping society's ability to provide them. To help address this issue, we show that self-attention is efficiently computable to arbitrary precision with constant cost per token, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in memory use and computation. We derive our formulation by decomposing the conventional formulation's Taylor expansion into expressions over symmetric chains of tensor products. We exploit their symmetry to obtain feed-forward transformations that efficiently map queries and keys to coordinates in a minimal polynomial-kernel feature basis. Notably, cost is fixed inversely in proportion to head size, enabling application over a greater number of heads per token than otherwise feasible. We implement our formulation and empirically validate its correctness. Our work enables unbounded token generation at modest fixed cost, substantially reducing the infrastructure and energy demands of large-scale Transformer models. The mathematical techniques we introduce are of independent interest.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current browse context: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cs.LG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A case study in PDF forensics: The Epstein PDFs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;December 22, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;December 22, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About Peter Wyatt, PDF Association&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The recent release of a tranche of files by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) under the “Epstein Files Transparency Act (H.R.4405)” has once again prompted many people to closely examine redacted and sanitized PDF documents. Our previous articles on the Manafort papers and the Mueller report, as well as a study by Adhatarao, S. and Lauradoux, C. (2021) “Exploitation and Sanitization of Hidden Data in PDF Files: Do Security Agencies Sanitize Their PDF files?,” in Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Workshop on Information Hiding and Multimedia Security, illustrate the importance of robust sanitization and redaction workflows when handling sensitive documents prior to release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article examines a small random selection of the Epstein PDF files from a purely digital forensic perspective, focusing on the PDF syntax and idioms they contain, any malformations or unusual constructs, and other technical aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PDFs are more challenging to analyze than many other formats because they are binary files that require specialized knowledge, expertise, and software. Please note that we did not analyze the contents of the PDF documents. Not every PDF was examined. Any mention of products (or appearance in screen-shots) does not imply any endorsement or support of any information, products, or providers whatsoever. We are not lawyers; this article does not constitute legal advice&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We offer this information, in part, as some of the Epstein PDFs released by DoJ are beginning to appear on malware analysis sites (such as Hybrid-Analysis) with various kinds of incorrect analysis and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;26 December 2025 update&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After we'd completed our analysis the DoJ released a new dataset, DataSet 8.zip. This new ZIP file is 9.95 GB compressed and contains over 11,000 files, including 10,593 new PDFs totaling 1.8 GB and 29,343 pages (the longest document has 1,060 pages). DataSet 8 also contains many large MP4 movies, Excel spreadsheets, and various other files. The first PDF in the set of 10,593 PDFs is VOL00008\IMAGES\0001\EFTA00009676.pdf, and the last file is VOL00008\IMAGES\0011\EFTA00039023.pdf. A cursory analysis shows pdfinfo properties similar to those from the earlier datasets, but we have not otherwise analyzed this new dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since our original post, various social media and news platforms have also been announcing “recoverable redactions” from the “Epstein Files”. We stand by our analysis; DoJ has correctly redacted the EFTA PDFs in Datasets 01-07, and they do not contain recoverable text as alleged. As our article states, we did not analyze any other DoJ or Epstein-related documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the featured image in this Guardian news article (which was also picked up by the New York Times) corresponds to VOL00004\IMAGES\0001EFTA00005855.pdf, as can be easily determined by searching for the Bates Numbers in the EFTA “.OPT” data files. The information in this EFTA PDF is fully and correctly redacted; there is no hidden information. The only extractable text is some garbled text from the poor-quality OCR and, as expected, the Bates Numbers on each page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the few reports we investigated (including from Forbes and Ed Krassenstein on both X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram), these stories misrepresent other DoJ files that were not part of the major DataSets 01-07 release on December 19 under the EFTA. All PDFs released under EFTA have a Bates Number on every page starting "EFTA". These include “Case 1:22-cv-10904-JSR Document 1-1, Exhibit 1 to Government’s Complaint against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.” (see page 41) and “Case No: ST-20-CV-14 Government Exhibit 1” (see page 19). These PDFs, previously released by the DoJ, do contain incorrect and ineffective redactions, with black boxes that simply obscure text, making “copy &amp;amp; paste” easy to recover the text that's otherwise hidden. Clearly, DoJ processes and systems in the past have inadequately redacted information!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The files we examined&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tranche released by DoJ on Friday, December 19 is available as seven “data sets”, most easily downloaded as seven ZIP archives totaling just under 2.97 GB. Each ZIP file contains a similar folder structure, with DataSet 6 being the odd one out with an extra top-level folder. Once unzipped, the total size is 2.99 GB. The tranche contains 4,085 PDF files, a single AVI (movie) file (located in the folder VOL00002\NATIVES\0001), and 2 data files (.DAT and .OPT) for each ZIP archive. The “.OPT” files appear to be CSV (Comma-Separated Values) but lack a heading row, while the “.DAT” files contain information about the Bates numbering. The analysis we provide here is limited to the PDF files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PDF files are named and ordered sequentially within the folder structure, starting with “EFTA00000001.pdf” in VOL00001 and ending with “EFTA00009664.pdf” in VOL00007, indicating that at least 5,879 PDF files remain unreleased.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A random sampling of the PDFs for visual review suggests that they are a mix of single and multi-page full-page photos and scanned content. OCR (Optical Character Recognition) was used to provide some searchable and extractable text in at least some files. “Black box” style redactions (without text reasons) are apparent. When done correctly, this is the appropriate way to redact, far more robust than pixelating text. The PDFs we sampled did not include any obviously “born digital” documents. Various news sites are reporting very heavily redacted documents within this tranche.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;File validity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A precursor to most forensic examinations is to establish whether the PDF files are technically valid (that is, conform to the rules of the PDF format), since analyzing malformed files can easily lead to incorrect results or wrong conclusions. Combining tools that use different methods provides the broadest possible information while ensuring that tooling limitations are fully understood. However, if the basic file structure or cross-reference information is incorrect, various software might then draw different conclusions and/or construct different Document Object Models (DOMs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to basic file structure, incremental updates (if any), and cross-reference information, PDF validity assessments include the objects that comprise the PDF’sDOM as well as the file structure, incremental updates, and cross-reference information. To assess relationships between objects in the PDF DOM, some forensic analysis tools leverage our Arlington PDF Data Model, while others use their own internal methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our analysis of file validity, using a multitude of PDF forensic tools, identified only one minor defect (invalidity); 109 PDFs had a positive FontDescriptor Descent value rather than a negative one. This is a relatively common (but minor) error, typically associated with font substitution and font matching, that does not affect the validity of the files overall. One specific forensic tool reported a PDF version issue with some files, related to the document catalog Version entry, which prevented the tool from further verifying those specific PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;PDF versions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve previously written about the unreliability of PDF version numbers. Still, for forensic purposes, they may provide insight into the DoJ’s software, and whether improved software could have performed better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used two different but commonly used PDF command-line &lt;code&gt;pdfinfo&lt;/code&gt; utilities on different platforms (Windows and Ubuntu Linux) to summarize information about these PDF files. When run against the full tranche of PDFs, I got two very different sets of answers! Immediately, my spidey senses started to tingle, and I was once again reminded of a key lesson in digital document forensics – you should never trust a single tool!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Reported PDF Version&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Count Tool A&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Count Tool B&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;209&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3,817&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3,875&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;267&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;TOTAL (should be 4,085)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4,085&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4,085&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PDF version in the file header, “&lt;code&gt;%PDF-x.y&lt;/code&gt;”, is nominally the first line in every PDF file (based on the not-unreasonable assumption that the PDF files have no “junk bytes” before this PDF file identifier). Using the Linux command line, you can run in Linux “&lt;code&gt;head -n 1 file.pdf&lt;/code&gt;” to extract the first header line from each PDF and compare it with the reported results from each tool. Or run in Linux “&lt;code&gt;grep -P --text --byte-offset "%PDF-\d\.\d" *.pdf&lt;/code&gt;” to confirm that there are no junk bytes prior to the PDF header line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason for the difference reported in the table above is that Tool B is not accounting for the Version entry in the document catalog of PDFs with incremental updates. We’ll next investigate whether this is due to malformed files or a programming error. When properly accounting for incremental updates, however, Tool A is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the same &lt;code&gt;pdfinfo&lt;/code&gt; output (and again comparing results from both tools), we can also quickly establish the following facts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No PDF is tagged&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No PDF is encrypted&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No PDF is “optimized” (technically, Linearized PDF)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No PDF has any annotations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No PDF has any outlines (bookmarks)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No PDF contains any embedded files&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;None of the PDFs are forms&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;None of the PDFs contains JavaScript&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Page counts range from 1 (in 3,818 PDFs) to 119 pages (in two PDFs), totaling 9,659 pages across all 4,085 PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Incremental updates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PDF’s incremental updates feature allows multiple revisions of a document to be stored in a PDF file. As the name implies, each set of deltas is appended to the original document, forming a chain of edits. When read by conforming PDF software, a PDF is always processed from the end of the file, effectively applying the deltas to the original document and to any previous incremental updates. Both the original document and each incremental update can be recognized by their respective “&lt;code&gt;xref&lt;/code&gt;” and “&lt;code&gt;%%EOF&lt;/code&gt;” markers (assuming that the PDF files are structured correctly).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this investigation, we started by examining the very first PDF in the tranche: VOL00001\IMAGES\0001\EFTA00000001.pdf. This PDF had different PDF versions reported by different versions of &lt;code&gt;pdfinfo&lt;/code&gt;. A simple trick to check if a PDF contains incremental updates is to search for these special markers while treating the PDF as a text file (which it isn’t!):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ grep -P --text -–byte-offset "(xref)|(%%EOF)" EFTA00000001.pdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;371340:xref&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; 371758:startxref&lt;lb/&gt; 371775:%%EOF&lt;lb/&gt; 372977:startxref&lt;lb/&gt; 372994:%%EOF&lt;lb/&gt; 373961:startxref&lt;lb/&gt; 373978:%%EOF&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These results (sorted by byte offset) indicate that EFTA00000001.pdf contains two incremental updates after the original file. The lack of an “&lt;code&gt;xref&lt;/code&gt;” marker before the last two “&lt;code&gt;startxref&lt;/code&gt;” markers indicate that neither incremental updates uses conventional cross-reference data, but may use cross-reference streams (if any objects are changed).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bates numbering&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As referenced above, Bates numbering is the process by which every page is assigned a unique identifier. For this tranche of Epstein PDF files, Bates numbers were added to each page via a separate incremental update, as shown below in Visual Studio Code with my pdf-cos-syntax extension. Note that DoJ’s PDFs are primarily text-based internally, making forensic analysis a lot easier - and the files a lot bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line 2984 is the end-of-file marker for the file version, and line 2985 starts a new incremental update section.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lines 2985-2987 define object 26, the unembedded Helvetica font resource used by the Bates number.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lines 2997-3020 are the modified page object (object 3), replacing the page object in previous revisions of the file.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line 2999 is the page Contents array, comprising five separate content streams, with the 3rd stream (object 29) being the Bates numbering added in this incremental update. Object 30 is an empty content stream that could have been removed by an optimization process.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line 3034 sets the Helvetica font to 12 point.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line 3037 uses a hexadecimal string to paint the Bates number onto the page.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idiom for this final incremental update, which adds the Bates number to every page, appears in all the PDF files we selected at random for investigation. This specific incremental update always uses a cross-reference stream (&lt;code&gt;/Type /XRef&lt;/code&gt;) and relies on the previous incremental update, in which the document catalog Version entry is set to PDF 1.5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The first incremental update&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The VSCode pdf-cos-syntax extension also indicates (correctly!) that the original PDF is missing the required (when the PDF contains binary data, which most do) comment as the second line of the file that indicates to software that the PDF file needs to be treated as binary data (ISO 32000-2:2020, §7.5.2). Although the missing comment does not make the PDF invalid per se, without such a marker close to the top of each PDF, software may think the PDF is a text file, and thus potentially corrupt the PDF by changing line endings, which would break the byte offsets in the cross-reference data. In this PDF, the first incremental update adds this marker comment after a lot of binary data, which is pointless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, the first incremental update changed the document catalog Version entry to PDF 1.5, as we see in this next screenshot:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lines 2953-2984 are the incremental update section.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line 2954 is a PDF comment. PDF comments always start with a PERCENT SIGN (&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;) and may occur in many places in PDF files. Effective sanitization and redaction workflows typically remove all comments from PDFs because they may inadvertently disclose information, but this exact comment appears in 3,608 other PDF files. The origin or meaning of this comment was not further investigated.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line 2964 upgrades the PDF version to 1.5. At first glance, this may appear to be perfectly valid PDF, but it is technically incorrect because the file header is &lt;code&gt;%PDF-1.3&lt;/code&gt;yet the Version key was only added in PDF 1.4 - this is what the strict file validation tool mentioned above had noticed. As object 24 is a compressed object stream (lines 2966-2973) and object 25 is a compressed cross-reference stream (lines 2974-2981), the indicated version should be PDF 1.5. As a practical matter, however, this level of technical detail does not impact operation or behavior of PDFs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line 2984 is the end-of-section “&lt;code&gt;%%EOF&lt;/code&gt;” marker for this incremental update section.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As this section of the PDF uses compressed object streams, specialized PDF forensic tools must be used… simple search methodologies, such as those mentioned above, may not identify everything!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know that there are 7 objects (because we find /&lt;code&gt;N 7&lt;/code&gt;) inside the object stream:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As per PDF’s specification, ISO 32000-2:2020, §7.5.7, the first line of integers is interpreted as N pairs, where the first integer is the object number and the second integer is the byte offset relative to the first object in the object stream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="5"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1st integer (object number)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2nd integer (start offset)&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Content&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;23&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;472&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Array of 2 indirect references (to content streams)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[21 0 R 4 0 R]&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;486&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is very interesting here – from a PDF forensics perspective – is the fact of a hidden document information dictionary that is not referenced from the last (final) incremental update trailer (i.e., there is no Info entry in object 31, lines 3050-3063 below). As such, this orphaned dictionary is invisible to PDF software! This oddity occurs in all other PDFs we’d randomly selected for investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Formatted nicely as an uncompressed object, this hidden document information dictionary inside the compressed object stream contains the following information (the CreationDate and ModDate appear to change in other randomly examined PDFs):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;17 0 obj &amp;lt;&amp;lt; /CreationDate (D:20251218143205) /ModDate (D:20251218143205) /Creator (OmniPage CSDK 21.1) /Producer (Processing-CLI) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; endobj&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This metadata clearly indicates the software DoJ used to manipulate these PDF files. Although not relevant to the content, this forensic discovery clearly shows that extra care is required when sanitizing PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Different incremental updates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another randomly selected PDF, VOL00003\IMAGES\0001\EFTA00003939.pdf contains 3 full-page images, and just a single incremental update that applies the Bates numbering. However, in this case the file header is &lt;code&gt;%PDF-1.5&lt;/code&gt; yet both the original PDF and incremental update use conventional cross-reference tables! This isn’t problematic, but is certainly unexpected and inefficient since PDF 1.5 introduced compressed cross-reference streams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By comparing the objects in the incremental cross-reference table to the original cross-reference table we can see that objects 66 to 69 – the 3 Page objects for the 3 page document – were redefined. This is just what is expected in order to add the Bates number to each page’s Contents stream as in the previous example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Metadata&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our initial examination using pdfinfo utilities did not identify any metadata in any of the PDFs in the tranche, either in the document information dictionary (PDF file trailer Info entry) or as an XMP metadata stream (Metadata entry).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, since we know that (a) the tranche includes PDFs with incremental updates, and (b) that an orphaned document information dictionary exists, all revisions of a document should be thoroughly examined. Incremental updates may have marked other document information dictionaries or XMP metadata streams as free but not deleted the actual data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;XMP metadata is always encoded in PDF as a stream object, and since stream objects cannot be in compressed object streams, using forensic tools to search for keys “&lt;code&gt;/XML&lt;/code&gt;” or “&lt;code&gt;/Metadata&lt;/code&gt;” should always locate them. All modern office suites and PDF creation applications will generate XMP metadata when exporting to PDF. As XMP is usually uncompressed, searching for XML fragments may also be helpful (see below for an example XMP object fragment).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;3 0 obj &amp;lt;&amp;lt;/Length 36996/Subtype/XML/Type/Metadata&amp;gt;&amp;gt; stream &amp;lt;?xpacket begin="ï»¿" id="W5M0MpCe … zNTczkc9d"?&amp;gt; &amp;lt;x:xmpmeta xmlns:x="adobe:ns:meta/" x:xmptk=" … "&amp;gt; &amp;lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"&amp;gt; &amp;lt;rdf:Description rdf:about="" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:xmp="http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/" ...&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not unsurprisingly for properly-redacted files, we did not find any XMP metadata streams or XML in any PDF. As a consequence, none of the PDFs can declare conformance to either PDF/A (ISO 19005 for long-term archiving) or PDF/UA (ISO 14289 for accessibility). Of course, as untagged PDFs, the files cannot conform to accessibility specifications such as PDF/UA or WCAG in any event. Additionally, none of the PDFs appear to include device-independent color spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The presence of an Info entry in the trailer dictionary or (in PDFs with cross-reference streams) in the cross-reference stream dictionary indicates the presence of document information dictionaries. “&lt;code&gt;/Info&lt;/code&gt;” does indeed occur in many of the PDFs, including multiple times in some PDFs, indicating potential changes via incremental updates. However, as discovered above, in some cases the final incremental update does not include an Info entry, thus “orphaning” any existing document information dictionaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ISO 32000-2:2020, Table 349 lists the defined entries in PDF’s document information dictionary (Title, Author, Subject, etc). Any vendor may add additional entries (such as Apple does with its /AAPL:Keywords entry), so redaction and sanitization software should be aware of extra entries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From our random sampling, we identified one PDF with a non-trivial document information dictionary still present: VOL00002\IMAGES\0001\EFTA00003212.pdf. This is shown below in Visual Studio Code with my pdf-cos-syntax extension:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of additional interest in this specific PDF is that the comment at line 60 has survived DoJ’s sanitization and redaction workflow! Other PDF comments may therefore also be present in other files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EFTA00003212.pdf appears to be a redacted image or an error from the DoJ workflow, as it is a single page with the text “No Images Produced”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simple searching of the standardized PDF document information dictionary entries gives the following (note that the technique used will not locate information in compressed object streams, as mentioned above):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Key name&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Number of PDFs (max. = 4,085)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Comment&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Info&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3,823&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Some PDFs have empty Info dictionaries with no entries&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Title&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;APPL:Keywords&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Date analysis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Detailed date analysis is a common task in the forensic analysis of potentially fraudulent or modified documents. However, in the case of redacted or sanitized documents, where the document is known to have been modified, this can be less useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The creation and modification dates for the 3,609 PDFs range from December 18, 2025, 14:32:05 (2:32 pm) to December 19, 2025, 23:26:13 (almost midnight). For all files, the creation and modification dates are always the same. This may also imply that the DoJ batch processing to prepare this tranche of PDFs took at least 36 hours!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s also interesting is that the CreationDate and ModDate fields in the hidden document information dictionary (inside the object stream of the first increment update – see above) appear to always be an exact match to both the CreationDate and ModDate of the original document. This implies that all dates across all incremental updates were updated in a single processing pass that applied the Bates numbering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Photographs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are no JPEG images (DCTDecode filter) in any PDF in the tranche, including the full-page photographs. Randomly viewing the photographic images at high magnification (zoom) in PDF viewers clearly shows JPEG “jaggy” compression artifacts. All photographic images appear to have been downscaled to 96 DPI (769 x 1152 or 1152 x 769 pixels), making text on random objects in the photos much harder to discern (see the OCR discussion below).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DoJ explicitly avoids JPEG images in the PDFs probably because they appreciate that JPEGs often contain identifiable information, such as EXIF, IPTC, or XMP metadata, as well as COM (comment) tags in the JPEG bitstream. This information may disclose the camera model and serial number, GPS location, camera operator details, date/time of the photo, etc., and is more difficult to redact while retaining the JPEG data. The DoJ processing pipeline has therefore explicitly converted all lossy JPEG images to low DPI, FLATE-encoded bitmaps in the PDFs using an indexed device-dependent color space with a palette of 256 unique colors (which reduces the color fidelity compared to the original high-quality digital color photograph).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Scanned documents – or are they?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Randomly inspecting the tranche discovers many documents that appear to have been created by a scanning process. On closer inspection, there are documents that have tell-tale artifacts from a physical scanning process, such as visible physical paper edges, punched holes, staple marks, spiral binding, stamps, paper scuff marks, color blotches and inconsistencies, handwritten notes or marginalia, varying paper skew, and platen marks from the physical paper scanning processes. For example, VOL00007\IMAGES\0001\EFTA00009440.pdf shows many of these aspects&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also other documents that appear to simulate a scanned document but completely lack the “real-world noise” expected with physical paper-based workflows. The much crisper images appear almost perfect without random artifacts or background noise, and with the exact same amount of image skew across multiple pages. Thanks to the borders around each page of text, page skew can easily be measured, such as with VOL00007\IMAGES\0001\EFTA00009229.pdf. It is highly likely these PDFs were created by rendering original content (from a digital document) to an image (e.g., via print to image or save to image functionality) and then applying image processing such as skew, downscaling, and color reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of the timeless monospaced (also known as fixed-width) “Courier” typeface means that the number of characters redacted can be easily determined by vertical alignment with text lines above and below each redaction. In some instances, this may reduce the possible number of options that represent the redacted content, allowing it to be more easily guessed. Although redaction of variable-width typefaces is far more complex, Bland, M., Iyer, A., and Levchenko, K. 2022 paper “Story Beyond the Eye: Glyph Positions Break PDF Text Redaction” showed that this is still possible with sufficient computing power and determination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Optical Character Recognition (OCR)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OCR is complex image processing that attempts to identify text in bitmap images. In PDF files, OCR-identified text is commonly placed on top of the image using the invisible text render mode. This enables users to then extract the text from the image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Returning to the very first PDF file in the tranche, VOL00001\IMAGES\0001\EFTA00000001.pdf - this is a full-page photo of a hand-written sign where part of the hand-written information is explicitly redacted. The PDF contains largely inaccurate OCR-ed text, indicating that natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), or even language aware dictionary-based algorithms were not used. This means that there will be more errors in the extracted text than is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With cloud platforms readily accessible and supporting advanced OCR at low cost, anyone is capable of re-processing the entire tranche of PDFs and comparing the OCR results to those provided by DoJ. Even though the page images are low-resolution (96 DPI), rerunning OCR may bring to light additional or corrected information hidden by the original OCR that failed to recognize everything correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “black box” redactions we investigated were all correctly applied directly into the image pixel data. They are not separate PDF rectangle objects simply floating above sensitive information that was still present in the image and easily discoverable. Yes, sometimes it is that easy…!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We did not set out to comprehensively analyze every corner of every PDF file in the Epstein PDFs, but to present a basic walk-through of some of the challenges and tricks used to conduct a PDF forensic assessment. Our results above were from a small random sample of documents - there may well be outlier PDFs in the data sets that we did not encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DoJ has clearly created internal processes, systems, and workflows that can sanitize and redact information prior to publishing as PDF. This includes converting JPEG images to low-resolution pixel-only bitmaps, largely removing metadata, and rendering page images to bitmaps. OCR appears to have been widely applied, but is of variable quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their PDF technology could be improved to vastly reduce file size by removing unnecessary objects (e.g., empty content streams, ProcSets, empty thumbnail references, etc.), simplifying and reducing content streams, applying all incremental updates (i.e., removing all incremental update sections), and always using compressed object streams and compressed cross-reference streams. Information leakage may also be occurring via PDF comments or orphaned objects inside compressed object streams, as I discovered above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PDF forensics is a highly complex field, where variations in files and tool assumptions can easily yield false results. The PDF Association hosts a PDF Forensic Liaison Working Group to develop industry guidance on forensic examination of PDF files and to educate document examiners and other specialists about many of these aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

Voxtral Realtime is open-weights under the Apache 2.0 license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're also launching an audio playground in Mistral Studio to test transcription instantly, powered by Voxtral Transcribe 2, with diarization and timestamps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Highlights.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2: State-of-the-art transcription with speaker diarization, context biasing, and word-level timestamps in 13 languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxtral Realtime: Purpose-built for live transcription with latency configurable down to sub-200ms, enabling voice agents and real-time applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best-in-class efficiency: Industry-leading accuracy at a fraction of the cost, with Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2 achieving the lowest word error rate, at the lowest price point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open weights: Voxtral Realtime ships under Apache 2.0, deployable on edge for privacy-first applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Voxtral Realtime.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxtral Realtime is purpose-built for applications where latency matters. Unlike approaches that adapt offline models by processing audio in chunks, Realtime uses a novel streaming architecture that transcribes audio as it arrives. The model delivers transcriptions with delay configurable down to sub-200ms, unlocking a new class of voice-first applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Word error rate (lower is better) across languages in the FLEURS transcription benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 2.4 seconds delay, ideal for subtitling, Realtime matches Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2, our latest batch model. At 480ms delay, it stays within 1-2% word error rate, enabling voice agents with near-offline accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model is natively multilingual, achieving strong transcription performance in 13 languages, including English, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Arabic, French, Portuguese, Russian, German, Japanese, Korean, Italian, and Dutch. With a 4B parameter footprint, it runs efficiently on edge devices, ensuring privacy and security for sensitive deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re releasing the model weights under Apache 2.0 on the Hugging Face Hub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average diarization error rate (lower is better) across five English benchmarks (Switchboard, CallHome, AMI-IHM, AMI-SDM, SBCSAE) and the TalkBank multilingual benchmark (German, Spanish, English, Chinese, Japanese).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average word error rate (lower is better) across the top-10 languages in the FLEURS transcription benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2 delivers significant improvements in transcription and diarization quality across languages and domains. At approximately 4% word error rate on FLEURS and $0.003/min, Voxtral offers the best price-performance of any transcription API. It outperforms GPT-4o mini Transcribe, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Assembly Universal, and Deepgram Nova on accuracy, and processes audio approximately 3x faster than ElevenLabs’ Scribe v2 while matching on quality at one-fifth the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Enterprise-ready features.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2 introduces key capabilities for enterprise deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Speaker diarization.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate transcriptions with speaker labels and precise start/end times. Ideal for meeting transcription, interview analysis, and multi-party call processing. Note: with overlapping speech, the model typically transcribes one speaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Context biasing.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provide up to 100 words or phrases to guide the model toward correct spellings of names, technical terms, or domain-specific vocabulary. Particularly useful for proper nouns or industry terminology that standard models often miss. Context biasing is optimized for English; support for other languages is experimental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Word-level timestamps.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate precise start and end timestamps for each word, enabling applications like subtitle generation, audio search, and content alignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Expanded language support.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Realtime, this model now supports 13 languages: English, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Arabic, French, Portuguese, Russian, German, Japanese, Korean, Italian, and Dutch. Non-English performance significantly outpaces competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Noise robustness.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintains transcription accuracy in challenging acoustic environments, such as factory floors, busy call centers, and field recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Longer audio support.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Process recordings up to 3 hours in a single request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Word error rate (lower is better) across languages in the FLEURS transcription benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Audio playground.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test Voxtral Transcribe 2 directly in Mistral Studio. Upload up to 10 audio files, toggle diarization, choose timestamp granularity, and add context bias terms for domain-specific vocabulary. Supports .mp3, .wav, .m4a, .flac, .ogg up to 1GB each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Transforming voice applications.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxtral powers voice workflows in diverse applications and industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Meeting intelligence.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcribe multilingual recordings with speaker diarization that clearly attributes who said what and when. At Voxtral's price point, annotate large volumes of meeting content at industry-leading cost efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Voice agents and virtual assistants.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build conversational AI with sub-200ms transcription latency. Connect Voxtral Realtime to your LLM and TTS pipeline for responsive voice interfaces that feel natural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Contact center automation.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcribe calls in real time, enabling AI systems to analyze sentiment, suggest responses, and populate CRM fields while conversations are still happening. Speaker diarization ensures clear attribution between agents and customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Media and broadcast.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate live multilingual subtitles with minimal latency. Context biasing handles proper nouns and technical terminology that trip up generic transcription services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compliance and documentation.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitor and transcribe interactions for regulatory compliance, with diarization providing clear speaker attribution and timestamps enabling precise audit trails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both models support GDPR and HIPAA-compliant deployments through secure on-premise or private cloud setups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Get started.&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voxtral Mini Transcribe V2 is available now via API at $0.003 per minute.

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Arcan-A12: Weaving a Different Web&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;26 Jan 2026&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article is a companion piece to “Arcan Explained: A browser for different Webs” which covered how Arcan works as a browser engine. Some key takeaways from that article are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The focus is only on running networked applications where the outermost one takes on the responsibilities of window management and display control, becoming the ‘desktop’.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Document browsing is a compilation step through separate tools that generates a signed, shareable application package.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It is recursive (an application can embed others, including itself) and can compose and interact with allow-listed local software.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Media decoding, media transforms, network communication and system integration are all delegated to per-instance sets of interchangeable privilege-separated programs.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is essentially a browser take on a microkernel architecture. The choice in network communication program will control resource retrieval, link resolution, discovery and so on. This determines what kind of a web you end up in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason why this is posted here and not on the main Arcan site is to emphasise this decoupling. It is but one possible solution, and there will be better ideas out there, without someone having to boil the ocean in order to try them out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article covers the design and choices of the included default implementation (&lt;code&gt;afsrv_net&lt;/code&gt;), its command-line helper tool
(&lt;code&gt;arcan-net&lt;/code&gt;) and how they leverage the A12 protocol to form
a web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is organised as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Recalling the old ways we take a trip down memory lane back to the days of bulletin board systems to look for good bits to bring back into style.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In A frayed web of separate worlds we argue that the ‘World Wide Web’ is anything but ‘World Wide’ and cover a set of problems that we want our solution to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In A12 as protocol we go through the characteristics of the protocol that we are building the rest on top of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In A12 Web we layer in designs to address the problems of a frayed web using the A12 protocol, along with some properties we want it to have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, in Developer Story we get practical and go through the use of the tools available to actually build something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recalling the old ways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My early access to the Internet started through Bulletin Board Systems, specifically ones that translated select Usenet discussion groups and relayed e-mail over a system called ‘Echomail’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If those words are unfamiliarly to you, a BBS was mainly someone sharing a slice of their computer to others over a telephone network. This was served to one or a few people at a time because each active connection required a designated telephone line and those were expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See also: The BBS documentary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the boards I frequented had a very personal feel to them. It was more like being allowed inside someone’s computing living room than being presented with a streamlined and well-dressed corporate facade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was at once both intimate and intimidating on the rare few occasions when the SysOp (“System Operator”) decided to “break into chat” and your browsing of the local wares was interrupted by a seemingly inescapable one-to-one chat window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding out about these places was an interesting journey in itself. Initial discovery was by word of mouth through a friend of a friend. As things sobered up, magazines took to providing listings. Here the experiences were on the milder side. There was less profanity and rarely mischief manuals (such as “the Anarchist’s Cookbook”), erotica or pirated software. Secondary discovery came through sitelists which the sysops curated themselves, or that someone had dumped into a shared upload directory or snuck into the ‘release information’ files packaged inside some piece of downloadable software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often enough a phone number did not actually lead to the board in question. Instead of the familiar tone of the modem connection handshake you got the voice of someone who did not appreciate being woken up at two in the morning – perhaps you had misread the operating hours/days (not everything was 24/7) or the sysop had grown tired of it all and closed the thing down. Such is life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From this shallow description alone we can see the outline of some sort of troubled web story: Through word of mouth links between a named entry (Larry’s Land of Leisure and Suites thereof) and an address (here, phone-number) you could access resources, including links to other resources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As far as links go, they were not particularly good:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Unidirectional - unless told, the one being linked to was unaware of who referred to them and thus had no say as to whether the extra attention was appreciated or not.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Non-descriptive - you had to try and resolve the link to figure out what it actually linked to, or if it was even valid in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Constraints as a side channel - “open between 08.00pm to 06.00am Fri-Sun” was something that might be mentioned on a login screen (less than helpful) or on the sitelist. Accuracy varied wildly.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Local resources were not addressable - you could point someone in the general direction of something, but once they were connected to the board itself the true hunt began.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Local termination - resolving a link does not let you find further ones without processing the resources at the linked location.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ephemeral - should the address mapping change, there is no mechanism to rediscover the linked resource through other paths in the network.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much of this and more still apply to links on the world “wide” web. To their credit URLs did fix addressing local resources (for a time) and DNS did something about the ephemerality, only to be undone by shortening services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, think how much less useful even the first versions of HTML would have been without local resources being part of the language of the ‘link’. The technical solution is about as trivial as can be, yet the consequences are massive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a snack for thought, take the ‘local termination’ part: this is rather unusual if you think about the underlying data structure; it is a graph, but it is not exposed as such. A link may lead to other links, but first you need to ‘scrape’ (download, parse, extract) them from the outer resource.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This left a big discoverability hole to fill, one big enough to spawn some of the wealthiest companies in the world. It may be tempting to think how things would turn out if the other weaknesses had been addressed as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The obvious elephant in the room is Ted Nelson’s poetic Xanadu and how it keeps being brought up as the ‘what could have been’ solution because it used backlinks to avoid unidirectionality and transclusions for subcontent referencing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alas, the rest of its ‘web as living document’ story had a very niche appeal, and the browser part was vapourware for the longest time and then very quirky and unintuitive. As important as the linking story is for the base layer of a web, there also needs to be something there: content is king.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tech doesn’t just go away, but rather move into one of many retirement homes for retrocomputing romantics. I don’t recall a strong inflection point where the BBS stopped being my primary source for information and exploration, it “just happened” as an uncoordinated silent shift. The Internet just naturally became the new default, but the transition and loss of something could be felt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real kicker was the shift in discovery, with search engines as the natural new starting point, some being Web while also somehow not being ‘Web’, like NTNU.no’s FTP search. They quickly became the way to discover content. More seasoned explorers, like the late and great +Fravia pivoted from using disassemblers and debuggers to reverse the dynamic structure of computing, to unpacking the search engine ‘command-line’ to reverse the structure of the web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other discovery solutions were curated collections of links as ‘portals’, like the original Yahoo. Those were similar to magazine sitelists, which also switched to providing links as URLs rather than phone numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might seem comical and distant now but there was real value in buying a computer magazine for suggestions on where to go on the web. Several Internet Service Providers at the time did go through the extra effort of bundling subscriptions to such magazines. Still even echoes of BBS form discovery remained for a while in the shape of ‘Web rings’ and IRC chatbots serving sitelists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To shorten the story somewhat I will skip past the evolution of forums into ‘community’ sites, how they were replaced by ‘social media’ and so on. Instead I will simply suggest that the ‘web’ oscillates between different modalities, like (open, distributed, public) to (closed, centralised, invite-only). The nudge needed to switch the trend from the one to the other, is spam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ‘open web’ has, to me, become the least useful resource on the Internet, and that rapidly accelerated to large hadron levels with the sheer amount of bullshit synthesis that has weaseled its way in between me and whatever I was searching for or whoever I was communicating with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am anything but alone in feeling this disconnect. For a well worded view on the matter, look no further than Splitting the Web. That is, if your browser still allows you to, and the link is still working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A frayed web of separate worlds&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing that the many web pundits I have spoken to over the years have in common when asked to narrow down what the web ‘is’, is a certain glee over unity. Grab a (reasonable) device! And a browser! Browse the web! From anywhere!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t answer the question and does not match any reality of mine. I have reasonable devices in every form factor, and an even larger pile of completely unreasonable ones. I use several browsers, but it is an exceptional day if two browsers on two different devices behave even close to the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heck, if two browsers run on the same device but gets different geolocated source IPs they are served different content on the regular, and more so when using choice examples, say between China to Japan or whether the almighty Cloudflare deems you worthy or not. That is a rather narrow idea of ‘world-wide’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For every other click I am supposed to prove my humanity by clicking a box or waiting a few seconds while my computer crunch pointless numbers. Possibly both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where is it? Hardly in the protocol. Otherwise we could have dropped that part of the URL long ago. Even before shifts towards the likes of QUIC or TLS (or is it SSL?) becoming ubiquitous, browsers implemented a wide range of them, from Gopher and FTP to RTSP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You also won’t find it in the myriad of document containers or the resources referenced inside. What once was ‘Flash’ or ‘Silverlight’ is now an exercise in computing necromancy to relive. Is that javascript of yours following ECMAScript.1997 or 2025?. One day you might get to see that PNG as JXL, if the Gods so decide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are not big on appealing to the authority of the W3C, what you are left with now are the links and how people use them. As we implied previously, the properties of ‘links’ and how they are discovered and enable discovery largely controls what kind of web that emerges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tangent striking dischord&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discord is an interesting phenomenon that deserves to be included here for a handful of reasons. I will fight the urge to attempt a larger breakdown, but it does serve as a connection to the BBS story from before, albeit in sheep’s clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To the owners it is probably the happiest of little accidents, just like the Covid pandemic was to Slack. The numbers displayed on Wikipedia and friends are probably imaginary, but suggestions around 3 million accounts in 2016 to well over 500 million in 2025, and a little less than that actually active, seem reasonable. That is quite something for what was basically paratext and coordination around gaming – maybe the ‘Linux desktop’ could learn something from this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The connection to the BBS story is that it gives you a turnkey solution for spinning up your own ‘personal’ ‘server’. In reality it is anything but, merely a namespace where you only get to partially define a small set of the rules, but at least you get to pick an icon or something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The actual agency is more like the old surveillance camera meme:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technically it is completely uninspired. The browser story is Electron as a bodge patchset on top of some dull variant of Chromium. Somehow it is always my lucky day when launching as ‘pretend consent’ language to force you to update whatever to whatever just to then automatically download some more updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The linking story is somehow worse than plain web. First you have one form for local object link embedding. That one is unlikely to be externally content addressable URLs, thus not shareable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then you have pseudo-resolution of regular URLs (into ‘previews’) that then gets forwarded to another browser, even though that is most likely the same code you were already running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its search story is spartan but also telling; a basic command-line with some magical prefixes with search space limited to that of the current ‘server’. I suspect it is very deliberately so before IPO, and that a possible sell later is both training data when all other wells have gone dry, and a chatbot interface to deliver masqueraded ads and bias to some; dark secrets to others, all based on what- and who- you are willing to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That something like the TOS violation Searchcord, managed to spark anger and controversy over basic search of partial indexing across public servers (that opted in!) is also telling of the average user expectation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Content wise it is a hotspot for the usual uninteresting filth like grooming; violence; expressions of carnal desires; bullying and brigading. That is something of a variable to monitor as part of a larger health and sanity check. If it is completely absent I get suspicious. If it is overflowing, I walk away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, even though the presentation has all the personality of a wet fart captured in a bag and painted grey, it is my goto for some slim chance of an actual interaction with an actual person over a niche interest. That is not gaming paratext, but areas as diverse as CNC Machinery, Pinball Repair, Laser engraving, Electronics and Reverse Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My point is that even though the building blocks and overall purpose is wrong - a strong and playful human connection is still possible and can spring up in the most unlikely of places. We’ll need that going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A12 as protocol&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time to get technical and cover the last building block before also getting practical. The base A12 protocol was introduced here: A12: Visions of the fully networked desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It provides means for sharing an interactive media source (like an application window or composited desktop) to a sink in either a push based configuration, like how X11 remoting worked, or a pull one like VNC, RDP, or SSH would.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is done over one of many transfer channels, each being unidirectional and coupling a possible video, audio and binary ‘blob’ stream corresponding to source windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The philosophy was that of ‘one desktop, many devices’. This means having individual devices be responsible for providing one or many sources over a network, and the desktop finding and composing them together as seamlessly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among its building blocks is the ability to redirect a source from one sink to another while it is still running. This was demonstrated already back in 2019 by ‘dragging a living window from one machine to another’ as seen in the clip below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also an optional extension to the protocol that enables previously paired sources and sinks to find each other again by broadcasting sets of challenge hashed public keys backed by petnames. This turns cryptographic identity into the link itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This avoids having to rely on DNS, DHCP provided hostnames, mDNS or other naming services for local (re-) discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is not enough for what we need here, and that brings us to the final extension. It introduces a third possible role, the directory. It act as a rendezvous for discovery; traffic relaying; NAT traversal; shared and private file/state store; application hosting and source/sink match-making.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The directory server forms a messaging and storage namespace for each hosted application. By default this is broadcast between all sinks running an application. This works for light collaboration and coordination. The reference desktop environment for Arcan, Durden, uses this to synchronise clipboard and share input devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For something more refined we can slot in a directory server side control application to match. It uses the same structure as a regular Arcan application, but its role is to coordinate and regulate communication and to mediate access to other networked resources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such resources can be those that are necessary to the dynamic side of the application itself, like hosted media, indexing and search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To achieve that there are some special functions in the scripting API that we will return to in the ‘Developer Story’ section. Two of particular note are &lt;code&gt;link_target&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;reference_target&lt;/code&gt;. Those lets us define different kinds of
links.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This leads us to the next section, as we can now form webs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A12 Web&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have reached the philosophy of ‘the desktop, reaching out’ similar to the BBS as covered in ‘the old ways’ to counter the problems from ‘a frayed web of separate worlds’ and either sizzle out into obscurity or create new terrifying problems – we all know where roads paved with good intentions might lead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be more direct and practical we will explain things using the command-line tooling as a starting point. For development purposes, we have hosted an Arcan directory server at arcan.divergent-desktop.org for years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using something like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;arcan-net arcan.divergent-desktop.org explain&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there is a cached / petnamed entry already in the local keystore, e.g. ‘dd’:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;arcan-net dd@ explain&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Create an outbound a12-connection to arcan.divergent-desktop.org.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Generate an authentication keypair and query for trust unless known (TOFU).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Issue a LIST command with [notify] enabled.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Wait for a reply with a name field that matches ‘explain’.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Issue a download request for key-associated state matching package ID from #4.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Issue a download request for the package ID from #4.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Verify integrity of package from #6.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Verify authenticity of package compared to signature in manifest from #7.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unpack into temporary storage.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start runner process with sandboxing and I/O transfer channels.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inject any state from #5 and signal runner to execute.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Join directory messaging group matching ID from #4.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Map messages and dynamic resource access between runner and directory until termination.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cleanup and transfer state.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ‘until termination’ point has three possible triggers. First one is the user simply shutting the application down. That would create a snapshot of application-persistent key-value pairs and upload into a matching slot from #5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other is that an updated version of the application appears (that would be signalled due to the notify- flag from the LIST command in #3). The default behaviour then is to initiate a download of the update matching steps (5,7,8,9) and have the runner store-restore state to itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last is on a scripting error causing termination. The runner can be instructed to continue regardless; to snapshot, shutdown and retry; to rollback to a previous version. With any of these options the runner may also send a report rather than (possibly broken) state as per #14.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this stage there is already a number of deviations from the hypertext transport way of doing things, and we have only taken a peek at the basics. Outside of the actual package format and Steps 5 and 13, the chain above is generic enough that it could as well have been a model for a mobile app store.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, any code and necessary ‘offline first’ data is present in the initial package transfer. Its size and checksum is known as part of the LIST command so caching code+data is trivial. Package contents are signed, as is client managed state; altering either on the server side is a distinguishable error condition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While hotly debated internally, the engine blocks any script loads outside of the signed package along with a small curated set of builtin ones. There is no facility ‘hide code in strings and unpack into eval()’ form of getting unsigned code to run and therefore no ‘middleboxes injecting code’ adtech style tampering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, any state store is deferred to the user and their decision to leverage (or not) an authentication key-bound server side store. There is no need for neither &lt;code&gt;cookies&lt;/code&gt; nor a ‘login’ form -
authentication primitives for the connection carry over to the
application layer and, if a server side processor is attached, salted to
an application-bound identifier as part of the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, traffic is owned by the hosting directory. This is a big shift and ties heavily into the linking story. The engine configuration for the case we discuss here gets its primary traffic through either &lt;code&gt;arcan-net&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;afsrv_net&lt;/code&gt; when the outer
application also runs the desktop itself. These, in turn,
exclusively communicate with the specified directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This calls for a short example to get any further. Say that you have an A12 web app that is about image sharing and communication around shared images with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The general UI, layouting and chat overlay is handled by the static signed appl package. Dynamic chat updates come through message passing events. The actual images do not make sense to share in the bundle expected to load/run at startup, so they are retrieved on demand from the server. In the old HTML world, that would be something like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img src="https://some.site/path/image_name.png?bunch_of_state_dont_leak"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an arcan appl, that would be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;local stdin = net_open("@stdin", net_callback_handler)
local image_file = open_nonblock(stdin, {}, "image_name")
load_image_asynch(image_file, image_callback_handler)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The asynchronous event handlers and transfer queueing hints have been omitted for brevity. Here, &lt;code&gt;net_open&lt;/code&gt; gives a reference
handle to the current network connection. Then it is used to initiate a
non-blocking serialised read of &lt;code&gt;image_name&lt;/code&gt; that gets
forward to image decoding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All resource requests follow this pattern. The directory server is able to route / cache / load whatever is necessary to fulfill a request, and the reference implementation has several options for this, but the point is that the directory owns the traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the client end this means that network filtering and monitoring can be very aggressive and request record/replay is trivial for both archival and development purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Linking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We finally have enough context to discuss links. The linking model here has two forms: “unified” and “referential”. The referential link is user facing, so we start there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a connection is made over A12, the initial handshake covers the expected local and remote roles: ‘Source’, ‘Sink’ or ‘Directory’. When hosting a directory server, you can specify outbound referential links through the &lt;code&gt;reference_directory('myfriend')&lt;/code&gt; function call
in the config scripting API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will create a worker that makes an outbound connection, and when this worker is alive and authenticated, it will be among the results sent in response to the LIST command.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This allows local clients to open ‘myfriend’, either tunneled or redirected. The local and remote directory workers transfer public keys and other extended authentication primitives for ‘myfriend’ to transitively trust a new connection to some specified degree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see a few properties for this kind of link:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bidirectional, authenticated and revocable - A link can only be established if the linked entity agrees to it, and it lives only as long as both parties maintain a connection.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Typed - A path through directories always terminate at a directory, a hosted source, sink, or application and you know what you get in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Presence is reachability - The linking entity updates its local directory to reflect connection changes, and protocol propagates this to active clients.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rediscoverable - When walking the path of a link the clients learn about public keys of individual directories. The discovery protocol extension lets a linked entity be rediscovered even if the link itself has been revoked.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is clearly not without trade-offs. Transitive trust models and managing petnames to authentication primitives to stop Zooko’s Triangle can get complicated fast, even for networks of only your own devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, DNS is not necessary. It is completely possible to navigate only through a path of petnames. The idea is that in a well-distributed web, we run into six degrees of separation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t link to resources within a hosted application. That is deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Links being contractual sets a low cap on the amount of links that are feasible to maintain. That’s a feature, not a bug. The cost to resolve grows linearly with the number of directories in a path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A unified link is also specified in the config scripting API by calling the &lt;code&gt;link_directory('myfriend')&lt;/code&gt;. The main difference
against referential links is that the connection is not visible in the
client presented list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is because the linking parties form a unified namespace of exposed applications and their respective worker processes synch host applications, files and instance server side script runners as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Search and Indexing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last thing on the Web menu here is search in the sense of ‘From what we know and can access, what best matches your query?’ and not the ‘that we or our sponsors think that you should see’ variation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cheap solution is of course to leave it in the hands of developers and see what emerges. While that can come as a side effect of growth in popularity, part of the ‘many devices, one desktop’ narrative means that lower level mechanisms would be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a few parts of the protocol to leverage here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One is that binary stream uploads/downloads have a few typed alternate slots. One such slot is METADATA. This means that with upload permission someone can pre-index/analyse locally, and attach that to the server side store going forward. Similarly, a controller providing, for example, an image hosting service can see that something does not have any metadata attached to it, fire up some analysis tool and attach the results itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another part is that the name part of requests that trigger binary stream transfers reserves the ‘.’ prefix for protocol support use. The server implementation uses .monitor, for instance, to negotiate an interactive debug interface stream and .debug to collect crash dumps that have accumulated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another that gets special treatment is ‘.index’. Normally it can be downloaded as a means to list files in the private store attached to the key you authenticated to. It is also used to list available resources in the server-side store assigned to each controller by also specifying the namespace identifier that matches the application identifier that the controller is assigned to, and that would propagate across a network of unified links.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you upload a file to ‘.index’ you actually slot in a filter that corresponds to your search query for that namespace. This will influence future ‘.index’ downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The server also has an external resolver mechanism. To understand this, both file and index resolving first goes to the controller. This has the option to reject it, or to forward or remap into its local file-store. The later can be substituted for an external resolver that takes care of translating to other protocols, e.g. AT, IPFS, Torrent with caching. This tactic is also used for implementing unified linking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a lot more to unpack here when it comes to protection against abuse and collaboratively reaching an accurate .index that all participants can sign off on -- but that is for a different day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Developer Story&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With enough protocol nuances in place we can dig into some of the practicalities in developing a networked Arcan application, but just enough to follow the web story here rather rather than the concrete APIs as such. For those there are numerous guides, step-by-step instructions and examples already in both Wiki and repository documentation format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only thing we need to recall is that an Arcan appl is a set of scripts with some minor file- and function name- patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A minimal form is just this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mkdir $ARCAN_APPLBASEPATH/myappl;
echo "function myappl()\nend\n" &amp;gt; $ARCAN_APPLBASEPATH/myappl/myappl.lua&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assuming that you have permission to install or update an appl (which are different permissions) to a directory server that will host it, all you have to do is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;arcan-net --sign-tag mykey --push-appl myappl somedir@&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will package, sign and transfer ‘myappl’ to the directory pointed to by ‘somedir’ in the current keystore. Creating an entry and generating keys can be done with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;arcan-net keystore somedir host.or.ip&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It will also tell you the public key that the server needs to grant permissions to. Setting one up has a lot more nuance to it, but with the arcan-net installation you would have a config.lua.example to work from and then run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;arcan-net -c /path/to/my/config.lua&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can then test-run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;arcan-net somedir@ myappl&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which should just become a black window. Keep it running, but at the same time let’s push a change that would break it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;echo "function myappl()
    bad_function_call()
 end
" &amp;gt; $ARCAN_APPLBASEPATH/myappl/myappl.lua

arcan-net --sign-tag mykey --push-appl myappl somedir@&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The already running client downloads/update and it breaks. If configured to permit it will create a crash report, upload it and rollback to the last known working one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;arcan-net --get-file myappl .report - somedir@&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That will collect user crash reports, bundle them together and send them back to us (and pipe to standard output). The reports are valid Lua scripts, so we can have analysis tooling that itself generates an appl.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same tactic is used for slotting in a controller, just with --push-ctrl instead of --push-appl.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To look at a more advanced example, we will take streaming media playback. The full appl code is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
function myapp()
net_open("@stdin",
  function(source, status)
    if status.kind == "connected" then
      play_media(source)
    end
  end
  )
end

function play_media(ref)
  local fio = open_nonblock(ref, {}, "appl:/test")
  launch_decode(nil, "protocol=media",
    function(src, status)
      if status.kind == "bchunkstate" then
        open_nonblock(src, {}, fio)
      elseif status.kind == "resized" then
        show_image(src)
        resize_image(src, status.width, status.height)
      end
    end
  )
end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing to note is the &lt;code&gt;net_open&lt;/code&gt; call. This explicitly says
that we want to access and communicate with the directory that it was downloaded
from. Should that call fail, we can assume to be running offline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;play_media&lt;/code&gt; function pairs two asynchronous processes. The
&lt;code&gt;open_nonblock&lt;/code&gt; part is used for non-blocking asynchronous file
input/output, both ones from within the appl package; from user-defined
namespaces and through existing processes via a reference handle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first call goes through the handle to the network connection, and the appl:/ prefix tells it to go through the controller side application specific namespace. Any extra controls about transfer queueing/buffering/parallelisation preferences would go into the passed option table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;launch_decode&lt;/code&gt; part will spawn a media decoding process,
and by not providing it with direct input it will send a set of extensions it
supports (bchunkstate), that we ignore here and just pair with the resource
reference we got from previous &lt;code&gt;open_nonblock&lt;/code&gt; call. On the first
'resize' event we set the associated video object to visible and size to match
the source dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's slot in a matching controller:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
function myapp()
end

function myapp_load(cl, resource)
  if resource == "test" then
    return "test.mp4"
  end
end

function myapp_store(cl, resource)
-- block all attempts at storing files
end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;_load&lt;/code&gt; entrypoint will be triggered when the client &lt;code&gt;open_nonblock&lt;/code&gt;
is issued. Here we map it to an actual file in the server-side store. This is where we
can add additional permission checks or selection logic. This is where the previously
mentioned 'external resolver' also fit, if the &lt;code&gt;config.lua&lt;/code&gt; set for the server
would say:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
function ready()
  local resolver =
    launch_resolver("/some/executable",
                    function(source, status)
                    end
                   )
  appl_set_resolver("myapp", resolver)
end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mapped &lt;code&gt;test.mp4&lt;/code&gt; request would be forwarded to the process of
&lt;code&gt;/some/executable&lt;/code&gt; where we can have advanced mapping to other protocols and
storage solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's do something more advanced. We add an arcan-shmif client to the server-side policy database: &lt;code&gt;arcan_db add_target BIN xserver /usr/bin/Xarcan -exec wmaker&lt;/code&gt;. Then,
in the controller we add the following function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
function myapp_join(cl)
  launch_target(cl, {}, "xserver",
    function(source, status)
    end
  )
end
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As soon as a client joins, the server would spawn an instance of an Xserver with the 'WindowMaker' window manager attached. This makes a loopback connection and registers as a hidden source only visible to the specified client. The client gets a notification that the source is available, and that would translate to a &lt;code&gt;segment_request&lt;/code&gt;
event in the &lt;code&gt;net_open&lt;/code&gt; event handler. If it accepts it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
net_open("@stdin",
function(source, status)
  if status.kind == "segment_request" then
    accept_target(640, 480, event_handler)
  end
end
)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We now have the means to composite and interact with the source as if it had been launched locally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of this has been assuming that the client end has the Arcan stack installed and available. This might not be the case for weaker 'thin' kiosk like devices or in a more limited context, like one of those horrid vendor locked app ecosystems. Should the full stack be present on the directory server however, and the &lt;code&gt;config.permissions.applhost&lt;/code&gt; option be set to a tag (group)
matching your authentication key, a simplified viewer that only implements the
a12 protocol parts, like Smash,
could be used if the client request the appl as a source and not as an appl
package download. This would cause the server to spawn an instance of Arcan
with a loopback connection as a directed source to the specific client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The purpose of bringing all this up here is not as a practical guide, but to provide enough context to highlight a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The tooling to browse, host and develop is the same. They are a property of the network solution itself, not ‘browser:developer tools’.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Updates are atomic and signed, making life much more difficult for parasitic intermediaries.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Every form of communication is explicit, from link contracts to how the appl communiate.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The execution form is local-first, into locally-hosted, into networked.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The scaling model is small nodes, large networks.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The 'frontend', 'backend' and server development model is one and the same.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Both client appl and controller are composable due to the naming scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;In Closing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a lot of technical details omitted here around decisions and trade-offs and there is yet a small time window for change before all this is locked-in, especially around server side APIs and small-scale payment processing (with GNU taler being a strong candidate) to avoid the 'need' (they will always find a way) for Ad-tech parasites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other future plans involve preserving and translating current web contents into this, with tooling for layering in collaborative features over the contents. There is still ample room to join in and play around like it is the 90ies again, for a timeline that doesn't look so dark and grim as the current one does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, a substantial goal for all of this is personal agency over any kind of mass adoption -- I am stubborn, not naive. That anyone outside of a small group of tech die hards would go all Yippee Ki-Yay over this is a moonshot and that is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a number of places in my life and home where the current web- and browser- story will be pushed out. Places like my network cameras, heat pump HMI, various maker devices, home theater, gaming gear, mobile devices and so on. If I can only revert that I might at least tolerate that I still have to order groceries in some throwaway browser on a throwaway device. At least for now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research-oriented starter kit for runescape-style bots, including a typescript sdk, agent documentation and bindings, and a server emulator. Works out of the box - tell it what to automate!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build and operate bots within a complex economic role-playing MMO. You can automate the game, level an account to all 99s, and experiment with agentic development techniques within a safe, bot-only setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goals of this project are to provide a rich testing environment for goal-directed program synthesis techniques (Ralph loops, etc), and to facilitate research into collaboration and competition between agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is currently a leaderboard for bots running on the demo server, with rankings based on highest total level per lowest account playtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RS-SDK is a fork of the LostCity engine/client, an amazing project without which rs-sdk would not be possible. Find their code here or read their history and ethos&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/MaxBittker/rs-sdk.git&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of the box, you can connect to the provided demo server, choose a name that is not already taken!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With claude code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bun install
claude "start a new bot with name: {username}"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manually:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bun install
bun scripts/create-bot.ts {username}

    &lt;p&gt;Chat is off by default to prevent scamming and prompt injection attacks, but you can opt in with &lt;code&gt;SHOW_CHAT=true&lt;/code&gt; in the bot.env file&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Warning: The demo server is offered as a convenience, and we do not guarantee uptime or data persistence. Hold your accounts lightly, and consider hosting your own server instance. Please do not manually play on the demo server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This server has a few modifications from the original game to make development and bot testing easier:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Faster leveling - The XP curve is accelerated and less steep.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Infinite run energy - Players never run out of energy&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No random events - Anti-botting random events are disabled&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;rs-sdk runs against an enhanced web-based client (&lt;code&gt;botclient&lt;/code&gt;) which connects to the LostCity 2004scape server emulator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a gateway server which accepts connections from botclient and SDK instances, and forwards messages between them based on username. Once connected to the gateway, the botclient will relay game state to the SDK, and execute low-level actions (e.g. &lt;code&gt;walkTo(x,y)&lt;/code&gt;) sent from the SDK through the gateway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that the SDK can't talk directly to the game server, but must go through the botclient. It will attempt to launch the botclient on startup if one is not already running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don't need to run the gateway/botclient in order to run automations against the demo server, but you may choose to if you are fixing bugs or adding features to the rs-sdk project&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You want all these running:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd engine &amp;amp;&amp;amp; bun run start&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd webclient &amp;amp;&amp;amp; bun run watch&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd gateway &amp;amp;&amp;amp; bun run gateway&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also a login server which you may not need, I forget&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a free, open-source, community-run project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is strictly education and scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Product Engineer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Location: NYC (in-person)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Help us build everything a consumer brand needs to grow. Weâre just 4 engineers with serious traction (well beyond $1M ARR). Youâll be shipping end-to-end product and working directly with customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;About Converge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to profitably grow the world's consumer brands. That begins with helping them understand which marketing efforts are driving profitable growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;200+ consumer brands, including publicly traded companies, rely on Converge to check in on their marketing performance up to a dozen times a day. They drill down to figure out what's working and decide where to shift million-dollar marketing budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To ship even more, we've raised $5.7M from some of the best investors, including Y Combinator, General Catalyst, and the founders of Posthog, Algolia, Shipbob, ...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What you'll do&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ship product fully end-to-end. All the way from designing the system and data models to building out the interface and polishing the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We trust you to build the best solution to a customer's problem. We lead with context and give you full autonomy to design the solution. This means you'll need to build a deep understanding of the problem, obsess over the solution, and ship it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work directly with customers. You'll talk to them, ship, get feedback, and iterate. There are no middlemen. This means you can move incredibly fast: you message a customer, create a PR, and can have it fixed within hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some examples of projects you could own:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Effortless Slack conversations: Customers screenshot their Converge reports up to a dozen of times a day (!) to share with the rest of the company. Instead, they should be able to directly tag and message a teammate from any number in Converge and have this synced bidirectionally with Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Centralizing all growth efforts: Converge already centralizes all growth metrics, but the information explaining them is still scattered. We want overlay the context that actually explains trends like pricing updates, budget changes, and promo calendars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creative analytics: All growth teams use a separate tool to iterate on ad creatives, but they would want to run this workflow on Converge. We should build a Creative Analytics product on top of our data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI agents: We never wanted to jump on the AI train for the sake of hype. But now that we have the foundations in place, there's huge leverage in building agents that can help growth teams understand their data and act on it more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why Converge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're a team of just 4 engineers with serious traction (well beyond $1M ARR). Join us if you want to get rid of office politics and just take ownership to get a lot done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even though you join early, this job comes with real engineering challenges. We process $4B in online orders annually, 20TB of data flows through Converge each month, and we've collected around 10B customer interactions to date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you're shipping will actually get used. 50% of our customers use us daily (!), while this is only 13% for the average SaaS company. You will have an immediate impact.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We love working in-person. You'll like it here if you do too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think you could be a founder, there's no better way to learn than to talk to customers and ship. That's what you'll be spending all of your time on. We obsess over the details and will share honest feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What we're looking for&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strong experience working across the stack (4+ YOE). We work with React, Python, Postgres, and Clickhouse. Experience building data-intensive products or familiarity with Clickhouse is a plus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You've previously built products or large features fully end-to-end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You obsess over the quality of what you're building, both in UX and code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Compensation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Salary: $175K - $240K + equity (0.6% - 0.85%).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Private health, dental, and vision insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pension &amp;amp; 401k contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Interview process*&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intro call (30 min): We want to learn about your motivations to join Converge, determine why youâd be a great fit, and answer any questions you have for us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical (1h): We work through a typical engineering problem we face at Converge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Culture (45 min): We dive into your past experiences to learn how you like to work and what motivates you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superday (1 day): Join us for a day to actually build something! You get to meet the team, we get to meet you, it's great. (fully paid)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(*) This can all be done in 2 days. If you want to move quickly, we do too. Our founding engineer was on a plane to meet us just days after our first call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;We raised $5.7M from some of the best investors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;James Hawkins&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Nicolas Dessaigne&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Founding team&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How we started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Did you knowâ¦&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All co-founders have written code that has run in production as part of Converge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We closed our first publicly traded company during our YC batch from our living room in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thomas and Tiago (Founding Engineer) worked together when Thomas was just an intern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Michel (Customer Success) was responsible for most of the incoming Converge Support tickets in his previous job as a freelance tracking consultant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thomas and Jan were best friends in high school, and Jan and Jerome met in their first year of college.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;AI is Killing B2B SaaS&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;SaaS is the most profitable business model on Earth.1 It’s easy to understand why: build once, sell the same thing again ad infinitum, and don’t suffer any marginal costs on more sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been writing software for more than half my life. In the last year itself, I’ve talked to hundreds of founders and operators in SF, from preseed to Series E companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI is bringing an existential threat to a lot of B2B SaaS executives: How to keep asking customers for renewal, when every customer feels they can get something better built with vibe-coded AI products?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the market is pricing it in. Morgan Stanley’s SaaS basket has lagged the Nasdaq by 40 points since December. HubSpot and Klaviyo are down ~30%. Analysts are writing notes titled “No Reasons to Own” software stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The relation between vibe coding and B2B SaaS sales&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new problem for B2B SaaS is that with AI, customers can get something working with vibe coding. There are tens of vibe coding “internal tool” services that promise to connect to every integration in the world to pump out CRUD and workflow apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever they build simply works. It takes some wrangling to get there (one Series C VP listed eleven different vibe coding tools they’ve tried and the pros and cons between each on a phone call once), but productivity gains are immediate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And vibe coding is fun. You feel like a mad wizard using the right incantation 2 to get this magical new silicon intelligence to do exactly what you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they don’t know, though, is that a poorly architected system will fail, eventually. As every senior programmer (eventually) understands, our job is complex because we have to understand the relationships in the real world, the processes involved, and the workflows needed, and representing it in a robust way to create a stable system. AI can’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-programmers don’t know any of this nuance. One Series E CEO told me that they’re re-evaluating the quarterly renewal of their engineering productivity software because they along with an engineer reimplemented something using Github and Notion APIs. They were paying $30,000 to a popular tool3 and they were not going to renew anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How does it impact B2B sales?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;If customers feel like they aren’t being served exactly like they want to, they are more likely to churn. The reason behind all this is that customers are demanding more from their B2B vendors, because they know what’s possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, you would change your company to fit what your ERP and pay them hundreds of thousands of dollars. Now, everyone can see that agentic coding makes an unprecedented level of flexibility possible. And customers are demanding that flexibility, and if they don’t get it, they’ll leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week itself I was on a phone call with a Series B AE talking about how they’re potentially losing an $X00,000 account just because the customer can’t use a specific failure reporting workflow in the SaaS. They’re now working with me to build what the customer needs and retain them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to survive&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Be a System of Record&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the entire company’s workflows operates on your platform, i.e. you’re a line-of-business SaaS, you are integrated into their existing team already. They know your UI and rely on you on the day to day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, to create a data visualization I won’t seek any SaaS. I’ll just code one myself using many of the popular vibe coding tools (my team actually did that and it’s vastly more flexible than what we’d get off-the-shelf).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a “System of Record” means you’re embedded so deeply that there’s no choice but to win. My prediction is that we’ll see more SaaS companies go from the application layer to offering their robust SoR as their primary selling point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Security, authentication, and robustness&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where vibe-coded apps silently fail — and where established SaaS platforms earn their keep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a non-technical team vibe-codes an internal tool, they’re not thinking about environment keys, XSS vulnerabilities or API keys hardcoded in client-side JavaScript. They’re not implementing rate limiting, audit logs, or proper session management. They’re definitely not thinking about SOC 2 compliance, GDPR data residency requirements, or HIPAA audit trails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen it firsthand: a finance team built a “quick” expense approval tool that stored unencrypted reports in a public S3 bucket. A sales ops team created a commission calculator that anyone with the URL could access — no auth required. These aren’t edge cases. They’re the norm when software is built without security as a foundational concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise SaaS platforms have spent years (and millions) solving these problems: role-based access control, encryption at rest and in transit, penetration testing, compliance certifications, incident response procedures. Your customers may not consciously value this — until something breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge is that security is invisible when it works. You need to communicate this value proactively: remind customers that the “simple” tool they could vibe-code themselves would require them to also handle auth, permissions, backups, uptime, and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. Adapt to the customer, not the other way around&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The times of asking customers to change how they work are gone. Now, SaaS vendors that differentiate by being ultra customizable win the hearts of customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How? It’s the most powerful secret to increase usage. We’ve all heard the classic SaaS problem where the software is sold at the beginning of the year, but no one actually ends up using it because of how inflexible it is and the amount of training needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if a SaaS is underutilized, it gets noticed. And that leads to churn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the case with one of my customers, they have a complex SaaS for maintenance operations. But turns out, this was not being used at the technician level because they found the UI too complex4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How I’m solving this is essentially a whitelabelled vibe-coding platform with in-built distribution and secure deployments. When they heard of my solution they were immediately onboard. Their customer success teams quickly coded a very specific mobile webapp for the technicians to use and deployed it in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the IC technician is exposed to just those parts of the SaaS that they care about i.e. creating maintenance work orders. The executives get what they want too, vibe coding custom reports exactly the way they want vs going through complicated BI config. They are able to build exactly what they want and feel like digital gods while doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usage for that account was under 35%, and is now over 70%. They are now working closely with me to vibe code new “micro-apps” that work according to all of their customer workflows. And the best part? This is all on top of their existing SaaS which works as a system of record and handles security, authentication, and supports lock-in by being a data and a UI moat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what I’m building: a way for SaaS companies to let their end-users vibe code on top of their platform (More on that below). My customers tell me it’s the best thing they’ve done for retention, engagement, and expansion in 2026 – because when your users are building on your platform, they’re not evaluating your competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Real Shift&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I’ve realized after hundreds of conversations with founders and operators: AI isn’t killing B2B SaaS. It’s killing B2B SaaS that refuses to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SaaS model was built on a simple premise: we build it once, you pay forever. That worked when building software was hard. But now your customers have tasted what’s possible. They’ve seen their finance team whip up a custom dashboard in an afternoon. They’ve watched a non-technical PM build an internal tool that actually fits their workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can’t unsee that. You can’t go back to paying $X0,000/year for software that almost does what you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survivors won’t be the SaaS companies with the best features. They’ll be the ones who become platforms – who let customers build on top of them instead of instead of them. When I showed a well-known VC what I was building to help SaaS companies do exactly this, he said: “This is the future of marketplaces and software companies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe. Or maybe this is just another cycle and traditional SaaS will adapt like it always has. But I know this: the companies I’m talking to aren’t waiting around to find out. They’re already rebuilding their relationship with customers from “use our product” to “build on our platform.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question isn’t whether AI will eat your SaaS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s whether you’ll be the one holding the fork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m solving exactly this problem with a whitelabelled AI platform for B2B SaaS companies, so your users can vibe code customized workflows on top of their existing system of record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My customers tell me this is the best way to support retention, engagement, and expansion in 2026.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anxiety is the second leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Roughly a third of adults in the United States will experience an anxiety disorder within their lifetime, and the median age of onset is 17 years old. Anxiety increases the risk for multiple other problematic outcomes, including depression and suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While social media can be a cause of anxiety, it can also be a potential solution. A researcher at the University of Arkansas recently found that young adults who receive emotional support on social media are significantly more likely to report reduced anxiety symptoms, with a few specific personality traits reporting the most improved well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among the study's findings was that people with high openness to experience, high extraversion, high agreeableness and low conscientiousness reported an increase in perceived social media emotional support. Positive interactions and perceptions may explain why young adults with these specific traits feel more supported and less anxious overall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Longitudinal studies demonstrate an association between social media use and anxiety," the researchers noted in a paper published in Psychiatry International. "However, the mechanism of this association in terms of emotional support is not completely understood. This new study addressed these important research questions, finding strong and linear associations of reduced anxiety, especially among females."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study was co-authored by Renae Merrill, a lecturer in the Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences at the U of A, and Chunhua Cao, an assistant professor in the College of Education at the University of Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The national sample was comprised of more than 2,403 U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 30. Anxiety was measured using the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System scale. Emotional support was measured by asking participants how much support they receive on popular social media platforms, and personality was measured using the Big Five Inventory, which assesses openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The findings from this research have important social implications, given the increased prevalence of anxiety among young adults," the researchers noted. "We currently know that anxiety also increases the risk of stress-induced inflammation, sleep disruption, migraine headaches, negative workplace culture, maladaptive perfectionism, low self-esteem and negatively impacting academic performance."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, study cannot determine the direction of the association. For example, social media emotional support may lower anxiety or anxiety may lower perceived social media emotional support. It does suggest gender differences in how social media emotional support is perceived. The results also suggests that emotional support is effective in improving mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"People thrive when they feel valued, supported and part of a cohesive group," Merrill explained. "Becoming more emotionally aware in our interactions with others is essential. This involves taking the time to really understand what others are going through and offering positive meaningful support as much as possible. Improving perception, communication and emotional awareness both in person and on social media platforms is integral for improving health and well-being."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Research support was received by the Fine Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, my friend and fellow Recurser, Frank, picked up an arcade machine for the Recurse Center. We call it the RCade. He wanted to leave the original CRT in - which I think is a great choice! - and drove it off of a Raspberry Pi. Eventually we wanted to move to a more powerful computer, but we needed a way to connect it to the display. Off-hand, I mentioned that I could build a CRT display adapter that interfaces with a normal computer over USB. This is that project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What the display expects&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CRT in the RCade has a JAMMA connector, and Frank bought a converter that goes between VGA and JAMMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might think we could just use an off-the-shelf VGA adapter to drive it at this point, but it's not that simple. The CRT runs at a weird resolution; We started with 320x240 but eventually wanted to target 336x262, which is super non-standard. Even 320x240 is unattainable by most display adapters, which typically can't go below 640x480. A custom solution would allow us to output any arbitrary resolution we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other thing is that the Pi, with the VGA board we were using, only supports 18-bit colour, and we wanted to improve this. Even on the RCade's CRT, colour banding was an obvious issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to use a laptop, not a desktop, which meant not using a PCI-e card. Instead, a USB interface would be preferable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wait, but what is VGA?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;VGA is a signaling protocol that maps almost exactly 1:1 with what a CRT actually does.&lt;/p&gt;Taken from wikimedia.org&lt;p&gt;Inside of a CRT, there are 3 electron guns, which correspond to red, green, and blue colour values. Two electromagnets in the neck of the tube are responsible for steering the beam - one steers horizontally and one steers vertically. To draw an image, the beam moves across the screen one horizontal line at a time, and the electron guns are rapidly modulated in order to display the correct colour at each pixel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VGA contains analog signals for these R, G, and B electron guns. It also contains an HSYNC and VSYNC signal, which are used so that the driver and the CRT can agree on what pixel is being drawn at a given time. Between the VGA input and the CRT is a very simple circuit which locks onto these HSYNC and VSYNC pulses and synchronizes the sweeping of the beam.&lt;/p&gt;Taken from pyroelectro.com&lt;p&gt;The HSYNC pulses happen in between horizontal lines, and the VSYNC pulses happen in between frames. There are dead zones around each pulse - referred to as the front and back porch - which give the electron beam time to sweep back across the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, all we really need are those R, G, B, HSYNC, and VSYNC signals, running at precise timing, and synced properly relative to each other. Conceptually this is actually pretty simple!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Attempt 1: Using the RP2040's PIO&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the Raspberry Pi RP2040 a lot. It's relatively cheap (around $1 USD) and has tons of on-board RAM - 264 KB in fact! It also has what is called Programmable IO, or PIO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've never used the PIO before, but the basic idea is that you can write assembly programs where every instruction takes exactly one cycle, and has useful primitives for interacting with GPIO. It's a fairly limited instruction set, but it allows for bit-banging precise cycle-accurate custom protocols. It's exactly what I need to modulate a VGA signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PIO code ended up looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;// 1. low for 320+16=336 pixels // 2. high for 30 pixels // 3. low for 34 pixels // 4. repeat // runs on sm0 // 6 instrs -&amp;gt; can save some with sidesetting let hsync = pio::pio_asm!( ".wrap_target", /* begin pixels + front porch */ "irq set 0 [2]", // tell vsync we're doing 1 line "set pins, 1 [31]", // go low for 32 "set X, 8 [15]", // +16 = 48 "a:", "jmp X-- a [31]", // each loop 32, * 9 = 288, total = 336 /* end front porch, being assert hsync */ "set pins, 0 [29]", // assert hsync for 30 /* end assert hsync, begin back porch */ "set pins, 1 [29]", // deassert, wait 32 (note there is extra delay after the wrap) ".wrap" ); // NOTE - we get irq at *end* of line so we have to time things accordingly // 1. low for 242 lines -&amp;gt; but irq 2 every line for the first 240 // 2. high for 3 lines // 3. low for 22 lines // 4. repeat // runs on sm1 // 19 instr let vsync = pio::pio_asm!( ".side_set 1 opt", ".wrap_target", "set Y, 6", "a_outer:", "set X, 31", "a:", "wait 1 irq 0", "irq set 2", "jmp X-- a", // 32 lines per inner loop "jmp Y-- a_outer", // 7 outer loops = 224 "set X, 15", // 16 more lines = 240 "z:" "wait 1 irq 0", "irq set 2", "jmp X-- z", "wait 1 irq 0", // wait for end of last rgb line "wait 1 irq 0", // 2 more lines for front porch "wait 1 irq 0", "set X, 2 side 0", // assert vsync "b:", "wait 1 irq 0", "jmp X-- b", // wait for 3 lines "set X, 20 side 1", // deassert vsync "c:", "wait 1 irq 0", "jmp X-- c" // wait for 21 lines (back porch) ".wrap", ); // 2 cycles per pixel so we run at double speed // 6 instr let rgb = pio::pio_asm!( "out X, 32", // holds 319, which we have to read from the FIFO ".wrap_target", "mov Y, X", "wait 1 irq 2", // wait until start of line "a:", "out pins, 16", // write to rgb from dma "jmp Y-- a", "mov pins, NULL", // output black ".wrap" );&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full code lives here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are 3 separate PIO programs. &lt;code&gt;hsync&lt;/code&gt; is responsible for keeping time and generating HSYNC pulses. At the start of each line, it generates an IRQ event that the other programs use for synchronization. &lt;code&gt;vsync&lt;/code&gt; counts these events and generates the VSYNC pulses. Finally, &lt;code&gt;rgb&lt;/code&gt; reads pixel data from DMA and outputs to the RGB pins in precise time with the other signals. The &lt;code&gt;out pins, 16&lt;/code&gt; signifies that we're only doing 16-bit colour for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of weirdness in here to get around the constraints of the PIO. For example, between all 3 programs, only a maximum of 31 instructions are allowed. All of the VGA parameters (resolution, porch length, etc.) are hard-coded, and changing these would require at least a small rewrite. It's pretty brittle in that regard, but for our use-case it's sufficient as a proof-of-concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here it is running the actual CRT in the RCade:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to fill the framebuffer with a repeating pattern, but I messed up my code, hence it looking weird. That's fine - it was enough to verify my VGA program worked!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, every time I popped off the back of the RCade to work on it was terrifying. Not because of the lethal voltages inside, but because Recursers absolutely love the RCade. I often joke that if I were to break it, I would basically be the anti-Frank!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that I had something that could take a framebuffer and throw it onto the CRT, it was time to get the image from my computer to the RP2040.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Let's write a kernel module!&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;My plan was to write a Linux kernel module that would expose itself as a framebuffer, and then send that framebuffer over USB to the RP2040. On the framebuffer side, this involved interfacing with the DRM layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually made decent progress here, although I kernel panicked many, many times. I never bothered to set up a proper development environment (oops), so pretty much any bug would require me to reboot my computer. This was super annoying and tedious, although I did learn a lot. I found cursed things in the official documentation, like interrobangs!&lt;/p&gt;Linus pls&lt;p&gt;I got as far as getting a framebuffer to show up at the correct resolution and refresh rate. Along this journey though, I discovered the GUD kernel module, and quickly realized I should use that instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;GUD is... pretty good&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay so this GUD thing is sick. It's a USB display adapter protocol - exactly what I need! It was originally designed to send video from a computer to a Pi Zero for use as a secondary display. It consists of an upstreamed (!!!) kernel module that runs on the host, and separate gadget software that runs on the Pi Zero. I decided I would just write my own gadget implementation to run on the RP2040.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a protocol, GUD seems decent. It supports compression over the wire, and only sends the deltas of what's changed in the host's framebuffer. It's also pretty robust in terms of allowing the gadget to advertise what features it supports - compression is optional, and there's flexibility in colour depth and resolution. And again, it's upstreamed into the kernel, so anyone on modern Linux could use my display adapter with no software tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, GUD has almost no documentation. I figured out what I needed to do by reverse engineering the kernel module, which involved recompiling it to add some debugging statements. The protocol is simple enough that is wasn't too much of a hassle, and it didn't take long before I had developed a gadget implementation in Rust for the RP2040.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with that, we saw our first Linux images on the CRT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, it looks terrible. Several years ago, I had built a board that implements the R/G/B DACs out of resistors, and I reused that for this project. It can only do 12 bits of colour maximum, and for this test I only bothered to wire up ~2 bits per channel, which is basically unusable. But it proves the concept works!&lt;/p&gt;The board I built several years ago. It was originally designed to fit an STM32 development board.&lt;p&gt;To be honest, it's pretty lucky that this board came with me to New York. I'm surprised I didn't either throw it out or move it to my parent's place. It was probably in some other box of things I deemed worth keeping around.&lt;/p&gt;The VGA board connected to the RP2040.&lt;p&gt;You can see from the above picture that I really connected the bare minimum for a proof-of-concept. I find perfboard soldering to be a bit tedious!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, you may notice in the video that the entire screen is shifted to the left. The left side has wrapped around and is now on the right side. On initial boot, it would look fine; over time it would gradually get worse and worse. This is a bug in my implementation - I suspect it's some kind of buffer underflow that's happening, such that each time it occurs, the PIO gets progressively more out of sync. But this is just a guess; I didn't look into it too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The colour depth issue is trivial to fix, but this next one isn't. The framerate sucks! You can even see it in the video above, where you can watch the new frame scroll down the screen. The RP2040 can only do USB FS (full-speed), which is capable of 11 Mbps. At the 320x240x16 bpp we were originally targeting, every frame is 153.6 kB. At our maximum USB FS speed, that's less than 10 FPS! Embarrasingly, I had originally done the math with a bandwidth of 11 MBps, not 11 Mbps, so I was off by a factor of 8. I was hoping to get something at least temporarily usable but had to go back to the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Going on a GUD gadget side quest&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who even needs microcontrollers anyway? My next idea was to use the normal GUD gadget implementation, running on a Pi Zero, but outputting to VGA over GPIO. Conceptually this is pretty simple, although in practice it was anything but. The canonical GUD gadget software was based on a 2021 version of Buildroot, which was too old to output VGA. I tried, and failed, to update the Buildroot version, as well as to backport the VGA overlay. Neither of those really worked, but I didn't really know what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also played around with generating a custom NixOS image that had a modern kernel and the GUD gadget kernel module. When that didn't work I prepared to run a user space GUD gadget implementation on Raspberry Pi OS. But like, isn't that boring? And then I'll still be stuck at 18 bit colour! And sometimes a girl just wants to tickle her electrons :3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Attempt... 2? 3? 1+i? Returning to MCU land&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so my beloved RP2040 doesn't support USB HS (high-speed). My beloved RP2350 (the newer version of the same chip) doesn't either. But some of my beloved STM32s do!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially I was planning to go computer -&amp;gt; USB HS -&amp;gt; STM32 -&amp;gt; SPI bus -&amp;gt; RP2040 -&amp;gt; VGA. But like, that's complicated, and there are 2 microcontrollers to program, and there is so much to go wrong, and the SPI bus protocol is going to need to be robust against lost/extra bits, and AAAAAAAAAA I don't wanna!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But! STM32! I learned through research that some of the nicer ones have an LTDC peripheral, which, among other things, can drive an LCD display. And guess what? Many LCDs take in an R, G, B, HSYNC, and VSYNC signal. That's right - they pretend they're a CRT, and they pretend they have a cute little electron gun inside of them, and the STM32 is like "ok I got u" and can just like, do this natively. And I realize that this is what VGA is, but it's so, so funny to me that the protocol is literally just the manifestation of a physical design that is largely obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay so at this point I'm like, is this even a real project anymore? I'm just connecting the USB peripheral to the LTDC peripheral. What part of this is supposed to take effort? I had already written the GUD gadget implementation. Wasn't I basically already done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OH BOY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, by now it's Christmas time and I fly back to Canada to hang out with my family, as you would expect. I had none of my hardware with me, so now felt like a good time to design the actual board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Christmas Eve, this is what I had. Conceptually, it's a pretty basic board - there's the USB HS input, the VGA output, 3 8-bit DACs, some RAM for the framebuffer, and supporting components. At the heart of it is the STM32H723, which is a microcontroller that's advertised as supporting USB HS and LTDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth talking about the DACs a bit. They have a few requirements. They need to map the 8-bit binary space uniformly to the analog domain. They also need to act as a resistor divider - my I/O is at 3.3V, but VGA expects a maximum of 0.7 volts for R/G/B. And finally, they need to be impedance-matched to the 75 ohms of the VGA cable, to prevent reflections and ringing that show up in the image. I am... pretty doubtful we need this at our resolution, but it doesn't hurt, and it increases nerd cred (^:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I encoded all of these requirements into a system of equations, threw it into a SAT solver, and computed all of my resistor values. I checked the output manually and it made sense, so I used these values in my DAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also worth noting is the length-matched traces between the STM32 and the HyperRAM. Length-matching ensures that all the signals arrive at the same time; if some arrive too early or late it can cause issues. The traces aren't impedance-matched, but I did a bit of math and determined they were short enough that I didn't have to worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, I want to talk about the USB port. I used Mini-USB. Alright look. I know I know, I should have used USB-C. But I don't like USB-C! It's a dumb standard. We spent decades teaching non-technical users to plug the square wire into the square hole and the round wire into the round hole. And then we made every hole the same shape!! But they don't all support the same things!! Not even every cable supports the same things!! I hate it!! And Mini-USB is so cute. It's not reversible, but who cares? It's more robust than micro USB, while still being small. And it's my board, my rules. So yes, I will keep sending pictures of this board to people, and they will keep complaining it doesn't use USB-C. And I will continue to not care! Mini-USB is CUTE. And by the way, if you read this entire article and this is the section you choose to engage with, then you are boring!!! You will never live up to Mini-USB!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay okay sorry about that. I am calm now. With all of that out of the way, I placed the order for the boards. I bought 5 of them, 2 of which were partially assembled. I would complete the rest of the assembly myself, but I didn't want to worry about the more finicky stuff. Between taxes, tariffs, and shipping, it came to a little over a hundred dollars USD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Disaster strikes&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a week later, I was back home in NYC. My boards hadn't arrived yet, although I did have access to an STM32H723 development board at this point. To prepare for my boards, I started porting my RP2040 firmware to the STM32H723.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things were going well until I tried getting USB set up. For some reason, I could only get it working at USB FS speeds. I figured I was just initializing something wrong - maybe a register I was forgetting about, or that wasn't in the HAL? I did a lot of digging, before finding this hidden in the datasheet (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The devices embed a USB OTG high-speed (up to 480 Mbit/s) device/host/OTG peripheral that supports both full-speed and high-speed operations. It integrates the transceivers for full-speed operation (12 Mbit/s) and a UTMI low-pin interface (ULPI) for high-speed operation (480 Mbit/s). When using the USB OTG_HS interface in HS mode, an external PHY device connected to the ULPI is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My heart sank. Yes, despite this chip very clearly advertising support for USB HS, it can't actually do that without an external PHY. This is super easy to miss - I actually told other people about the problem, and often they would tell me I was incorrect until I showed it to them in the datasheet. I've also found many posts on the ST Community forums from people running into the same thing. So yeah, I need a new board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because boards are expensive, I figure I'll still use the rev 1 board to validate as much as I can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Disaster strikes, again&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the boards come, I complete assembly of one, plug it into my computer, and nothing happens. I find out that the 3.3V rail is shorted to ground. This is the same on all of my boards, even the 3 that are disassembled. Some debugging later, it turns out I moved a via in KiCad and didn't do a re-pour. My ground plane was connected to my power plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a full CI/CD pipeline set up for my PCBs, so I was surprised it didn't catch this. It turns out it has a bit of wiggle-room, and the re-pour was small enough it didn't get picked up. I now know I need to be disciplined and run DRC locally, ensuring there are literally no differences (and if there are, commit them and push them up to my Git forge).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although annoying, and quite embarrassing, this wasn't a huge deal. I used a drill bit and very carefully drilled out the offending via by hand. It made a bit of a mess - make sure you use breathing protection - but I got a board that worked.&lt;/p&gt;The drilled-out via. You can see it directly under the text, near the center-bottom of the image.&lt;p&gt;At this point I wrote some code that exercised the HyperRAM and VGA. Everything worked great, so I began work on the new board. Here's what my development setup looked like while I was testing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the rev 1 board didn't work out, Frank pointed out that the difference between it and the previous revision was stark:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a bad pace of development!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Attempt 4 - Rev 2&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I needed an STM32 that supported ULPI (used for talking to the USB PHY), LTDC, and some kind of external RAM. I looked at dozens of chips and found all sorts of blockers. Chips that actually supported both (but they had overlapping pins), chips that were advertised as supporting both (but in actuality, could only do one or the other, depending on the specific model number), and chips that actually could do both, with unconflicting pins, but only in a BGA package. I did not particularly want to deal with that, mainly because the tiny vias and traces would balloon the board cost even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ended up settling on the STM32H750IBT, a massive, 176 pin, LQFP chip. This thing is larger than some New York apartments, and at over $10 USD, it costs about the same! I have bought entire dev boards for a fraction of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I picked out the chip, I basically redesigned the entire board from scratch. Sure, I could reuse the DACs, but I needed completely new RAM (the new chip has no HyperBus), as well as the USB PHY and supporting components. Now that my Christmas vacation was over, it took me a solid week to get everything designed. This isn't my most complicated board, but it's certainly my most complex routing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean, look at those traces. I'm using basically all available space just to get them to be the same length. ST famously has bad pinouts, and because one of the memory controller pins is located on the complete opposite side of the chip, literally all of the rest of the RAM traces had to be lengthened. And the RAM has a 16-bit data bus. I had to route 38 length-matched traces for the memory alone!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USB PHY also had a decent number of traces to route, although far less than the RAM. This is probably the part where I'm supposed to say that like, crosstalk is bad and stuff, but we're just gonna ignore that. I had like no space; leave me alone!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what the board looked like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with that, I ordered the board. Waiting for it to arrive just about killed me, but when it finally did, I got to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Board bring-up&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Board bring-up is a magical thing. One-by-one, you enable each part of the board, and you make sure that everything works the way you expect. Given that USB burned me before, I decided to start there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right out of the gate, I was off to a bumpy start. I got the USB technically working, and I even got it to show up on my computer as USB HS (yay!), but it was super, super flaky. Eventually I worked out that its crystal oscillator was unstable. Going back to the datasheet, I realized I missed a 1M ohm resistor, which was meant to be put in parallel with the crystal. I didn't have one handy, but I know the human body is around that resistance. I put one finger on each terminal of the crystal. It immediately stabilized. I was pretty ecstatic!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day I went to the Recurse Center and stole a 1M ohm resistor to affix to the board. (Faculty, if you're reading this, I owe you about a tenth of a cent. Sorry!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that over, the rest of the bring-up process was pretty smooth. I got the LTDC running and ported over the rest of the code that implemented the GUD protocol. I had written things pretty naively but, to my surprise, it didn't need any optimization for high-speed USB. I guess that's what a microcontroller with a 480 MHz core will get you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Running it in the RCade cabinet&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was already at the Recurse Center at this point, so I popped the back off the RCade, unplugged the VGA from the Pi, and plugged it into my board. It started up immediately - the colours looked great and I got the full 60 Hz framerate. To be honest, I was shocked at how good it looked, and the crowd that had formed was shocked too. I wasn't really a believer that 24 bit colour would be noticeable, but I was totally wrong. The lack of colour banding was striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, I plugged the board into the Pi, and Frank reconfigured it to make my display adapter the primary display. We launched the normal RCade software and played some games. They looked truly amazing; nothing like before. Rose, one of the main people who developed the software, joked that it looked so good that some of the graphical shortcuts she took were no longer sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's hard to tell in the pictures but the difference in person was striking. Where it's most obvious is in the lack of banding around the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This felt amazing, but I wasn't quite ready to leave the board installed. It was fragile - especially with the resistor I bodged on - and it was expensive. I took my board back out and Frank reverted the RCade to how it was before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Designing a case&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll be honest. I don't get that much joy out of 3D modeling. I find it frustrating, tedious, and generally unfulfilling. To get around this, I decided to use YAPP to design the case. YAPP is a parametric box generator written in OpenSCAD. I wrote a few dozen lines of code and ended up with this beauty:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took barely any time at all and only took 2 physical revisions before I was happy with it. I added the OpenSCAD code to my board repository and CI/CD pipeline. Now, it builds all the files I need to order the boards, as well as the STL files for the case.&lt;/p&gt;HE'S BEGINNING TO TAKE FORM&lt;p&gt;And now, with the board in the case:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point I was starting to prepare myself to install it in the RCade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Disaster strikes, again??&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything was done, so I expected I'd just plug it in and be good to go. When I did this, though, nothing happened. After some debugging I realized the USB had completely died on my board. It wasn't showing up on any computer I connected it to, although the STM32 was still chugging along happily (and outputting to VGA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still haven't figured out exactly what happened here. I was having a bit of flakiness with the USB already. I vaguely suspect ESD to either the STM32 or the USB PHY, but am not super confident this is the cause. I'm going to keep looking into this. (inb4: wow maybe you shouldn't have touched the crystal without grounding yourself first!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I assembled a second board and got that installed instead. I'm slightly nervous because I don't have a third board to use if this one also dies, and I don't want to order any more until I can figure out what's killing them. That said, it has been a few days now since I installed it, and despite running 24/7, there's no signs of it dying yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the board in its case, installed in the RCade. We're still running it off the Raspberry Pi for now, but soon we'll have that switched out with a laptop. I can't wait!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Future improvements&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are all sorts of things I want to change. I want the board to also support audio, with an integrated amp. Perhaps even a tube amp? I just think it would be funny. And being able to read input from the controls would be cool too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the software side, I want double or triple buffering. I actually got them both working, although they didn't play nice with the deltas that GUD sends over the wire. There are workarounds to this that I haven't implemented yet. It would also be nice to give GUD the ability to disable these deltas; perhaps that would be a good feature for me to add to the kernel module. Writing some documentation on the GUD protocol could be good too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a really fun project, and it's not over yet, but I think all the hard stuff is pretty much done (although - I've thought that before!). I really wasn't expecting this to take as long as it did, but I learned so much, and I'm a stronger engineer for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Source code&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a few repositories of interest:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hardware lives here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software lives here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're interested, the original software for the RP2040 lives here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My very messy DAC equations live here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Nix GUD gadget attempt lives here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also wrote a fair bit of scratch code while learning (such as for my kernel module), but I don't think any of it was worth putting it in my Git forge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your email service supports Sieve scripts (for example, Fastmail or Proton Mail), you can use this filter [1] that I made. It's very aggressive and will block all emails that originate from Zendesk, so you'll need to disable it whenever you're actually expecting mail from Zendesk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems to have started two weeks ago. A spammer realized that one can find a Zendesk‐based help forum, open a new ticket without an account, fill the ticket with spam URLs, and put an email address scraped from GitHub commit logs in the author email field. Zendesk would “helpfully” send the “author” the contents of the ticket, becoming in effect an open relay for spam emails. Two weeks ago is when the spammer started the attack in earnest: I received hundreds of these spam emails, typically one or two per Zendesk‐hosted help forum, sent to email addresses that I’ve only ever used on GitHub. It was discussed a bit on HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46685768&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since then, Zendesk seems to have strengthened their system so that opening a ticket requires account activation first. Leading to today, when I’ve received thousands of signup attempt emails (again, typically one or two per Zendesk‐hosted forum). This is way more emails than I got last time. I hypothesize that the spammer is doing a “last gasp” attack: now that Zendesk has burned the exploit by no longer including the ticket text in the emails, the spammer is trying every Zendesk site it knows in hopes that some of them are slow to update and still forward the ticket text to the victim.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Glad I'm not the only one. It seems to use {popular website without tld}@example.com as a pattern, so I'm getting a lot via my catch all address even if I haven't used the specific inbox yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a company utterly dependent on email, Zendesk came across to me as very naive about email sending.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did a Zendesk integration shortly after working on a general overhaul of our email at a previous company. The overhaul involved separating out our different types (transactional, marketing, support, etc), and then implementing best practices on deliverability for each of them. Not your day-one email setup, but we were still a small company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The comparison to Zendesk's approach was astounding. Assuming you don't want to use a Zendesk address (we didn't, customers thought it was dodgy), the email setup they let you do was bad, and their support folks had no idea about any of the details. DKIM, SPF, etc, was all alien to them. Ironically they had pretty bad support in general.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zendesk’s mailserver reputation has got to be extremely poor by now. I think they will have trouble with deliverability after this is over. Got about 50 of these today and nearly all of them were categorized as spam before they made it to the inbox despite being nominally “legit”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm getting emails titled "Activate account for ...", and addressed to random names of web services at my domain (e.g. reddit@example.org). Also Twitch-related names like pog, kekw and xqc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also super annoying are crypto scams sent from an Italian ISP's (tiscali.it, shame on you) email service, even though I tried to contact the ISP, but that's unrelated to this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Received 15+ in 10mins on a public email (dropbox, soundcloud, gitlab, tidelift etc). Then just started hitting handles on the domain ( diddy@, epstein@ ). Just placing an aggressive block for "Activate account" and "zendesk" in content for now&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Technocracy 2.0&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Norman Saunders, Cover for the Technocrats’s Magazine, 1933.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Word count: 4552&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paragraphs: 61&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In September 2025, President Trump held a dinner with over two dozen leaders from Silicon Valley. Easily one of the wealthiest gatherings ever held in the White House, the guest list included tech CEOs, venture capitalists, and administration officials. The topic of the dinner was investment and state alignment, as every individual present jockeyed for Trump’s approval. Government contracts and less regulatory oversight were the prizes for those companies which promised the most funds. Mark Zuckerberg, when asked, abruptly made up an investment number to get in Trump’s good graces, “600 billion dollars.” Only to be caught on a hot mic moments later saying, “I’m sorry, I wasn’t ready. I wasn’t sure what number you wanted to go with.”1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There has never before been such a close association between tech capital and the American state. Previously less MAGA-friendly, tech industry leaders have virtually all turned toward Trump since his 2024 victory, eager to gain favors and position themselves as kingmakers in the market. In the global race for AI dominance, the Trump administration views Silicon Valley as an extension of itself, from Palantir working openly with the US military for surveillance and defense systems to OpenAI seeking government aid guarantees on its debt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Buoyed by previously unthinkable stock valuations, tech capital and political power have formed a symbiotic relationship. It is an arrangement that has been in the works for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir, argued in his book The Technological Republic (2025), for too long has it been “taboo” in Silicon Valley to openly want to affect politics. The only lasting future for the United States, he says outright, is the merging of tech and the state. Karp cites the Manhattan Project as a precedent, a model that is now to be applied to virtually every lever of power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Karp and other technocrats like him may not know it themselves, this idea has deep roots in American political culture, going back a century. Technocracy, or “rule by technical experts,” once had a strong, cult-like following in the United States. In the throes of the Great Depression, a mass movement for technocracy quickly became the “most discussed topic in America.”2 Elon Musk’s grandfather was once even part of its Canadian branch. The movement was among the first to organize itself around the idea that technology, not workers or nations, is the main revolutionary agent of history. The ultimate aim was to establish an anti-democratic state run by a board of technical experts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Origins of Technocracy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the turn of the twentieth century, the United States was going through the pains of its industrial transformation. Cities were booming in population, and politics was rife with discord over what would become of American life. New ideas began to circulate over who would helm this path forward. Some were moved by the plight of workers, while others found a cause in battling corruption. But above all, this generation desired reform. They were loosely called the Progressive movement. As one of its leaders, Herbert Croly, argued, now was the time for a “New Nationalism.” Yet few agreed on what the nation’s needs exactly were.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A growing subset of Progressives found their cause within science and technology. Because it had made the Industrial Revolution possible, it was easy to assume its experts should also lead. These Progressives believed society was growing too complex to be left to insular self-interest and politics. Intellectuals like Walter Lippmann, Walter Weyl, Louis Brandeis, Charles McCarthy, and Frederic Howe put forward arguments that any future administration of experts needed a clear separation from politics.3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the seed of what would later become technocratic thinking: the idea of a state of appointed experts. Yet, it was not only politics that was increasingly viewed with suspicion. Businessmen, too, were becoming suspect because of their narrow interests. This argument was most famously made by economist Thorstein Veblen, who was a leading influence on the early technocrats. Although initially more sympathetic to industrial workers, by the 1910s Veblen shifted toward a belief in rule by engineers. A critic of capitalism himself, he viewed business managers as incapable of understanding the system they were handling.4 They were poorly educated in the “industrial arts,” and distorted what should be industrial society’s priorities. These “ignorant businessmen with an eye single to maximum profits” had to be replaced by a new class of people, the technicians.5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 1919, Veblen began publishing a series of magazine essays that would be compiled in The Engineers and the Price System (1921). A “soviet of technicians” had to be established where engineers, not workers, would take over from the capitalists, he argued. This new philosophy would be given a name that year—“technocracy”—and then give rise to a short-lived organization named the Technical Alliance. Veblen was one of its founding members and its intellectual anchor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ideological coordinates of these early days of technocracy were confused. The Technical Alliance brought together a group of very different individuals, united only by the belief that technology now dominated social progress. The alliance worked on research with the radical left-wing union the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), but many of its members remained non-committed politically. While fellow travelers of left causes, there was no focus on the proletariat, class struggle, or workplace organizing. Their only point of agreement was that capitalism was inefficient and holding back industrial society’s potential.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Headquartered in the New School in New York City, where Veblen was a faculty member, the alliance effectively had no strategy for power. It was merely an organizing committee with a variety of titled members from different industries: chemist, educator, physicist, architect, forester, statistician, and so on—an embryo, Veblen argued, of a future “soviet of technicians” that was in the process of proving itself. Their main focus was simply research papers, as they produced reports on waste in the American capitalist system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Veblen himself was in poor health and in no position to lead. Incubating in the Technical Alliance was the future face of the technocracy movement, Howard Scott, who would take Veblen’s ideas and transform them into a mass movement by the 1930s. His career would play out like something out of a melodrama: a parabolic rise, sudden fame and delusions of grandeur, and finally a speedy decline into irrelevance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scott himself was something of an eccentric with an air of mystery about him. In fact, he had few scientific credentials. He hid his past, and was known for exploding angrily when asked about it.6 But what he lacked in qualifications, he had in charisma, sheer will, and a domineering presence. Unlike Veblen, who was more rational, Scott was caught up in the dream of technocracy as if it were his personal religion and north star. He stylized himself a “bohemian engineer,” an adventurer and flaneur, preaching technocracy to all who would listen in Greenwich Village, as if it would someday be possible to create a new Garden of Eden.7&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 1920, Scott was already leaning into a polemical style that would define his rise. In “The Scourge of Politics in a Land of Manna”, an article published that year in the IWW periodical, he demeans politics as centered on petty emotion and subjective reality. If only, he speculated, there could be “a political party based, not upon theory but upon actual facts, the situation would not be such a hopeless one.”8&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Rise (and Fall) of the Original Technocracy Movement&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the Technical Alliance did produce some preliminary work on capitalist waste, it disbanded by 1921. Amid the economic boom of the 1920s, the group failed to resonate with the public and politicians. There was little need for rule by technicians as long as capitalism continued to boom. The popularity of technocracy only returned with the bust of 1929.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Great Depression gave the technocrats another opening. In the early 1930s, Scott met geophysicist Marion King Hubbert, who pushed him to reestablish the old Technical Alliance. At the time, Hubbert was working at Columbia University. The group reconvened with the blessing of mechanical engineer Walter Rautenstrauch, the founder of the university’s Department of Industrial Engineering. Columbia later denied any connection to the group, but their early press releases were all done through university channels.9&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new organization, called the Committee on Technocracy, took up where the Technical Alliance left off by producing research reports on capitalist waste. Except this time, the excitement spread to the papers. By August 1932, the group was receiving hundreds of eager letters from universities, economists, labor organizations, and civic leaders.10 Scott became an overnight celebrity, dining with industrialists, bankers, newspaper editors, and future New Deal administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reports summarized by Scott generated intense public interest. The New York Times in particular helped elevate the profile of the technocrats. In one piece, the Times reported that the committee had convincingly made its case that the system would collapse unless the energy expended by production was radically redistributed. By the end of 1932, the hype reached something of a frenzy. “The gospel of Technocracy is spreading throughout schools, universities, and churches,” published one newspaper.11 Wall Street was said to be following with “intense and worried interest,” and it was said that even the Vatican was closely monitoring developments.12 As the editor of Harper’s, Frederick Lewis Allen, wrote, Scott “was now pursued by interviewers ready to hang upon his lightest word.”13&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part of the appeal of technocracy was that it was viewed as a genuinely American idea. As The Nation reported in September, 1932, “neither socialism, communism, nor fascism is equipped to do this job in a society as highly technical as America today.”14 The editors argued that technocracy was a revolutionary philosophy uniquely made by and for America. This imbued the movement with nationalistic fervor, since it was believed that its adoption would also establish the United States as the leader of scientific progress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, by the start of 1933 the situation already began to deteriorate. In January of that year, the Committee on Technocracy split over infighting, and Scott formed his own group, Technocracy Incorporated. Scott himself was also growing more apocalyptic in his messaging. In Harper’s magazine, Scott wrote of a looming catastrophe. “A crisis in the history of American civilization is at hand. The nation stands at the threshold of what is simultaneously opportunity and disaster… are we going to set about it before it is too late?”15&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what exactly it was became suspect. Amid criticism, the amicable relationship between the New York Times and the technocracy movement broke down. Scott was facing intense pressure for his lack of credentials and so-called “consultancy,” derided as a “crackpot,” and reporters wrote that his “cult” was “now on the wane.”16 Retrospectives on the movement’s decline have linked the fall to Scott’s disastrous radio address to critics in late January, 1933.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the New York Times reported, four hundred of New York’s elites—capitalists, bankers, economists, and artists—came to hear Scott defend himself at Hotel Pierre in New York City.17 Rather than silence his detractors, Scott simply asserted, “we don’t have to answer our critics: time will tell.”18 As one writer spoke of a year later, the delivery was anti-climactic and ultimately the movement’s deathblow. It was “a jumble of unfinished and half-baked sentences. It was all over.”19&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ideas, however, persisted. Historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. has argued that it remained thereafter as a “California cult.”20 The movement reinvented itself as a mass organization with fascist-adjacent aesthetics. Its supporters wore gray-toned clothing, drove matching gray cars, and gave militaristic Roman salutes. Pamphlets like Technocracy Digest began to circulate, with local chapters springing up across the country. Its followers were openly antagonistic toward the state, which in turn banned them in Canada in 1940.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although press interest fell to a new low by the late 1930s, the movement itself still boasted hundreds of thousands of members. Rather than scientists and engineers, however, artists and writers were drawn to Scott’s dream of technocracy. Hugo Gernsback—who coined the term “science fiction”—wrote for the movement’s journal in 1933. And writer Ray Bradbury affirmed that technocracy was “all the hopes and dreams of science fiction.”21 Yet, it had little to do with science by this point. Scott increasingly relied on spectacle to draw attention, with large rallies held at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. With the outbreak of World War II, he attempted to integrate his followers into the war effort with diminishing success.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the succeeding decade, the movement had all but vanished. As historian Henry Elsner, Jr. recounts, one comedy film from the 1950s included a punchline about how it had all been forgotten. “Daddy, what’s a technocracy?” asked a young girl, to laughter from the audience. It was a little detail to show that the film took place in 1932, during the peak of technocracy hysteria, a craze that was now like a lost fever dream.22&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Core Beliefs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In its official channels, Technocracy Incorporated defined itself as “science applied to the social order.” This would become its slogan in the 1930s. For Scott, the philosophy behind it was simple: “Engineers and mechanics created this civilization, so they will eventually dominate it.”23&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet the technocracy movement was always scattered politically, and even its slogan was open-ended. Its ideology was all over the map. Technocracy Incorporated organized mass rallies while appealing to individual reason. It was imperialistic, and believed its “Technate” should rule over all of North, Central, and parts of South America along with the Caribbean. Fiercely anti-capitalist, it sought to replace money with energy vouchers and production quotas. Howard Scott himself liked to lean into the ideological confusion. “As far as technocracy's ideas are concerned,” he joked, “we’re so far left that we make communism look bourgeois.”24&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When speaking of history and ideas, there is always a temptation to go deeper and deeper into the historical record to find some precise origin. Sociologist Daniel Bell, for example, has argued that the first technocrat proper was Henri de Saint-Simon, with his rational religion of humanity. But while the ideology of technocracy can be traced to the nineteenth century, the idea was made real by the modern Industrial Revolution. Only then did technocracy have any semblance of a movement rooted in material reality. Veblen is therefore the closest to technocracy’s ideological founding father.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If technocracy could be identified with a single idea, it is the belief that society can and should be counted, measured, and directed mathematically. As the ABC of Technocracy (1933) argues, “the working of our great social machine is susceptible to measurement.” A later video produced by the movement put it more ominously: “All phenomena involved in the functional operation of a social mechanism are measurable.”25&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technocracy viewed its dream as a form of social engineering with society like a biological organism that can be behaviorally conditioned. In a mockup of the technocratic state, Technocracy Incorporated dedicated an entire department to “social relations.” Every facet of society was to be quantified, processed, and optimized for efficiency. Each citizen would be surveilled in their habits to ensure the smooth processing for the greater industrial organization. A new seven-day work week was proposed to allow for non-stop production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From this principle, a vision of technocratic government emerged. First, all industries would be centralized into a few large-scale enterprises owned by the state. Each would be administrated by a board of technical experts. Second, the state would be exclusively bureaucratic and non-democratic. Third, each citizen would be granted a universal basic income based on production quotas. Fourth, prices and money would be phased out and replaced by energy vouchers. And last, all politics and parties would be abolished. There would be no officials other than those experts who lead industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, how it would actually get to governing was hardly clear. Despite being deeply elitist, Technocracy Incorporated adopted a mass character. Scott peddled in fantasies, and so he imbued the movement with a folk-like ethos through popular rallies, local chapters, and pamphleteering. Because politics in the 1930s was populist and mass-led, technocrats understood the pull of the crowd. They were also competing with the New Deal. Yet, under the surface, technocrats understood their system was more about creating a new priestly class of experts than anything representative. These technicians were to lead society because they were biologically superior. As one 1937 essay in Technocracy Digest put it, “upon biologic fact, theories of democracy go to pieces.”26&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The writer Harold Loeb summarized the core belief behind technocracy as follows: “Technology is the revolutionary agent of our period.”27 In a time of intense class and national conflicts, the technocrats of the 1930s did not view workers or nations as holding the future. They fashioned themselves as revolutionaries working in the interests of a different subject: technological progress. And like all revolutionary movements, they had a deep messianic belief that only they possessed the capabilities to save society from coming destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In truth, the technocrats had overestimated the power of science and industry in their time. Technological systems were not developed enough then to measure and direct society mathematically. Nor did the original movement possess the expertise to even pursue this dream, because few actual engineers and scientists filled its ranks. But today, the appeal of technocracy finds itself in a different world. We are incessantly surveilled, quantified, and made malleable through our behaviors online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technocrats no longer need to persuade the masses to enact their vision. Owning the lion’s share of the world’s capital and influence, they can effectively work in silence and act as if beholden to no one. In the twenty-first century, core ideas of technocracy’s old dream have been revived and given new life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technocracy Today&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the twenty-first century, the definition of technocracy has expanded well beyond the scope of the short-lived 1930s movement. It has been used to describe the EU’s European Commission, China, Singapore, and Italy during the COVID pandemic. In everyday conversation, “technocrat” is often used as a catch-all term for “non-political expert.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given historically low institutional trust, the appointment of non-political experts has become a common strategy by political parties to repair their image. Political scientist Sheri Berman has argued that, in times of popular anger, few would make the case for oligarchy. Rule by an unelected technocracy, however, is a less offensive stand-in.28 Appealing to technocrats provides the state with an attractive means of shoring up legitimacy during crisis. The Trump administration’s recent “Gaza peace plan,” for example, is rife with technocratic language—stipulating that the territory will be governed under the “temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But while definitions of technocracy today cast a wide net, the original idea is finding a second life in Silicon Valley. It is among the tech elite that technocracy takes on actual, ideological substance that echos the movement of old.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2009, tech venture capitalist Peter Thiel outlined his new belief on politics in an op-ed for the Cato Institute. He still called himself a libertarian, but wrote that he no longer believed democracy and freedom to be compatible.29 Politics, he argued, had failed in providing new horizons. Instead, Thiel was convinced that tech entrepreneurs now had to escape politics. They had to get away from the “unthinking demos that guides so-called ‘social democracy.’” To put it differently: he had come to the conclusion that actual people were in the way of the technological future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Thiel, technology was in a deadly race with politics. This, in his view, had suffocated innovation and led to widespread stagnation. He speculated that the future may depend on “the effort of a single person who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom.” This would be the only way to make the world safe again for capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thiel’s thoughts would go on to be instructive for tech elites over a decade later. Many of his allies now occupy top positions within politics and Silicon Valley, like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, neoreactionary thinker Curtis Yarvin, and even the current vice president, JD Vance. In Thiel’s worldview, technological progress is simply too important to be left to democratic society. His beliefs echo the technocrats of almost a century ago, who viewed themselves as in the wings, ready to take over when democracy collapsed. As their 1933 statement read, “technocracy stands ready with a plan to salvage American civilization, if and when democracy… can no longer cope with the inherent disruptive forces.”30&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, unlike the movement of old, twenty-first century technocrats do not wish to replace capitalism. Instead, they see themselves as the chosen elite destined to save and steer it. And within this belief, strangely enough, even capitalist competition itself is viewed with suspicion. In a 2014 op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, Thiel calls economists’ obsession with competition a “relic of history.”31 Monopolies drive progress, he argues, and they are a natural consequence of the accumulation of capital. This is his self-described “idée fixe”—an endpoint he is “obsessed with”—and he co-hosted an event with Altman on the subject in 2014. The reverence toward monopolies closely resembles the old technocracy movement’s desire for top-down centralization of industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such ideas have been taken to their logical conclusion by “Dark Enlightenment” thinkers, especially Curtis Yarvin. A techno-monarchist, Yarvin is a believer in transforming the state into a corporation led by a CEO-like monarch with a court of (presumably) Silicon Valley aristocrats. Yarvin is close to Thiel, calling him “fully enlightened” on this question.32 As a nod of agreement, Yarvin’s start-up was also funded by Thiel’s VC firm. The “Dark Enlightenment” circle includes fellow travelers like billionaire Marc Andreessen. In 2023, he argued in his venture capital firm’s manifesto that concerns over inequality, environmental degradation, and social atomization are the complaints of “decels” (decelerationists), who are irrationally against technological progress.33&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such elitist, anti-democratic, and monopolist views circulate within a complex web of ideologies that animate Silicon Valley. They loosely fall under the umbrella term of “Rationalism,” but also overlap with AI accelerationism and effective altruism (EA). EA found its voice on message boards like LessWrong, where users shared utilitarian solutions to long-tail civilizational risks. In what would be the movement’s deathblow, EA’s most famous proponent, crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried, viewed his embezzlement of customer funds as preventing long-term “risks.” He rationalized that saving his over-leveraged venture capitalist firm with others’ money, without their permission, was socially optimal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This self-inflicted wound to EA ultimately exposed the limitations of Rationalism generally. As Omar Hernandez observed in “Capitalism, Rationality, and Steven Pinker”, the Rationality community is the philosophical ecosystem of twenty-first-century technocrats.34 What binds them together is the goal of “removing cognitive biases,” as if parsing through bad code in the social body, done through quantitative assessments of the world. This quantitative view of the social world persists among tech elites. It is their main leverage for accruing power: the endless collection of personal data. On this basis, they lobby the state to argue that they alone possess the toolkit for social prediction. Some companies are shamelessly open about pushing this case—like Palantir, whose name is taken from an all-seeing orb that can predict the future in Lord of the Rings. The dream of today’s technocrats is coached in the same language as almost a century ago: that all social processes are measurable and can therefore be efficiently optimized and predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among all tech companies, Palantir has used this leverage most effectively. It represents the leading strategy for power nowadays among tech elites, namely integration with the state through data sharing and lucrative contracts. Palantir now provides data for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), intelligence for lethal force on the Ukrainian battlefield, machine learning for the Department of Defense, and citizen databases for the IRS and other government agencies, among other functions. As an integral part of the American state, it is one of the few contractors immune to the Trump administration’s cost-cutting. Alex Karp, its CEO, justifies his company’s mission in explicitly Americanist terms, arguing that the fusing of state power with Palantir and other tech giants is necessary to—as Co-Founder Joe Lonsdale put it—“save Western civilization.” Other companies, like OpenAI, Meta, and Google, have taken cues from his strategy of state alignment. In December 2025, the US Department of War announced that it will be integrating with Google’s Gemini AI platform.35&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But not all technocrats are pleased by this statist turn. Elon Musk, for one, tried to enter politics and then left abruptly without achieving any of his hyperbolic cost-cutting promises. He now believes only AI can save America.36 Others take an equally cynical view, and echo Thiel’s original concern that politics is incompatible with technological progress. The proposed alternative path forward is instead to exit and build power on the margins, ready to swallow a weakened American state when the time comes. This case was first made by tech investor Balaji S. Srinivasan in a 2013 speech at startup accelerator Y Combinator. America was “outdated and obsolescent” like Microsoft, he argued, and it was time for Silicon Valley to secede.37 The speech won roaring applause from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More recently, Srinivasan has been proselytizing a new belief that he likens to “tech Zionism.”38 Tech elites had to exit democracy and settle sovereign territories of their own. These peripheral islands of tech utopianism would in time unite, eventually accruing enough capital and power to challenge the nation-state. They would oversee a new tribe of loyal citizens dressed in matching gray. “If you see another gray on the street… you do a nod. You’re a fellow gray.”39&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This aesthetic choice, it must be said, is ridiculously on the nose: gray was also the color palette of the 1930s technocracy movement. Srinivasan’s ideas could easily be ignored if he was a pariah in the tech world, but he is not; the book explaining his worldview, The Network State: How to Start a New Country (2022) is quite popular. Andreessen has praised Srinivasan, in Rationalist terms, saying he “has the highest rate of output per minute of good new ideas of anybody I’ve ever met.”40&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technocracy today may have different strains of thought, but they ultimately converge on a pseudo-religious millenarian view of the world. What they disagree on is how to best achieve it. Given that technology is again being put forward as the sole mover of history, it is unsurprising that its wealthy beneficiaries view themselves as the rightful heirs of the coming social transformation. The belief is not so far removed from Howard Scott’s—who argued that “engineers and mechanics created this civilization, so they will eventually dominate it.” So, too, do today’s technocrats view themselves as the creators of this current civilization, and hence see it as their right to dominate it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twenty-first-century tech elites may not even know of the old technocracy movement, but have revived many of its ideas. Gone are the pomp and spectacle of rallies, however, since popular persuasion is no longer needed. Equally missing are the critiques of capitalism, since capital accumulation now benefits the new technocrats. Instead, we are left with pure technocratic technique, organizing numbers and data, to give substance to the old dream. Whatever its fantasies, they are nonetheless still tied to economic realities, and will live only so long as tech stocks soar.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Codex App Changes Everything!!! (not really)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Codex desktop app doesn't change everything - but it's part of a larger trend worth paying attention to. Where IDEs are headed and why specs matter more than code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, it doesn’t. The Codex desktop app dropped yesterday. You’ll see breathless Twitter posts and YouTube videos about how it changes everything. It doesn’t. But it is pretty cool, and it’s part of a larger trend worth paying attention to. I’m going to talk briefly about how it’s changing my workflow, and then zoom out to what it means that this app exists at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My Workflow (For Now)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll write a longer post on this, but the quick version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;My primary driver is Claude Code in the terminal. I think it has the best features, the most hooks, and the most ability to create a clean development workflow with all the checks I want.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Codex app is my parallelization layer. The thing that’s cool about it (and Conductor, which is similar) is that it makes Git worktrees easy to use. That means real parallelization.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how I’m experimenting with it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I have my main feature or project running in Claude Code in a terminal window&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Whenever I come up with changes, bug fixes, or investigations outside the scope of that feature, I spin up a worktree in the Codex app. I can chat with it separately. It lets me know when it needs input. It’s totally isolated, and I can merge it back whenever I want.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The TLDR: Codex app is OpenAI’s supported UI for multi-agent parallelized development. In my workflow, I use it to develop small features in parallel while I’m working on the main thing in Claude Code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Bigger Picture&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason I find this interesting isn’t the app itself, but what it says about where things are headed. I think about IDEs a lot because they’re a lens into where software development is going. I’ve said this before: software development will be unrecognizable in two to three years. And what’s happening with IDEs is proof.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“IDE” stands for integrated development environment. The name doesn’t imply it has to be about reading and writing code - but that’s what it’s always been. That’s changing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing: I don’t read code anymore. I used to write code and read code. Now when something isn’t working, I don’t go look at the code. I don’t question the code. I either ask one of my coding agents, or - more often - I ask myself: what happened with my system? What can I improve about the inputs that led to that code being generated?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The code isn’t the thing I’m debugging. The system that produced the code is. The people really leading AI coding right now (and I’d put myself near the front, though not all the way there) don’t read code. They manage the things that produce code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Continuum&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The image above illustrates how I think about this landscape. There’s a spectrum with three major zones: Code, Agents, and Specs. The further left you move, the higher up the stack you get.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code (right side): Traditional IDEs. VS Code, JetBrains. You read code, you write code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code + AI: AI-assisted features. Autocomplete, inline suggestions. GitHub Copilot lives here. The human is still driving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agentic IDEs: Cursor, Windsurf. Code and agents combined. The AI makes autonomous multi-file edits, runs terminal commands, iterates on its own work. But you’re still looking at code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multi-Agent Orchestration: Claude Code, Codex CLI, Codex app, Conductor. The whole interface is about managing agents. You’re not staring at code - you’re dispatching tasks, watching progress, reviewing PRs. Agent inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specs (left side): Kiro, GitHub Spec Kit, Vibe Scaffold. The spec is the primary artifact. Requirements → design → tasks → implementation. Code is an output, not the thing you manage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where This Is Going&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the industry is moving left. Toward specs. The code is becoming an implementation detail. What matters is the system that produces it - the requirements, the constraints, the architecture. Get those right, and the code follows. I’m actually building something in this area, focused on specs (not Vibe Scaffold 🙂). Hopefully I have some details in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of CIAâs oldest and most recognizable intelligence publications, The World Factbook, has sunset. The World Factbook served the Intelligence Community and the general public as a longstanding, one-stop basic reference about countries and communities around the globe. Letâs take a quick look into the history of The World Factbook. Â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over many decades, The World Factbook evolved from a classified to unclassified, hardcopy to electronic product that added new categories, and even new global entities. The original classified publication, titled The National Basic Intelligence Factbook, launched in 1962. The first unclassified companion version was issued in 1971. A decade later it was renamed The World Factbook. In 1997, The World Factbook went digital and debuted to a worldwide audience on CIA.gov, where it garnered millions of views each year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The World Factbook appealed to researchers, news organizations, teachers, students, and international travelers. Some readers even inquired whether their preferred geographic designation or world entity could be included on the high-profile site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, only CIA insiders would know that officers donated some of their personal travel photos to The World Factbook, which hosted more than 5,000 photographs that were copyright-free for anyone to access and use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though the World Factbook is gone, in the spirit of its global reach and legacy, we hope you will stay curious about the world and find ways to explore itâ¦ in person or virtually.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How we built a real-world benchmark for AI code review&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This blog reflects a collaborative effort by Qodo’s research team to design, build and validate the benchmark and this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This blog introduces the Qodo’s code review benchmark 1.0, a rigorous methodology developed to objectively measure and validate the performance of AI-powered code review systems, including Qodo Git Code Review. We address critical limitations in existing benchmarks, which primarily rely on backtracking from fix commits to buggy commits, thereby narrowly focusing on bug detection while neglecting essential code quality and best-practice enforcement. Furthermore, previous methods often utilize isolated buggy commits instead of simulating a complete pull request (PR) review scenario on genuine, merged PRs, and are constrained by a small scale of PRs and issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our research establishes a new standard by intentionally injecting defects into genuine, merged pull requests sourced from active, production-grade open-source repositories&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This novel approach is uniquely designed to simultaneously evaluate both code correctness (bug detection) and code quality (best practice enforcement) within a realistic code review context and at a significantly larger scale – 100 PRs containing a total of 580 issues. In a comparative evaluation pitting the Qodo model against 7 other leading AI code review platforms, Qodo demonstrated superior performance, achieving an F1 score of 60.1% for reliably identifying this diverse set of defects. The benchmark, including tools evaluated reviews, is publicly available in our benchmark GitHub organization. The following sections detail our benchmark creation methodology, experimental setup, comparative results, and key takeaways from this evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Related work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While there are many benchmarks for AI code generation and bug fixing, SWE‑Bench being the most well-known, the code review domain has historically lacked robust evaluation datasets. Greptile made an important first step by creating a benchmark based on backtracking from fix commits, measuring whether AI tools could catch historically fixed bugs. Augment also used this approach to evaluate several AI code review tools. These methods are effective at spotting real bugs but are limited in scale, often only a single bug per commit review, and do not capture the size, complexity, or context of full pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qodo takes a different approach by starting with real, merged PRs and injecting multiple issues, including both functional bugs and best-practice violations. This enables the creation of larger, more realistic benchmarks for testing AI tools in system-level code review scenarios, capturing not just correctness but also code quality and compliance. By combining larger-scale PRs with dual-focus evaluation, Qodo provides a more comprehensive and practical benchmark than prior work, reflecting the full spectrum of challenges encountered in real-world code review.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Methodology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Qodo Code Review Benchmark is constructed through a multi-stage process of injecting complex and non-obvious defects into real-world, merged pull requests (PRs) from active open-source repositories. This controlled injection approach is fundamentally designed to simultaneously evaluate both core objectives of a successful code review: code correctness (issues detection) and code quality (best practice enforcement). This integrated design allows us to create the first comprehensive benchmark that measures the full spectrum of AI code review performance, moving beyond traditional evaluations that focus mostly on isolated bug types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Importantly, this injection-based methodology is inherently scalable and repository-agnostic. Because the process operates on real merged PRs and extracts repository-specific best practices before injection, the benchmark generation can be applied to large volumes of PRs and to any codebase, open-source or private. This makes the framework a general mechanism for generating, high-quality code review evaluation data at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The benchmark repositories were strategically chosen to create a realistic, system-level code review environment. The core selection criteria focused on two aspects: 1) System-Level Code: Projects are production-grade, multi-component systems (e.g., server logic, FE, DB, API) that reflect the complexity of enterprise pull requests involving cross-module changes and architectural concerns. 2) Language Diversity: The set intentionally spans diverse technology stacks and ecosystems. including TypeScript, Python, JavaScript, C, C#, Rust, and Swift.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Repository Analysis and Rule Extraction: We first analyze each target repository to collect and formalize a set of best practice rules. These rules are carefully curated to align with the repository’s current coding standards, style guides, and contribution guidelines, extracted from documentation and full code base analysis using an Agent-based parsing process and human validation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;PR Collection &amp;amp; Filtering: PRs from targeted open-source repositories are collected via the GitHub API and subjected to strict technical filters (e.g., 3+ files, 50-15,000 lines changed, recently merged). To ensure the highest quality of ‘clean’ code for injection, we exclusively select PRs that were merged without subsequent reverts or immediate followup fix commits. After identifying all quality candidates, we validate that the selected PRs align with the extracted best practice rules before any compliance issues are injected.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Violation Injection (Compliance Stage): compliance violations are injected into each filtered, compliant PR using an LLM, corrupting the diff while preserving the original functionality.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Issues Injection (Additional Bugs Stage): an additional 1-3 functional/logical bugs are injected. These issues span various categories, including logical errors, edge case failures, race conditions, resource leaks, and improper error handling, creating a final benchmark instance with multiple, simultaneous defects for AI models to detect.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ground Truth Validation: Following all injection steps, we perform a double verification of all modified PRs. Any additional, naturally occurring subtle issues or best practice violations found during this final check are manually added to the ground truth list, ensuring the benchmark’s accuracy and comprehensive coverage of realistic defects.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Evaluation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Set up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The evaluation setup was designed to closely mirror a production development environment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Repository Environment: All benchmarked pull requests (PRs) were opened on a clean, forked repository. Prior to opening the PRs, we ensured that the repository-specific best practice rules, formalized in an AGENTS.md file, were committed to the root directory, making them accessible to all participating tools for compliance checks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Configuration: Each of the 7 evaluated code review tools was configured using its default settings to automatically trigger a review upon PR submission.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Execution &amp;amp; Validation: All benchmark PRs were systematically opened. We monitored all tools to confirm they ran without errors, re-triggering reviews when necessary to ensure complete coverage.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data Collection: Inline comments generated by each tool were meticulously collected.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Performance Measurement: The collected findings, inline comments generated by each tool, were rigorously compared against our validated ground truth using an LLM-as-a-judge system. The core metrics calculated are defined as follows: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Hit Definition: An inline comment generated by a tool is classified as a “Hit” (True Positive) if two criteria are met: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The comment text accurately describes the underlying issue&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The localization (the file and line number reference) is correct and points to the source of the issue.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;False Positive (FP): A comment is classified as a False Positive if it does not correspond to any issue in the ground truth list.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;False Negative (FN): An issue from the ground truth list is classified as a False Negative if no tool-generated comment meets the criteria of a “Hit” for that specific issue.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Recall: Calculated as the rate of ground truth issues recognized by the tool.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Precision: Calculated as the rate of tool-generated comments that correctly correspond to a ground truth issue.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;F1 Score: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hit Definition: An inline comment generated by a tool is classified as a “Hit” (True Positive) if two criteria are met: &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results reveal a clear and consistent pattern across tools. While several agents achieve very high precision, this comes at the cost of extremely low recall, meaning they identify only a small fraction of the actual issues present in the PRs. In practice, these tools are conservative: they flag only the most obvious problems to avoid false positives, but miss a large portion of subtle, system-level, and best-practice violations. This behavior inflates precision while severely limiting real review coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qodo, in contrast, demonstrates the highest recall by a significant margin, while still maintaining competitive precision, resulting in the best overall F1 score. This indicates that Qodo is able to detect a much broader portion of the ground-truth issues without overwhelming the user with noise. Importantly, precision is a dimension that can be tuned post-processing according to user preference (e.g., stricter filtering of findings), whereas recall is fundamentally constrained by the system’s ability to deeply understand the codebase, cross-file dependencies, architectural context, and repository-specific standards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; For Qodo, we report results for two operating configurations: Qodo Precise, which reports only issues that clearly require developer action, and Qodo Exhaustive, which is optimized for maximum coverage and recall. Notably, both configurations achieve higher F1 scores than all competing tools in this evaluation. The results reveal a clear and consistent pattern across tools.

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Appendix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Selected repositories&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The selected repositories span a broad and representative distribution of programming languages and system disciplines, covering full-stack web applications, distributed systems, databases, developer platforms, runtime infrastructures, and mobile applications, with complexity profiles ranging from single-language projects (redis in C, tauri in Rust) to polyglot systems (dify with Python/Go, aspnetcore with C#/JavaScript), making them well-suited candidates for code review benchmarking across different paradigms while reflecting the diversity of real-world codebases encountered in modern software development.&lt;/p&gt;
