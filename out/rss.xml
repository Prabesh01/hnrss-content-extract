    &lt;p&gt;If you were to close your eyes and picture a map of the world, chances are you would imagine a conventional image: North America (including Greenland) and Europe at the top, Africa somewhere in the middle, and South America, Australia, and Antarctica at the bottom. But it does not have to be so, and it was not always so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not that our planet underwent change—it did, of course, but long before maps. Our conventions as map readers and makers have converged over time to a north-up default. What happens when that convention is challenged? Robert Simmon, a cartographer who previously developed maps for Planet Labs and NASA Earth Observatory, designed a map to address that question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simmon’s map includes countries, major lakes, oceans, gulfs, seas, roads, and cities. It also features inset maps depicting Earth’s biosphere, global land cover, and bathymetry. All of these are familiar to most map readers. Yet the map may seem disorienting to many. Simmon’s map is geographically correct, yet purposely—and literally—turns convention on its head. What was once familiar becomes alien, challenging readers to look at Earth anew. It also encourages us to think more deeply about such conventions: Why is north almost always at the top of maps? And must it always be that way? Simmon’s map reminds us that it doesn’t have to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simmon is not the first to create a south-up map. Others have made these maps to challenge conventions and norms. And it was only rather recently that north-up maps became so commonplace. Centuries ago, cartographers drew maps with the top being south, east, or other orientations. These alternatives reflected the limited tools, knowledge, and practices of the time. The basic idea behind a compass (which most today recognize as a device that points north) was known to the Han and Tang dynasties of China more than 2,000 years ago. Early Chinese navigators used magnetized devices as a compass, but for them south was the dominant position from which bearings were derived.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deciding to put south, or north, at the top of maps is a decision of consequence. Psychologically, we tend to view things nearer the top as ‘good’ and those lower as ‘bad.’ This can influence our interpretation of maps at both global and local scales. Still, the prominence of north-up maps did not arrive deliberately to elevate the status of some areas or their rulers. It is in part a consequence of the work of Ptolemey, who first labeled his maps with calculated lines of latitude and longitude. This made it easy for others to copy, extend, and derive new maps. Each map drawn in this way would adopt Ptolemy’s orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless of the reasons for a given orientation and the implications that follow, Simmon’s map reminds us to challenge tradition and consider its influence. As both a map and a philosophical prompt, this example hits the mark beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;U.S. already has the critical minerals it needs – but they're being thrown away, new analysis shows&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In new Science article, Colorado School of Mines researchers call for more research, development and policy to increase critical mineral recovery&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the critical minerals the U.S. needs annually for energy, defense and technology applications are already being mined at existing U.S. facilities, according to a new analysis published today in the journal Science.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The catch? These minerals, such as cobalt, lithium, gallium and rare earth elements like neodymium and yttrium, are currently being discarded as tailings of other mineral streams like gold and zinc, said Elizabeth Holley, associate professor of mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines and lead author of the new paper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The challenge lies in recovery," Holley said. "It's like getting salt out of bread dough – we need to do a lot more research, development and policy to make the recovery of these critical minerals economically feasible."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To conduct the analysis, Holley and her team built a database of annual production from federally permitted metal mines in the U.S. They used a statistical resampling technique to pair these data with the geochemical concentrations of critical minerals in ores, recently compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey, Geoscience Australia and the Geologic Survey of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using this approach, Holley’s team was able to estimate the quantities of critical minerals being mined and processed every year at U.S. metal mines but not being recovered. Instead, these valuable minerals are ending up as discarded tailings that must be stored and monitored to prevent environmental contamination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is a brand-new view of ‘low hanging fruit’ – we show where each critical mineral exists and the sites at which even 1 percent recovery of a particular critical mineral could make a huge difference, in many cases dramatically reducing or even eliminating the need to import that mineral,” Holley said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The analysis in Science looks at a total of 70 elements used in applications ranging from consumer electronics like cell phones to medical devices to satellites to renewable energy to fighter jets and shows that unrecovered byproducts from other U.S. mines could meet the demand for all but two – platinum and palladium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among the elements included in the analysis are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cobalt (Co): The lustrous bluish-gray metal, a key component in electric car batteries, is a byproduct of nickel and copper mining. Recovering less than 10 percent of the cobalt currently being mined and processed but not recovered would be more than enough to fuel the entire U.S. battery market.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Germanium (Ge): The brittle silvery-white semi-metal used for electronics and infrared optics, including sensors on missiles and defense satellites, is present in zinc and molybdenum mines. If the U.S. recovered less than 1 percent of the germanium currently mined and processed but not recovered from U.S. mines, it would not have to import any germanium to meet industry needs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The benefits of enhanced recovery are not only economic and geopolitical but also environmental, Holley said – recovering these critical minerals instead of sending them to tailings piles would reduce the environmental impact of mine waste and open more opportunities for reuse in construction and other industries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Now that we know which sites are low-hanging fruit, we need to conduct detailed analyses of the minerals in which these chemical elements reside and then test the technologies suitable for recovery of those elements from those specific minerals,” Holley said. “We also need policies that incentivize mine operators to incorporate additional processing infrastructure. Although these elements are needed, their market value may not be sufficient to motivate operators to invest in new equipment and processes without the right policies in place.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Co-authors on the paper are Karlie Hadden, PhD candidate in geology; Dorit Hammerling, associate professor of applied mathematics and statistics; Rod Eggert, research professor of economics and business; Erik Spiller, research professor of mining engineering; and Priscilla Nelson, professor of mining engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

    SSH and FileVault&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When FileVault is enabled, the data volume is locked and unavailable during and after booting, until an account has been authenticated using a password. The macOS version of OpenSSH stores all of its configuration files, both system-wide and per-account, in the data volume. Therefore, the usually configured authentication methods and shell access are not available during this time. However, when Remote Login is enabled, it is possible to perform password authentication using SSH even in this situation. This can be used to unlock the data volume remotely over the network. However, it does not immediately permit an SSH session. Instead, once the data volume has been unlocked using this method, macOS will disconnect SSH briefly while it completes mounting the data volume and starting the remaining services dependent on it. Thereafter, SSH (and other enabled services) are fully available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The capability to unlock the data volume over SSH appeared in macOS 26 Tahoe.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The images arrive already complete; there is no communication between them and myself, no reciprocal exchange. As much as we like to say that the world is opening up to us, since we can see every part of it, we can also say that the world is closing itself off – in all its openness.&lt;/p&gt;Karl Ove Knausgård&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In academia and the media, AI is often described as mirroring human psychology with humanlike reasoning, human-level performance, human-like communication. In these comparisons, “humans” are treated as the benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a provocative 2023 paper, researchers at Harvard University asked – which humans?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The diversity of human psychologies has been a hot topic since 2010, when researchers found that many accepted psychological “truths” were often confined to so-called “WEIRD people”: Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, Democratic. What feel like universal beliefs for people like me and no doubt many of the readers of this blog, e.g. that I am an automonous individual, are instead only true for a thin slice of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So when we say AI tools are “human-like”, what we mean is that AI is WEIRD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, this paper found that more than that, it thinks American. The greater the cultural distance between a country and the USA, the less accurate ChatGPT got at simulating peoples’ values. For countries like Libya and Pakistan, AI results are little better than a coin toss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This paper showed this through an ingenious method – administering the World Values Survey (WVS) 1,000 times to ChatGPT and then comparing it to real data from other countries. The WVS measures everything from self-reported cultural values to moral principles, attitudes towards family, religion, poverty and so on.[1]&lt;lb/&gt;In this simple chart, they plotted two variables:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The eagle-eyed reader may note that ChatGPT responses are slightly more correlated to smaller Western countries such as New Zealand than the US. This likely reflects the USA’s greater cultural diversity, and the fact that ChatGPT was developed in California.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marketers and researchers in non-WEIRD countries have often struggled for budget and bandwidth. AI tools’ poorer accuracy in their markets therefore introduce a double jeopardy: the non-WEIRD countries least likely to secure research budgets also have the worst accuracy from “off the shelf” AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These biases could show up throughout the research process, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a real risk that increasing use of AI tools in international research will flatten out and devalue insights, as highly diverse peoples’ individual spoken and unspoken responses are fed into text-processing machines and emerge looking and sounding vaguely Californian. What looks like a living, breathing forest to us may end up being processed as just so much wood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean we should ignore AI tools when working cross-culturally. They’re simply too useful. Instead, I’d suggest that we need to invest in the cultural fitness of our thinking and processes. Just as you don’t have to lose physical stamina when you start driving a car, your projects do not have to atrophy cultural meaning when you introduce elements of automation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As researchers we can deepen the cultural layer in our international work by:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And as AI product owners or users, it’s more a question of how we minimise the loss of cultural meaning. I remain to be convinced that AI moderation will achieve that for as long as the “moderator” is powered by an American LLM with deep-coded cultural biases. When using AI for analysis or to design research, however, there is likely to be marginal value in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs process information in a WEIRD way, are psychologically WEIRD, and assume the average human is too. At the same time, the LLM space is getting ever more concentrated with US companies dominating. There is a real risk that as researchers we could get pulled into ways of working and thinking that make the world feel smaller, and much less wondrous. We must build our cultural fitness to ensure that we can introduce automation without losing sight of the many ways of being human. &lt;lb/&gt;Here at STRAT7 (and for me personally), we want to explore further:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re going to conduct a few experiments of our own with LLMs from different continents – comment below if you have any thoughts on what to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[1] Separately, I recommend checking out the WVS website – it is old school but has some great data and insights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[2] The researchers released an interactive tool to compare cultural distance across a range of dimensions, worth a play around&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Tour David Lynch's house as it hits the market&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Lynch's LA estate is for sale at $15m, and the listing pictures offer a glimpse into the late filmmaker's aesthetic and creative universe&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David Lynch, the visionary American filmmaker behind Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet and Mulholland Dr, passed away this January, yet his creative universe endures in objects, spaces and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among the most striking of these relics is his larger-than-life, meticulously designed Hollywood Hills home; a cinematic setting in its own right. Perched on a sweeping 2.3-acre hillside, David Lynch’s private compound, which is now listed for $15 million by Marc Silver of The Agency, unfolds like one of his own intricately plotted storylines. A showcase of Mid-Century modern architecture, the estate was conceived with the same care and cinematic precision that defined his work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Inside David Lynch's Los Angeles estate&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The property, set across five contiguous parcels, reads like a storyboard in relief: three main residences and several ancillary structures stepping down the hillside, each capturing a different note in Lynch’s creative oeuvre.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The story behind this compound started in 1987, when he acquired the pink-hued Beverly Johnson House designed in the early 1960s by Lloyd Wright, son of Frank Lloyd Wright. The home, in fact, was recognised by Historic Places LA as an exemplary work of Mid-Century Modern residential design. Then in 1991, he commissioned Eric Lloyd Wright (Lloyd Wright’s son) to add a pool and pool house, extending the Wright imprint on his property with a new generation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across the years, Lynch kept expanding the plotline: in 1989, he purchased an adjoining two-bedroom Brutalist house; in 1995, a studio building; and later, more pieces of land, ultimately shaping a seven-structure sanctuary with 10 bedrooms and 11 bathrooms spread over roughly 11,000 square feet. The result was a creative campus perched above the city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the heart of the compound lies the architectural crescendo – the approximately 2,000 square feet home where light pours through generous windows and skylights to rake across organic textures and bold geometries. The facade’s cement chevrons catch the sun; inside, simple metalwork and natural woods are drenched in material honesty that often surfaced in Lynch’s films.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two neighbouring addresses deepen the lore: 7029 Senalda served as the home of Asymmetrical Productions, while 7035 Senalda attained near-mythic status as both the Madison residence in the movie Lost Highway and Lynch’s own studio, complete with a library, screening room and editing suite – spaces where he refined major works, including Mulholland Drive.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Beyond the exemplary structures, Lynch left a personal handprint, collaborating on additional buildings: a sculptural two-storey guest house and a one-bedroom retreat finished in his favoured smooth grey plaster. Outdoors the terraces, courtyards and planted walkways offer a counterpoint to the intensity of production and everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a listing note from The Agency suggests, this is a 'creative sanctuary and architectural landmark,' with provenance unlike any other in Los Angeles. For admirers of Lynch, it reads as both home and archive: a lived-in factory of ideas, meticulously composed and, at last, ready for its next act.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Help Us Raise $200k to Free JavaScript from Oracle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After more than 27,000 people signed our open letter to Oracle about the “JavaScript” trademark, we filed a formal Cancellation Petition with the US Patent and Trademark Office. Ten months in, we’re finally reaching the crucial discovery phase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deno initiated this petition since we have legal standing as a JavaScript runtime, but it’s really on behalf of all developers. If we win, “JavaScript” becomes public domain – free for all developers, conferences, book authors, and companies to use without fear of trademark threats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re asking for your support through our GoFundMe campaign so we can put forward the strongest case possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why $200k?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because federal litigation is expensive. Discovery is the most resource-intensive stage of litigation, where evidence is collected and arguments are built.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t want to cut corners – we want to make the best case possible by funding:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Professional public surveys that carry legal weight in front of the USPTO, proving that “JavaScript” is universally recognized as the name of a language, not Oracle’s brand.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expert witnesses from academia and industry to testify on JavaScript’s history, usage, and meaning.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Depositions and records from standards bodies, browser vendors, and industry leaders showing Oracle has no role in the language’s development.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Legal filings and responses to counter Oracle’s claims at every step.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there are leftover funds, we’ll donate them to the OpenJS to continue defending civil liberties in the digital space. None of the funds will go to Deno.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Oracle officially denies “JavaScript” is generic&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On August 6th, 2025, Oracle for the first time addressed the validity of the trademark. Their response to our petition denies that “JavaScript” is a generic term.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re a web developer, it’s self-evident that Oracle has nothing to do with JavaScript. The trademark system was never meant to let companies squat on commonly-used names and rent-seek – it was designed to protect active brands in commerce. US law makes this distinction explicit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We urge you to read our petition and open letter to understand our arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we don’t win discovery, Oracle locks in ownership of the word “JavaScript.” This is the decisive moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this case is bigger than JavaScript. It’s about whether trademark law works as written, or whether billion-dollar corporations can ignore the rule that trademarks cannot be generic or abandoned. “JavaScript” is obviously both. If Oracle wins anyway, it undermines the integrity of the whole system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s make sure the law holds. Please donate. Please share and upvote this.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;These Ant Queens Seem to Defy Biology: They Lay Eggs That Hatch Into Another Species&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Iberian harvester ant queens produce offspring of their own species and of the builder harvester ant, seemingly by cloning males&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iberian harvester ant queens have a unique superpower: They can lay eggs that hatch into an entirely different species.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This discovery, described in a new paper published September 3 in the journal Nature, defies a fundamental principle of biology and may cause scientists to reconsider how they define a species.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The classic concept says that [a species] is a group of organisms with similar physical and genetic characteristics that can reproduce with each other in nature and produce fertile offspring,” says Xim Cerdá, an ecologist at Doñana Biological Station in Spain who was not involved with the research, to Miguel Ángel Criado at El País. “But it turns out that’s not the case; two species are needed here. We’re going to have to rethink the concept.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Did you know? How many ants are on the planet?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scientists estimate that 20 quadrillion ants are crawling around the Earth, according to a 2022 study.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scientists recently discovered that Iberian harvester ant queens (Messor ibericus) mate with males of another species, the builder harvester ant (Messor structor). When they do, the M. ibericus queens store the M. structor male’s sperm, then use it to fertilize some of the eggs they lay. Researchers think the M. ibericus queens remove their own genetic material from the eggs’ nuclei, so that when those eggs hatch, they effectively turn out to be M. structor male clones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The queens produce males of both M. ibericus and M. structor, and all the worker ants in M. ibericus colonies are female hybrids of the two species.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s an absolutely fantastic, bizarre story of a system that allows things to happen that seem almost unimaginable,” says Jacobus Boomsma, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Copenhagen who was not involved with the research, to Nature’s Max Kozlov.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even more perplexing is the fact that M. ibericus and M. structor are not closely related, evolutionarily speaking. The two species diverged more than five million years ago, according to the paper. For comparison, scientists think humans and chimpanzees split from a common ancestor that lived between six million and eight million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proving the relationship between M. ibericus and M. structor was challenging. The scientists dug up various M. ibericus colonies they found along the sides of farm roads near Lyon, France, looking for male ants. But among a colony of 10,000 ants, there might be only a few males, writes Science’s Erik Stokstad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, they found 132 males from 26 M. ibericus colonies. Of those, about half were nearly hairless—a hallmark of M. structor—while the others were covered in dense hair, a trait typically found in M. ibericus. DNA testing confirmed their hunch: The hairy males were M. ibericus, and the bald ones were M. structor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even more intriguing, the males of both species shared M. ibericus mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited from the mother, suggesting they had all been born from M. ibericus queens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This discovery is so novel and so unusual that the researchers had to come up with a new term to describe the behavior exhibited by M. ibericus queens: “xenoparity,” which essentially means “foreign birth.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team also wanted to go beyond genetic evidence: They hoped to observe births of M. structor ants from an M. ibericus queen. So, they reared colonies in their laboratory. Then, they waited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It was very difficult, because in lab conditions, it’s nearly impossible to have males,” says co-author Jonathan Romiguier, an ecologist at the University of Montpellier in France, to New Scientist’s Tim Vernimmen. “We had something like 50 colonies and monitored them for two years without a single male being born. Then we got lucky.” Observing the births of M. structor males was another key piece of evidence in describing the ants’ strange biology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for the M. ibericus males in the colony, the queens mate with them to produce the next generation of M. ibericus queens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But why do M. ibericus queens clone M. structor males? Scientists aren’t totally sure, but they say the partnership must be beneficial to both species.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For M. ibericus, this adaptation ensures they have plenty of workers, which are responsible for many important tasks in a colony, including building the nest, gathering food and raising the larvae. The arrangement also keeps M. structor males around for future M. ibericus queens to mate with, even in places without M. structor colonies. Shockingly, M. structor colonies are only found in mountainous areas across a small range. But by transporting the M. structor male clones around, M. ibericus has allowed that species to spread to new places.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the unique setup might not last forever. Because the M. structor males are clones and do not appear to be mating with members of their own species, they are probably accumulating harmful genetic mutations, which makes them more vulnerable in the long run, reports New Scientist. But, for now, the relationship seems to be working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Every step in this coevolutionary game makes perfect sense and uses the entire toolbox of reproductive tricks that we know ants are capable of employing,” says Sara Helms Cahan, an evolutionary ecologist at the University of Vermont who was not involved with the research, to Science. “The end result is fantastical but incredibly successful, with one species carrying another in its pocket, as it were, all over southern Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s curry night and service is in full swing. Baileys and bitter flow from the bar, kormas are ladled at tables, and laughter, complaints, and spills erupt through dentures. As I give a Nan a naan, a yell cuts through the noise; an older lady has fallen by the serving hatch and is unable to stand unassisted. “Would you give me a hand, sweetheart?”, she calmly asks, “Don’t touch her!” the bar manager snaps as I bend towards her. “You’re not allowed to touch her!” The woman blinks up at me, confused. “We have to call the care team — otherwise she could sue.” And so, for the next 45 minutes, she lies there, motionless but conscious and otherwise unhurt. “I won’t sue,” she promises, as staff avert their gaze, stepping over her to deliver Guinnesses, Pernods and chicken tikka masalas. Occasionally, she rolls onto one side. Eventually, she is hoisted to her feet, the official hoister having arrived on the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, over 90,000 older people live in over 1,700 similar developments, where scenes like this play out all the time. They’re advertised in glossy magazines subtly named Silver and Dignity, and their brochures often include salt-and-pepper bearded Adonises playing croquet, or else happy couples watching the sunset with a glass of wine. On-site dining is often offered — restaurants serving the British classics: sausage and mash, fish and chips, the ubiquitous curries — alongside shops, gyms, swimming pools and libraries. Every group is catered for. And, judging by the marketing, these villages look like the kind of place you might tell your children grandma went to play with the other grandmas, or even the perfect setting for a best-selling multimedia cosy crime series.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the reality, as that lady’s fall in the cafeteria implies, is often very different. Residents face service charges averaging £524 a month, on top of ground rents that can exceed £500 a year. And if some fees are certain, others can bewilder both residents and their kids. While private organisations and charities often own these villages, after all, one provider sold 25% of its properties to the local council for use as social housing. The remaining 75% are privately purchased by residents. With no standardised model, understanding exactly what you’re signing up for can be hard. In some cases, responsibility for selling the property falls to the next of kin — with homes left on the market for months, often years. Research shows that around half are eventually sold at a loss, during which time families can still be liable for council tax, service charges and ground rent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got to know this grim reality firsthand. I used to work in one as a jobbing receptionist, translator, delivery-boy, diplomat, and often faux-grandson to the residents of the apartment complex of over 300 flats in the south-east of England. And now, I’m back, for the first time since leaving university. It’s the end of lunch and the café is quiet. Three ladies are in bejewelled finery as if on the Titanic; they sit and sigh and wait. They are, of course, all waiting for the inevitable as I realise when I enthusiastically approach someone I recognise. “How’s Harry?” I ask. “Dead.” “Helen?” “Dead.” “Lucy?” “In care.” “Pirate Paul?” (he wore an eye-patch and a cap with an anchor on it.) “Dead, I found him.” “Mary One?” “Alive.” “Mary Two?” “Nope.” “Bombay Jan?” “In the bar.” “Little John?” “Had a fall”. Either time is of the essence or there’s something in the custard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The village tessellates out from a central plaza. The foyer is bright white, its hunched ceiling propped up by columns along the main thoroughfare. There are no windows, only a rectangular skylight along the roof — which, despite easing any ascension, gives me a feeling of already being six feet under. Vast new-build tiers stretch outward, lined with numbered doors and passageways that weave into the distance. I’m told the architects modelled the building on a cruise ship, though the interior feels closer to the Isle of Wight ferry. Along the main walkway, as promised in the brochure, there’s a little shop, gym, hairdresser, and woodwork room. To the right, an expansive bar and restaurant, where white tablecloths are decorated with neatly laid tables — though there was more life on the Mary Celeste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I find the manager of another site — part of a national chain — in a side room typically reserved for “events” (wakes). He’s the same height as many residents, has a mop of brown hair, and wears a translucent white shirt. He’s quick to burst the bubble that, despite older people’s endearing appearance, retirement villages are a community like any other. “Half the residents here are nobs,” he tells me. “You can get any walk of life here. Some are looking for sheltered housing, others are escaping from domestic abuse, things like that.” There isn’t much of that here, he hastens to add, but in facilities with 300 apartments, there’s always a chance of copping a “wrong’un” as a neighbour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not that these risks put a dent in demand. As the manager says, there’s a 12-18 month waiting list for rentals, while sales can take up to a year. “But if you’re a cash buyer,” he adds, with a wry smile, “it puts you up to the top of the list.” It’s impossible, here, not to return to the question of money — for amid the ground rents and tax bills, many of these places are ultimately run as businesses. “Regardless of if you own it or rent it, it always comes back to us,” says the manager of a care home’s business model, explaining that for every year someone lives in the property, 1% of the original purchase price is taken off what the company will eventually buy it back from you (or your estate) for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If, for example, you buy a flat for £100,000, then live in it for a decade, you’d see a return of just £90,000. That errant 10% is chalked up to maintenance and bills — and excludes a range of other fees — with the money passed back to your next of kin if you die. In practice, though, the economics can be even more brutal than these calculations imply. I meet one resident, a short man, with a flat cap smudged onto his head, who tells me his apartment was worth £170,000 when he entered into a shared ownership agreement with the council. Not only does he lose 1% of its value every year — plus additional fees — but “flats of that size are going for 400 grand now, which is a bit of a kick in the teeth, innit?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That touches at a deeper issue that gnaws at this community: the buy-back price excludes any allowance for inflation. In other words, then, the man with the cap bought a share of a flat worth £170,000, and it may now be worth £400,000 on the open market — but when he dies, the company will buy back his share from his next of kin for less than he originally paid. No wonder he feels cheated out of the property’s increased value. Certainly, it’s a jarring contrast to how property works “on the outside” — as residents call it. But here, there’s no such thing as capital appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defenders of the care home system would claim its benefits are supposedly quantifiable. One retirement village charity commissioned a team from Aston University to investigate the health outcomes for residents. Over their six-year study, the researchers reported a 38% reduction in NHS costs, a 64% drop in depression, a 75% increase in physical activity, with 86.5% of residents reporting they “never or hardly ever” felt lonely. It’s a sentiment echoed by the people I meet. Wally, with his neatly-combed grey hair, wears a chequered shirt and has saved me a seat among his circle. They’re sharing bottles of rosé in the foyer. Wally pours himself a glass, and they all guffaw as he dribbles some onto the faux-marble table. He has lived here for 12 years, and tells me “this is the best thing that could’ve happened to me” — especially given his wife has died and Wally himself faces a range of health issues. “If I’d have stayed in my house,” he adds, “I’d have had a very, very lonely life.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That might be enough to make Richard Osman smile, but it’s hard to feel sentimental when I recall my own experiences: shepherding confused residents to the toilet; placing cones beside rogue deposits in the restaurant; mopping up suspicious puddles (custard, John Smiths, or other); nudging care teams about overstuffed stoma bags; and politely reminding people of where exactly they live.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many in the community I visit feel unhappy with the village’s ageing demographics, even as they feel misled by the marketing. The snooker balls crack as I am beckoned by a coven of residents in a circle of armchairs in front of the bar. “If you want the dirt, come and sit with us,” Janet divulges. She slithers into a chair beside John, who wears a polo shirt, glasses, and a marbled moustache, which he marinates with a pint of bitter — immediately noting how it costs “five quid, even though we subsidise it”. They’re both in their late 60s. John moved in 13 years ago, after what he recounts as “18 months of persuasion” from his wife (not Janet). He describes recently coming downstairs into the hall and finding “it’s full of bloody old people!” While this can feel like complaining about sand in the desert, John argues that the place was marketed as a “thriving, active community”. Now, though, “it’s a miracle if you can get a couple coming in and one of them can walk”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;John and Janet are so indignant about the migration of elderly people to the village, I half expect them to roll out a “stop the scooters” banner. They conspiratorially discuss the procurement process in half-whispers. “Old people don’t live long, so [the company] gets a quick turnover,” John explains. “They’re moving the older people in to get the money, see?” They explain that, beyond the clear financial benefit of reselling the apartment to a new resident, departing owners, or their next of kin, are also charged exit fees. Some organisations demand as much as 35% of the property’s market value. Yet with the rising costs of nursing homes — the average monthly rate of residential care is currently £5,192 — John also claims that retirement villages are still cheaper: in the short term anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beneath the soft furnishings and glossy brochures, it’s anyway hard not to spot something rather cynical, with some residents beginning to sense that places like this aren’t built to care. They’re built, rather, to farm, with elderly residents harvested for their savings and extracted for maximum yield. That’s clear enough from all those costs and fees — but arguably, too, from the fact that many residents also volunteer. “We’re on reception, the bar, groups, facilities, all sorts,” Janet enthuses, with half her peers signed up to unpaid odd jobs. Yet if people like Janet surely find a sense of purpose in this work, it’s undoubtedly cheaper to employ fewer staff. As John angrily puts it: “It’s a money-saving scheme!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I ask the manager about this, he chuckles. “We have a bit of a running joke with sales, and we say ‘oh that one can walk!’”. Despite the threshold being 55, he says “people moving in are more like 82-83”. But he pours cold water on the idea that there’s a conspiracy afoot. Rather, he blames the disparity of wealth between generations. Emerging as the wealthiest age group in the UK, Baby Boomers are simply more able to afford life in a village compared to their younger peers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be fair, volunteerism isn’t merely there to help the village’s bottom line. Jacqueline — in her 80s, with rosy cheeks and heavy makeup — proudly describes her work on the resident’s association. “We meet once a month,” she tells me, “and keep an eye on all sorts of things: the internal situation in regards to the building, the gardens being managed, and the fundraising initiatives.” Their latest victory comes after campaigning for 12 months to get a dedicated bus. “It’s a loop bus,” Wally declares, “it takes you in any direction: hospital, the shops, the garden centre, the pharmacy, you name it it goes there. It’s changed our lives, that bus. Without it, we’d be stuck.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s evening now. The bar lights are dimmed and a sea of chairs face a mocked-up stage where a semi-professional singer croons. Couples, new-found and long-weathered, hold hands and sway like anchored boats on a gentle tide. Friends greet each other with hugs and remove handbags from reserved seats. Electric wheelchairs beep as they dock. A joyous squadron of women flaunt their mobility with line-dancing moves learnt in a community class. John joins me at the bar and we observe the scene. “It suits a lot of people down to the ground,” he defeatedly reflects. For those who have lost their loved ones, and who risk being isolated, you can’t put a price on community. But, for John, it “just hurts me to give them thousands of pounds for nothing”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It strikes me that no matter the service charge, or the quality of the restaurant — which John chides as “more like a backstreet cafe” — or whether privately owned or council-housed, you may still end up defecating onto your shoe in the middle of a bistro. No amount of ground rent can protect your dignity when there is an intrinsic lack of it in ageing. That’s the part The Thursday Murder Club glosses over. You don’t see Pierce Brosnan shuffling down a hallway in stained joggers, unsure where he’s going. Helen Mirren isn’t seen denuded of dignity, lying on her back and promising she won’t sue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet whichever way you look at it, this sordid future is exactly what’s waiting for more of us each year. The UK is facing a shortfall of over 487,000 homes for pensioners, with The Times reporting in 2022 that more than 3,000 retirement villages will be needed to meet demand. The Leasehold Reform Act 2024 promised to fix exploitative charges and ban leasehold sales on new homes — except retirement villages. As a society, we turn away from those in their last years, glamorise them in glib novels, perhaps because the truth about ageing is so hard to stomach. Looking an old person in the eye, as they lie on the floor, unable to stand, begging to be held, is too uncomfortable. So those who can afford it outsource the problem, outsource the care, and outsource their responsibility. Independent living schemes are here to stay, but without urgent reform, vulnerable older people will continue to be exploited, and that’s not a problem we should simply step over.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Youtube has been turning on AV1 for 1080p content for me. My phone is the only device with an AV1 hardware decoder. The impact on battery life and CPU usage has been extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can tell Youtube to prefer AV1 only for low-quality videos (https://www.youtube.com/account_playback) or you can install an extension that will force h264 playback where supported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other playback features such as ambient mode and volume equalisation can also impact performance, though that kind of depends on how fast your web browser is at executing Javascript, and to a much smaller extent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The substantial bandwidth savings are here to stay, though, so in time I think Youtube will move to AV1 more often.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the video is encoded using a codec your hardware doesn't handle, it would be left up to the CPU to decode. Av1 can slow everything down to a crawl over CPU. You'd think the browser would be smart about the stream selection though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe Youtube's player is driving codec selection, not the browser (i.e. the player requests a list of supported codecs and then picks the one most beneficial for Google, not the other way around).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, I've solved this problem for myself on macOS and Firefox by setting media.webrtc.codec.video.av1.enabled to false on about:config, as all other codecs used by Youtube are hardware accelerated on my Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's intentional on YouTubes end, they aim to serve more bitrate-efficient codecs wherever possible, even if it's a high burden on the client due to a lack of hardware acceleration. They'll only fall back to older codecs if the client is completely incapable of handling the modern ones. It's annoying but at their scale it no doubt saves them a shitload of bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I run an extension that allows to automatically request h.264 streams from YouTube even when av1 is also available. Saves a lot of CPU, at the cost of some bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s funny that this kind of browser extension has recurred over the years. Originally it was to replace the awful CPU hog flash player with an HTML5 h.264 player[1], then it was to sidestep YouTube’s insistence on VP* codecs, and now it’s to sidestep AV1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a beautiful world, there would be a link to each codec to let the user decide, or the browser itself would override the web site's preference and provide such links. It's sad that we keep having to resort to browser extensions to circumvent terrible web site and browser software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assuming you have hardware support for VP9 as well, setting media.webrtc.codec.video.av1.enabled to false on about:config achieves the same outcome without an extension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yep, that's what I use. It took youtube from using 100% cpu, to the point where my little xps13 was thermal throttling, to 50% cpu running 1080p at 2-3x speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also: Recently my videos "goes full black" for few milliseconds (not matter which way to see them, but yt is where I noted it more). I'm on M3, and can't pin point a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If someone sees, oh YouTube is making my computer hot, the last thing that's going to occur to them is, "wait let me try turning off my adblocker."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When corporations try to change people's incentives, they are obvious about it, so people know what to change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast, changing CPU usage on video playback for people who use adblockers and then not telling anyone is... just not a strategy that makes any sense at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I find it fascinating that people think 12 seconds armchair psychology is enough to definitively rule out phenomena that hinge on complex tech and complex human deliberations about policy. That works on campy monster of the week TV shows but it catastrophically underestimates real world complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've got documented cases in the wild of youtube adding 5 second timer, as well as experimenting with 3 video limits for adblock users, not to mention the cat and mouse game of breaking scraper-oriented tools like Newpipe. So it's happened before, and on-the-ground evidence of historical precedent and a straight look at incentives tell us more than assumed psychological states.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did you mean to reply to a different comment? Mine didn't say anything about psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you do seem to be strengthening my comment -- when YouTube was implementing a 3 video limit for users blocking ads, they were doing so with a big huge message: "It looks like you may be using an ad blocker. Video playback will be blocked unless YouTube is allowlisted or the ad blocker is disabled."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That makes sense as a strategy, telling the user what to change. Silently using up more CPU doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incompetence is by definition not intentional, and sabotage is the action of a rogue employee, not corporate strategy. A corporation can't intentionally sabotage itself, by definition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think that has any connection to the subject under discussion, which is about whether YouTube CPU performance would lead people to turn off adblockers. Not about getting people to switch to Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Possibly You are conflating CPU usage with halting of video for length of the ad? ad blocker halts the video i.e.spinner widget appears for length of the ad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sorry, but drive-by philosophy is not applicable here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;YouTube developers single out adblocker users and taunt them with an "Experiencing interruptions" toast prompt that locks the video stream for ~5 seconds. Curiously, it contains a link to the YouTube Help Center, to the section fragment "#check_ad_blockers". In other words: "yeah, we know you've got uBlock Origin enabled, enjoy the speedbump".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Player base.js:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;api.XL("innertubeCommand",{openPopupAction:{popup:{notificationActionRenderer:{responseText:{runs:[{text:"Experiencing interruptions?"}]},actionButton:{buttonRenderer:{style:"STYLE_OVERLAY",size:"SIZE_DEFAULT", text:{runs:[{text:"Find out why"}]},navigationEndpoint:{commandMetadata:{webCommandMetadata:{url:"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3037019#check_ad_blockers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google does - Google search and maps have gotten objectively worse over the past 2 years. At least in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have 38 locations in my (huge) city saved in Google maps and it breaks when I ask it to find a way from point A to point B. Works fine when logged out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maps also put traffic signals where there are none, and while finding shortest path it stopped putting weights to traffic signals. So you could have it route you via a city's main street instead of the freeway because it's 2km shorter but it ignores the 9 traffic signals that wastes 15 mins. Apple maps works fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google search on web has adopted bad UX, and clicking a map or a shopping item has a noticeable delay between. Also right click "Open in new tab" options are gone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you saying all these "enshittification" changes are deliberate?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I work for another large streaming site where people like to use adblockers. These adblockers also cause similar performance issues that are entirely caused by awful code in these blockers. I've studied the code for all of these blockers and they do stuff like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Constantly hammering the playlist endpoint to try and get something without an ad stitched in&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Constantly tearing down and remaking the player&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- During an ad, requesting the playlist for every other quality to see if those do not have any stitched ads&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Proxying all traffic to servers the adblocker people own in countries where ads are not typically served (eg Russia)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Intercepting playlist requests and simply deleting segments that they believe are ads (oh no why is my stream broken!!! stupid streaming website!!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Youtube _could_ be doing something here, but there is also a very real chance your adblocker code is simply bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of what you're mentioning applies to uBlock interacting with YouTube, I suspect you're talking about Twitch, which bakes the ad breaks into the stream so you still get the stream interrupted even you manage to block the ads, making people resort to hacky things like using the homepage player when an ad would be played.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This memory leak happens very often to me in GitHub, not sure why, and not sure if it's Microsoft's fault, or Firefox's. I actually have no idea at all on how to debug this...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firefox Console &amp;gt; Memory &amp;gt; Enable record call stacks, reload the page, take a snapshot, wait until you notice memory grows, take another snapshot. Then compare the two: https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/memory.... You can also try a performance recording.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you probably won't be able to make much sense of the results without a lot of effort because of all the minimization/obfuscation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Somewhat relevant: can somebody share good mpv defaults (or some other interesting technique) for playing YT videos? I have managed to get it to work, but it still pauses a lot for bufferring. I wonder if there's maybe some yt-dlp, ffmpeg, etc. trick to pre-cache some segments or something like that. The reason to play it in mpv is not to avoid commercials (I have a paid account), but because I can then play it from my editor while fully controlling the playback - it works great for watching lectures and taking notes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have weird issues with YouTube on my home PC. If I have a Chrome window with a YouTube video running to the side of my monitor, it always inevitably ends up freezing up the whole display. Ctrl+Alt+Delete and cancelling back in makes it go away briefly, however sometimes it can just keep freezing the monitor up constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The weird thing is, the PC (running Windows 11) has a powerful graphics card which can handle AAA games (as of earlier this year at least), graphics drivers are all up to date, and YouTube works fine in fullscreen across the whole ultra-wide monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just can't work out what's causing it. It makes running YouTube side-by-side with other programs a real pain in the ass. It's been like this for months now. Checked browser HWA settings, and they're all as they should be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you have an iGPU+dGPU combo like in a gaming laptop? For my 2019 gaming laptop with a i915+RTX2060, if I leave the switchable option on in the hardware settings (meaning the OS can choose which GPU to use ie. iGPU for low power), I end up with similar behavior in Linux/Win10. The external port actually uses the dGPU so rendering must go through it but it will struggle with the switchable option and I end up with freezing or stutters. In Linux, I explicitly configure Xorg to only use the iGPU and reserve the dGPU for model inference which fixes the stuttering issue. When booting into Win10, I explicitly disable the iGPU and turn off the external monitor so my VR playing doesn't stutter or youtube doesn't freeze or stutter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have only noticed this on my Windows machine, not any of my Macs. The windows machine has enough horsepower to use most of it's 2000w power supply, so I don't think it's a hardware issue. Using firefox engine &amp;amp; an adblocker fwiw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hell, I have to use my phone instead if I want to go to any of those pages nowadays. And even my phone now gets a random crash from chrome or the page itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder if it’s proof of work bullshit. For those to be effective, they have to slow down whatever machine is running in an LLM farm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That generally means they have to peg a desktop GPU for long enough to make a dent larger than LLM inference time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Browsing with a 2 core box is like using a musket to blow a hole in a wall that’s optimized for armor piercing rounds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this dumb? Of course. Your best recourse is probably to work around the anti-LLM blocks by having an agent read and summarize the page for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are there any decent cloud based web renderers yet? Something like vnc or rdp backed by a shared 4090 could solve the problem. For static content, it’d only have to run proof of work once, then serve the result from cache.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That makes no sense. You require PoW before providing the information, not when the page is already sent. For a large code repository like GitHub for LLM training, it's also trivial to just git fetch to scrape. The simpler explanation is that modern web devs are frequently incompetent and can't get static text to appear on an idle page without pegging cores, can't get subsecond server page generation for simple CRUD, etc. This was the trend before LLMs were ever a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've had something similar happen starting maybe a year ago, and varying in intensity from "no problem" up to "pegged CPU in the youtube tab and UI actions can lag up to several seconds". It doesn't affect video playback though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This behavior comes and goes over time, for example it's been fine for several weeks in a row now. I assume it's punishment for running an ad-blocker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's probably the special Google hardware obsoleting sauce called AV1. Without hardware acceleration your computer will struggle to decode their videos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This started happening on one of my older computers recently and I had to actually disable hardware acceleration to get the audio to stop being out of sync. The tradeoff for that has been noticeable frame dropping. I even added an extension to force h264 but there's no difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can play video no problem on other sites or in VLC. It's just YouTube and just on that PC...That PC can run Doom Eternal. Video content shouldn't be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given their actions the last two years or so unfortunately the default assumption is (reasonably) “probably something intentional to get people to stop doing something they don’t want, like using ad blockers.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very well could be. But with companies like Google I immediately start from a place of light-cynicism until I see evidence to the contrary at this point. I haven't given them the benefit of the doubt in probably a decade, and generally it's a fair way to go about things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I keep getting the video restarting after a few seconds randomly, very annoying even more so when it's the ad that restarts from the beginning, which almost seems intentional. Like a bug that nobody is in a hurry to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Intel Arc Celestial dGPU seems to be first casualty of Nvidia partnership while Intel Arc B770 is allegedly still alive&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we haven’t heard anything of substance regarding Intel’s high-end Arc Battlemage B770 desktop GPU for months now, the GPU is reportedly alive and coming this quarter. The information, which comes to us courtesy of Moore’s Law Is Dead, confirms a leak from back in May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MLID’s latest leak, which also reveals the Intel x Nvidia Hammer Lake and Titan Lake APUs, delivers some noteworthy specs updates for the Arc B770. Contrary to what the leaker posted in October 2024, the Intel Arc B770 now seems to be skipping PCIe 5.0 support. Moreover, the board is also alleged to have inconsistent performance with “frame pacing issues”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, while MLID still maintains that the Arc B770 will feature 32 Xe cores, a 256-bit wide bus, and is capable of reaching RTX 4070 level, the card will reportedly suffer from choppy performance and have a limited supply. What’s even sadder, however, is that Arc B770 could be the last Intel desktop GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Per MLID's sources, Intel has pulled the Celestial dGPU from its roadmap. This effectively points to the desktop Arc Celestial cards being canceled. If Intel does cancel Arc Celestial and, by extension, later GPU architectures like Arc Druid, it will effectively put an end to what can only be categorized as a shaky and often rudderless business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For what it’s worth, we do hope that Intel, somehow, keeps working on and releasing new desktop GPUs. Despite its issues, the Arc Battlemage B580 was a breath of fresh air when it launched into a crappy GPU market (Available on Amazon).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Court lets NSF keep swinging axe at $1B in research grants&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Judge rules there’s no quick fix for 1,700+ axed grants, leaving labs scrambling for cash while the lawsuit plays out&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A US court has cleared the way for the National Science Foundation to press ahead with the cancellation of more than 1,700 research grants worth upwards of $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ruling, handed down this week by Judge Jia Cobb of the DC District Court, rejects a request from researchers, universities and scientific societies to reinstate the cancelled grants while the case is heard. The plaintiffs had argued that NSF's mass terminations were arbitrary, unlawful and would do irreparable harm to the country's research ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NSF began hacking away at its portfolio after publishing a "Change in Priorities" statement in April. The new policy narrowed the scope of what counts as an acceptable "broader impact," warning that taxpayer-funded projects must not "preference some groups at the expense of others." In practice, that meant hundreds of grants tied to diversity, equity and inclusion programmes, or focused on boosting participation by underrepresented groups, suddenly found themselves on the chopping block.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between April and May, the agency fired off five waves of termination letters, citing boilerplate language that the projects "no longer effectuate program goals or agency priorities." Most awardees were given little explanation beyond that, despite their work having been peer-reviewed, approved and in many cases already underway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The legal challenge, filed in June by a coalition of educational and scientific organisations, argued that NSF's actions were arbitrary, violated grantees' due process rights, and contradicted the agency's statutory mission to broaden participation in STEM. The plaintiffs asked for a preliminary injunction that would have forced NSF to reinstate the money immediately while the case plays out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Judge Cobb said no. In her 38-page opinion, she ruled that the court lacks jurisdiction to order "retrospective relief", forcing NSF to pay out previously cancelled funds, saying those claims should be brought in the Court of Federal Claims, which handles lawsuits seeking money from the federal government. She also said that, while cancelled grants may cause serious disruption to labs, jobs and students, the plaintiffs hadn't met the high legal bar for proving "irreparable harm" needed to justify emergency relief.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In response, Democracy Forward, the coalition behind the legal challenge, said it was "deeply disappointed in the court's decision to allow the termination of grants to stand while we argue this case on the merits".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We are as united and committed as ever to ultimately winning this case and protecting these important NSF grants," it added. "The Trump-Vance administration acted unlawfully when it terminated these crucial grants. It attempted to usurp congressional authority by eliminating funding required by law. This case is not over and we are eager to defend the important role the NSF plays in the daily lives of Americans."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the decision doesn't kill the case entirely. Cobb allowed the plaintiffs' prospective claims to go forward, meaning NSF's new grantmaking policy itself can still be challenged, and future grant decisions could yet be scrutinised or overturned if the courts find the rules unlawful. But for now, the past terminations will remain in force.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scale of the purge is huge: according to data released by research lobby group COSSA, 1,752 grants worth around $1.4 billion have been terminated so far. The STEM Education Directorate was hit hardest, losing nearly half of its active grants and about two-thirds of its funding. Social, Behavioural and Economic Sciences also saw a significant share of its portfolio axed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;US science left out in the cold amid plans to retire Antarctic icebreaker&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Eggheads hold science fair on Capitol Hill to decry funding cuts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Japan builds near $700M fund to lure foreign academic talent&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;EU tells US scientists to dump Trump for a lab in Europe&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trump wants to fire quarter of NASA budget into black hole – and not in a good way&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fight over NSF's priorities has been raging for months. As The Register reported in May, the agency's budget proposals threaten cuts of up to 80 percent in some directorates, alongside the closure of 37 divisions and the firing of probationary staff. DEI programmes and other outreach initiatives have been singled out for removal as the foundation pivots toward what it calls "neutral" science funding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For researchers on the receiving end, the court's decision means the disruption will continue. Projects are being paused or shut down mid-stream, leaving graduate students with uncertain futures due to the loss of stipends provided by those grants. Some universities have said they'll try to backfill funding to keep work alive, but warn they can't cover everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, scientists are being offered something quite different. France's Aix-Marseille University has launched a Safe Place for Science programme, offering up to three years of funding and a "safe and stimulating environment" for American researchers seeking refuge from the disruption at home. ®&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;As Android developer verification gets ready to go, here's a new reason to be worried&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;24 hours ago&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Google is putting together its framework for Android developer verification, connecting dev names to even sideloaded apps.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Recent additions to the Android SDK offer a little insight into how the system may ultimately operate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One variable suggests that users may not be able to sideload even verified apps without an active network connection.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Android’s approach to software openness is changing in some fundamental ways right now, and the shift has not been happening without a fair amount of controversy. While Google has always let you install Android apps from outside its managed app ecosystem, sideloading their APK files, the company will now start mandating that developers register their identity, and block the installation of apps from unverified sources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For fans of open platforms, that’s resulted in some spicy takes (my own included), but in the weeks since the news first broke we’ve learned a little more about Google’s plans for implementing this program — and hearing about some critical workarounds, like maintaining the ability to sideload unverified apps over a connection to another device running ADB (the Android Debug Bridge).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we’re breathing a little easier now that we know about that option, there are still plenty of headaches that this move could cause, and today we’re thinking about one that’s been brought up by Android fans on Reddit like user WesternImpression394. There, they’ve spotted some of the groundwork Google’s been laying in the Android SDK (not the AOSP, as claimed in that thread) to support developer verification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the variables defined there is labeled in a way that immediately gets our attention: &lt;code&gt;DEVELOPER_VERIFICATION_FAILED_REASON_NETWORK_UNAVAILABLE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you stop and think about it for a moment, that makes all the sense in the world — Google isn’t just interested in attaching someone’s name to all those anonymous APKs floating around out there, but presumably doing so in a way that allows the company to take action based on the name, like blacklisting devs who spread malware. And indeed, there’s a similar &lt;code&gt;DEVELOPER_VERIFICATION_FAILED_REASON_DEVELOPER_BLOCKED&lt;/code&gt; variable. While it’s easy enough to verify something like a cryptographic signature locally, Android might want to prevent you from installing an app if it can’t get online and check if the name is on just such a no-no list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Admittedly, this probably won’t cause a problem for most users ever, and we are looking at some kind of extreme corner case situation where you’ve already downloaded an APK, but no longer have network connectivity, nor access to a device running ADB (or an app already installed to run ADB commands locally). There could even be a cached copy of the ban list that would let you install offline up to a point. That said, Android has literally billions of users, and even rare situations will probably happen for someone eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve still got a year to go before developer verification starts actually impacting any Android end-users, although devs will start signing up in the months to come. That leaves plenty of time for us to learn more about the all-too-important details behind how the system will ultimately work — and hopefully, plan ahead for how to work around it for users who genuinely need to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ordered a set of 10 Compute Blades in April 2023 (two years ago), and they just arrived a few weeks ago. In that time Raspberry Pi upgraded the CM4 to a CM5, so I ordered a set of 10 16GB CM5 Lite modules for my blade cluster. That should give me 160 GB of total RAM to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was the biggest Pi cluster I've built, and it set me back around $3,000, shipping included:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's another Pi-powered blade computer, the Xerxes Pi. It's smaller and cheaper, but it just wrapped up its own Kickstarter. Will it ship in less than two years? Who knows, but I'm a sucker for crowdfunded blade computers, so of course I backed it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But my main question, after sinking in a substantial amount of money: are Pi clusters even worth it anymore? I There's no way this cluster could beat the $8,000, 4-node Framework Desktop cluster in performance. But what about in price per gigaflop, or in efficiency or compute density?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's only one way to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Compute Blade Cluster Build&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I made a video going over everything in this blog post—and the entire cluster build (and rebuild, and rebuild again) process. You can watch it here, or on YouTube:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if you're on the blog, you're probably not the type to sit through a video anyway. So moving on...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Clustering means doing everything over n times&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the course of going from 'everything's in the box' to 'running AI and HPC benchmarks reliably', I rebuilt the cluster basically three times:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;First, my hodgepodge of random NVMe SSDs laying around the office was unreliable. Some drives wouldn't work with the Pi 5's PCIe bus, it seems, other ones were a little flaky (there's a reason these were spares sitting around the place, and not in use!)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;After replacing all the SSDs with Patriot P300s, they were more reliable, but the CM5s would throttle under load&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I put these CM heatsinks on without screwing them in... then realized they would pop off sometimes, so I took all the blades out again and screwed them into the CM5s/Blades so they were more secure for the long term.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Compute Blade Cluster HPL Top500 Test&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first benchmark I ran was my top500 High Performance Linpack cluster benchmark. This is my favorite cluster benchmark, because it's the traditional benchmark they'd run on massive supercomputers to get on the top500 supercomputer list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before I installed heatsinks, the cluster got 275 Gflops, which is an 8.5x speedup over a single 8 GB CM5. Not bad, but I noticed the cluster was only using 105 Watts of power during the run. Definitely more headroom available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After fixing the thermals, the cluster did not throttle, and used around 130W. At full power, I got 325 Gflops, which is a 10x performance improvement (for 10x 16GB CM5s) over a single 8 GB CM5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compared to the $8,000 Framework Cluster I benchmarked last month, this cluster is about 4 times faster:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the Pi cluster is slightly more energy efficient, on a Gflops/W basis:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what about price?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi is a little less cost-effective for HPC applications than a Framework Desktop running a AMD's fastest APU. So discounting the fact we're only talking CPUs, I don't think any hyperscalers are looking to swap out a few thousand AMD EPYC systems for 10,000+ Raspberry Pis :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what about AI use cases?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Compute Blade Cluster AI Test&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With 160 GB of total RAM, shared by the CPU and iGPU, this could be a small, efficient AI Cluster, right? Well, you'd think.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But no: currently llama.cpp can't speed up AI using Vulkan on the Pi 5 iGPU. That means we have 160 GB of RAM, but only CPU-powered inference. On pokey Arm Cortex A76 CPU cores with 10 GB/sec or so of memory bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A small model (Llama 3.2:3B), running on a single Pi, isn't horrible; you get about 6 tokens per second. But that is pretty weak compared to even an Intel N100 (much less a single Framework Desktop):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could have 10 nodes running 10 models, and that might be a very niche use case, but the real test would be running a larger AI model across all nodes. So I switched tracks to Llama 3.3:70B, which is a 40 GB model. It has to run across multiple Pis, since no single Pi has more than 16 GB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just as with the Framework cluster, llama.cpp RPC was very slow, since it splits up the model layers on all the cluster members, then goes round-robin style asking each node to perform its prompt processing, then token generation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi cluster couldn't even make it to token generation (tg) on my default settings, so I had to dial things back and only generate 16 tokens at a time to allow it to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And after all that? Only 0.28 tokens per second, which is 25x slower than the Framework Cluster, running the same model (except on AI Max iGPUs with Vulkan).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also tried Exo and distributed-llama. Exo was having trouble even running a small 3B model on even a 2 or 3 node Pi cluster configuration, so I stopped trying to get that working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Distributed llama worked, but only with up to 8 nodes for the 70B model. Doing that, I got a more useful 0.85 tokens/s, but that's still 5x slower than the Framework cluster (and it was a bit more fragile than llama.cpp RPC—the tokens were sometimes gibberish):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find all my AI cluster benchmarking results in the issue Test various AI clustering setups on 10 node Pi 5 cluster over on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Gatesworks and Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: this cluster's not a powerhouse. And dollar for dollar, if you're spending over $3k on a compute cluster, it's not the best value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is efficient, quiet, and compact. So if density is important, and if you need lots of small, physically separate nodes, this could actually make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like the only real world use case besides learning is for CI jobs or high security edge deployments, where you're not allowed to run multiple things on one server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's what Unredacted Labs is building Pi clusters for: they're building Tor exit relays on blades, after they found the Pi was the most efficient way to run massive amounts of nodes. If your goal is efficiency and node density, this does win, ever so slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for 99% of you reading this: this is not the cluster you're looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two years ago, when I originally ordered the Blades, Gateworks reached out. They were selling a souped up version of the Compute Blade, made to an industrial spec. The GBlade is around Pi 4 levels of performance, but with 10 gig networking, along with a 1 gig management interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But... it's discontinued. It doesn't look like any type of compute blade really lit the world on fire, and like the Blade movie series, the Compute Blade is more of a cult classic than a mainstream hit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a bad cluster. Except for maybe blade 9, which dies every time I run a benchmark. But I will keep it going, knowing it's definitely easier to maintain than the 1,050 node Pi cluster at UC Santa Barbera, which to my knowledge is still the world's largest!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before I go, I just wanted to give a special thanks to everyone who supports my on Patreon, GitHub, YouTube Memberships, and Floatplane. It really helps when I take on these months- (or years!) long projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Parts Used&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might not want to replicate my cluster setup — but I always get asked what parts I used (especially the slim Ethernet cables... everyone asks about those!), so here's the parts list:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US Securities and Exchange Comission (SEC) has dropped its fraud case against Nikola‘s founder and former CEO Trevor Milton, after Trump’s pardon six months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trevor Milton, who had been convicted of securities fraud, received a pardon from the US President Donald Trump in March, a month after the Phoenix-based electric and hydrogen truck maker Nikola filed for bankrupcy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The full and unconditional presidential pardon overturned a four-year prison sentence, imposed in December 2023, for deceiving investors about the company’s progress and products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an X post this Tuesday, the company’s founder said that “the SEC has dropped their case against me with prejudice.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“5 years of outright lies by the media, corrupt prosecutors, former Nikola executives and short sellers is finally over,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Milton added that he comes “out of this thankful to my God for one more day in this life and for such a wonderful family and wife who never backed down against the evil men behind this.” (Read the full statement below.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the company deals with the Chapter 11 plan in a Delaware bankrupcy court, Milton asked for a $69 million indemnification in legal fees against Nikola, which the company has pushed back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Nikola, Milton’s demand is invalid, as the ex-executive acted in a “grossly negligent, reckless” behaviour, engaging in “bad faith actions” during his time at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, last month, he argued that the bankrupcy plan does not fully reflect the presidential pardon he received.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I don’t know him, but I was… they say it was very unfair. And they say the thing that he did wrong was he was one of the first people that supported a gentleman named Donald Trump for president,” the President said then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The filing last month noted that “President Trump expressly decided here that Milton is factually innocent, the pardon did, contrary to the debtors’ assertions, wipe the slate clean.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In May, Nikola‘s creditors committee asked the bankrupcy court to investigate whether Milton was dissipating personal assets that should be used to satisfy his debt to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Milton stepped down from CEO in 2020, after allegations from Hindenburg Research that accused him of repeatedly misrepresenting Nikola‘s technological capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read Trevor Milton’s X statement below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The SEC has dropped their case against me with prejudice. 5 years of outright lies by the media, corrupt prosecutors, former Nikola executives and short sellers is finally over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They falsely indicted me, silenced me, deleted my followers including here on X, stole my company, bankrupted my company, debanked me, targeted my friends and family, stole most my wealth and tried to put me in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it’s over now and eventually our creator will make it right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I come out of this thankful to my God for one more day in this life and for such a wonderful family and wife who never backed down against the evil men behind this.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Slow liquid&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;After updating to iOS 26, I will add my voice to the chorus of dismay: this thing makes my phone run like shit! I recognize that mine isnât the latest and greatest, but itâs only four years old — &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope Apple can (literally) smooth things out. I realize thereâs always an undercurrent to these releases of âmaybe you should get a new phone … â but in this case the performance hit feels either (1) shockingly delinquent, or (2) hilariously malevolent, true planned obsolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I havenât updated my laptop to macOS 26; on the desktop I have, for a few years, been committed to a strategy of âdonât update until you absolutely mustâ.)&lt;/p&gt;To the blog home page&lt;/main&gt;
