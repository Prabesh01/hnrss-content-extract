    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Waymo World Model: A New Frontier For Autonomous Driving Simulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Waymo Driver has traveled nearly 200 million fully autonomous miles, becoming a vital part of the urban fabric in major U.S. cities and improving road safety. What riders and local communities don’t see is our Driver navigating billions of miles in virtual worlds, mastering complex scenarios long before it encounters them on public roads. Today, we are excited to introduce the Waymo World Model, a frontier generative model that sets a new bar for large-scale, hyper-realistic autonomous driving simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simulation is a critical component of Waymo’s AI ecosystem and one of the three key pillars of our approach to demonstrably safe AI. The Waymo World Model, which we detail below, is the component that is responsible for generating hyper-realistic simulated environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Waymo World Model is built upon Genie 3—Google DeepMind's most advanced general-purpose world model that generates photorealistic and interactive 3D environments—and is adapted for the rigors of the driving domain. By leveraging Genie’s immense world knowledge, it can simulate exceedingly rare events—from a tornado to a casual encounter with an elephant—that are almost impossible to capture at scale in reality. The model’s architecture offers high controllability, allowing our engineers to modify simulations with simple language prompts, driving inputs, and scene layouts. Notably, the Waymo World Model generates high-fidelity, multi-sensor outputs that include both camera and lidar data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This combination of broad world knowledge, fine-grained controllability, and multi-modal realism enhances Waymo’s ability to safely scale our service across more places and new driving environments. In the following sections we showcase the Waymo World Model in action, featuring simulations of the Waymo Driver navigating diverse rare edge-case scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🌎 Emergent Multimodal World Knowledge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most simulation models in the autonomous driving industry are trained from scratch based on only the on-road data they collect. That approach means the system only learns from limited experience. Genie 3’s strong world knowledge, gained from its pre-training on an extremely large and diverse set of videos, allows us to explore situations that were never directly observed by our fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through our specialized post-training, we are transferring that vast world knowledge from 2D video into 3D lidar outputs unique to Waymo’s hardware suite. While cameras excel at depicting visual details, lidar sensors provide valuable complementary signals like precise depth. The Waymo World Model can generate virtually any scene—from regular, day-to-day driving to rare, long-tail scenarios—across multiple sensor modalities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;🌪️ Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;💥 Rare and safety-critical events&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;🐘 Long-tail (pun intended!) objects and more&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the interactive viewers below, you can immersively view the realistic 4D point clouds generated by the Waymo World Model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🕹️ Strong Simulation Controllability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Waymo World Model offers strong simulation controllability through three main mechanisms: driving action control, scene layout control, and language control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Driving action control allows us to have a responsive simulator that adheres to specific driving inputs. This enables us to simulate “what if” counterfactual events such as whether the Waymo Driver could have safely driven more confidently instead of yielding in a particular situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Counterfactual driving. We demonstrate simulations both under the original route in a past recorded drive, or a completely new route. While purely reconstructive simulation methods (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splats, or 3DGS) suffer from visual breakdowns due to missing observations when the simulated route is too different from the original driving, the fully learned Waymo World Model maintains good realism and consistency thanks to its strong generative capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scene layout control allows for customization of the road layouts, traffic signal states, and the behavior of other road users. This way, we can create custom scenarios via selective placement of other road users, or applying custom mutations to road layouts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scene layout conditioning following&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Language control is our most flexible tool that allows us to adjust time-of-day, weather conditions, or even generate an entirely synthetic scene (such as the long-tail scenarios shown previously).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;World Mutation - Time of Day&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;World Mutation - Weather&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🎞️ Converting Dashcam Videos&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During a scenic drive, it is common to record videos of the journey on mobile devices or dashcams, perhaps capturing piled up snow banks or a highway at sunset. The Waymo World Model can convert those kinds of videos, or any taken with a regular camera, into a multimodal simulation—showing how the Waymo Driver would see that exact scene. This process enables the highest degree of realism and factuality, since simulations are derived from actual footage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;⚙️ Scalable Inference&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some scenes we want to simulate may take longer to play out, for example, negotiating passage in a narrow lane. That’s harder to do because the longer the simulation, the tougher it is to compute and maintain stable quality. However, through a more efficient variant of the Waymo World Model, we can simulate longer scenes with dramatic reduction in compute while maintaining high realism and fidelity to enable large-scale simulations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;🚀 Long rollout (4x speed playback) on an efficient variant of the Waymo World Model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By simulating the “impossible”, we proactively prepare the Waymo Driver for some of the most rare and complex scenarios. This creates a more rigorous safety benchmark, ensuring the Waymo Driver can navigate long-tail challenges long before it encounters them in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a demo for how you can turn an ESP32-S3 microcontroller into a tiny instant-on PC with its own shell, editor, compiler, and online apps installer. Something like Raspberry Pi, minus the overhead of a full server/desktop grade OS. I think ESP32 is underrated in hobby maker community for this PC-like use case. This demo uses BreezyBox, my mini-shell ESP-IDF component.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First of all, seeing is believing (click to watch the video):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It started as a "cyberdeck" style crafting project. Then I got carried away with the software part. I chose ESP32-S3 for the base platform. It has the nostalgic appeal of the DOS era PCs, with similar resources, and elbow-deep-in-bytes coding experience, plus modern wireless comms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ESP32-S3 can do everything those PCs did and more, but that is inconvenient out of the box, because that is not the commercial use case it is positioned for. It also forces away the code bloat. If you are like me, and love small elegant things, and technology that punches way above its weight, you ought to try it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So anyway, I decided to try and package some key missing parts: a basic vterm, the current working directory (CWD) tracking, a few familiar UNIX-like commands, and an app installer. Believe it or not, the rest is already there in ESP-IDF components, including the elf_loader with dynamic linking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is called "BreezyBox", by analogy with the BusyBox commands suite. The name is just a light joke, it is not meant to be a full clone. You can import it with one command in your ESP-IDF project, and if you have some stdio going, even at "Hello World" level, it should mostly just work. I call it a "mini shell", a naïve user might call it an OS (it is not, it runs on FreeRTOS), and you can also call it the userland layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The BreezyBox component leaves the display and other board configuration details to the user's firmware project, providing mainly the vterm/vfs features, and some shell commands. This particular example/demo project supports only one specific dev board: Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7B (no affiliation). But you can see how all the parts connect, and adapt it to your display/board, or just copy some code snippets from here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suggest just fork it, clone it, and try to make it work on your board. Mine was about 40€; you can start with some random $10 two inch LCD S3 dev board if you like. Hint: LVGL text label control is the easiest path to stdout on LCD that works almost everywhere. You can also start with a headless board over USB console, that takes zero code, and gives you free ANSI codes in standard IDF Monitor in VSCode (or in Tabby).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You do not have to write your own font renderer like I did here; that was just to push past 30 FPS on a display slightly too large for this chip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is free software under MIT License.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best help is currently more testing beyond "works on my computer", more shared examples and fun use cases:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;More ELF apps – see the examples at my breezyapps repo, they are super easy to follow. Even a carefully written stdlib C program with no platform-specific bits may work sometimes, also with some ANSI codes. But be sure to verify on the actual ESP32-S3: the memory is tight, the larger PSRAM requires alignment, and there are other limits and quirks. You can publish and install the apps using your own repo.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;More full example firmware repositories: for different boards, with different styles. Maybe you provide the basic LVGL text label example on some popular board. Maybe you prefer C++ to plain C. Maybe you embrace the GUI. Maybe you port some retro games. Maybe you even make it work on P4, or C6 (RISC-V, a completely different CPU). Maybe you attach some cool gadgets to it. Maybe you build an extra cool cyberdeck case. Or maybe you reproduce the exact same thing, and just share your setup experience and hands-on impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be so cool to see more people using BreezyBox, and to have more ready-to-clone examples for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenCiv3 (formerly known by the codename “C7”) is an open-source, cross-platform, mod-oriented, modernized reimagining of Civilization III by the fan community built with the Godot Engine and C#, with capabilities inspired by the best of the 4X genre and lessons learned from modding Civ3. Our vision is to make Civ3 as it could have been, rebuilt for today’s modders and players: removing arbitary limits, fixing broken features, expanding mod capabilities, and supporting modern graphics and platforms. A game that can go beyond C3C but retain all of its gameplay and content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenCiv3 is under active development and currently in an early pre-alpha state. It is a rudimentary playable game but lacking many mechanics and late-game content, and errors are likely. Keep up with our development for the latest updates and opportunities to contribute!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE: OpenCiv3 is not affiliated with civfanatics.com, Firaxis Games, BreakAway Games, Hasbro Interactive, Infogrames Interactive, Atari Interactive, or Take-Two Interactive Software. All trademarks are property of their respective owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OpenCiv3 team is pleased to announce the first preview release of the v0.3 “Dutch” milestone. This is a major enhancement over the “Carthage” release, and our debut with standalone mode featuring placeholder graphics without the need for Civ3 media files. A local installation of Civ3 is still recommended for a more polished experience. See the release notes for a full list of new features in each version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenCiv3 Dutch Preview 1 with the same game in Standalone mode (top) and with imported Civ3 graphics (bottom)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download the appropriate zip file for your OS from the Dutch Preview 1 release&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All official releases of OpenCiv3 along with more detailed release notes can be found on the GitHub releases page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a Windows 64-bit executable. OpenCiv3 will look for a local installation of Civilization III in the Windows registry automatically, or you may use an environment variable to point to the files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;OpenCiv3.exe&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;CIV3_HOME&lt;/code&gt; pointing to it and restart OpenCiv3&lt;p&gt;This is an x86-64 Linux executable. You may use an environment variable to point to the files from a Civilization III installation. You can just copy or mount the top-level “Sid Meier’s Civilization III Complete” (Sans “Complete” if your install was from pre-Complete CDs) folder and its contents to your Linux system, or install the game via Steam or GOG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CIV3_HOME&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to point to the Civ3 files, e.g. &lt;code&gt;export CIV3_HOME="/path/to/civ3"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;CIV3_HOME&lt;/code&gt;, run &lt;code&gt;OpenCiv3.x86_64&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;.profile&lt;/code&gt; or equivalent.&lt;p&gt;This is a universal 64-bit executable, so it should run on both Intel and M1 Macs. You may use an environment variable to point to the files from a Civilization III installation. You can just copy or mount the top-level “Sid Meier’s Civilization III Complete” (Sans “Complete” if your install was from pre-Complete CDs) folder and its contents to your Mac system, or install the game via Steam or GOG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;OpenCiv3.app&lt;/code&gt; and a json file will appear&lt;code&gt;OpenCiv3.app&lt;/code&gt; it will tell you it’s damaged and try to trash it; it is not damaged&lt;code&gt;xattr -cr /path/to/OpenCiv3.app&lt;/code&gt;; you can avoid typing the path out by typing &lt;code&gt;xattr -cr &lt;/code&gt; and then dragging the &lt;code&gt;OpenCiv3.app&lt;/code&gt; icon onto the terminal window&lt;code&gt;CIV3_HOME&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to point to the Civ3 files, e.g. &lt;code&gt;export CIV3_HOME="/path/to/civ3"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;CIV3_HOME&lt;/code&gt;, run &lt;code&gt;OpenCiv3.app&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;open /path/to/OpenCiv3.app&lt;/code&gt;, or again just type &lt;code&gt;open &lt;/code&gt; and drag the OpenCiv3 icon onto the terminal window and press enter&lt;code&gt;xattr -cr /path/to/OpenCiv3.app&lt;/code&gt; to enable running it.&lt;code&gt;c7-static-map-save.json&lt;/code&gt; or open a Civ3 SAV file to open that map&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;© OpenCiv3 contributors.

All vowels are available. See full mapping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I CVT svarer dette til Neutral-mode i fuld densitet — fuld foldlukning med en lettere, ikke-metallisk kvalitet.

        &lt;cell&gt; The bridge between chest and head — neither cracks nor flips. Start with bratty "Nay" on scales to force cord closure while ascending.

The seamless transition between registers is achieved by switching between modes — typically Curbing (restrained, held back) or Edge (sharp, twangy) through the passaggio. See full mapping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVT bruger ikke begrebet "mixstemme." Den sømløse overgang mellem registre opnås ved at skifte mellem modes — typisk Curbing (tilbageholdt) eller Edge (skarp, twanget) gennem passaggioen. Se fuld kortlægning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

Overdrive: EH, OH only. Edge: I, EH, A, OE only. Curbing: UH, O, OO only. Neutral: all vowels. Instead of gradually shading vowels, CVT singers choose the right mode for the vowel and pitch. See full mapping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVT håndterer dette anderledes: hver mode har strenge vokalregler. Overdrive: kun EH, OH. Edge: kun I, EH, A, OE. Curbing: kun UH, O, OO. Neutral: alle vokaler. I stedet for gradvist at ændre vokaler vælger CVT-sangere den rette mode til vokal og tonehøjde. Se fuld kortlægning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt; Natural vibrato comes from relaxation, not forcing. Proper breath support + released tension = vibrato appears on its own. Relax jaw, tongue, throat while maintaining diaphragm support.&lt;p&gt;Exercise: Sustain "Ah" — pulsate diaphragm gently&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise: Alternate two neighboring notes fast → slow until it blends Naturlig vibrato kommer af afslapning, ikke tvang. Korrekt åndedrætssstøtte + frigivet spænding = vibrato opstår af sig selv. Afslap kæbe, tunge, hals mens du opretholder mellemgulvsstøtte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Hold "Ah" — pulsér mellemgulvet blidt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Skift mellem to nabotoner hurtigt → langsomt til det smelter sammen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, Christina Aguilera, Stevie Wonder&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt; Start SLOW. Learn the exact notes before speeding up. Use a piano to identify each pitch. Practice at half speed, then 75%, then full. Runs are muscle memory.&lt;p&gt;Exercise: Slow 5-note scale runs → gradually speed up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise: Pick a famous run, learn each note individually Start LANGSOMT. Lær de præcise toner før du øger tempo. Brug et klaver til at identificere hver tone. Øv i halvt tempo, så 75%, så fuldt. Runs er muskelhukommelse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Langsomme 5-tone skala-runs → øg gradvist tempo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Vælg et berømt run, lær hver tone individuelt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

Glid ind i den i stedet for at lande rent. Kan også bøje mellem to toner uden trin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Syng en tone, tilnærm derefter fra en halvtone under&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Portamento-glid mellem intervaller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Punchy, percussive note beginnings. Adds emphasis. Like a tiny "click" before tone. Punchy, perkussive tonestartar. Tilføjer betoning. Som et lille "klik" før tonen.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Adele (signatur), de fleste popsangere bruger det selektivt&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt; Say "uh-oh" — that little stop is a glottal stop. Use sparingly on emotionally important words. Overuse creates tension. Default should be simultaneous onset.&lt;p&gt;Exercise: "Uh-oh" — isolate the stop feeling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise: Apply to first word of a phrase only Sig "uh-oh" — det lille stop er et glottalt stop. Brug sparsomt på emotionelt vigtige ord. Overbrug skaber spænding. Standard bør være samtidig ansats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: "Uh-oh" — isolér stop-følelsen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Anvend kun på første ord i en frase&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A short introduction to RLHF and post-training focused on language models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become an important technical and storytelling tool to deploy the latest machine learning systems. In this book, we hope to give a gentle introduction to the core methods for people with some level of quantitative background. The book starts with the origins of RLHF – both in recent literature and in a convergence of disparate fields of science in economics, philosophy, and optimal control. We then set the stage with definitions, problem formulation, data collection, and other common math used in the literature. The core of the book details every optimization stage in using RLHF, from starting with instruction tuning to training a reward model and finally all of rejection sampling, reinforcement learning, and direct alignment algorithms. The book concludes with advanced topics – understudied research questions in synthetic data and evaluation – and open questions for the field.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Software Engineering is back&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Coding agents have replaced every framework I used&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t post a lot. But when I do, it’s because I think few people are saying out loud what I’m noticing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been building a product from the ground up. Not the “I spun up a Next.js template” kind of ground up. I mean from network configuration to product design to pricing decisions. Truly end to end. And I’ve been doing it using frontier models and coding agents for hours and hours every single day, both on this project and in my full time work. I’ve been trying to stay away from the chaos and the hype, filtering hard for what is actually valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since December 2025, things have dramatically changed for the better. Many have noticed. Few are drawing the right conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Automated Programming&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Antirez likes to call it “automated programming”, and I really like that framing. It captures the essence far better than the shallow, almost dismissive label of “vibe coding”. Automation was at the core of most of the work and cultural revolutions of human history. The printing press, the loom, the assembly line. This one doesn’t differ much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of my work is still there. I still have to deeply think about every important aspect of what I want to build. The architecture, the trade offs, the product decisions, the edge cases that will bite you at 3am. What’s gone is the tearing, exhausting manual labour of typing every single line of code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point in time, models and tools, when put in a clean and maniacally well set up environment, can truly make the difference. I can be the architect without the wearing act of laying every single brick and spreading the mortar. I can design the dress without the act of cutting and sewing each individual piece of fabric. But I can do all of this with the experience on my back of having laid the bricks, spread the mortar, cut and sewn for twenty years. If I don’t like something, I can go in, understand it and fix it as I please, instructing once and for all my setup to do what I want next time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automated programming especially allows me to quickly build the tools I need so fast that every blacksmith that ever existed on this earth would envy me deeply. Finally able to really focus on the things they have in mind. Finally dedicating more time of their craft to the art they conceive, not the sweat of the forge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Epiphany&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s been months now that I have this thought crystallized in my mind. It is so clear to me that I genuinely don’t understand why everyone is not screaming it to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can finally get rid of all that middle work. That adapting layer of garbage we blindly accepted during these years. A huge amount of frameworks and libraries and tooling that has completely polluted software engineering, especially in web, mobile and desktop development. Layers upon layers of abstractions that abstract nothing meaningful, that solve problems we shouldn’t have had in the first place, that create ten new problems for every one they claim to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think about what happened. We, as an industry, looked at the genuine complexity of building software and instead of sharpening our thinking, we bought someone else’s thinking off the shelf. We wrapped everything in frameworks like wrapping a broken leg in silk. It looks nice. The leg is still broken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The three problems frameworks solve (or claim to)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my mind, besides the self declared objectives, frameworks solve three problems. Two explicit and one obvious but never declared.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Simplification”. Software engineers are scared of designing things themselves. They would rather accept someone else’s structure, despite having to force fit it into their product, rather than taking the time to start from the goal and work backwards to create the perfect suit for their idea. Like an architect blindly accepting another architect’s blueprints and applying them regardless of the context, the needs, the terrain, the new technological possibilities. We decided to remove complexity not by sharpening our mental models around the products we build, but by buying a one size fits all design and applying it everywhere. That is not simplification. That is intellectual surrender.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automation. This is the only point I can actually, more or less, understand and buy. Boilerplate is boring work. I hate it. And I especially hate using libraries that I then need to study, keep updated, be aware of vulnerabilities for, just for the purpose of removing the creation of duplicated but necessary code. Think about ORMs, CRUD management, code generation, API documentation and so on. The grunt work that nobody wants to do but everybody needs done. Fair enough. But hold that thought, because this is exactly the point where everything changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Labour cost. This is the quiet one. The one nobody puts on the conference slide. For companies, it is much better having Google, Meta, Vercel deciding for you how you build product and ship code. Adopt their framework. Pay the cost of lock in. Be enchanted by their cloud managed solution to host, deploy, store your stuff. And you unlock a feature that has nothing to do with engineering: you no longer need to hire a software engineer. You hire a React Developer. No need to train. Plug and play. Easy to replace. A cog in a machine designed by someone else, maintaining a system architected by someone else, solving problems defined by someone else. This is not engineering. This is operating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Software Engineering Is Back&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my opinion Software engineering, the true one, is back again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not speaking out of my lungs only. I’ve been developing this way almost flawlessly for over two years at this point. But the true revolution happened clearly last year, and since December 2025 this is obvious to anyone paying attention. From now on it will be even more so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have the chance again to get rid of useless complexity and keep working on the true and welcome complexity of our ideas, our features, our products. The complexity that matters. The complexity that is actually yours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automation and boilerplating have never been so cheap to overcome. I’ve been basically never writing twice the same line of code. I’m instantly building small tools I need, purpose built, exactly shaped around the problem at hand. I don’t need any fancy monorepo manager. A simple Makefile covers 100% of my needs for 99% of my use cases. When things will get very complicated, and if they get very complicated, I’ll think about it. But only then. Not a second before. This is engineering. You solve the problem you have, not the problem someone on a conference stage told you that you’ll eventually have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents are really well prepared when it comes to basic tools. Tools that have been around not for months, but literally for decades. Bash was born in 1989, just preceding me by two months. The most mediocre model running at this time knows bash better than any person in the world. Bash is the universal adapter. It is not a coincidence that coding agents are shifting from complex and expensive MCP configurations to a simple agent loop with bash as a way to interact, literally, with the world. The oldest tool turned out to be the most future proof. There’s a lesson in there if you care to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Think about it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why do you ever need, for most of the use cases you can think of, a useless, expensive, flawed, often vulnerable framework, and the parade of libraries that comes with it, that you probably use for only 10% of its capabilities? With all the costs associated with it. From the “least” expensive: operational costs like keeping everything updated because they once again found a critical vulnerability in your Next.js version. To the most expensive one: the cost to your Design Choices. The invisible cost. The one you pay every day without even realizing it, because you’ve been paying it so long you forgot what freedom felt like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you keep accepting this trade off, you are not only losing the biggest opportunity we’ve seen in software engineering in decades. You are probably not recognizing your own laziness in once again buying whatever the hyperscalers have decided for you. You’re letting Google and Meta and Vercel be your architect, your designer, your thinker. And in exchange, you get to be their operator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tools are here. The models are here. The revolution already happened and most people are still decorating the old house.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stop wrapping broken legs in silk. Start building things that are yours.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Stories From 25 Years of Software Development&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year, I completed 20 years in professional software development. I wanted to write a post to mark the occasion back then, but couldn't find the time. This post is my attempt to make up for that omission. In fact, I have been involved in software development for a little longer than 20 years. Although I had my first taste of computer programming as a child, it was only when I entered university about 25 years ago that I seriously got into software development. So I'll start my stories from there. These stories are less about software and more about people. Unlike many posts of this kind, this one offers no wisdom or lessons. It only offers a collection of stories. I hope you'll like at least a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Good Blessings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The CTF Scoreboard&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Viewing the Source&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The first story takes place in 2001, shortly after I joined university. One evening, I went to the university computer laboratory to browse the Web. Out of curiosity, I typed &lt;code&gt;susam.com&lt;/code&gt; into the address bar and landed on
  its
  home page.  I remember the text and banner looking much larger
  back then.  Display resolutions were lower, so they covered almost
  half the screen.  I knew very little about the Internet then and I
  was just trying to make sense of it.  I remember wondering what it
  would take to create my own website, perhaps at
  &lt;code&gt;susam.com&lt;/code&gt;.  That's when an older student who had been
  watching me browse over my shoulder approached and asked if I had
  created the website.  I told him I hadn't and that I had no idea how
  websites were made.  He asked me to move aside, took my seat and
  clicked View &amp;gt; Source in Internet Explorer.  He then explained
  how websites are made of HTML pages and how those pages are simply
  text instructions.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, he opened Notepad and wrote a simple HTML page that looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;BODY&amp;gt;&amp;lt;FONT COLOR="RED"&amp;gt;HELLO&amp;lt;/FONT&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/BODY&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Yes, we had a &lt;code&gt;FONT&lt;/code&gt; tag back then and it was common
  practice to write HTML tags in uppercase.  He then opened the page
  in a web browser and showed how it rendered.  After that, he
  demonstrated a few more features such as changing the font face and
  size, centring the text and altering the page's background colour.
  Although the tutorial lasted only about ten minutes, it made the
  World Wide Web feel far less mysterious and much more fascinating.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; That person had an ulterior motive though. After the tutorial, he never returned the seat to me. He just continued browsing the Web and waited for me to leave. I was too timid to ask for my seat back. Seats were limited, so I returned to my dorm room both disappointed that I couldn't continue browsing that day and excited about all the websites I might create with this newfound knowledge. I could never register &lt;code&gt;susam.com&lt;/code&gt; for myself though.
  That domain was always used by some business selling Turkish
  cuisines.  Eventually, I managed to get the next best thing:
  a &lt;code&gt;.net&lt;/code&gt; domain of my own.  That brief encounter in the
  university laboratory set me on a lifelong path of creating and
  maintaining personal websites.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Reset Vector&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The second story also comes from my university days. One afternoon, I was hanging out with my mates in the computer laboratory. In front of me was an MS-DOS machine powered by an Intel 8086 microprocessor, on which I was writing a lift control program in assembly. In those days, it was considered important to deliberately practise solving made-up problems as a way of honing our programming skills. As I worked on my program, my mind drifted to a small detail about the 8086 microprocessor that we had recently learnt in a lecture. Our professor had explained that, when the 8086 microprocessor is reset, execution begins with CS:IP set to FFFF:0000. So I murmured to anyone who cared to listen, 'I wonder if the system will reboot if I jump to FFFF:0000.' I then opened &lt;code&gt;DEBUG.EXE&lt;/code&gt; and jumped to that address.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;C:\&amp;gt;DEBUG -G =FFFF:0000&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The machine rebooted instantly. One of my friends, who topped the class every semester, had been watching over my shoulder. As soon as the machine restarted, he exclaimed, 'How did you do that?' I explained that the reset vector is located at physical address FFFF0 and that the CS:IP value FFFF:0000 maps to that address in real mode. After that, I went back to working on my lift control program and didn't think much more about the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About a week later, the same friend came to my dorm room. He sat down with a grave look on his face and asked, 'How did you know to do that? How did it occur to you to jump to the reset vector?' I must have said something like, 'It just occurred to me. I remembered that detail from the lecture and wanted to try it out.' He then said, 'I want to be able to think like that. I come top of the class every semester, but I don't think the way you do. I would never have thought of taking a small detail like that and testing it myself.' I replied that I was just curious to see whether what we had learnt actually worked in practice. He responded, 'And that's exactly it. It would never occur to me to try something like that. I feel disappointed that I keep coming top of the class, yet I am not curious in the same way you are. I've decided I don't want to top the class anymore. I just want to explore and experiment with what we learn, the way you do.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was all he said before getting up and heading back to his dorm room. I didn't take it very seriously at the time. I couldn't imagine why someone would willingly give up the accomplishment of coming first every year. But he kept his word. He never topped the class again. He still ranked highly, often within the top ten, but he kept his promise of never finishing first again. To this day, I feel a mix of embarrassment and pride whenever I recall that incident. With a single jump to the processor's reset entry point, I had somehow inspired someone to step back from academic competition in order to have more fun with learning. Of course, there is no reason one cannot do both. But in the end, that was his decision, not mine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Man in the Middle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my first job after university, I was assigned to a technical support team where part of my work involved running an installer to deploy a specific component of an e-banking product for customers, usually large banks. As I learnt to use the installer, I realised how fragile it was. The installer, written in Python, often failed because of incorrect assumptions about the target environment and almost always required some manual intervention to complete successfully. During my first week on the project, I spent much of my time stabilising the installer and writing a step-by-step user guide explaining how to use it. The result was well received by both my seniors and management. To my surprise, the user guide received more praise than the improvements I made to the installer itself. While the first few weeks were productive, I soon realised I would not find the work fulfilling for long. I wrote to management a few times to ask whether I could transfer to a team where I could work on something more substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My emails were initially met with resistance. After several rounds of discussion, however, someone who had heard about my situation reached out and suggested a team whose manager might be interested in interviewing me. The team was based in a different city. I was young and willing to relocate wherever I could find good work, so I immediately agreed to the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was in 2006, when video conferencing was not yet common. On the day of the interview, the hiring manager called me on my office desk phone. He began by introducing the team, which was called Archie, short for architecture. The team developed and maintained the web framework and core architectural components on which the entire e-banking product was built. The product had existed long before open source frameworks such as Spring or Django came into existence, so features such as API routing, authentication and authorisation layers, cookie management, etc. were all implemented in-house as Java Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP). Since the software was used in banking environments, it also had to pass strict security testing and regular audits to minimise the risk of serious flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The interview began well. He asked several questions related to software security, such as what SQL injection is and how it can be prevented or how one might design a web framework that mitigates cross-site scripting attacks. He also asked programming questions, most of which I answered pretty well. Towards the end, however, he asked how we could prevent MITM attacks. I had never heard the term, so I admitted that I did not know what MITM meant. He then asked, 'Man in the middle?' but I still had no idea what that meant or whether it was even a software engineering concept. He replied, 'Learn everything you can about PKI and MITM. We need to build a digital signatures feature for one of our corporate banking products. That's the first thing we'll work on.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks, I studied RFCs and documentation related to public key infrastructure, public key cryptography standards and related topics. At first, the material felt intimidating, but after spending time each evening reading whatever relevant literature I could find, things gradually began to make sense. Concepts that initially seemed complex and overwhelming eventually felt intuitive and elegant. I relocated to the new city a few weeks later and delivered the digital signatures feature about a month after joining the team. We used the open source Bouncy Castle library to implement the feature. After that project, I worked on other parts of the product too. The most rewarding part was knowing that the code I was writing became part of a mature product used by hundreds of banks and millions of users. It was especially satisfying to see the work pass security testing and audits and be considered ready for release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was my first real engineering job. My manager also turned out to be an excellent mentor. Working with him helped me develop new skills and his encouragement gave me confidence that stayed with me for years. Nearly two decades have passed since then, yet the product is still in service and continues to be actively developed. In fact, in my current phase of life I sometimes encounter it as a customer. Occasionally, I open the browser's developer tools to view the page source where I can still see traces of the HTML generated by code I wrote almost twenty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sphagetti Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around 2007 or 2008, I began working on a proof of concept for developing widgets for an OpenTV set-top box. The work involved writing code in a heavily trimmed-down version of C. One afternoon, while making good progress on a few widgets, I noticed that they would occasionally crash at random. I tried tracking down the bugs, but I was finding it surprisingly difficult to understand my own code. I had managed to produce some truly spaghetti code full of dubious pointer operations that were almost certainly responsible for the crashes, yet I could not pinpoint where exactly things were going wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ours was a small team of four people, each working on an independent proof of concept. The most senior person on the team acted as our lead and architect. Later that afternoon, I showed him my progress and explained that I was still trying to hunt down the bugs causing the widgets to crash. He asked whether he could look at the code. After going through it briefly and probably realising that it was a bit of a mess, he asked me to send him the code as a tarball, which I promptly did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He then went back to his desk to study the code. I remember thinking that there was no way he was going to find the problem anytime soon. I had been debugging it for hours and barely understood what I had written myself; it was the worst spaghetti code I had ever produced. With little hope of a quick solution, I went back to debugging on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barely five minutes later, he came back to my desk and asked me to open a specific file. He then showed me exactly where the pointer bug was. It had taken him only a few minutes not only to read my tangled code but also to understand it well enough to identify the fault and point it out. As soon as I fixed that line, the crashes disappeared. I was genuinely in awe of his skill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have always loved computing and programming, so I had assumed I was already fairly good at it. That incident, however, made me realise how much further I still had to go before I could consider myself a good software developer. I did improve significantly in the years that followed and today I am far better at managing software complexity than I was back then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Animated Television Widgets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In another project from that period, we worked on another set-top box platform that supported Java Micro Edition (Java ME) for widget development. One day, the same architect from the previous story asked whether I could add animations to the widgets. I told him that I believed it should be possible, though I'd need to test it to be sure. Before continuing with the story, I need to explain how the different stakeholders in the project were organised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our small team effectively played the role of the software vendor. The final product going to market would carry the brand of a major telecom carrier, offering direct-to-home (DTH) television services, with the set-top box being one of the products sold to customers. The set-top box was manufactured by another company. So the project was a partnership between three parties: our company as the software vendor, the telecom carrier and the set-top box manufacturer. The telecom carrier wanted to know whether widgets could be animated on screen with smooth slide-in and slide-out effects. That was why the architect approached me to ask whether it could be done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I began working on animating the widgets. Meanwhile, the architect and a few senior colleagues attended a business meeting with all the partners present. During the meeting, he explained that we were evaluating whether widget animations could be supported. The set-top box manufacturer immediately dismissed the idea, saying, 'That's impossible. Our set-top box does not support animation.' When the architect returned and shared this with us, I replied, 'I do not understand. If I can draw a widget, I can animate it too. All it takes is clearing the widget and redrawing it at slightly different positions repeatedly. In fact, I already have a working version.' I then showed a demo of the animated widgets running on the emulator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following week, the architect attended another partners' meeting where he shared updates about our animated widgets. I was not personally present, so what follows is second-hand information passed on by those who were there. I learnt that the set-top box company reacted angrily. For some reason, they were unhappy that we had managed to achieve results using their set-top box and APIs that they had officially described as impossible. They demanded that we stop work on animation immediately, arguing that our work could not be allowed to contradict their official position. At that point, the telecom carrier's representative intervened and bluntly told the set-top box representative to just shut up. If the set-top box guy was furious, the telecom guy was even more so, 'You guys told us animation was not possible and these people are showing that it is! You manufacture the set-top box. How can you not know what it is capable of?'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I continued working on the proof of concept. It worked very well in the emulator, but I did not yet have access to the actual hardware. The device was still in the process of being shipped to us, so all my early proof-of-concepts ran on the emulator. The following week, the architect planned to travel to the set-top box company's office to test my widgets on the real hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time, I was quite proud of demonstrating results that even the hardware maker believed were impossible. When the architect eventually travelled to test the widgets on the actual device, a problem emerged. What looked like buttery smooth animation on the emulator appeared noticeably choppy on a real television. Over the next few weeks, I experimented with frame rates, buffering strategies and optimising the computation done in the the rendering loop. Each week, the architect travelled for testing and returned with the same report: the animation had improved somewhat, but it still remained choppy. The modest embedded hardware simply could not keep up with the required computation and rendering. In the end, the telecom carrier decided that no animation was better than poor animation and dropped the idea altogether. So in the end, the set-top box developers turned out to be correct after all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Good Blessings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in 2009, after completing about a year at RSA Security, I began looking for work that felt more intellectually stimulating, especially projects involving mathematics and algorithms. I spoke with a few senior leaders about this, but nothing materialised for some time. Then one day, Dr Burt Kaliski, Chief Scientist at RSA Laboratories, asked to meet me to discuss my career aspirations. I have written about this in more detail in another post here: Good Blessings. I will summarise what followed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Kaliski met me and offered a few suggestions about the kinds of teams I might approach to find more interesting work. I followed his advice and eventually joined a team that turned out to be an excellent fit. I remained with that team for the next six years. During that time, I worked on parser generators, formal language specification and implementation, as well as indexing and querying engines of a petabyte-scale database. I learnt something new almost every day during those six years. It remains one of the most enjoyable periods of my career. I have especially fond memories of working on parser generators alongside remarkably skilled engineers from whom I learnt a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Years later, I reflected on how that brief meeting with Dr Kaliski had altered the trajectory of my career. I realised I was not sure whether I had properly expressed my gratitude to him for the role he had played in shaping my path. So I wrote to thank him and explain how much that single conversation had influenced my life. A few days later, Dr Kaliski replied, saying he was glad to know that the steps I took afterwards had worked out well. Before ending his message, he wrote this heart-warming note:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;‘One of my goals is to be able to provide encouragement to others who are developing their careers, just as others have invested in mine, passing good blessings from one generation to another.’&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The CTF Scoreboard&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This story comes from 2019. By then, I was no longer a twenty-something engineer just starting out. I was now a middle-aged staff engineer with years of experience building both low-level networking systems and database systems. Most of my work up to that point had been in C and C++. I was now entering a new phase of my career where I would be leading the development of microservices written in Go and Python. Like many people in this profession, computing has long been one of my favourite hobbies. So although my professional work for the previous decade had focused on C and C++, I had plenty of hobby projects in other languages, including Python and Go. As a result, switching gears from systems programming to application development was a smooth transition for me. I cannot even say that I missed working in C and C++. After all, who wants to spend their days occasionally chasing memory bugs in core dumps when you could be building features and delivering real value to customers?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In October 2019, during Cybersecurity Awareness Month, a Capture the Flag (CTF) event was organised at our office. The contest featured all kinds of technical puzzles, ranging from SQL injection challenges to insecure cryptography problems. Some challenges also involved reversing binaries and exploiting stack overflow issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am usually rather intimidated by such contests. The whole idea of competitive problem-solving under time pressure tends to make me nervous. But one of my colleagues persuaded me to participate in the CTF. And, somewhat to my surprise, I turned out to be rather good at it. Within about eight hours, I had solved roughly 90% of the puzzles. I finished at the top of the scoreboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my younger days, I was generally known to be a good problem solver. I was often consulted when thorny problems needed solving and I usually managed to deliver results. I also enjoyed solving puzzles. I had a knack for them and happily spent hours, sometimes days, working through obscure mathematical or technical puzzles and sharing detailed write-ups with friends of the nerd variety. Seen in that light, my performance at the CTF probably should not have surprised me. Still, I was very pleased. It was reassuring to know that I could still rely on my systems programming experience to solve obscure challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the course of the contest, my performance became something of a talking point in the office. Colleagues occasionally stopped by my desk to appreciate my progress in the CTF. Two much younger colleagues, both engineers I admired for their skill and professionalism, were discussing the results nearby. They were speaking softly, but I could still overhear parts of their conversation. Curious, I leaned slightly and listened a bit more carefully. I wanted to know what these two people, whom I admired a lot, thought about my performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of them remarked on how well I was doing in the contest. The other replied, 'Of course he is doing well. He has more than ten years of experience in C.' At that moment, I realised that no matter how well I solved those puzzles, the result would naturally be credited to experience. In my younger days, when I solved tricky problems like these, people would sometimes call me smart. Now people simply saw it as a consequence of my experience. Not that I particularly care for labels such as 'smart' anyway, but it did make me realise how things had changed. I was now simply the person with many years of experience. Solving technical puzzles that involved disassembling binaries, tracing execution paths and reconstructing program logic was expected rather than remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I continue to sharpen my technical skills to this day. While my technical results may now simply be attributed to experience, I hope I can continue to make a good impression through my professionalism, ethics and kindness towards the people I work with. If those leave a lasting impression, that is good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Software Factories And The Agentic Moment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built a Software Factory: non-interactive development where specs + scenarios drive agents that write code, run harnesses, and converge without human review.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The narrative form is included below. If you'd prefer to work from first principles, I offer a few constraints &amp;amp; guidelines that, applied iteratively, will accelerate any team toward the same intuitions, convictions1, and ultimately a factory2 of your own. In kōan or mantra form:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Why am I doing this? (implied: the model should be doing this instead)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In rule form:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code must not be written by humans&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code must not be reviewed by humans&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, in practical form:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you haven't spent at least $1,000 on tokens today per human engineer, your software factory has room for improvement&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The StrongDM AI Story&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On July 14th, 2025, Jay Taylor and Navan Chauhan joined me (Justin McCarthy, co-founder, CTO) in founding the StrongDM AI team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The catalyst was a transition observed in late 2024: with the second revision of Claude 3.5 (October 2024), long-horizon agentic coding workflows began to compound correctness rather than error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By December of 2024, the model's long-horizon coding performance was unmistakable via Cursor's YOLO mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to this model improvement, iterative application of LLMs to coding tasks would accumulate errors of all imaginable varieties (misunderstandings, hallucinations, syntax, version DRY violations, library incompatibility, etc). The app or product would decay and ultimately "collapse": death by a thousand cuts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together with YOLO mode, the updated model from Anthropic provided the first glimmer of what we now refer to internally as non-interactive development or grown software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Find Knobs, Turn To Eleven&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the first hour of the first day of our AI team, we established a charter which set us on a path toward a series of findings (which we refer to as our "unlocks"). In retrospect, the most important line in the charter document was the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially it was just a hunch. An experiment. How far could we get, without writing any code by hand?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not very far! At least: not very far, until we added tests. However, the agent, obsessed with the immediate task, soon began to take shortcuts: return true is a great way to pass narrowly written tests, but probably won't generalize to the software you want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tests were not enough. How about integration tests? Regression tests? End-to-end tests? Behavior tests?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;From Tests to Scenarios and Satisfaction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One recurring theme of the agentic moment: we need new language. For example, the word "test" has proven insufficient and ambiguous. A test, stored in the codebase, can be lazily rewritten to match the code. The code could be rewritten to trivially pass the test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We repurposed the word scenario to represent an end-to-end "user story", often stored outside the codebase (similar to a "holdout" set in model training), which could be intuitively understood and flexibly validated by an LLM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because much of the software we grow itself has an agentic component, we transitioned from boolean definitions of success ("the test suite is green") to a probabilistic and empirical one. We use the term satisfaction to quantify this validation: of all the observed trajectories through all the scenarios, what fraction of them likely satisfy the user?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Validating Scenarios in the Digital Twin Universe&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In previous regimes, a team might rely on integration tests, regression tests, UI automation to answer "is it working?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We noticed two limitations of previously reliable techniques:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tests are too rigid - we were coding with agents, but we're also building with LLMs and agent loops as design primitives; evaluating success often required LLM-as-judge&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tests can be reward hacked - we needed validation that was less vulnerable to the model cheating&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Digital Twin Universe is our answer: behavioral clones of the third-party services our software depends on. We built twins of Okta, Jira, Slack, Google Docs, Google Drive, and Google Sheets, replicating their APIs, edge cases, and observable behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the DTU, we can validate at volumes and rates far exceeding production limits. We can test failure modes that would be dangerous or impossible against live services. We can run thousands of scenarios per hour without hitting rate limits, triggering abuse detection, or accumulating API costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Unconventional Economics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our success with DTU illustrates one of the many ways in which the Agentic Moment has profoundly changed the economics of software. Creating a high fidelity clone of a significant SaaS application was always possible, but never economically feasible. Generations of engineers may have wanted a full in-memory replica of their CRM to test against, but self-censored the proposal to build it. They didn't even bring it to their manager, because they knew the answer would be no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those of us building software factories must practice a deliberate naivete: finding and removing the habits, conventions, and constraints of Software 1.0. The DTU is our proof that what was unthinkable six months ago is now routine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Read Next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Principles: what we believe is true about building software with agents&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Techniques: repeated patterns for applying those principles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Products: tools we use daily and believe others will benefit from&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know he did other things than Larry, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We talked with Al Lowe about Leisure Suit Larry, but mostly other stuff. This was Roar’s first interview and he ran out of time before he could dive into what Al is mostly known for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al Lowe is an American software developer who started making games in the early eighties. His is mostly known for the Leisure Suit Larry games, created with Sierra, but he is also a musical man who loves playing his sax and still plays with his model trains. He has also created lots of other games for Sierra, not only the Larry series.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think Al is great, but you already know all you need to know about Larry, then this is the article for you. And it is pretty long. Get your coffee now, before continuing…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Have you ever been to Norway?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Oh yeah, sure. I have this eyeball right here. It works because I spent a week recuperating in the Department of Ophthalmology at Oslo University Hospital. I had a detached retina when we were flying into Oslo, and went to an ophthalmologist, and she said to get to the hospital right now. The next morning a bunch of Norwegian women started poking around in my eye and fixed it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, I was blind in that eye for the next week, and I was already blind in the other eye, so I wandered around in the dark while my wife went sightseeing. I went with her, but I didn’t see any sights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: So you have felt and smelt the beautiful fjords, but never seen them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, on an earlier trip, we did take the railroad to Bergen. Over the mountain plateau [Hardangervidda]. So we spent some time there, and that was fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I’ve never actually taken that trip myself, but I heard it’s wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: It was not for us. We got to the top, up in the top of the mountains. And the electricity went off. And so, we parked in the middle of this beautiful snowy scene for three hours, before they finally got the power back on. Then we went on our journey but we had already missed the connecting rides. We had booked a trip on a boat through the fjords, and a trip on the cog railway. We missed all of them. So be sure you go when there is electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah, we like to joke about that in Norway, the richest country in the world and the lousiest trains. I guess that is a good segue, because you do like trains, don’t you? At least model trains?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yes, I do. I’ve been a model railroader for most of my life. I got my first model train when I was 2 years old, and my dad wouldn’t let me play with it. So he ran it around the Christmas tree and I had to watch. But eventually, when I was 9 or 10, I got interested in HO size trains, and built a layout in our basement. Completely by myself, I had no idea what I was doing or anything, but I just learned as I went, piddled around and figured it out. I went to the hobby shop sometime and would say stuff like: How do you glue this stuff to this stuff? And they’d give me some special glue and and teach me how.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, it was fun. I learned a lot, and I proved that I could do things with my hands. I ended up learning a lot about wiring and electricity. And scenery, I did stuff with papier-mâché. I took old tomato sticks from our garden, cut them in different heights. I wrapped old screen door wire over the top of them and coated that with plaster to make mountains and stuff. So I did a lot of stuff, mostly things I’d read about in magazines, but I think it helped me understand that I could learn something if I didn’t already know it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Did you add any miniature figures or models and stuff like that in the scenery as well?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Sure, yeah, lots of stuff. In fact, I built buildings out of balsa wood. And I read an article in a magazine that said if you hold your X-Acto knife at just the right angle and drag it across the balsa wood, you can make clapboard siding, you know, where the siding overlaps. I also built doors from scraps of wood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, it was fun. It’s a fun hobby, and it served me for ten years at first. Then I went to college and started playing music, and I forgot about it. But then when my son was 10 years old I thought: I liked doing this when I was 10, maybe he will. So we went to the hobby shop and bought a bunch of trains. Of course he wasn’t interested at all, but I got hooked again! So for the last 35 years I’ve been doing N-scale trains, where the locomotive is about five inches long.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: So your son is 45, then?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yes!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yes, then you could have been my dad, because I’m 46.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, you’re the right age, then, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Model trains are not what they used to be&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I was sent a link to the National Model Railroad Association where you are mentioned as a member of the board of directors of the 4th Division of the Pacific Northwest region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: The Pacific Northwest Region of the NMRA, yeah. I did that for 10 years at least. Then I was assistant director for another 10 years so I worked at that organization for about 20 years. But recently I said: That’s enough, let some new blood come in. So we got new people now, and they’re much better, so I’m happy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: But you didn’t get any money for it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: No, no, it’s a volunteer organization. At first we did a paper newsletter every month. We would print and fold and staple and stamp and address-label hundreds of newsletters. I did that for a couple years until I finally convinced everybody that we’ve got to go online. So then I made a PDF, posted it, and we sent out an email. That was much better, but we still had a few die-hard people that would download it and print it out every time. I was part of this for 24 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Are there any physical magazines about model trains today?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yes. Well, the man who ran one of the biggest ones just passed away and so his magazine’s gone now, but there’s still a magazine called N Scale, and it’s housed right here in the suburb of Seattle. It is distributed all over the world. And then there’s the National Model Railroad Association, which publishes a magazine every month, all over the world. And then there’s Model Railroader and Railroad Model Craftsman. I know there’s one for each of the scales, for HO and S and O and G for garden railroads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: It’s an old hobby. A weird hobby, in that it follows my path. Most people get interested in trains when they’re little kids. And then they grow out of it in high school. Then later in life, they realize: I got time and money now. I could get back in it, this is a good hobby. And it really is. It’s great socially, because the group that I’m in have a layout that’s portable and we can bring it to shows. So 6-8 times a year we pack everything up into a trailer, move it to a place, and set it up. And we run trains all weekend, we talk with the public and hundreds of people come by and see my work. Then we pack it up and put it back in the trailer and then wait for the next show. So it doesn’t get old because it’s so long between shows. It’s really fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I guess there’s not that much development in the field, so even though you haven’t done it for 20 years, it’s not that hard to just continue where you left off?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Actually, it has changed completely with computers. So you couldn’t be more wrong! Actually, you were correct for 40 years at least. But in the 90s people started developing computerized means of running the trains. And in the mid-90s, the National Model Railroad Association set up standards and said: If you follow all these rules then your stuff can run on anybody’s system. And that’s when it really changed over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About 2001 or 2002, we went from the old system, which was a rheostat that controlled the amount of voltage applied to the rails, just like a volume control. So we went from a potentiometer that changed the amount of power to the tracks to constantly powered tracks, with a computer chip inside each locomotive. It has a number address that you can set. Then on your remote control you can type in the number of the locomotive you want to drive, turn a knob, and it sends a radio signal through the air to a computer that’s permanently affixed to the layout. And that computer multiplexes a serial signal on top of the power, just kind of like your old phone modems where they overlaid a signal on top of the regular phone lines. It then tells the locomotive to go this fast, back up, or sound the whistle and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I guess for you this was not a bad thing at all, because you love that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Oh, no, right? It was right up my the alley there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I have some experience painting Warhammer miniature figures. Did you paint miniatures yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah. The trouble with N Scale is that the people are very small. It’s a challenge to paint. We always tell everybody that the hard part is getting the eyelashes right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: And that’s at least one thing that does not get easier with age.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: No, no, that’s true. But I have lots of special tools for that. I have an optimizer that has LED lights built around it, so I can zoom right in on things and paint the tiny little stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Pretending to be a cyborg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, well … getting the help I need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Al Lowe and music&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Music is very important to you. And people wouldn’t think about music when they hear your name. But for me, I got this mp3-file in the late 90s with the title: «Al Lowe – For Your Thighs Only». And that played the music from Leisure Suit Larry. So then I learned the name. And of course, I had played these games earlier, but never picked up on the name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I hope you paid me a royalty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah, of course! So for me you were a musician before I found out that you had also created these games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, I was involved with a lot of Sierra products in one way or another. I worked on their spelling program when they had a word processor. I worked on their assembler for Apple II. I worked on … God, just a lot of different stuff. 26 products in 16 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, yeah, I should plug my website. Tell people, if they have gotten this far, they should visit my website. There’s lots more stuff there. If you enjoy this, you’ll enjoy that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah, I believe I will. Your kids, did they go for music, game developing, or anything else in their father’s footsteps?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Of course not. They’re my kids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Since you’re a saxophone player, I would guess that you can play a lot of other instruments as well?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, I was a high school band director, so I had to learn to play every instrument somewhat. So, I can pick up a viola and play badly, and I can play a trombone or French horn, but my real instrument is the saxophone and also flute and clarinet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: So, what kind of music do you like?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Big Band Jazz. But I play as much as I listen. I tend to watch films and read books, but I play music. I’m in two big bands, where I play lead alto sax. And they meet every week for a couple hours in the evening. And I’m in two saxophone quartets that meet a little less regularly, but we play classical saxophone music, and also some pop songs and things, but it’s just four saxophones, and so we get a lot of interesting work. That’s real fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I’ve been looking at this YouTube video, where you played in a band called The David Hasselhoff Big Band.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yes, the group is ironically named.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Metallica had been covered by a band of four cello players. Would it be possible to do something like that with saxophones?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: It would absolutely be possible, but the question is, why would you do that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: That is the better question. I guess being Norwegian, I don’t really feel like any music should be without some kind of growling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Al Lowe and television&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Do you watch any modern series on television?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: We watch a lot of Scandinavian noir shows. A lot of Danish and a couple of Norwegian shows. And we watch them in Norwegian with subtitles. We don’t want to use the English voiceover, because they are usually not very good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: No, I would guess not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: It is easier and better just to listen to the Norwegian and not know what you’re saying, but be able to read the subtitles and get the gist. I can’t think of a title right now, but we’ve got a long list on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah. Today it’s very easy to consume whatever you want to consume. Even though you don’t necessarily own the stuff you watch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: From very early on I didn’t want to own any movies or TV shows. We never bought anything. I always felt like I would rather just rent and see something new – see more stuff, instead of looking at the same thing over and over. And so, I didn’t build up a collection of VHS or DVDs. I was «streaming» when that was still analog. We got discs in the mail, you know. That was pretty advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah like Netflix, the original Netflix?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Al Lowe and humor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: What about humor? The modern humor scene versus the old humor scene. Some things that were acceptable to say back in the eighties are not any more, and so on, and we even rewrite old things to make them more «modern». Do you have any views about this issue, being an old humorist yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, I said and did things in the eighties’ games that I would never dream of doing now. Let’s put it that way. On the other hand, violence seems to be quite popular. I don’t understand it. We get scared of humor, but yet, you just can’t blow a person up any more than we do now. It is an odd situation isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yep. There has also been so much nudity in the last 10 years in all kinds of movies, and very explicit nudity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, which I enjoy. I have no problem with that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah, yeah, I won’t complain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, all in all, I guess my opinion is that things have gotten better. How long has it been since I wrote Larry 1? 35 years? No, 38 years. So in the 38 years since I wrote Larry 1, I think all of that stuff has gotten better, with the exception of violence. I’m not happy with that. I think we show too much, too often, and too strongly and too dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: It’s very brutal now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: But, you know, I think all these things are a pendulum, right? You know, it’s gonna swing over here, and then eventually it’s gonna swing back. Typical human behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yes, that’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: We’ll see what happens. Well, I won’t see what happens. You can see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Old Sierra games&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yes. Um, I guess I also have to talk to you about the old Sierra games. And these might not be the most original questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, I only want original questions…..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: You had, among other things, been working on the Dark Crystal Game: Gelfling Adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, I did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: And growing up when I did, I loved watching that old Dark Crystal movie. It was pretty scary when I was eight or nine, but man, what a wonderful movie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: It was. Yeah, it sure was. And Roberta [Williams] was delighted when Jim Henson asked her to do a computer game based on Dark Crystal. And I was delighted, because after the artists had done all the backgrounds and things for Dark Crystal, Sierra asked me to spin off an educational version of it. We called it the Gelfling Adventure, and it wasn’t a big hit, but it was sure fun to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I would guess if you could get it today, in a big box, it would be worth a fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I used to have a copy, but I think I sold it on eBay when I cleaned out my attic. I had an attic full of games, and finally I just put them on eBay and sold them off one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: You did? Was it that collection Metal Jesus Rocks bought?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Ah, no, that was not a game, that was stuff from Sierra. We should tell people what we’re referring to – there’s a YouTube channel called Metal Jesus Rocks. And he came over and did an interview one day at my house.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah, I saw that, you showed him all your cool stuff. And that is gone now?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: He convinced me that I should put it up on eBay, and somebody would buy it. And I said, no, nobody would do that. Who would want such a silly thing?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, it turned out that the current owner of Sierra, Activision [now owned my Microsoft] got mad and sent me a cease and desist letter: If you sell this, there might be something on those disks that we own. We don’t know what it is, you may not know what it is, and you may doubt that it’s there, but if there’s anything we’ll sue you. So I was like: oh, shit, what? Whatever I would get from selling it wouldn’t be nearly enough to pay a lawyer to defend me. So, I pulled it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: So, it’s still up there, if you look. Let’s see if I can adjust the camera a little. *Shows boxes of stuff in the background* Right there, those black boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Did you ever get to meet Jim Henson?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I did not, no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: He was big back then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, my wife and I never missed an episode of The Muppet Show. It was one of the most creative and funny things. Just warm-hearted, good, kind spirited, and funny as hell. Just a great show. And the first movie was also great. Then the second Muppet movie was maybe a little less, and the third one was a little less, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I did like the movies too. More than I liked The Muppet Show, because I was too young to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: The Muppet Show had a lot humor that went over kids’ heads, you know?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: And also, all those guests, I had no idea who they were.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I knew every one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: That does help. But I have seen the episodes as an adult, and now I enjoy them, because now I know who these people are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, I highly recommended it. Still funny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Leisure Suit Larry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: That brings me to the first Leisure Suit Larry game. It had all these questions at the start that was usually based on American pop culture or politics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end you just ended up writing down every question you could get. Then the answer you tried and whether it was correct or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: That’s how you did it? You know, all you had to do was press Alt-X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yes, we found that out after a while. But it was a very good way of learning English before that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: And now you know who Spiro Agnew was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah, but that’s also because of the Futurama series. He was a recurring character there being Nixon’s vice president and helper. But knowing that was not normal as a 10-year-old kid in Norway in the late 80s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Who was not Vice-President of the United States in 1973-74?&lt;p&gt;a. Gerald Ford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b. Nelson Rockefeller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c. Thomas Hayden&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d. Spiro Agnew&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Spiro Agnew is&lt;p&gt;a. a form of social disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b. a jazz-fusion rock band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c. a former Vice President.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d. the first woman in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The germ that transmits syphilis is&lt;p&gt;a. Spiro Agnew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b. Spirochete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c. Spirograph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d. Barbarella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who or what was Spiro Agnew? More of these on Als homepage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Disney games&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: My first real computer was a Commodore 64. So my first love with your stuff, without even knowing it was you, was Donald Ducks Playground.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Oh, yeah! I was very proud of that game. That won a bunch of educational awards over here, and was a successful product for Disney. Not as successful for Sierra and Al Lowe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: It was probably a cheap licence to get?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: They had no idea what any of the games or computers was about. They had a couple of women who worked for them, and did educational film strips, movie slideshows and, you know, educational workbooks and stuff like that they sold to schools. And so they told these two women: You take charge of this computer thing because it’s kind of like a movie projector or a slot film strips, and I think it’s got a screen, so you’re in charge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, I quickly realised that I knew much more, and I knew Sierra knew much more than they did. A couple of the other products we did were Mickey’s Space Adventure and Goofy’s Word Factory (never released). Those guys consulted with them often about how to create their product. But I took the approach: I’m too busy to talk to you until I get it done, and when I get it done, I’ll show it to you. And they bought off on that for a while. They didn’t know what I was doing. Then finally I said: Okay, it’s done, take a look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, then they had a big, long list of changes that we should make, because for them to be important, they had to put some mark on the product. They said; Well, I think that the leaf should be red instead of green, or I think his pants should be this instead of that, or this should be over in that corner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I said: Well, you know, I could make all those changes, or we could ship the product and make some money. What do you want to do? And Ken Williams said: Well, ship it, you know, let’s get it out. And so, I pretty much did that entire product without any input from Disney. And it was the same with Donald Duck. They had changes they wanted to make, but they weren’t improvements. If they had come up with something better, then yeah, I would have done it. Because I wanted to make it better, but just to make this color a little different, or move that thing over one pixel, you know, that made no difference whatsoever. Anyway, that’s my Disney story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: It’s such a nice-looking game. And I learned about quarters and dollars and cents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I haven’t seen it in 40 years, probably.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: In other games, like Winnie the Pooh or Mickey’s Space Adventure, you improved on the Zork formula. You added graphics. And you didn’t have to type in what you wanted to do, but instead clicked buttons with text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Did you ever play the Black Cauldron?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: No, but I did look at a YouTube video, and I thought: Maybe this is a Sierra game where you cannot die. But ah, I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Oh, no, you can. I didn’t know it at the time, but I feel like I invented the point-and-click adventure. Because that whole game could be played with a mouse or a joystick. It could be played just by pointing and moving to where you wanted to go. And then using the function keys – I’m doing it the old-fashioned way, using the keys on the right side of the keyboard where God intended them to be instead of up here, where nobody can hit them. But anyway, I used the function keys instead of clicking icons and stuff. Roberta added the icons with King’s Quest V, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Working for, but not being employed by Sierra&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: How was it working with the Williamses?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, I have no complaints, they bought me a nice house, bought me some nice cars, let me retire at 52, so I will say I was pretty happy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah, because you stayed there your whole career. At least your whole gaming career?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I resigned from my teaching gig and started working for Ken full-time. After six months, he hit hard times. There was one Friday the company started the morning with 120 employees. And in the afternoon it had been cut to 40 employees. So they fired two-thirds of the company that day, including me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He then called me into the office and said: I want you to keep working. I don’t want you to quit and leave. I want you to work on this product. And, I’ll give you advances against future royalties instead of a salary. I said, whoa, how much are we talking here? What kind of advances? Well, I can do this much for that. I asked: What about this other game you wanted? Because I was going to work on that. Oh, yeah, yeah, we’ll add that on, too. So I can do that one, and we’ll give you so much for that one. And I said, okay, well, what about the translation to Atari and Commodore for, you know, Winnie the Pooh or something? Oh, yeah, you would do that too. So I added up all the advances he was talking about and it was double the salary he had been paying me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Ah! Haha, nice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I figured I could get it done in a year so I said: Okay, that sounds good. Have I just been fired? Yep. Great, thanks! And I shook his hand, and for the next 15 and a half years I was an outside contractor who only worked on a contract basis. I got royalties instead of salary, and ended up having a great relationship with Sierra until Ken left the company. And when Ken got bought out by this … well, I don’t know how much depth you want to go into that, but there was a really ugly end for Sierra, where they were bought out in a hostile takeover by one of their board members, who were then convicted and sent to prison for fifteen years for fraud. So it was an ugly end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: When Ken left, the writing was on the wall. It was pretty obvious that they didn’t have anybody who could replace him, and there was nobody to replace Roberta. Sierra’s new method of product development was: Listen to a pitch, fund that pitch, let them do a lot of work on it, and then look at the product when it’s half done and not fun with nothing to see. Then they’d get cold feet and say: Oh, gosh, I don’t know if we should spend the rest of the money. Then cancel it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They just went through this endless churn of, you know, we’ll start a new product, oh no, oh, uh, no, we’ll cancel that. Now let’s do another one. Oh, yeah, yeah, that sounds good. Oh, wait, it doesn’t look very good… Well, it’s not done, dumbass. So the company quickly went into this….. Did you ever see the old World War II movies when they would shoot a plane and it would spiral out?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Oh yeah!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, that’s what Sierra felt like for about a year there. You could just see all the good people jumping ship and going to better companies. And all the bad people were staying around and making products that were even worse. And so, maybe two years after Ken left the company, they decided to move what little work was left to Los Angeles and merge with Blizzard. Then they turned off the lights and sent all the employees home. They locked the doors, and that was the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Including the end of all the historic materials that we used to create the games, which were carefully… well, I shouldn’t say that. That’s a lie. They were uncarefully stored. They were thrown in a box, put in a cabinet, and then when they needed cabinet space, they rented a storage unit and threw them in there. Then at the end somebody said: Why are we paying money for a storage unit for all this old crap? Then they burned it all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Oh, they burned it?!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Oh, yeah, it was just the dumbest thing. That was the end of the company. I had a few cells of animation that survived, but there’s very little of that stuff left anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: But at least you did have a copy of the source code for your games?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, for the early games I made. Once you got to Larry 6, the games were too big and you couldn’t back them up anymore. I think it was like 5 or 6 CDs, and at some point along there I just gave up. I have the source material for Larry 7, but I have no way to compile it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: If you put it online, someone will create a compiler, I’m pretty sure of it. People are nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: It’s too bad they didn’t let me sell the source code, because one of the things I loved doing was writing comments in the code. And more often than not, the comments were funnier than the game. It was a shame to let that all go to waste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: When you say the later games, you talk about games like Torin’s Passage and Freddy Pharkas, yeah?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, I have the source material for that somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: There are some projects that emulate these old games. ScummVM, I think, now supports a lot of non-Scumm games as well. So it might be that someone is thinking about Freddy Pharkas and Torin’s Passage for that engine [this is actually true for both these titles].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, maybe. I’m not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: It’s not impossible and I guess that’s also a point with these old games. They are fun to play, but usually because you did play them as a kid. If I gave Leisure Suit Larry to my kids today, I’m not sure if they would like them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, they would have to think. Sierra games were about thinking, they weren’t about shooting or killing, or building things. They were about figuring out things in your brain, and that’s something that we seem to be losing as a species.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: That’s true. It’s also very popular to look at other people playing games today, on Twitch and Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: That I don’t understand at all. And I think part of it is because the games that people watch don’t require thinking, or the same kind of puzzle solving. They’re certainly thinking in shooter games, but it’s not the same, you know? You don’t sit and ponder something. You don’t wait around, figure out what to do. Can I do this? How would I do that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah. Did you ever play that Softporn Adventure game without any hints?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Uh, only with the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Because I think you have a sound argument that people don’t like to think today, but there are a lot strange solutions that are not that obvious in the old games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sierra and stairs:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Why did all the old Sierra games always have these difficult stairs everywhere?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I can’t tell you other than you had to get to a different level. I actually spoofed that in, uh, Larry 2, I think? We had a cliff face and you had to walk this narrow path alongside a cliff. If you slipped, you went over the side, but you grabbed with this long arm that extended out and then brought you back up like a rubber band, so you couldn’t die on those stairs or on that cliff. That was my joke on those stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you’re right, it was a definite feature of Sierra games. Also, the deaths were because we often didn’t know what people would try. And when they would try something, we had no code in there to handle that. What were we gonna do? You couldn’t ignore it. I think somewhere, Larry 3, maybe, I added the feature that said: When you die you can go back to a game you saved, or you can just go back to life. And that seemed much more friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah? And you also had these very funny comments about you dying when you died.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Oh, sure. Yeah, it was always fun for me to make fun of the player. And there was something else that I want to bring to you that I don’t know that people have noticed. My games always referred to Larry as you. So when I talk to the player, I would say: You did this, you fell off a cliff, that was a dumb thing you did. Whereas a lot of other games referred to the main character in the third person. It was: Larry has fallen off, you know? But I always felt it like it was more meaningful to me as a player if the game referred to me as a person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I agree. And you can only blame yourself for trying to pet that cat or something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yep. Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Someone created a game: Stair Quest. It’s a game where you move like you do in the old Sierra games, and there are these very thin diagonal stairs that you have to traverse, and you fall off all the time and die.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, the trick with the stairs usually was to use the keys on the numeric keyboard. You’d have to use all of the keypad, including the diagonals. But I guess people didn’t always have keypads. So when the layout changed it made it pretty difficult to move.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Hmm, that’s a very good point. And with that I will let you get on with the day. It was wonderful meeting you, Al Lowe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Nice to meet you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’d like to thank Al Lowe for talking with us!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;SectorC: A C Compiler in 512 bytes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SectorC (github) is a C compiler written in x86-16 assembly that fits within the 512 byte boot sector of an x86 machine. It supports a subset of C that is large enough to write real and interesting programs. It is quite likely the smallest C compiler ever written.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a base64 encoding, it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

wYQA0+CaANP4jwCUwHf/lcAMAJzADgCfwIUAnsCZAJ3AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVao=
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Supported language&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fairly large subset is supported: global variables, functions, if statements, while statements, lots of operators, pointer dereference, inline machine-code, comments, etc. All of these features make it quite capable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the following program animates a moving sine-wave:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int y;
int x;
int x_0;
void sin_positive_approx()
{
  y = ( x_0 * ( 157 - x_0 ) ) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 7;
}
void sin()
{
  x_0 = x;
  while( x_0 &amp;gt; 314 ){
    x_0 = x_0 - 314;
  }
  if( x_0 &amp;lt;= 157 ){
    sin_positive_approx();
  }
  if( x_0 &amp;gt; 157 ){
    x_0 = x_0 - 157;
    sin_positive_approx();
    y = 0 - y;
  }
  y = 100 + y;
}


int offset;
int x_end;
void draw_sine_wave()
{
  x = offset;
  x_end = x + 314;
  while( x &amp;lt;= x_end ){
    sin();
    pixel_x = x - offset;
    pixel_y = y;
    vga_set_pixel();
    x = x + 1;
  }
}

int v_1;
int v_2;
void delay()
{
  v_1 = 0;
  while( v_1 &amp;lt; 50 ){
    v_2 = 0;
    while( v_2 &amp;lt; 10000 ){
      v_2 = v_2 + 1;
    }
    v_1 = v_1 + 1;
  }
}

void main()
{
  vga_init();

  offset = 0;
  while( 1 ){
    vga_clear();
    draw_sine_wave();

    delay();
    offset = offset + 1;
    if( offset &amp;gt;= 314 ){ // mod the value to avoid 2^16 integer overflow
      offset = offset - 314;
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Screenshot&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;But, how?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I started thinking about SectorC, I had just finished Deobfuscating OTCC with a lot of its ideas freshly loaded into my head. I also just had some healthy doses of justine.lol and Tom7 to inspire the absurdity of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did I think I would succeed? I suspected NO. Fit an entire C compiler in 510 bytes of instruction memory? Good luck (sarcasm).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tokenizing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first problem came quickly. In C, the tokenizer/lexer alone seems larger than one 512 byte sector! We need to consume an arbitrary stream of bytes and produce “tokens”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int main()
{
  if( a &amp;lt; 5 ){
    func();
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would be consumed and converted into:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;'int'  TOKEN_KEYWORD_INT
'main' TOKEN_IDENTIFIER
'('    TOKEN_LPAREN
')'    TOKEN_RPAREN
'{'    TOKEN_LBRACE
'if'   TOKEN_KEYWORD_IF
'('    TOKEN_LPAREN
'a'    TOKEN_IDENTIFIER
'&amp;lt;'    TOKEN_OPERATOR
'5'    TOKEN_NUMBER
')'    TOKEN_RPAREN
'{'    TOKEN_LBRACE
'func' TOKEN_IDENTIFIER
'('    TOKEN_LPAREN
')'    TOKEN_RPAREN
';'    TOKEN_SEMI
'}'    TOKEN_RBRACE
'}'    TOKEN_RBRACE
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need to specifically recognize &lt;code&gt;keywords&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;identifiers&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;operators&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;numbers&lt;/code&gt;. And then we need to convert numbers from string to integer with something like &lt;code&gt;atoi()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int atoi(const char *s)
{
  int n = 0;
  while (1) {
    char c = *s++;
    if (!c) break;
    n = 10 * n + (c - '0');
  }
  return n;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote a fairly straight-forward and minimalist lexer and it took &amp;gt;150 lines of C code. A crude estimate of the same code in x86-16 would require 300-450 bytes minimum (e.g. a simple &lt;code&gt;add ax,bx&lt;/code&gt; instruction encodes as 2 bytes). And this doesn’t include any symbol table, recursive-descent parser, code-generator, branch-patching, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No Chance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, naturally … I continued. Always pick the losers. The lolz are more fun that way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Big Insight #1&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Big Insight #1 came while thinking about other languages such as Forth. The tokenizer in Forth is nearly trivial. Every token is simply space-delimited. Every token is just called a &lt;code&gt;WORD&lt;/code&gt; and nothing is special (slight lie). Hmm, how about a C that does that? So dreamed up a C that is technically still a C, is probably turing-complete, and will definitely make every code maintainer terrified. 😏&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will call it the Barely C Programming Language:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int done , a , b , c , p , cond ;
int(main)(){while(!done){
     a = b - c ;
     *(int*) p = b - c ;
     a = *(int*) p ;
     if(cond) a = b - 45 ;
}}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we have spacing strategically placed to create “mega-tokens”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example: &lt;code&gt;int(main)(){while(!done){&lt;/code&gt; is one such "mega-token".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a sense, we actually have a language more like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;VAR_BEGIN done AND a AND b AND c AND p AND cond END
MAIN_BEGIN
  a = b - c END
  DEREF p = b - c END
  a = DEREF p END
  COND a = b - 45 END
MAIN_END
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, a normal C compiler will also recognize it as C!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even after using space-delimiters, we still have a lot of tokens and need to find more ways to minimize the tokenizer. What is essential? Well it’s quite hard to avoid the &lt;code&gt;atoi()&lt;/code&gt; if we want to actually have integer literals. What else do we need? How about nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Big Insight #2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Big Insight #2 is that &lt;code&gt;atoi()&lt;/code&gt; behaves as a (bad) hash function on ordinary text. It consumes characters and updates a 16-bit integer. Hashes are perhaps the holy-grail of computer-science.
With a good hash, we can just side-step all the hard problems by trading them for an even harder problem (hash collisions), and then we just ignore that harder problem. Brilliant. (sticks fingers in ears) 🤪&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we have this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Token Type&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Meaning of atoi()&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Integer Literal&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;uint16 number&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Keyword&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;token ”enum” value&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Identifier&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;hash value into a 64K array&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Implementing Barely C&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first implementation of Barely C fit in 468 bytes. It was a simple recursive-descent parser over the &lt;code&gt;atoi&lt;/code&gt; tokens. There was no symbol table of any kind. Variables simply access a 64K segment using the hash value. Codegen is emitted somewhat similar to OTCC, using &lt;code&gt;ax&lt;/code&gt; as the result register and shuffling values to the stack and then to &lt;code&gt;cx&lt;/code&gt; for binary operators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Minimizing with Byte-Threaded Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an attempt to steal every good idea Forth ever had, I then dreamed up what I will call “byte-threaded-code”. Since a sector is 512 bytes, if we simply align address on a 2-byte boundary, we can do addressing with a single byte! We can have a series of “gadgets” and do forth-style threading:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bits 16
  cpu 386

  jmp 0x07c0:entry

entry:
  push cs
  pop  ds

  lea si,operations
next:
  xor ax,ax
  lodsb
  add ax,ax
  push next
  jmp ax

putch:
  mov ah,0x01
  mov al,bl
  mov dx,0
  int 0x14
  ret

  align 2
hang:
  jmp hang

  align 2
print_F:
  mov bx,'F'
  jmp putch

  align 2
print_G:
  mov bx,'G'
  jmp putch

operations:
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 20  ; print_G
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 20  ; print_G
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 20  ; print_G
  db 16  ; hang
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Annoyingly, &lt;code&gt;nasm&lt;/code&gt; won’t let you do something like &lt;code&gt;db print_F/2&lt;/code&gt; so I had to write a custom little assembler to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alas, this idea didn’t work out. In 512 bytes, the overhead of this Forth-style computation model doesn’t pay for itself. There are a lot of little overheads: 2 byte alignment, extra &lt;code&gt;ret&lt;/code&gt; instructions, calling other “threads”, the &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; function, etc. The byte-threaded version of Barely C ended up at the same size as the straight-forward version&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the idea is fun and I decided to document it anyways in the event that someone else finds utility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Minimizing the Straight-Forward version&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, I returned to the straight-forward version and minimized it as much as possible. From 468 bytes ⇒ 303 bytes (165 bytes saving): 510 - 303 ⇒ 207 spare bytes to use for new features!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some tricks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reorganize code to allow “fall-through” instead of &lt;code&gt;jmp&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use tail-calls via &lt;code&gt;jmp&lt;/code&gt;wherever possible&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Perform call-fusion (e.g. &lt;code&gt;call tok_next2&lt;/code&gt;instead of&lt;code&gt;call tok_next; call tok_next&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Utilize &lt;code&gt;stosw&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;lodsw&lt;/code&gt;extensively&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Eliminate machine code tables for cheaper inline &lt;code&gt;stosw&lt;/code&gt;versions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prefer &lt;code&gt;cmp ax,imm&lt;/code&gt;over&lt;code&gt;cmp bx,imm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keep jump offsets within 8-bits to encode more efficiently&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Look Ma, A Real C!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As it turns out, a lot can be accomplished in 200 bytes if you already have a tokenizer, parser, and code-generator in 300 bytes. With these 200 bytes, Barely C became a proper C:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Arbitrarily nested &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;statement block with an arbitrary expression condition&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Arbitrarily nested &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;statement block with an arbitrary expression condition&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lots of operators: &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Grouping expressions: &lt;code&gt;( expression )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Function definitions and recursive function calls (using &lt;code&gt;func()&lt;/code&gt;as a hash value into a symbol table at segment 0x3000)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A special &lt;code&gt;asm&lt;/code&gt;statement for inline machine-code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single-line &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt;comments&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-line &lt;code&gt;/*&lt;/code&gt;comments&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A trick to do “space-injection” before semicolons to make code look more normal&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The biggest enabler here is the &lt;code&gt;binary_oper_tbl&lt;/code&gt; which allows for a very cheap way to add lots of operations. Each operator is simply a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;16-bit token-value&amp;gt; &amp;lt;16-bit-machine-code&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; pair, costing just 4 bytes.The above 14 operators cost just 56 bytes plus a little overhead to scan the table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Grammar&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the full grammer specification:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;program     = (var_decl | func_decl)+
var_decl    = "int" identifier ";"
func_decl   = "void" func_name "{" statement* "}"
func_name   = &amp;lt;identifier that ends in "()" with no space&amp;gt;
statement   = "if(" expr "){" statement* "}"
            | "while(" expr "){" statement* "}"
            | "asm" integer ";"
            | func_name ";"
            | assign_expr ";"
assign_expr = deref? identifier "=" expr
deref       = "*(int*)"
expr        = unary (op unary)?
unary       = deref identifier
            | "&amp;amp;" identifier
            | "(" expr ")"
            | indentifier
            | integer
op          = "+" | "-" | "&amp;amp;" | "|" | "^" | "&amp;lt;&amp;lt;" | "&amp;gt;&amp;gt;"
            | "==" | "!=" | "&amp;lt;" | "&amp;gt;" | "&amp;lt;=" | "&amp;gt;="
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, both &lt;code&gt;// comment&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/* multi-line comment */&lt;/code&gt; styles are supported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(NOTE: This grammar is 704 bytes in ascii, 38% larger than it's implementation!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Inline Machine-Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A programming language without I/O is useless. And, as the C language is defined in an I/O agnostic way, we need some way out. Thus, an &lt;code&gt;asm&lt;/code&gt; extension is supported. This allows programs to generate raw x86-16 machine code literals inline. Using &lt;code&gt;asm&lt;/code&gt;, programs can access any low-level detail of the machine. This is used extensively in the example code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Error-Handling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is “error-handling”? 🤣&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In traditional C style, we trust the programmer to write correct and well-formed programs. We are certain they are all minor gods and goddesses with the ability of perfection. Obviously, spending bytes on error-checking would be foolish. Surely all will agree that this is a very reasonable standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the less divine among us, a &lt;code&gt;lint&lt;/code&gt; was also written (that doesn’t fit in a sector) to detect errors. The author certainly didn’t require this tool for development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Runtime&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If C compiler writers were a secret shadow organization like the Free Masons, Illuminati, Lizard Peoples, or Pizzagaters our inner-secret would be “C actually has a runtime”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SectorC has a runtime under &lt;code&gt;rt/&lt;/code&gt; consisting of two files implemented in C itself:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rt/lib.c:&lt;/code&gt;A collection of library routines, often coded in inline&lt;code&gt;asm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rt/_start.c:&lt;/code&gt;The actual entry-point&lt;code&gt;_start()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The runtime code is concatenated with program source to construct the full source to compile and run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Examples&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few examples are provided that leverage the unique hardware aspects of the x86-16 IBM PC:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;examples/hello.c:&lt;/code&gt;Print a text greeting on the screen writing to memory at&lt;code&gt;0xB8000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;examples/sinwave.c:&lt;/code&gt;Draw a moving sine wave animation with VGA Mode 0x13 using an appropriately bad approximation of&lt;code&gt;sin(x)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;examples/twinkle.c:&lt;/code&gt;Play “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” through the PC Speaker (Warning: LOUD)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems fitting to end an article with “takeaways” or “what did we learn”. So.. umm.. what did we learn? Honestly, I’m not sure. But in the interest of fun, here’s a Choice Your Own Adventure version of What Did We Learn:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am an unusual beast. All my solo project games I've been making recently have been written in 'vanilla' C. Nobody does this. So I think it might be interesting to explain why I do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dry programming language opinions incoming, you have been warned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's some things which are non-negotiable. First of, it has to be reliable. I can't afford to spend my time dealing with bugs I didn't cause myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of my games were written for flash, and now flash is dying. I do not want to spend my time porting old games to new platforms, I want to make new games. I need a platform that I am confident will be around for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly I want to avoid tying myself to a particular OS, and ideally I'd like to have the option of developing for consoles. So it's important that my programming language is portable, and that it has good portable library support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The strongest thing on my desired, but not required list is simplicity. I find looking up language features, and quirky 'clever' api's incredibly tiring. The ideal language would be one I can memorize, and then never have to look things up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dealing with bugs is huge creative drain. I want to produce less bugs, so I want strict typing, strong warning messages and static code analysis. I want bugs to be easier to find, so I want good debuggers and dynamic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not interesting in high-def realism, but I do still care a bit about performance. Having more cycles available broadens the palette of things you can do. It's particularly interesting to explore what is possible with modern, powerful computers if you aren't persuing fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even more than that I care about the speed of the compiler. I am not a zen master of focus, and waiting 10+ seconds is wasteful, yes, but more importantly it breaks my flow. I flick over to Twitter and suddenly 5+ minutes are gone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not an OOP convert. I've spent most of my professional life working with classes and objects, but the more time I spend, the less I understand why you'd want to combine code and data so rigidly. I want to handle data as data and write the code that best fits a particular situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ is still the most common language for writing games, and not without reason. I still do almost all of my contract work in it. I dislike it intensely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C++ covers my needs, but fails my wants badly. It is desperately complicated. Despite decent tooling it's easy to create insidious bugs. It is also slow to compile compared to C. It is high performance, and it offers features that C doesn't have; but features I don't want, and at a great complexity cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C# and Java have similar issues. They are verbose and complex beasts, and I am searching for a concise, simple creature. They both do a lot to railroad a programmer into a strongly OOP style that I am opposed to. As per most higher level languages they have a tendency to hide away complexity in a way that doesn't actually prevent it from biting you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like Go a lot. In many ways it is C revisited, taking into account what has be learnt in the long years since it was released. I would like to use it, but there are big roadblocks that prevent me. The stop-the-world garbage collection is a big pain for games, stopping the world is something you can't really afford to do. The library support for games is quite poor, and though you can wrap C libs without much trouble, doing so adds a lot of busy work. It is niche enough that I worry a little about long term relevance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be nice to make things for the web, but it feels like a terrifyingly fast moving enviroment. It is particularly scary with the death of flash. I really dislike javascript, it is so loose that I marvel that people are able to write big chunks of software in it. I have no interest in trying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Haxe feels much more promising than most alternatives. If I do web stuff again I'll be diving in here. There is some good library support. I am a little concerned by its relative youth, will it last? I don't much have else to say about it though, I've only dabbled with the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some people just say screw it, I'll write my own language, the language I want to use. I admire this, and sometimes I toy with the idea of doing the same. It feels like too much to throw away all existing library support, and taking full responsibilty for future compatibility. It is also very difficult, and when it comes down to it I would rather be making games than programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C is dangerous, but it is reliable. A very sharp knife that can cut fingers as well as veg, but so simple it's not too hard to learn to use it carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is fast, and when it comes to compilation I can't think of anything faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can be made to run on just about anything. Usually this is relatively easy. It is hard to imagine a time when this won't be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The library and tooling support is strong and ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I say this with some sadness, but it is still the language for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I absolutely DO NOT mean to say "hey, you should use C too". I full appeciate preferences here are pretty specific and unusual. I have also already written more 'vanilla' C code than most, and this certainly is part of my comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So yeah, that's it :-)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a simple code exploration, inspired by (and stollen from) https://iventions.com/, saw it on X here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this example, I'm trying to implement a menu that is revealed when the user clicks on a button. With HTML+CSS only. No JS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two clip-paths:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The menu is revealed by a circle that grows from the top-left corner of the screen to the bottom-right corner. A fun clip-path calculation that I used here (clip-path: circle(calc(1.42 * 100vmax) at 0 0);) is based on the vmax, which is the larger of the viewport width or height. Then multiplied it by 1.42, because 1.42 is the square root of 2, which is the ratio of the width to the height of the viewport.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second clip-path is a polygon that is used to simulate the "ray". The polygon is hardcoded now, but it can be calculated with js, for dynamic dimension that respect the navigation dimensions for responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for stopping by.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast mode is in research preview. The feature, pricing, and availability may change based on feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/fast&lt;/code&gt; when you need speed for interactive work like rapid iteration or live debugging, and toggle it off when cost matters more than latency.
Fast mode is not a different model. It uses the same Opus 4.6 with a different API configuration that prioritizes speed over cost efficiency. You get identical quality and capabilities, just faster responses.
What to know:
&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;/fast&lt;/code&gt;to toggle on fast mode in Claude Code CLI. Also available via&lt;code&gt;/fast&lt;/code&gt;in Claude Code VS Code Extension.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fast mode for Opus 4.6 pricing starts at $30/150 MTok. Fast mode is available at a 50% discount for all plans until 11:59pm PT on February 16.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Available to all Claude Code users on subscription plans (Pro/Max/Team/Enterprise) and Claude Console.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;For Claude Code users on subscription plans (Pro/Max/Team/Enterprise), fast mode is available via extra usage only and not included in the subscription rate limits.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Toggle fast mode&lt;/head&gt;Toggle fast mode in either of these ways:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;/fast&lt;/code&gt;and press Tab to toggle on or off&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;"fastMode": true&lt;/code&gt;in your user settings file&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;If you’re on a different model, Claude Code automatically switches to Opus 4.6&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;You’ll see a confirmation message: “Fast mode ON”&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;A small &lt;code&gt;↯&lt;/code&gt;icon appears next to the prompt while fast mode is active&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;/fast&lt;/code&gt;again at any time to check whether fast mode is on or off&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;code&gt;/fast&lt;/code&gt; again, you remain on Opus 4.6. The model does not revert to your previous model. To switch to a different model, use &lt;code&gt;/model&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Understand the cost tradeoff&lt;/head&gt;Fast mode has higher per-token pricing than standard Opus 4.6:&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Mode&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Input (MTok)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Output (MTok)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Fast mode on Opus 4.6 (&amp;lt;200K)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;$30&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;$150&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Fast mode on Opus 4.6 (&amp;gt;200K)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;$60&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;$225&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Decide when to use fast mode&lt;/head&gt;Fast mode is best for interactive work where response latency matters more than cost:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Rapid iteration on code changes&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Live debugging sessions&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Time-sensitive work with tight deadlines&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Long autonomous tasks where speed matters less&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Batch processing or CI/CD pipelines&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Cost-sensitive workloads&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fast mode vs effort level&lt;/head&gt;Fast mode and effort level both affect response speed, but differently:&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Setting&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Effect&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Fast mode&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Same model quality, lower latency, higher cost&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Lower effort level&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Less thinking time, faster responses, potentially lower quality on complex tasks&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Requirements&lt;/head&gt;Fast mode requires all of the following:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Not available on third-party cloud providers: fast mode is not available on Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Azure Foundry. Fast mode is available through the Anthropic Console API and for Claude subscription plans using extra usage.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Extra usage enabled: your account must have extra usage enabled, which allows billing beyond your plan’s included usage. For individual accounts, enable this in your Console billing settings. For Teams and Enterprise, an admin must enable extra usage for the organization.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast mode usage is billed directly to extra usage, even if you have remaining usage on your plan. This means fast mode tokens do not count against your plan’s included usage and are charged at the fast mode rate from the first token.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Admin enablement for Teams and Enterprise: fast mode is disabled by default for Teams and Enterprise organizations. An admin must explicitly enable fast mode before users can access it.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your admin has not enabled fast mode for your organization, the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/fast&lt;/code&gt; command will show “Fast mode has been disabled by your organization.”&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Enable fast mode for your organization&lt;/head&gt;Admins can enable fast mode in:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Console (API customers): Claude Code preferences&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Claude AI (Teams and Enterprise): Admin Settings &amp;gt; Claude Code&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Handle rate limits&lt;/head&gt;Fast mode has separate rate limits from standard Opus 4.6. When you hit the fast mode rate limit or run out of extra usage credits:&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fast mode automatically falls back to standard Opus 4.6&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The &lt;code&gt;↯&lt;/code&gt;icon turns gray to indicate cooldown&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;You continue working at standard speed and pricing&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;When the cooldown expires, fast mode automatically re-enables&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;code&gt;/fast&lt;/code&gt; again.
&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Research preview&lt;/head&gt;Fast mode is a research preview feature. This means:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The feature may change based on feedback&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Availability and pricing are subject to change&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The underlying API configuration may evolve&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;See also&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Model configuration: switch models and adjust effort levels&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Manage costs effectively: track token usage and reduce costs&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Status line configuration: display model and context information&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn’t ask for this and neither did you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn’t ask for a robot to consume every blog post and piece of code I ever wrote and parrot it back so that some hack could make money off of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn’t ask for the role of a programmer to be reduced to that of a glorified TSA agent, reviewing code to make sure the AI didn’t smuggle something dangerous into production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet here we are. The worst fact about these tools is that they work. They can write code better than you or I can, and if you don’t believe me, wait six months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could abstain out of moral principle. And that’s fine, especially if you’re at the tail end of your career. And if you’re at the beginning of your career, you don’t need me to explain any of this to you, because you already use Warp and Cursor and Claude, with ChatGPT as your therapist and pair programmer and maybe even your lover. This post is for the 40-somethings in my audience who don’t realize this fact yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So as a senior, you could abstain. But then your junior colleagues will eventually code circles around you, because they’re wearing bazooka-powered jetpacks and you’re still riding around on a fixie bike. Eventually your boss will start asking why you’re getting paid twice your zoomer colleagues’ salary to produce a tenth of the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately if you have a mortgage and a car payment and a family you love, you’re going to make your decision. It’s maybe not the decision that your younger, more idealistic self would want you to make, but it does keep your car and your house and your family safe inside it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Someday years from now we will look back on the era when we were the last generation to code by hand. We’ll laugh and explain to our grandkids how silly it was that we typed out JavaScript syntax with our fingers. But secretly we’ll miss it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll miss the feeling of holding code in our hands and molding it like clay in the caress of a master sculptor. We’ll miss the sleepless wrangling of some odd bug that eventually relents to the debugger at 2 AM. We’ll miss creating something we feel proud of, something true and right and good. We’ll miss the satisfaction of the artist’s signature at the bottom of the oil painting, the GitHub repo saying “I made this.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t celebrate the new world, but I also don’t resist it. The sun rises, the sun sets, I orbit helplessly around it, and my protests can’t stop it. It doesn’t care; it continues its arc across the sky regardless, moving but unmoved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you would like to grieve, I invite you to grieve with me. We are the last of our kind, and those who follow us won’t understand our sorrow. Our craft, as we have practiced it, will end up like some blacksmith’s tool in an archeological dig, a curio for future generations. It cannot be helped, it is the nature of all things to pass to dust, and yet still we can mourn. Now is the time to mourn the passing of our craft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
