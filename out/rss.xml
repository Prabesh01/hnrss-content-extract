    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Apple is Fighting for TSMC Capacity as Nvidia Takes Center Stage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;[Exclusive] A 15-year relationship helped TSMC grow and Apple leap ahead of rivals. But now the iPhone maker is struggling to get access to chip production as it competes with Nvidia for wafer supply.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When CC Wei visited Cupertino last August, he had bad news for his largest client. Apple would need to acquiesce to the largest price rise in years, TSMC’s CEO told its executives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tim Cook and his team took the news on the chin. Wei had been telegraphing hikes in earnings calls over the past few quarters, and the Taiwanese chip maker’s rising gross margins were testament to its increasing pricing power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That wasn’t the worst news, my sources tell me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple, which once held a dominant position on TSMC’s customer list, now needs to fight for production capacity. With the continuing AI boom, and each GPU from clients like Nvidia and AMD taking up a larger footprint per wafer, the iPhone maker’s chip designs are no longer guaranteed a place among TSMC’s almost two dozen fabs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Wei probably didn’t tell Cook is that Apple may no longer be his largest client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Culpium analysis and discussions with sources in the supply chain, Nvidia likely took top spot in at least one or two quarters of last year. “We don’t discuss that,” Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang told Culpium Thursday when asked about the change in client rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Final data will be unveiled in a few months when TSMC releases its annual report — which includes revenue from its top clients — but there’s every chance that Apple’s lead for the full year narrowed significantly and may have even fallen below Nvidia’s. If it didn’t happen in 2025, then it’s almost certain to do so in 2026, my sources tell me.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Public data helps tells the story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TSMC’s revenue climbed 36% last year to $122 billion, it reported Thursday. Nvidia’s sales for the fiscal year through January 2026 is set to climb 62% while Apple’s product revenue — which excludes services — is on track to grow just 3.6% for the 12-months to December 2025, according to Culpium estimates based on earnings reports and company guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple’s role as the primary driver of TSMC revenue growth ended five years ago. In 2018 TSMC sales would have even fallen if not for incremental purchases by Apple that year. Now, the Cupertino company is posting low single-digit revenue growth while Nvidia is skyrocketing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason for this change is two-fold, and pretty obvious: AI is driving massive demand for high-powered chips, while the smartphone boom has plateaued.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TSMC’s sales from high-performance computing, which includes AI chips, climbed 48% last year on top of 58% growth the year before. Smartphone revenue climbed just 11%, slower than 23% in the prior year.2 That trend will continue this year, and for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Revenue in 2026 will rise close to 30%, yet capital expenditure will climb around 32% to a record of somewhere between $52 billion and $56 billion, TSMC said Thursday. Longer term, growth will average 25% in the five years through 2029 yet the AI segment will climb an average of 55% or more over the same period, the company said. That’s higher than a prior forecast for a mid-40 percent figure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ultimate flex for TSMC came Thursday when it showed off not only record revenue and net income, but a gross margin approaching that of software makers and fabless chip designers. In the December quarter, that figure was an astounding 62.3%, 280 basis points higher than the prior period. If not for its overseas fabs (Arizona and Japan) gross margin would have been even higher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two caveats that are important. First, while smartphone processors are the largest portion of chips bought by Apple, they’re not the only type. Processors for Macs come under HPC, while it also has a strong lineup of custom chips used in accessories which fall under digital consumer electronics. Second, Nvidia isn’t the only HPC client. AMD is a major buyer of capacity for its own GPUs while Amazon and Google are on the growing list of customers developing in-house AI chips.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Put another way, Apple’s chip catalog is broader and more varied, while Nvidia’s lineup is more concentrated around a huge number of wafers at, or near, leading-edge. It’s for these reasons that Apple will remain important for at least another decade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the near-term, however, TSMC’s technology roadmap coupled with broader industry trends favor Nvidia, AMD and their ilk, meaning Apple may need to keep fighting for capacity over the next year or two.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TSMC is already producing chips in volume at 2 nanometer (called N2), currently its most advanced node, with Apple a major buyer. But in the second half of this year it’s set to ramp up both a new variant called N2P as well as a new node called A16.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company’s business model is a little quirky. Instead of repurposing an existing factory for new technology, TSMC just builds a new one. This ensures no interruption to output and allows it to squeeze the most out of old tools and processes. In general, this means any new capacity that TSMC builds is for a new node. As a result, it has numerous fabs still churning out chips on technology that’s a decade older or more.3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In TSMC CEO CC Wei’s words A16, with Super Power Rail, is “best for HPC with complex signal routes.” SPR is TSMC’s version of backside power, a newer approach designed to separate a chip’s signal from its power supply. Intel is also developing this technology, and many believe it’ll be the key to the US company’s prospects at stealing foundry share from its Taiwan rival.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After that, TSMC has A14 which it expects to bring into volume production around 2028. Some call this the next full node after N2, labeling A16 as not a “full node.” In truth, all of these names are as much marketing terms as they are technology designators. Nevertheless, as SemiAnalysis recently wrote in a fabulous report on the TSMC-Apple relationship, the balance will shift back to Apple because A14 is designed “for both mobile and HPC from the start.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More importantly, what Apple offers is stability. Nvidia has been a client for a lot longer than Apple, but broadly speaking it’s a bit niche. Right now that “niche” is the hottest product on the planet, but niche it is. Apple, on the other hand, has products being made in no fewer than a dozen TSMC fabs. Even if Nvidia did overtake Apple by purchases, the breadth of its manufacturing footprint at TSMC is nowhere near as large.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This distinction may not matter now, but it probably will at some point. The AI boom won’t last forever. The bubble may burst, or it may slowly deflate, but the growth trajectory will surely flatten and that means demand for leading-edge AI chips will fall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wei knows this, which is why he’s expanding both quickly yet cautiously. “I am also very nervous,” he said at the company’s investor conference on Thursday in Taipei. “If we didn’t do it carefully, it would be a big disaster for TSMC for sure.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chip giant has recently come under fire, including from noted analyst Benedict Evans, for being “unwilling/unable to expand capacity fast enough to meet Nvidia’s book.” I think this is wrong, and unfair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The risk of under-investing is significantly greater than the risk of over-investing,” Evans cited Google CEO Sundar Pichai as saying back in 2Q 2024, as if to make the point. TSMC and Alphabet, Google’s parent, have approximately the same gross margin. But their business models couldn’t be more different. Nvidia’s financials are also unlike TSMC’s. Their respective capex strategies need to reflect this risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alphabet’s capital intensity, calculated as acquisitions of property, plant &amp;amp; equipment divided by revenue, was just 15% for full-year 2024. TSMC’s is more than double that at over 33%. More importantly, depreciation — which is where the cost of capex is reflected in earnings — was just 10% of Alphabet’s cost of revenue. For TSMC, this figure is more than four times higher at 45%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Nvidia, which is a tier-one buyer of TSMC’s output, the data is more stark. Capital intensity was just 2.5% for 2024, while depreciation was only 5.7% of the cost of revenue. As a fabless chipmaker, it can enjoy gross margins of over 70%. Its only real risk is holding excess inventory. Even then, it could have written off its entire inventory at the end of October and still maintain a gross margin approaching that of its chief supplier. What’s more, neither of these clients have anywhere near the customer-concentration risk of TSMC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The complaint that TSMC could and should build faster ignores the fact that it’s the one left holding the baby if a downturn comes and demand falls. It takes two to three years to build a new fab, Wei explained, so the company must skate where the puck is going without thinking too much about where it’s been. “Even if we spend 52 to 56 billion this year, the contribution this year is none,“ Wei said Thursday. Its major cost, buying equipment, remains on the books no matter what revenue it brings in for the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the best part of a decade, Apple was the one driving TSMC’s need to keep spending on new facilities. Today it’s Nvidia, and Jensen Huang is starting to wield more power than Tim Cook. But neither has to bother with the expensive business of actually manufacturing semiconductors, merely the hassle of begging CC Wei for wafers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For such clients, the foundry’s capacity is a fixed cost that they needn’t worry about. Which is precisely why eight of the world’s ten largest companies turn to TSMC to make their chips,4 and in return the Taiwanese giant gets to reap the rewards during boom times like this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;More from Culpium:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of these companies state their purchase and sales relationships explicitly, but instead use terms like Customer A and Vendor Y when providing numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to 2019, TSMC categorized revenue by Communications, Computer, Consumer, and Industrial but the data still reflects this smartphones v HPC dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not ALWAYS the case. In recent years it has repurposed old fabs, but that’s the exception and not the norm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other two are Saudi Aramco and TSMC itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Countless voiceless people sit alone every day and have no one to talk to, people of all ages, who don't feel that they can join any local groups. So they sit on social media all day when they're not at work or school. How can we solve this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You want to just hang out, you reach out and propose what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You want more purposeful and meaningful time, join a volunteer group you vibe with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if it’s meeting for coffee. You have to be the one who reaches out. You have to do it on a regular cadence. If, like me, you don’t have little alarms in your head that go off when you haven’t seen someone in a while, you can use automated reminders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have observed my spouse (who is not on social media) do this and she maintains friendships for decades this way. Nowadays she has regular zoom check ins, book clubs, and more, even with people who moved to the other coast. You do now have the tools for this. I have adopted it into my own life with good results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: you are going to get well under a 50% success rate here. Accept that most people flake. It may always feel painful (and nerds like us often are rejection-sensitive). You have to feel your feelings, accept it, and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are struggling against many aspects of the way we in the developed world/nerd world live. We have a wealth of passive entertainment, often we have all consuming jobs or have more time-consuming relationship with our families than our parents ever did. We move to different cities for jobs, and even as suburban sprawl has grown, you’re on average probably further away from people who even live in the same city! You get from place to place in a private box on wheels, or alternatively in a really big box on wheels with a random assortment of people. You don’t see people at church, or market day, or whatever other rituals our ancestors had. On the positive side, you have more tools and leisure than ever before to arrange more voluntary meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love this but I think you'll be surprised at your success rate. Everyone is struggling with this, not just you. Right on the heels of covid we were debating whether to have a NYE party or just go to a friend's house for a low key thing. We were paralyzed a bit feeling like, why we weren't invited to other parties ourselves? Won't everyone already be busy doing other stuff? In the end my wife took the leap and invited a ton of neighbors and friends. Guess what?? Almost everyone showed up! Which means all those people were going to be sitting at home feeling bad and wondering the same thing. You just need to believe and get over it, people want to hang out. We've all just gotten out of the habit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my experience, the problem is not a low success rate, but the burnout from being the only person that invites people to do things. At a certain point you want to see some reciprocation to create community. It can definitely happen, but a lot of folks still fall back on the habits. You have to invite and then also start asking people who's gonna host the next one and get them on the hook, and then not burnout from being a constant organizer :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Hyper-perfect social media / television setting "the best" expectations for an event.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Decreased knowledge of how to host a gathering. It's not rocket science, but throwing one the first time can seem daunting. And throwing one well does take skill. E.g. icebreakers, identifying and facilitating the right introductions by highlighting mutual interests, making sure wallflowers have a good time, defusing tensions, food, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Decreased American tolerance for and ability to handle awkwardness, and there's always going to be some awkwardness in social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Decreased public/accessible American meeting places. There used to (&amp;lt; 2000) be a plethora of low-cost, broadly-accessible spaces that could serve as training wheels for events (handling food, furnishings, cleaning, etc). They've essentially all been privatized, commercialized, and optimized to turn seats -- think real coffee shops disappearing in favor of Starbucks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- lower expectations (my own and everyone else's). I work out the bare minimum that would work for the event and do that. People need food. They don't need music.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- tell people how to contribute: "bring snacks and drinks", ask one specific person to bring ice. when people arrive I often give specific tasks: "can you find someone to help move the table and chairs into the other room", "can you sort out music"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- do it the same way every time so it's less mentally taxing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I find that the more a group does things, the more everyone chills out. It's like the expectations come from a fear of being judged and from uncertainty. When everyone has information from the last ten events then you don't need to stress anymore, because everyone knows how this one will go and they've all judged one another already.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It helps to remember that you are competing with: no event.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there are other parties happening and you're trying to make a better one, by all means, go all out. But mostly people in their 40s aren't going to many house events, so they're just happy to be somewhere with people. They don't care that you didn't decorate or sweep the floor or prepare an elaborate meal. You made soup and they're thrilled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd also add that first-event nerves (on host and attendee sides) can be an uncertainty problem. No one wants to misunderstand the dress code, social code, etc. Once people have been together, there are now group norms that assuage that (aka "I know what's acceptable to wear and talk about").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Absolutely. I throw “open houses” with open hours. There will be some food and company and some booze. Probably music. But in the end everyone brings what they can and it rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Granted it’s still a lot of effort but it’s low key and I find people prefer that unless it gets enough momentum to become a “thing” haha&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; 3. Decreased American tolerance for and ability to handle awkwardness, and there's always going to be some awkwardness in social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder how much of this is due to our ever increasing sense of obligation to be "performing" all the time. Maybe increased by the perpetual presence of social media and the habits and mindset that both creating and consuming for it creates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought that originally, but I actually think it's more experiential/exposure-side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hypothesis: modern society (especially apps) has decreased the amount of realtime, face-to-face social interactions at all stages of life, which has eventually manifested into a decreased average (there are still some social people!) capability to deal with social awkwardness. And consequently less comfort/appetite for putting oneself in situations where it might happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t think it’s this. I’ve lived in NYC recently and people there don’t have tolerance for shit behaviors either and you’re surrounded by people all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s due to people having higher standards than before and being bifurcated on every issue. There is deep polarization and tribalism within American culture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone consumes different content and there’s very little homogeneity within our culture. Like… Americans are more diverse than ever in terms of their thoughts and behaviors. They genuinely have little in common compared to many other cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll buy that, especially in NYC-like urban environments where frequency of exposure is definitely not the issue. Suburbs and rural may be different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part of the increased diversity is unavoidable due to technological changes eroding previous touchpoints. E.g. limited broadcast TV becoming cable becoming streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there does seem to be an increasing dearth of the logical tonic: discussion-facilitating diverse spaces. Places where people of different opinions can mingle, there are strong social norms around mutually productive conversation (and enforcement to discourage / weed out poison apples?), and that are open to new people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Hyper-perfect social media / television setting "the best" expectations for an event.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My approach around this is suggesting the idea to people up front and then throwing everyone into a WhatsApp chat and laying down the plan. Anyone who can't join gets removed/leaves. No one expects a whatsapp group to be a refined VIP experience. It's just people getting together and sharing an experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having moved countries and needing to start up a new friend group, things like Meetup or Facebook groups help a lot. There are _many_ people out there who are looking to meet people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For throwing a party, my general rule of thumb is expect 50% of people to turn up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently moved into a very upper class neighborhood (pacific heights) and enrolled my child in the neighborhood private school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The social hosting skill I’ve observed and and able to do as well is extraordinarily high. People throw parties, know how to act, are cordial and polite and seem to reasonably enjoy each others company while also teaching their children the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is how I remember mere middle class parents acting in the late 90s and early 2000s but my fellow millennials and z seem to be completely incapable of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One huge aspect I’ve noticed is that it’s wildly expensive in time and money to host. An open cocktail night cost me nearly 3000 dollars to host. I can imagine this would not be common for Gen Z these days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That seems to be a very narrow definition of a party. I have friends over for pizza and board games. We've had ice cream making parties. Cheese dinners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a millennial and my parents did no events, since they both worked and had long commutes. I wonder when the middle class entertainment slowed down—I want to guess it’s when you have more two income households, that don’t earn enough to hire home help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minimum wages have not increased in decades. Cost of living has increased a lot meanwhile, and the rich vs poor divide has increased. So lower class and middle class are suffering, while upper class have become richer from their labors. In earlier generations, the middle class could work for some years and afford to buy a house (on mortgage). But these days, middle class cannot afford a house, they live in rented apartments. Hosting parties is the least of their priorities, when they are struggling with the monthly bills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It used to be predominantly women who did it. It was part of being a housewife. Joy of Cooking even has an entire chapter dedicated to hosting a dinner party. But now women work for billionaires too. Nobody has time to work for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;In my experience, the problem is not a low success rate, but the burnout from being the only person that invites people to do things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what mostly happened with me, I just got burned out from always having to be the one to organise everything or nothing would happen, which is what ended up happening after I stopped, we just stopped meeting up and eventually grew completely apart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, I'm in a completely different country and I don't even have anyone's contacts anymore. But that's been life for me, people come and people go, never to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've accepted it by now, it can still hurt from time to time, but it is what it is, one should not force their will onto others, I believe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This. My wife and I built our social life when we moved countries, and we had a group of friends that we'd meet every week or two. But only when we invited them. No-one else in the group ever organised anything. It got really tiring. We could not get anyone else to organise a meet, they always had reasons why they couldn't organise one (but could turn up to it fine). We tried a bunch of things, but nothing worked - if we didn't organise it, it didn't happen. We ended up moving away and the whole social group collapsed and stopped meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think some people are just the center of gravity, and that particular friend circle revolves around them. Before COVID, we had a friend group that would hang out fairly regularly. Once I left (for a job, not fleeing the city), none of them hung out without me. Everyone was friendly with each other, but everyone also had their own lives going on with their own friends and other circles. While I was the glue for that circle, it wasn't like everyone just stayed at home having pity parties when I wasn't around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My anecdote might have limited relevance here, but I think it's something worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do any of those friends organise anything for any of their other friend groups?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I get the feeling that some people organise, while most people don't. I haven't seen the situation where a person organises stuff for one group, but not for another group. It always tends to be the same people doing the organising for all their friends. At least that's what I've observed, I'd welcome any other observations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That attitude, the some people are leeches, to me is part of the problem. If you go in with the expectation that others owe you something or they're bad people, you're only going to be going down the path of not doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lack of reciprocation is a tough one. I think it also helps sometimes to understand that not everyone is good at being the mother goose or the facilitator, especially if someone else is already good at doing it, and it's not because they lack interest or don't care.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have some friends who very easily lose themselves in their work and the stress around it and if I wasn't the one checking in and basically pulling them away, I'd miss out on what are easily my favourite days out and it has no impact on how much we enjoy each other's company. Maybe one day it changes but until then I'm there for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, there are of course times where it's better to just let go. But those people were probably never that important to you in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I sometimes wonder about this, I have a friend who does most of the organizing for parties or whatever. My sense is that there are a few different kinds of people, among those are people who, if they didn't organize parties, there wouldn't really be much of a platform for hanging out for them and others like them, while others are completely isolated, don't organize and don't have any other third space, and others yet have many smaller interactions from many other parts of life that don't necessitate a larger meetup necessarily. If you're an "organizer" type, my guess is that the people you'd hope reciprocate fall into the latter camp; they're happy to show up and have a good time, but they probably have a bunch of other things to explore that for some reason they haven't felt you'd be into... or a bunch of other possible reasons. Asking them to host a party is asking them to fabricate a social setting from thin air, but maybe they just organically don't find that to be something they need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me, I'll host something for a small group if I get some inspiration, but on a week to week basis I'm often in extremely social third-spaces, supplemented by larger parties (probably bi-weekly). My effort is often best spent meeting people for deliberate, intimate, outdoor sports adventures or coffee hangouts, but the same person I know who tends to organize larger parties doesn't really feel like someone who'd be into these; they can't really hold a conversation 1 on 1 for very long, and they're not super curious or vulnerable or athletic in the way that's necessary to engage in those as much. He's a regimented, scheduled, impatient, person. They often need a sort of fabricated social vehicle (also likes to decorate and host), whereas I get nearly all of my socializing from incidentally being in social space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it's fine to be either of course. It's ok that my organizer friend doesn't like heights, and so I won't invite him to climb mountains, he likes hosting parties, so I try to attend as many as I can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that I don't mean the non-organizer (me) is just passively socializing, it's just that they have different catalysts built into the things they do that extend into socializing easily. I'm DMing 1 or 2 friends, multiple times a week, to do something we both enjoy or just chat while walking around the city. While parties and hosted things are neat, they're just not very good platforms for depth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just as well, I do try and be inviting to everyone who'd like to come out and do other things, in general it's important to reciprocate, but I'm not hosting a party just because someone else did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As somebody who does host and doesn’t get a ton of reciprocity, the problem isn’t burn out (because I love doing it). The problem is second guessing whether this is something the group enjoys and whether they are just humoring me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also love hosting - but what I’m really trying to do is have particles collide and form bonds outside the larger events. Even smaller scale gatherings, game nights, or hell even a couples dinner invite would be a nice change of pace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've noticed this in our neighborhood. Once a year we host a few families before going out trick or treating with our kids. We buy a bunch of pizza so everyone can eat and don't ask for the other families to kick in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We were hoping the other families would reciprocate, and maybe invite us to some of their gatherings (especially two families who hang out together quite a bit.) So far it hasn't happened at all, they just receive our graciousness and move on immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Potluck parties help. Then they, generally, at least partly participated. Some people will just bring soda or chips or beer but that's still better than 0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s easy to find reasons to talk yourself out of action. Maybe you’ll get burned out, maybe you won’t. But if you never try you’ll never know. And you’ll definitely miss out on something special&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You'll need to get over the idea of this being a shared load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every community has one or two people that are "the engine" and constantly keep people reconnecting. Has nothing to do with social media, or Covid - it's always been the case as far as I can think back (and that's the early 80's)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, you can push and prod people to occasionally host, but that's also a ton of work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eh, I don't think EVERYONE is struggling with this. I am an introvert, and have no desire to go out and do more things with friends. I get enough socialization with my wife and kids, and don't really have the desire to do more things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately a lot of these require either an existing network or high stakes interaction (sending invites, accepting invites etc). They're good advise, but can be hard to execute on for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we want to solve this at the society or community level, there needs to be more opportunities for low stakes interaction. Places that people can passively gather around a communal activity. I'm reminded of the ladies dancing together in public squares / parks in China. They're usually a group, but mostly anyone can join in. You can just follow along and interact as much as you'd like. If you want to leave, leave. If you want to stay and chat, stay and chat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Downtown San Mateo for example has the potential for this. It's already a closed off street where people go. But today there aren't group activities there that encourages passive interaction, people are still in silos. Perhaps if there were some games / puzzles, chalk boards, townhall type of table setup, that'll encourage passive interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Be the organizer" assumes a certain baseline of energy, confidence, and emotional resilience. For people who are already lonely, depressed, neurodivergent, burned out, or socially anxious, that constant reaching out + rejection tax can be genuinely exhausting, not just uncomfortable&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what you're saying is you basically have to give. This is what I find real life is like. Unless I'm giving something, like a ride to some interesting place, people are not interested in me at all. They just want to get something from me, that's it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of people are more comfortable with a shared experience objective. This provides a means to do something and a reason behind meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are always in the mindset that you are giving and everyone else is taking that can really impact how you perceive everyone. And 9/10 most people over estimate how much they give and under-estimate how much they take.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also something powerful with "I _get_ to take my new friend to a place I find cool" rather than "My new friend is using me to go to my cool place". Changing the way you internally frame things drastically helps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know it sounds absolutely stupid hogwash but it helps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many years ago I read the classic 'How to win friends and influence people' and I was just hit with, according to that book, how little people actually care about other people and how fundamentally lonely our existence is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think that was the message the book was trying to give, but that's what I got out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So yes, people will wonder, subconsciously or not, what's in it for them. If you can give status or if you are naturally entertaining, this might all seem a little less obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure, but this only works as advice for people who you can talk to, such as me. I'm not trying to solve my loneliness, my own personal goal is to find ways to reach out to people who sit alone all day, and are dying from loneliness, and the only way to reach them is to catch them as they walk on the way to the grocery store, and hold up a sign that they can read. The question in my mind is, what next? So far, I've only been doing surveys[1], but I'm looking for the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Piggybacking off your suggestion, I like the idea of holding up a sign advertising a free activity that anyone can join, located in a very public space, with zero committment, so they can both show up and walk away at the drop of a hat. Whether it's an ad hoc organized chess tournament, or D&amp;amp;D game, or "one word story" or literally anything. That will have to wait until nicer weather, though, to avoid having to rent a place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can reach people you otherwise might not have by inviting your neighbours around for coffee and cake one weekend morning? Even if you have nothing in common it starts building a community of people who live in proximity to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your instructions to comment on your blog are incredible, come talk to you face to face. If I didn't live on the other side of the country it would be meaningful to tell you what it meant to me in person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agree but the flaking culture is too normalized right now, at least in the west. Nothing is more demotivating than majority of people just not coming and doing it in such a non-chalant manner. It's really not fun to put all that work and people don't take the invitation seriously to the point where they jusut ghost the event.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This annoys me: at least say you're not going to make it. I don't expect you always to be free or even want to attend, but how hard is it to say 'Thanks but I can't come.'?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You have to be the one who creates things to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You have to do it on a regular cadence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've posted about this before, but my wife and I sort of accidentally started a trivia team that's been going strong for like four years. Nearly every single week for four years, we get together with some subset of about 15 people. Most the regulars are there most days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also started cold plunging and have been doing it with the same regularity as trivia -- nearly every single week. It's a much smaller group, but it is absolutely part of our routine. Rain or shine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both these things have given several of us some really great friend time that makes that loneliness fade away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personal solutions to systemic problems are not solutions. Yours is great advice for the few people able to take it to heart, find the motivation, and succeed, but you cannot solve societal problems at any kind of scale this way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is excellent advice. How do we amplify this advice to more areas? I practice that by being intentional about my work: I think about all the opportunities I have to meet people and how I can give back to them. I call that slow multicast. I have a startup in my incubator that I call .find . I am a looking for a founder. I love how you explained it simply, clearly. I would love to have you in my "combat loneliness" team My ingredients: - walk the walk - Multicast - Seed - Tie to your bucket lists as growth engine (virtuous cycle)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would love to further the combat, please reach out to me Joseph de Castelnau on IG and X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been trying to do this. One thing I've observed is trying to arrange people to play board games is quite difficult because you can't predict how many people will show up. People get sick, misread the times, etc. And a lot of games are very sensitive to player count, so having 2 people too few or too many has the ability to make the game somewhat unplayable or risk people sitting out watching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Easier to just host a party or meetup where you can over invite and if some people don't show up it's no issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A friend of mine has this problem with their D&amp;amp;D campaigns. He makes huge efforts and there’s always one or two people who flake or don’t have the same commitment level. He’s gotten quite angry and sad about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He is trying something different now, to make a hybrid campaign where there’s a lot of one-shots in a broader story arc. It’s structured like missions in an ongoing struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe if you want to do board games, we need more games that scale up and down easily. I’m not a board game person, IDK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tell your friend to look up the Western Reaches style of play. One of the core ideas is that you begin and end each session in a safe zone so that you can have a rotating pool of adventurers. You can tuck in some rules for having mercenaries for when you have fewer than the encounters are balanced for and you’re off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It does reduce the possibility of highly on rails campaigns and instead requires more of a sandbox plan with one page dungeons and stuff. Even so, it seems made to solve this exact problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Tell your friend to look up the Western Reaches style of play.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The playstyle is called West Marches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IMHO, the important bit of this style isn't so much the player pool flexibility (tho it does help that case), but the inversion of who's driving the story. The DM prepares the world, but it's up to the players to organize their excursions outside of the safe zone, for their own reasons. This forces more involvement of the players in the story, instead of the more passive campaign on rails you mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in the GP's case of flaky low-effort players, West Marches style may not help because it puts more burden on the players in addition to just showing up and having everything presented to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, if the group can manage to do it, player engagement should be higher, and the DM suffers less disappointment because they're only prepping a session of content based on the players' plans for that session, not a long storyline that requires more alignment and adherence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;D&amp;amp;D has too many rules. I invented a really light weight set of rules so that we can engage in more "role play" as opposed to RTS. It's more fun for the casual game and you don't waste so much time between turns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our D&amp;amp;D group meets once to twice a month and is about seven or eight people. That's large enough that at most two of us can not show up and we're still enough to play and enjoy ourselves. The DM writes session recaps and posts them the day before the next session. The overhead here is minimized by his taking notes during the session. This has kept our group going for something like three or four years now!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The one thing about D&amp;amp;D is that I know almost everyone there exclusively through the campaign, and 90% of my interactions with them have been in character, which means I actually know very little about their personal lives. We're getting better with this with non-D&amp;amp;D hangs though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is possible I would assume. I just don't have that many games or enough table space to be super flexible. I'm thinking board games work easiest when the people are already in the same space and need something to do, rather than trying to arrange them to come just for the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Space base works well for this for up to eight people with the expansion. I have a friend with a very tiny apartment we have done that in, and while others are buying cards you can enjoy conversation. I used to host a lot when I was able to keep a dedicated hosting area at the one house, but recently not as much unless it's outdoors mainly. If you have a grill you can let people know to bring what they want to grill, and popcorn and some seasoning makes an affordable snack, and if you project a movie somewhere people can disconnect if needed. But yes, I usually use my social energy with family in the area now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, but it's frustrating that it's on the organizer to give everyone both something fun to do and the flexibility to flake. It feels like such thankless work to work so hard and get so little commitment back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a fairly reliable friend group, but sometimes stuff just happens. One game we had someone get sick, and another person's car broke down. That's just life and it happens, but the game was very disrupted. Would be easier to pick activities that are more flexible to the number of people participating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a group of people who play boardgames in a turned based fashion over at boardgamearena. This solves the flakiness issue. The lack of direct social interaction is then made slightly better by having a chat channel where we chat about ongoing games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've been having ongoing games (around 2 going at every one time) since about a year now I think.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still do in person games as well, but this at least keeps that group going through in-perwon drought periods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As someone who has tried to host events for specific board games, I completely agree. Most games I play are best with 3 to 4, and I will flat out refuse to play them with more than 5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, I host meetups which typically get 8-15 people and multiple games, so an unpredictable player count is not an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a thing that's always surprised me when I've been in the US. How common it is to enthusiastically arrange to do some activity together, get a meal, play a game, have a drink, whatever, and then for people to just call it off at the last minute. It seems much more socially acceptable to do so than either the UK (where I live) or France (where I have lived and still visit regularly).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The loneliness thing seems common across Europe too though so I'm not suggesting this is the root of the problem. But I do think that whilst this is a global problem the solutions are likely to be local, working with and leveraging different cultural norms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think your comment about social acceptance in the UK is slightly off. It's person dependent. I would say my experience aligns closer with the 50% mark. It's a massive variant from person to person. I have friends that will turn up to anything, rain or shine, sickness or in health. Equally, I know people that would flake on a wedding because they stubbed their toe or the latest season of [insert meaningless reality show] came out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that's the whole issue. Who am I supposed to reach out to? The 2 people at work I occasionally talk to because they happen to sit in the same office as me?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those two people might be a start, and it's a low barrier to their participation to say you want to try a nearby cafe for lunch tomorrow if they're interested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Longer term: make opportunities to occasionally talk to other people. Join a club, join a fitness group of some kind, take a class at your local library. It's got be something in person with enough repetition with the same people that everyone involved can overcome inertia enough to talk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try to say 'yes' should an occasional contact invite you to something, because it's pretty common that you won't get asked a second time if you pass on the first - I assume that's because we're all scared stiff that no-one likes us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I need to take a heaping spoonful of my own advice here, but: yeah, kind of yes. You don't have to think of them as the people you've been searching all your life for, but to meet people, you need a source of people to draw from. Those two people you talk to on a semi-regular basis are entry nodes into the social network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, I realized recently you have to be more intentional for things you want. You don’t necessarily have to host it but you need to reach out and find things going on where there are people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wow. This is so true. My social life has improved hugely in the last couple of years and it's almost all because of this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I host board game days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I organise a pub trivia team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I organise singalong nights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I host occasional parties. Soup nights. Zucchini parties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I set up a lot of group chats and keep them alive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I organise to visit my family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a lot of events, I get a 5-10% attendance rate compared to the number of people I invite. People are busy. It just means I need to keep expanding the circles of people to invite. If people don't want to come it eventually becomes clear and I quietly remove them from the lists. But mostly I hear the opposite - they really want to keep being invited, even if they don't make it often.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can minimize that though - just give the event a regular schedule or have some way to easily inform all participants of the next date. If people stop showing up without individual nagging then maybe they weren't all that interested in that activity and that's OK too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Join an organization. For example every city has Toastmasters, most have several. Easy to find, and it is an excellent place to meet people. And you'll learn how to convert social anxiety into social adrenaline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you have a faith? Actually go to church instead of just believing. Are you non-religious? Several strands of Buddhism can be followed as philosophy and practice without adopting any mystical beliefs. Vipassanā (also called Insight) and Zen are a couple of examples.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And how do you turn random people that you met into life-long friends? You can reduce the time investment by a lot. If you call someone on a spaced repetition schedule, you can make them internalize that the door is always open. Without requiring a large commitment on either side. And a spaced repetition schedule is easy to achieve - just think Fibonacci. I'll call you back in 3 days. Then 5. Then 8 (round down to a week). And so on. It feels like a lot of calls at the start. But it slows down fast. Over a lifetime, it is only around 20 calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Play around with it. If it was someone you met and hung out with on a cruise, maybe start at a week for that first call. Either way, you're reinforcing the idea that we like to talk, and the door is always open.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use a similar idea to keep people who move on from your workplace in your life. People always mean to stay in contact. Then don't. But with structured reinforcement, you can actually make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A spaced repetition schedule for speedrunning the friend-making process?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it works, it works, I guess. And in a thread about loneliness, that’s all that matters. But it seems a bit calculated rather than organic, which is what we think of as the platonic ideal of friendmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of it as an intentional way to turn a spark of connection into long-lasting coals. It can't work without that initial desire on both sides to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, you also can't have an attachment to what you want the outcomes to be. You can't expect the same in return from everyone else. Until you let go of this transactional mindset, you will grow resentful when a lot of them start canceling on you, and believe me, at your 30s and above, with all these things that compete for our time, they will.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; you are going to get well under a 50% success rate here. Accept that most people flake&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is true, but as long as the success rate is &amp;gt;= 1 other person, it's okay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started a running club for my apartment block (about 200 flats with maybe 300 residents). I posted flyers out once advertising it as a friendly social running club. Of the 300, the group has about 15 people, of which 5 are regulars (every other week at least), and just 2 of us are super regulars (multiple times per week). It's a terrible success rate, but those are 4/5 good friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first it bothered me how flaky people were. Some people joined the group but have yet to show up in person. And some joined the group and are yet to even converse in the group chat, but hey, they'll come along when they're ready.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree with this so much! I've found that going to people and initiating is the only thing you can do. How people respond varies a lot and you have to be resilient to rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a post[1] sometime back about just having coffee in the afternoon outisdes and how that brought in more people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think I saw this quote somewhere else on HN about a post lamenting how difficult it can be to make new friends after age 30 or so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding new friends as an adult can be exceedingly difficult, but becoming a friend to someone is surprisingly easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lots of people (and if I'm being honest I'm one of them, so no judgement) just sort of expect friendships to come to them. But if you actually do the hard (and somewhat socially risky) work of inviting people to do things, offering to help unsolicited, organizing gatherings, etc. new friendships are much easier to come by.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great point and many of the responses are very interesting too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder whether part of this is a habitualization of intolerance for just being with oneself - to be ok with feeling bored, for instance. Most suggestions are about "doing". Just being with oneself without a doing is painful for many from what I've seen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it's what that intolerance leads to which is a big part of the problem. It's natural that we don't like being bored, but these days we have infinite means to keep boredom away that don't involve connecting with others. Why go through the risks and awkwardness of opening yourself up to others when you have a device of infinite rabbit holes and time sinks in your pocket at all times? 40 years ago it was very possible to run out of entertainment, which is quite different today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;people are so fucked up by consumerism that they expect to be just consumers also in their sociality... like they expect that social relations to be like commodities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;in consumer societies people flee real freedom's anxiety by conforming to market ways, treating connections as consumption not production. lasting bonds need effort patience vulnerability, all anti-consumer virtues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fromm said that in market societies love and relations follow the commodity and labor market exchange pattern. they want low-effort replaceable humans. So they became low-effort replaceable humans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm just going to be a "me too" but I think you nailed it. It's just hard for some people to do. It's sort of like losing weight: the formula is easy, but the doing is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only do you need to create the things to do, but you need to pick up the phone and CALL them (on the telephone! not voicemail, not whatsapp/facetime) and have a conversation with them. Sometime in 2006-2008 we started sending people online invites to parties and the habit of calling people died out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you call 12 people, on the telephone, and invite them for a dinner party next weekend, and 12 people say yes, I give 90% odds that 12 people show up to your party&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see young people facetiming each other all the time, maybe a little too much. It definitely fills the same role as audio calls used to. But I just text. I remember when texting started to become a thing, and I was very much looking forward to the absolute convenience of being able to read and respond whatever I had time, and not have to deal with a phone call. I wonder if that was common in my generation (millenials), and I wonder if we call/facetime significantly less and text more than other generations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Texting is for sure more convenient but you lose the "watercooler" effect, you're not going to text them "how's your mom doing?" when inviting them over for D&amp;amp;D via text&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;huh, as a 50something saying yes to a text message is absolutely a firm commitment. if anything, is firmer than doing it over voice, because now you have both put something in writing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Note: you are going to get well under a 50% success rate here. Accept that most people flake. It may always feel painful (and nerds like us often are rejection-sensitive). You have to feel your feelings, accept it, and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most importantly, you have to hear “I can’t” and be really cool about it or folks will half commit out of guilt and bail. They probably have a good reason, especially if they have kids. Or maybe they’re just exhausted! That is valid - you will sometimes feel that way too, and you should clearly (but politely) communicate it when you need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you consistently say yes/no and adhere to it, people will return the favor and you’ll all be better for it. My social life vastly improved post COVID when I adhered to that. My friends and I are incredibly honest so now folks rarely bail (always for good reason) and we all can reliably plan to hang out without guessing if someone actually means “no” when they say maybe and all that nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The advice “create things to do” is a huge leap for someone with atrophied social skills. Even just attending an event is a terrifying prospect to someone with debilitating social anxiety or low self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, a better goal is to become comfortable talking to strangers. If you could do that confidently, anything is possible socially.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a framework to do that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Adopt a useful attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before any social situation, consciously choose an attitude that serves you socially: calm, relaxed, enthusiastic, curious, friendly, or simply open. This replaces the useless defaults that keep you stuck: reticent, scared, angry, confused.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assume people will like you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Set an intention for the interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Decide on one small goal for the interaction. Not “be charming” or “make friends,” rather something achievable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example intentions, ranked from easier to more difficult: - To appear friendly (smile, make eye contact) - To greet people - To find out what’s going on around town - To enjoy talking with people - To meet people - To make someone smile - To enjoy getting to know someone - To make someone laugh - To get someone’s contact info - To flirt - To talk to the most attractive person in the room&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Find comfort in your body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you arrive at a social space, take a deep breath. Know that you’re safe inhabiting your body, no matter what anyone thinks of you or says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Set your expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paralyzed about what to say? Set the bar low. Say your words and expect nothing in return. Confidence in delivering your words will grow. Confidence in social acceptance will follow as you see people respond neutrally and positively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might be talking to a grumpy person. It’s okay if you don’t get the response you’d hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. Start impossibly small.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re severely out of practice (nervous, anxious, uncertain), set out to initiate an interaction with someone where you accomplish just one objective. Then stop and celebrate that win. Don’t try to combine all of these into one interaction—you will get overwhelmed. Then initiate another interaction on another day and accomplish another objective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Objective: Say “hello.” If you tend to be quiet, focus on being heard. Find confidence in your voice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Objective: Say the first thing that comes to mind and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Objective: Notice something about a person and comment on it. “Nice shoes!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Objective: Notice something about the environment and comment on it to someone nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Objective: Ask someone a question for information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Objective: Ask someone their opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Objective: Ask a question that invites an emotional response rather than a factual one. “What do you love about living here?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Objective: Join a circle of people in conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;6. Make it a habit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start today: say one thing to one person. Repeat tomorrow. Then the next day. Within about a week, it becomes second nature. The scariness diminishes. Soon, you’ll actually want to talk to people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you learn to talk to strangers, you’re more than halfway to making a friend. Friends will help keep you out of loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm terrible at this because I just can't handle extended lulls in conversations with anyone who isn't a close friend. As a result, I talk too much and that's the end of building a friendship. Sigh...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;D&amp;amp;D is extraordinarily difficult to bootstrap. You ened 4-8 people to commit to being at a certain place at a certain time. If you play online instead, just the coordinated time alone is a monumental effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a ton of reasons for this. Work, school, coordinating plans with their partner, other commitments , other friends and family and honestly people just being flaky. For D&amp;amp;D this can be particularly bad if you're missing a couple of people who just flaked. Other activities don't have that problem and it can still be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a time when going out and doing things was necessary for social interaction. That's not true anymore. Online is sorta social. It's kinda close enough to scratch that itch for many, particularly because it has none of the coordination and/or travel issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But also people just have less free time. Because we have to work so much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hobbies in general have becom ea luxury. By that I mean you're spending your time doing something that doesn't earn an income. That's good but an increasingly large number of people don't have that as an option, hence "luxury".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Put another way, the ultimate goal of capitalism is to have all the worker bees constantly creating wealth so Bezos can have $210 billion instead of $215 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; and nerds like us often are rejection-sensitive As opposed to non-nerds of course, who are famously fine with rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all seriousness, there is no evidence to suggest that being a nerd (read: having nerdy interests) is related to being more emotionally stunted than the average person. You're just perpetuating a bad stereotype.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I‘m a cofounder of a German loneliness startup. My core insight is that loneliness often stems from a badly adjusted internal social threat function ( f(social event)=perceived threat ).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This function runs subconsciously all day long. From talking to strangers to reaching out to a friend, the lonely mind is much more aware of negative outcomes, so your mind protects you by telling you things like „I don’t talk to strangers because I would annoy them“ or „I don’t reach out to that friend because he’s probably busy“. And that makes it much much harder for lonely people to maintain a healthy social life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for the fix, you can try to set the social event up in a way that has less room for perceived threat. Think of third places, regularly scheduled meetings, etc. Or you can work on the function itself (=your thinking patterns). If you look at research on loneliness interventions, working on this function is the most effective way to help individuals overcome persistent loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now the sad thing is that people don’t like to hear that the most effective way to combat loneliness is to work on their own perceptions, which makes the sales pitch rather challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; So they sit on social media all day when they're not at work or school. How can we solve this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The naive solution is to place blame on the people who are influenced by the most advanced behavior modification schemes ever devised by humans. Kinda like how the plastic producers will push recycling, knowing they can shift blame for the pollution away from their production of the pollution, because people love blaming. You'll see commenters here telling us that the answer is for people to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, get out, get involved in their communities under their own willpower. These ideas are doomed from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real solution is already being enacted in a number of US states and countries[1]: legally restricting access to the poison, rather than blaming the people who are at the mercy of finely honed instruments of behavior modification when they're unable to stop drinking it under their own willpower.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't see how the control and enforcement of "social media age verification" solves for the "people who are unable to stop... under their own willpower." My grandparents are more addicted to the phone than I am. Taking the superlative stance of social media being the "most advanced behavior modification schemes ever devised by humans" wouldn't the correct regulation be some sort of threshold of consumption (screen time limits per application), or rehabilitation for those that have crossed a line into psychological addiction? I imagine the easiest, assuming you see "the algorithm" as the problem, would be to ban selective algorithms and force timeline-based feeds or the like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Laws and regulations are also ”advanced behaviour modification”. That is how they work. Tobacco is clear example of this, almost everybody used to smoke back in the 90’s and 00’s (including me) whereas after years of laws regulatios, taxation, public education, and providing healthcare for addiction, we are at the point where smokin makes you a loser rather than some cool Marlboro dude/dudette. There is very little society can do for grandparents addicted to fb, but we can prevent the same happening to the future elderly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limiting at which age you can use the product is just one part of the puzzle. You could also hit a big tax on ad revenue gained via social media to veer people off from ruining their brains. There is a host of others tools as well and I think we will see them implemented more and more. The tech billionaires fight back and rather fund a fascist dictator to power than lose a single cent, but there you go. But I think the Musk’s and the like have constantly stepped over boundaries to the extent that the tide has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problems occurred when online interaction got mediated by corporations with profit motives that use dark patterns, automated systems and algorithms to extract more revenue from its users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of my real-life friends are people I've first met online, or as a consequence of having met someone online. Those online sites have mostly been run by enthusiasts, driven by some hobby, fandom or other interest. A couple of them have risen highly in popularity and attracted many thousands of users, and also served news and allowed vendors to use their site for interactions with customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those communities that have thrived have made sure that discourse does not get poisoned. They have had active, strong but fair moderators. Many have strict rules against discussing politics or religion, but people have a need to discuss that too sometimes — and being identifiable e.g. between subreddits could put people off from doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, where do you draw the line to what is an online community and what is "social media"? I've avoided Facebook and X-twitter, but I know genuine communities exist there too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the “real solution” wouldn’t involve isolating children in already marginalised minorities, making them lose one of the only sources of community they feel safe in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking something away by force is not the way to encourage someone to do something else. This is carrot or stick mentality. The city added benches and chairs in all the parks to improve the quality of our third spaces, as an example of social infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am in North Seattle, and I have a flock of nerds under me that would like to see real demonstrations of penetration testing via radio (Wifi and more). I have been proposing doing monthly meetups where we go up on a the rooftop of various buildings, bust out the tools, the antennas, and every other toy we have to scan and show how it's done. There are stories about others and me that the younger generation would love to see in action and then we teach what is going on, how we are doing it, and more importantly, when we find a vulnerable target, offer help to fix the hole. Kind of like white hat pen testing. So many of the younger generation wants to exploit things, but do not understand the ethics as to why and why not, and how to do good with having those sort of skills. I know this might be slightly off topic, but I think the real answer to the question here is who is willing to take the lead and step out of the normal club, party, con, meetup crap and get back to the old school groups like we had back in the 90s?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems a lot of you are in Seattle and I'm willing to try and host an event like this if any of you might be interested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think this is quite an interesting question. Especially for the developer audience. If you're an engineer, then you likely have similar tendencies to a lot of other engineers. You want to spend time alone, but you also feel the need to combat this loneliness, isolation and depression that it leads to. You want to connect, but struggle to do so. The internet, software, reddit and other places became a safe haven, but then they perpetuated what was hindering you in the first place. I say these things because I'm that person. I lost decades to this sort of escapism that comes from an online world. Unfortunately the answers rarely work for us at the time we're going through this. It's rare for someone to just break out of the cycle. Something has to change, but it's a change that comes from deep within yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have to reflect on the why. Why am I here, why am I in this situation. And often it's that deeper internal reflection that starts to motivate something, change something. Listen, I lost decades. And I still struggle. But no one else can solve this for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of the loneliness epidemic itself. You have to split it into many separate categories. Isolation comes in many forms. For the online generation, who grew up with the internet, we are specific category. But I'll tell you, the path to fixing it has more to do with understanding why we are here than filling the time with arbitrary activities or socialising. Yes we need human connnection and yes we should explore, learn and grow. But fundamentally the first question we should be asking, why am I here, what is my purpose, now what should I do with that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my case, I did find talking to someone helped, but only after coming to the realisation that I needed to talk to someone and then proactively seeking it out. As much as we want to solve the problem for many people, they have to walk a path before they can see the truth. We can offer alternatives, but people will only find what they're looking for when they're ready.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't have a full answer, but a couple thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Volunteer. Somewhere, anywhere, for a good cause, for a selfish cause. Somebody will be happy to see you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Stop trolling ourselves. As far as I can tell, all of the mass social media is trending sharply towards being a 100% troll mill. The things people say on social media do not reflect genuine beliefs of any significant percentage of the population, but if we continue to use social media this way, it will.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disengage from all of the trolls, including and especially the ones on your "own side".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; the mass social media is trending sharply towards being a 100% troll mill&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree. It's one reason I still come to HN and it's one of the few places I bother to comment (and the only place with more than a few dozen users). The moderation and community culture against trolling makes it a generally positive experience. I do still need breaks sometimes, though, for a few months at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd love an online community where everyone was having discussions only in good faith. Zero trolling. I can dream.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure. Outside already satisfies good faith discussion. There is nothing gained in duplicating the exact same thing online. Use the right tool for the job, as they say. Online discussion is a compelling in its own right because you can stop being you and take on someone else's persona to try and discuss from their vantage point. This gives opportunity to understand another side of the story in an environment that provides the necessary feedback to validate that you actually understand another side. Too often people think they understand other angles, but one will also want validation, which online discussion provides. More often than not you'll realize that you actually didn't understand it at all, so it is a valuable exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for explaining your position. I don't know if I would have described that as bad faith, more like good-faith-in-disguise, but I understand what you are getting at.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would also argue that even people who I like a lot and have known for many years can be very different "people" online than in person. It's sometimes shocking the dichotomy. I try to remind myself and others to ignore some of the online weirdness and focus on the in person interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is so tough, though, because the things happening in the world really, genuinely, do matter and its very hard to realize that our passive emotional reaction to them is not meaningful, probably actively bad for us. If I could snap my fingers and do one thing, I'd obliterate social media from the face of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whatever else you think of Bluesky, it's a place where trolling and doomerism are rejected. The nuclear block (and a culture of block, don't engage) does wonders for denying actual trolls an audience, and secondarily for permitting people to do the virtual equivalent of walking away from someone who's behaving badly. In particular, doomerism about Trump is minimized there the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a fine line between "rejecting doomerism" and "putting your fingers in your ears and going 'lalala'" though, and it's important not to cross it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes I can't help but wonder if we're just shooting the messenger in placing the blame on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bluesky is full of people angry and screaming about Trump. In my feed, at least, though, the "it's all fascism, we're doomed" posters are getting blocked. It's an angry call to action that survives. They're consciously recognizing the pessimism is counterproductive and blocking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solitude is not the same as loneliness. A person can feel lonely surrounded by others. Like being the only non-drinker in a family Christmas celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loneliness is when there is a gap between desire for companionship/connection and reality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've done both extended periods of home office and a period of co-working in an open plan space. I didn't feel lonely in the home office. I guess because I did it by choice and had the agency to opt into joining a co-working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that loneliness could be a symptom of lack of connection. And this need for connection can in some cases be fulfilled online or even through reading books. Participating in forums like hackernews or effect-ts satisfies some of the handful facets of connection that I need. It gives me a feeling of not being totally alone with some of my ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've had a great time at board game meetups. I highly recommend finding a group of people who play modern board games once a week. There should be at least one in most towns or cities. It can take a while to find the right group, but once you do, you can make some lifelong friends just by turning up every week. I've had some great experiences and a few not as great ones around the world and at various times. My favorites ones always involve food and alcohol in a nice bar or pub, usually starting with some casual or social deduction games. I now have a pretty huge collection of board games. I just moved to a new town though and it's pretty small so I need to be a bit more proactive. Haven't played a lot recently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confession... I don't actually like board games all that much, and I don't really care if I win. Some of the games are really cool but I just love hanging out and having fun with a group of people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I usually do night walks, talking to strangers, outcasts such as homeless people, street children, store or restaurant sales persons. I treat them food and talk with them and learn from their stories, I do this consistently that they know me. I genuinely love helping people, I also do ministries which I can say is very effective on helping people with depressions, they will learn to have a purpose in life or at least they will learn that some people are living life with much difficulty. I organize people I do not know and play sports I do not know how to play, and ask people to join. We do monthly activities which is optional for others to join our not. Nothing is forced but every one is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do think it's worth separating two things, though. Helping others and building community can be deeply meaningful, but not everyone who's lonely has the capacity&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I once shard a flat/apartment with a female social butterfly. She once gave me some great advice, which is to NEVER turn down an invitation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Going out and trying to be comfortable in non-ideal situations (i.e. you know hardly anyone there) is a skill you can learn. I often think it's probably like sales cold calling. After a while you develop calluses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A social circle is like a garden, inasmuch as you have to put in work to tend and maintain it. You have to put yourself in a position of potential awkwardness or rejection, which isn't easy. Interacting with people (especially strangers) also takes practice - small talk is a skill like any other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you already have a friendship circle, start being the one to propose meetups (cafe, pub, picnic, hike, etc.) If you don't, it's harder - join a social sporting league, group fitness class, dance class, DnD group, anything where people have to talk with each other. When you arrive, turn your phone off for the interval. It might take a couple of goes to find something that sticks or the right environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that the real trick of "solving" the loneliness epidemic is that it isn't spread evenly. Everyone has their own individual level of opportunity for social interaction, so the solution is hyper-local and individualised. There's no one size fits all solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built an art practice after volunteering on Burning Man projects for a few years. I’m now a competent art fabricator and engineer in carpentry, lighting, electronics, and power systems. It’s fun, and it keeps me connected to lots of different communities. You meet a lot of people who like to get together and nerd out, host parties, and make cool things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When people talk about the loneliness epidemic, I realize how lucky I am to be in community with people who want to get together to do cool things just for fun. I know these kinds of art communities also exist in places outside the Bay Area, and it seems like a good model for creating excuses for people to gather anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Get a hobby and find the others” seems like its too simple to be the answer here, but that’s what it is for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think there's a lot of good advice in these comments already, at least for individuals to think about for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I happen to have discovered a fantastic contra dancing community[1] in Chicago that could be great for some who are lonely. You have to chalk up the courage to go (if you aren't used to trying new things, or dancing), but everyone is extremely welcoming, the dancing is easy even for people "with two left feet", and the happiness going around is truly contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it's a terrific place to find community. It's a social dance where you'll basically dance with everyone by the end of the evening. There's time before, in the middle (snack intermission), and at the end for striking some conversation. The dancing is every Monday so it's routine. The crowd (100-150 people on average) is diverse in many ways (at least in age, gender, income, interests) so you're bound to find people with commonalities that, using some of the other advice in these comments, you could try to hang out with outside of the dancing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As far as getting people to feel like they can join, I'm not the expert, but I've had such a great experience that I'm happy to at least bring it up and "spread the good word".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For outside of Chicago: contra dancing is a bit niche, but a surprising amount of large-ish US cities have it. I think it's more popular (relatively) on the East coast. Can't speak for outside of the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not for everyone but if you can, get a dog. Dogs are icebreakers. People like to meet a cute dog. They won't know your name at first but you will be "Fido's Dad" or "Dave's Mom". Other dog owners will greet you and so long as your dogs don't hate each other you already have something in common.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A dog gives you a reason to be wherever you want to be - take a walk around the neighborhood or to the park. You're not a rando taking a walk for mysterious and possible nefarious purposes, you're walking the dog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for for goodness sake, pick up after the pooch. If you can wipe your own arse you can pick up a dog turd with a plastic bag.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, I've had a lot of people in my life recede after getting pets. They're an excellent excuse to say no to things that you might otherwise do, because you need to get home and take care of the pet or you can't find a sitter to go on a trip etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not generalizing to all people, but I think for some a pet can reinforce anti-social tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dogs are a bit like having kids, if you embrace it. They make it tougher to do extended trips (e.g. foreign countries), but you can develop an entire social network through them. Doing dog-related trips is a new world of opportunities. I did a three night stay across the state with a bunch of my dog park friends a few years ago. Hikes with the dogs during the day, beer and board games every evening.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have an older neighbor who just absolutely loves dogs. He sits by his window all day long and runs outside every time a dog comes by to give them a treat. On hot days he has bowls filled with ice water and a kiddy pool for them to splash in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I lived here almost 6 years before doing much more than a smile and nod to him, but my next door neighbors with a dog befriended him almost as soon as they moved in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It wasn't until our son started walking and would stop and try and play in the dog water that we ever really talked to him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that's like befriending others through the kids. Those usually are very shallow relationships. If they suddenly stop seeing you they wouldn't even check if you are OK or what happened. I guess it's better than nothing but that's not for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having many shallow relationships is the first (well, second) step towards having a few deeper ones. You can't befriend people you never meet, and people find it extremely offputting for someone they don't know to immediately try to be their best friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plenty of my former coworkers have evolved into lifelong substantial friendships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What started with smalltalk evolved into conversations over lunch which then afforded after work socializing which then led to actively scheduling time for shared interests. All of those provided ample opportunity to learn almost everything about that person and open the door to a deep friendship when mutually desired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have you never made a deep friendship? How else would anybody make deep friendships? First you do things that let you meet people, then you make acquaintances, then you make setting-specific friends (work friends, gym buddies, etc), then you start inviting/being invited to do things that aren't based around that shared setting, and then you have friendships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Either that or your definition of deep friendship is substantially off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of my deep friendships were through friends and family. A handful at work/school. And it is the same way for most people I know. But I'm not American, so that's that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Making friends through work and school are pretty much exactly what I described. You go to a place with people, you meet a lot of people, and some of the shallow acquaintances end up becoming long term friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can be any other activity that requires more than one person. For example I started going to dance classes with my partner in november and what was just awkward "hello there" interactions before the holidays when we had to swap dance partners is now a bit more comfortable and we exchange a bit much and even have a chit chat after class at the door. It is waaaaaay too early to know if it will create new long term friends but the dynamic is here and after just a few weeks I can already spot the people I have absolutely no wish to know more about and those that I feel natural chatting with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really? Growing up almost all of my parents best friends were the parents of my best friends. This is a common story among my current group of friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You seem extremely judgemental and narrow in your view of the world. This is probably why you have difficulty forming deep friendships without the social proof of family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a counter example, I've made some of the best friends of my life through walking my dog at the local dog park over the last decade. Seeing how people are dedicated to and treat their dogs gives me a great insight into their personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was addicted to weed from ages 15-23. I have clinical depression and anxiety/OCD (now medicated and stable). I basically isolated and got stuck in a loop of believing I was broken and a bad person. When I committed to quitting I joined addiction recovery groups and asked for help instead of trying to do it alone. I still rely on the wisdom I gained in AA/MA. Trust God, clean house, help others, go do something when you are in danger of wallowing in self pity. 4 years later, I have a few real friends and many acquaintances. I swing dance and volunteer. I work in a semi-social office. Life is good. I still get paranoid thoughts, but they don't own or define me. I wish the best to all the lonely programmers and alienated people out there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m loving the comments here. But I confess I exoected a ‘social technology’ solution to the problem!! Like “casserole” in the UK, which connects people in a neighbourhood with others who need food and a visit. You make a casserole and take it round. I’ve not seen this in person but it seems like a great application of tech to help ward off loneliness… You could easily extend this to “dog friends” or “cat friends”, where you’re connected with someone who’d like you to visit them and bring your dog or cat for an introduction and a pat&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i like loneliness. in my teens i could not encourage my friends to travel so i went on my own and was happy. in my twenties i would comfortably break up my relationships if i knew i could be happier alone. i have worked overseas for extended periods alone. i am old now but i am happy alone. i enjoy my huge garden alone. i avoid crowds. I online shop instead of travelling to a store if i can. I just have no connection to people around me anymore and i have been able to recognise this need in me and encourage myself to follow my own understanding of a happy life. I have no real regrets. I am in a good position financially and have nobody to really bother me. I can look ahead to the next month or two and feel happy knowing there is nothing on the horizon to displace my solitude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many answers address the question of "how to build community." I like those responses! I also want to contribute to the discussion with an emotional intelligence response. The theory is that "loneliness" can be a symptom of underlying internal factors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While it is true that loneliness can arise from a lack of community, people, and related factors, for some people, the problem stems from not knowing how to be alone. At its core, the question becomes, "Am I externalizing my world, or internalizing my world?" When you externalize your world, you require something external. We are social creatures, and I do believe we need other people. I'm only suggesting that sometimes people need to look internally first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personal anecdote: No amount of community would have helped me feel like I wasn't alone, because I needed the world around me to provide some sense of my self-worth. It felt counterintuitive, but for me, I had to learn to be alone. Only then could I feel like I wasn't alone. It all came down to attachment theory and self-worth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the replies so far are suggesting ideas for an individual but seem to be missing the real crux of the matter...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, you'll be less lonely if you join a group, get out of your house, etc... But how do we actively incentivize that? Social media and whatnot have hundreds of thousands of people working around the clock to find ways to suck you in and monopolize your time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While "everyone should recognize the problem and then take steps to solve it for themselves" is the obvious solution, it's also not practical to just have everyone collectively decide they need to get out more without SOME sort of fundamental change in our society/incentives/etc&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree with this, and I think we're partly conditioned to think this way. We (think we) can change ourselves, but we (believe we) can't change the world. I think it's OK to think bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make friends, people need a place to meet, to have time and means to be there, and a reason to go there semi-regularly. A lot of the design of society completely ignores these needs. These are solvable problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We invented Soma from Brave New World. No amount of individual action will overcome the primary cause. Getting rid of Soma is the only effective solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if you avoid Soma yourself, you will still face the negative effects of a society plagued by Soma.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s kind of the conclusion I came to. I can make changes in my life, but when everybody else is sucked in by social media and doesn’t even see the issue trying to build bridges is futile. The only person you can rely on is yourself, the sooner you can accept being alone the better. I lived in Japan for a while which is a much more solitary place than the UK. I think things in the West are going the same direction. More normalisation of solitary activities, increasing social distance, and fewer new families being started. Grim future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just because people appear to be doing more isolated things doesn’t mean it’s a ratchet that only moves in 1 direction. People adjust. When enough people feel too lonely, they will adapt and many of them will come up with a solution, likely swinging the pendulum in the other direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a ratchet though. South Korea's birth rate has been at an existential level for at least a decade and shows no sign of improving. Things won't improve while technology and tech companies are warping what it means to be human.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now there's chatter about AI companions. If they take off and substitute real relationships it's game over. Swathes of the population will bed rot because they have no incentive to go outside for anything other than work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is immediately and completely solving the problem not a good enough incentive? If you go outside and interact, you will be much less lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no barrier! You don't need to overthink this. Walkable cities third spaces etc., all great — but literally just go out and interact with people you can do it today many people do it to great success!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're completely missing the point. The problem is people aren't collectively incentivized to do so. Individually someone can decide "oh wow, I'm lonely, I should get out more", but collectively there's nothing incentivizing everyone to do it, or even notice it's an issue. If there were, we wouldn't be in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"How do we solve the obesity problem?" "Well people should just work out."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously, that would solve it, but they're distinctly not doing that, which is why we're talking about a broader solution to actually get people to work out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The problem is people aren't collectively incentivized to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, we are — please believe me that a LOT of people go out into the world and interact with each other. Doing so is extremely heavily incentivized by all of the wonderful and beautiful things that happen in the world all the time, both quotidian and sublime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is pretty spot on. It is like telling deug addicts to stop buying legal and unregulated drugs. Never gonna work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Real change will require enforced regulation on the methods and tactics social media is allowed to use. Things like notification limits, rules on gamification, feed transparency, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the states this will never happen. The corporations own the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pre-schedule it. Ideally recurring. Can be monthly. Possibly even bi-weekly. Agree on a time and do it on schedule. Pre-scheduling removes all the mental load of finding a time together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People need to purposefully and intentionally do things. Sitting home on an app, watching TV is easy. There is no fear or rejection, there is no work to get out of the house, there is no risk. But there is also no reward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My thoughts on this are you need to have multiple roots into your community. This is something that you go to often and talk to people, become a regular, say hi. Think back to how your parents or grandparents did it: They went to church/temple/synagogue, they went to PTA meetings, they talked to their neighbors, they were in clubs, they went to the same bar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I think doing things that get you out of the house, consistently the most important part:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. People need to make a point to talk to their neighbors, invite them over for dinner or bbqs, make small talk. How towns are constructed now is a hindrance to this (unwalkable towns where all of the houses are big garages in the front and no porches).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Join a religious organization. Go to church, but also join the mens/womens group, join a bible studies class. Attend every week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Join social clubs / ethnic organization. The polish or ukrainian clubs, knights of columbus, elks, freemasons. Go every week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Join a club / league. Chess club, bowling league, softball league, golf league. Tech meetups, DnD Night etc. But you have to talk with people and try to elevate things to friendships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was a computer nerd in the 2000s, I noticed people used to like to hang around and chat, but I mostly didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, everyone is an internet addict, and I was just ahead of the curve. No one hangs around and chats anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you get off social media, real life becomes far more interesting. The problem with addiction is that it's so stimulating that everything else is boring. You have to let your mind reset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree but if your goal is to socialize more, it's not enough to get off social media. You need to be in a place where enough other people do too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of a city as both a spatial and a temporal grouping of people that are in the same place at the same time. Every hour a person spends at home on social media is an hour that they aren't really in the city and are not available for you to socialize with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cumulative hours that people spend staring at their phones are effectively a massive loss of population density. That lost density makes it harder to find people even if you yourself are getting off a screen and looking for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought of this the other day. I was on the train ride back from Chicago, and there was a family of four adults, sitting across from me, all just staring at their phones. I was effectively alone at that point in time. None of them were present. But you explained it in a new way I had not thought of before. They're quite literally not there in that moment, for however long that moment lasts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I took the train from Seattle to Portland last fall. Half of the people in the observation car were on Nintendo Switches the entire time. In the observation car.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;just find a hobby that involves other people. any kind of team sport, r/c airplanes, shooting, bird watching, the options are pretty endless. You'll meet other people, make friends, and not be so lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;'Making friends' doesn't occur by just being in proximity to people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quite likely at the end of the night they'll return to their lives and you won't be invited to interact with them again until the next meeting. That's if you're not excluded from existing club cliques - I've gone to many different meetings and come away at the end feeling more alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think "meetings" are a poor (or at least, very inconsistent) way of making friends. Doing activities together is the best way of making friends. Bonus points if it's for multiple hours, or there's an element of risk where you have to look after / trust each other, or stay overnight somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Examples include clubs for walking / running / cycling / scuba clubs etc. It doesn't have to be physical activity, but since you need exercise anyway, then you might as well get those endorphins whilst socialising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're right, you have to take a risk and go introduce yourself and talk. The thing with joining hobby clubs or groups is that you immediately have something in common to talk about. If you're lucky, some groups will have a person in the group who will see someone sitting alone, and go introduce them and drag them in. But not everybody picks up on that stuff or wants to make the effort on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yes, it's normal that people don't just immediately become best friends and want to hang out with one person they just met for an hour at a meeting. Especially if that person doesn't even say hello. Sometimes it happens though! It helps a lot if you just go back a couple of times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing I love about car meets is that I can just go up to someone, ask them about their car, and tell them that I like it. You can do the same with any hobby, just go to meets where people are doing things, and not just showing up with nothing. Bring things to share, and a lot of times that brings people to you. Another thing you can do is ask for help with something. People love to help!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ham nerds are the same way. Electronics nerds are the same way. Computer geeks do the same thing too. I'm sure every hobby is the same way. Find something you like doing and it makes it a lot easier. But the point is if you don't put in any effort, nothing will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; 'Making friends' doesn't occur by just being in proximity to people. [...] Quite likely at the end of the night they'll return to their lives and you won't be invited to interact with them again until the next meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes because sharing an activity involves greetings, interactions, group laughs which break the glass before more conversations starts and making friends becomes naturally a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Friendship is something that grow, not something that gets created in all its deepness from nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I think the real cause of the loneliness epidemic is that the older generation never taught us how to socialise and make friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is false. First because most of the social learning is done by mimicking what others do and we certainly all saw our parents invite and get invited to stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plus there is school which is the #1 place where your learn to socialize and make friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; just find a hobby that involves other people... shooting,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok that one made me chuckle just from the initial reading of the wording.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't disagree though, I do competitive bullseye, and it is definitely a communal thing. Many old guys at the range in particular seem to be there for 99% talking at you, and 1% actual shooting related stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I'm going to the range for a set of three position, a 120-shot session by myself takes like 2.5 hours including setup and teardown. If there's talkative-old-guy at the range, then I'm there for 4 hours, and I don't even make it through 60 shots lol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which is fine for someone like me who is a competitive shooter but not like really trying to be the absolute best, I don't mind spending 60 minutes doing bullseye and 180 minutes chatting about whatever. The actual competitive shooters at the range though, they'll either have someone screen talkative-old-guy for them, or just otherwise make it clear that they are Serious and not to be bothered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Activity partners" are pretty easy to find. What's harder is getting them to make the transition to deeper friendship where you spend time together outside of the activity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This problem is not going to be solved by individual action. Sure there is some things you can and should do, but for it to be solved at a population scale it has to involve changing the actual structure of society that caused the problem in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tackling phone addiction and lack of public spaces is going to be critical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A big problem for me personally is that, well, frankly, there really aren't many options around me. I live in a small farming town of 6000 people, and most things are 25-45 min away *by car*.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can relate to this. I was always moderately extroverted and sociable, but the irony has never ceased to flabbergast me that the very behaviours and interests for which nerds like me would have been stuffed into lockers and garbage cans (if I had dared to tell anyone in school that I was into computers) became, only a decade later, de rigueur for every young person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I remember sitting in a coffee shop in 2003 (senior year of HS) trying to get kernel drivers for a PCMCIA 802.11b card to work on an ancient Compaq laptop, and being pointed, laughed at, and called -- by modern standards -- unconscienable names by a table of high schoolers nearby. It must have seemed so strange to them to see someone's head so deeply in a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And my goodness, I wouldn't have dared to confess that I talk to strangers in faraway places _online_. To be known to have substantive computer-based interactions would have branded one so profoundly socially unsuccessful, that one's very family name would be cursed with this prejudice for two generations. AIMing one's classmates on the family PC was one thing, but chatting online to likeminded peers in other countries? Why, that was radiantly gay!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But literally a few years later, I can't get anyone to make eye contact and they frequently plough into me because their heads are buried in their phones, texting people they never see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trust me I am in 2025 and I am in senior high school and whenever I try to talk about open source or linux or anything others. Friends have point blank said that they aren't interested in it. (only one friend showed interest/shows interests at times)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the most ironical part is that they want to become software engineers for just the money aspect but fundamentally they really don't know anything about the field or are even interested to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in a sense this still happens :) This happened so much that I had to cut off my friends because the only thing that they were interested in talking about were woman or insta shorts and very few intellectual discussion could happen (atleast with that friend group and I would consider that friend group to be more intellectual among other peers but for some reason they just never wanted to discuss intellectual topics other than some very few occasions, mostly just shitposting being honest and I didn't enjoy the shit posting aspect that much if I am being honest as well)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hah! I had a very similar thought enter mind recently. I used to get shamed for being on screens too much, now the situation seems to have flipped. Who's the nerd now??&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me tell you about real life. I’m a caregiver and leaving the home is simply not an option. Short trips to the store, a walk around the block, maybe, if it’s before sundown, provided the person I’m caring for is in the right mental state to be left alone for 45 minutes. If there were neighborhood pubs that might be a thing to do if I drank. Getting off social media is great for those lucky enough to have the option, but with an increasing number of people getting into their dementia years, many with no savings to afford respite or other forms of care, social media is going to be the only option for a lot of people like myself. It’s better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, sorry for what you're going through. Also, your situation is definitely an outlier that I can't focus my main efforts on. Maybe someone else is meant for that. But I'm curious, why not have friends over? Is anything like this possible?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip of the hat there, it’s a very selfless thing to commit to caregiving. From a 50kft view, we have an aging demographic globally, and the bet seems to be robotics- hopefully they will get good enough to help meaningfully in this capacity. What happens to an economic system predicated around having more kids (GDP growth) is another concern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We already have the ability to take care of people now. All it needs is is for someone in power to give a fuck and set up a system and fund it. The suggestion that we do nothing for 30 years so we can leave our loved ones home with a robot care taker is kind of fucking angering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The robotics thing to replace caregivers misses the point that elder people also want connection. Yeah, it might free caregivers but still we will have a loneliness epidemic. I think this is more related to the desire for progress which is the backbone of modern life (you see it politics, school, your family, etcetera). This, I believe, has been slowly replacing the social glue of societies like religion, public space, play, chatting, etcetera.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually countries don't go to war over actual principles such as these but for self-interest. That's what I was getting at. Scare quotes indicate the position of the concept within public-facing rhetoric for an Opium War style operation (which would presumably be about profit, control and so on, the usual).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Now, everyone is an internet addict, and I was just ahead of the curve. No one hangs around and chats anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of the events and spaces I go to have people who hang around and chat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree that internet use has had an impact, but I think it's easy to underestimate how much situations change as you grow up. Now that I have kids, it seems like we're always ending up in spaces where people are hanging out and chatting. As far as my kids know, that's just the way the world works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought the same up through college, then I graduated and suddenly spontaneous socialization ended. I had to change my habits to go find other people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet this looks very different from what 40+ years back looked like for adults so it's not just about growing up, there was other massive changes in our society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example the number of kids we had in the past dramatically affected 'forced' socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The post war suburbanization that forced us to spend huge amounts of time on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Things like TV that took entertainment from a group activity to a single person event.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Things like TV that took entertainment from a group activity to a single person event.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TV was the visual replacement of radios, and both used to bring families together for tv events… I remember lots of instances of that as a child.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also brought people together at work. Everyone used to watch nearly the same things, and even up to 15 years ago, there’d at least be groups you could find in your office who was watching the same things you did, and could engage in water cooler talk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now theres so many shows on streaming networks, and you can watch whenever, so its all fractured.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully social media is getting so much worse so fast it's making this easier and easier. HN is the last social media platform I still participate in... and I suspect that might not be for too much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently logged onto Facebook and Instagram to update my 2-factor auth settings after having too many notifications of malicious login attempts. It was incredible to see what a transformation has happened there, it's like going to a decaying suburban shopping mall with only a few stores left open (and sort of sad to see the remaining users so continually desperate for a drop of approval from some imagined community).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reddit is mostly bots, astro-turfers and people so brainwashed it's hard to tell the difference. I remember disagreeing with people on there (this in the pre-Digg migration era) you would get interesting divergent points of view. Now it's like people are reading from a script.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twitter used to be my strongest addiction, but it's almost unbelievable how big a transformation has occurred since it became X. It's almost a parody of everyone's dystopian social media fears.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HN has obviously held up a bit better, but the AI driven mass hallucination impacting this community, combined with the increasingly aggressive manipulation of the home page, is continually making logging out for good seem like the best option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Reddit is mostly bots, astro-turfers and people so brainwashed it's hard to tell the difference. I remember disagreeing with people on there (this in the pre-Digg migration era) you would get interesting divergent points of view. Now it's like people are reading from a script.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's hard to classify Reddit as one thing, the communities are all so different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The subreddit for my town has led to several new friends that I meet with in person. Most of that came from coming together to advocate for something at a city council meeting or similar, where there was a directed meat space purpose. Getting together for hobbies like hiking or other things happens once in a while too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On other, technical subreddits dedicated to digging deep into details, there are few bots. It's all real people with shared interests. Reddit is far better than most forums that I frequent for finding those communities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The few times I have been swarmed by bots on Reddit was when I touched on a topic where, say, Russia had a strategic interest, then the subreddit would get tons of new commentators from other subreddits, which was the indication of bots. Fortunately the mods took swift action when this happened, becuase my god the discourse is awful when bots flood the zone with their babble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The few times I have been swarmed by bots on Reddit was when I touched on a topic where, say, Russia had a strategic interest&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing is, bot operators know they can’t just post on Russia-related topics - they need a smokescreen of other ‘normal human’ activity, to avoid getting detected and banned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the bots that swarmed you want to appear as only 5% pro-russian, for every response you got they had to make 19 other posts. Predictable advice in advice subs, lukewarm takes in entertainment subs, reposts in image subs, repetitive worn out jokes everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes I feel the same way too. This exactly captures what I am feeling right now. I wish there was a way to upvote this twice, thank you so much for writing this!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only place I am usually active is on Hackernews and on bluesky as wel&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; HN has obviously held up a bit better, but the AI driven mass hallucination impacting this community, combined with the increasingly aggressive manipulation of the home page, is continually making logging out for good seem like the best option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not kidding, this is so true. I don't know if I can get flagged again but oh well, The amount of manipulation happening in HN is insane and flagging and just about everything&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People called me bots twice on Hackernews for no apparent reason which really hurt and then I created a post about it which got flagged again as well and the responses were.. well not so sympathetic&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel like I would be better off being an robot than a human in hackernews at this point smh. You get called bots for simply existing and showing your viewpoint or having a viewpoint (different?) or just no apparent reason and I genuinely don't know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bluesky has some faults as well but It's (I must admit) more focused on politics. i like the weeds of things in coding. I found some coding spaces in bluesky but they are just not there yet. I ended up spending 2 hours or something trying to build an extension which can automatically create threads for large posts because (you can see) i love writing large posts and bluesky has 300 characters limit and that annoyed me&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't know what to do as well. I am thinking of still using Hackernews and bluesky but to an degree of moderation. I have tried discord and that doesn't work as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly I just don't know as well but right now I atleast feel that I am not alone in this. I am not feeling lonely about feeling like this so once again massive thank you man, these are the comments which lure me into entering hackernews. Not people accusing me of being bots for no apparent reason and this happened on both bluesky and hackernews where pople called me bot and I actually try to be respectful and uh in bluesky someone went on 10 thread comment saying silence AI or silence bot when I was trying to be reasonable for the most part until I trolled them back&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And in all of this questioning myself what did I do wrong, did I have a stance and they wanted to deny it and said something, the HN instance just mentioned my name as the reason I am a clanker. All of these things genuinely made me feel like people just wont trust me in being part of this community if someone (even after being a year in) trying to respond nicely and following the rules mostly can call me clanker&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like I just don't know what to do with either bots or people who accuse (you) of being bots. Both just feel the worst in social media and are actively rotting both HN and many other communties to the point that I dont even know what are some good alternatives&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the biggest negative impact of AI is the fact that we aren't able to trust each other online in my opinion or trust art and other issues as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once again thank you man for writing this. Your comment gets what I am talking about as well and I didn't know how to summarize what I wanted to say!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People are seeking multiple things on social media. One common one is connection. I am in Mexico dealing with family business. I am in a rural area. My Spanish skills are developing but are still weak. I can have light conversation here, but I can't deeply connect. My desire to use social media has drastically increased.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I only want to engage with my friends. Every platform feeds me various flavors of rage bait mixed in with my friends' content. Some of my friends groups have moved to chats on other less public platforms like Discord, Signal, or Whatsapp. But that's not the same experience. And a lot of the people I like to engage with aren't moving over to those platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We all thought maybe social media would evolve into something good... but it was enshitified. So maybe part of the solution here is to develop a tool that offers that connection without the whole being exploited aspect?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know the feeling but my impression is that interacting with people that are strictly internet friends is a proxy to the real thing, the same way watching porn is a proxy for the real thing. When you spend X hours talking to people on the Internet you're spending at least less X hours talking to people IRL and building the sense of community that we now feel thinning away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know people that are internet famous and are terminally online all the time. I'm pretty sure it must feel like they're accomplishing something but for somebody IRL not familiar with the game they're playing their life looks very weird socially.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My current mindset for this is that social media should only work augmenting my real world social life, not take what's left of it away from me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel like the idea social media prevents socializing in real life is a bit of a straw man.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've made many friends over the years through platforms like Instagram, some in countries I don't even live in, and we've met many times in person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course that won't necessarily work for everyone but the point I'm trying to make is that social media isn't some one way street that won't return value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's social media, and then theres "social" media. Someone veged out to tiktok or instagram reels is not socialising. They are trapped in an endless state of scrolling slop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We probably need some laws or regulation that strip out the random algorithm selected junk from feeds and return it to just posts from your friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s ironic that I’m saying this because right now I’m scrolling HN while waiting for my flight to board rather than trying to strike up conversations with people … but when I was riding the bus home a few days ago, I got fed up with the algorithmic feed (too many “you’re single because you don’t follow a dating coach that will tell you to gaslight people” ads in a row). I put my phone away and just decided to take in the scene around me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every other person was on their phone. Started wondering what these people did with their day, what new restaurants they discovered, what quirky thing they may have seen in the city. Conversations that might have been had if people weren’t afraid to strike up conversations with strangers. (something I definitely struggle with myself too)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; (unwalkable towns where all of the houses are big garages in the front and no porches)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can turn the garage into a hangout spot. A neighbor has a full bar with communal table plus TV for sports and he opens up the garage door once a week on a schedule (Sunday game day or whatever depending on the season) and whenever he feels like it on work week evenings. As people pass by we invite them over and after a few months everyone knows that when the garage is open, they can come over for a drink and to shoot the shit. Low pressure social interactions that often turn into weekend outings, regular poker games, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now years later we get impromptu block parties when he brings out the grill onto the driveway. It’s done wonders for our community in an otherwise unwalkable SoCal suburb.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This works wonders. I did it accidentally. In March 2020 when my gym closed, I started working out every night in the garage. After a couple of weeks a neighbor who I only ever said "hi" to wondered by and asked if he could join since his gym was closed. After a while more showed up, and now I have like 12 people every day show up. One Friday someone brought a bottle of whiskey and we hung out after the workout and now weekly happy hours are a regular occurrence. The neighbors who don't workout stop by after the workout for happy hour. It's almost become expected and folks schedule their weeks around it so that they can be there for drinks in the evening. As a super introvert nerd, I never thought I'd be the center of community in my neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is something I absolutely would not feel comfortable doing unless I was warmly encouraged to join in, that's how I've been turned into a social outcast in my youth. I know some people who for a fact feel the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe one solution is therapy, to help massage them out of their shell, to help them learn to be vulnerable and unafraid and friendly. But many of them refuse to go to therapy for whatever reason also.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are things I will be running into as I try to resolve this. I have already encountered a young man named Daniel who remembered me, and told me that he was hospitalized, and that the thought of me and my sign helped him get through it. I'm dealing with people on all spectrums of mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In fact, maybe that's kind of the point. I'm trying to reach out to people who refuse to go to therapy, who have internal thoughts berating them all day long, and I have the unique opportunity of helping them through the darkness and into the light of the truth, that they are valuable and lovable, if only people saw the true them, and trusted them to become that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am affected by extreme conscientiousness and would be described as a social outcast in my current state I'm sure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've always had a decent social network through proximity alone (neighborhood, education, etc.) and in this comfort, built a harsh prejudice against outgoing behavior. I'm not even sure why I held this perspective so deeply for so long, but I reviled the thought of intruding on others and only warranted intrusion on those I judged willful intruders. Most of my relationships are sufficiently available, but not very deep given my refusal to assert vulnerably (including against others vulnerabilities).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was lucky to find Dostoevsky, Camus, and Hesse notably, which helped break some of my absurd dispositions. However, my entire social network was still rotten on a basis of inauthentic connection and intellectualizing this can only go so far. You must live the perspective and it is hard and vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for these words, I find your mission deeply humane and I strive to live through a similar spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yep. I grew up in the era of ‘stranger danger’. We were explicitly taught as kids to fear strangers and socialising. We were taught “don’t be rude and butt in to conversations uninvited”, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, something else is off. In the 90s, the Internet was a way to expand your social circle. So many friends made on IRC groups that moved into real life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nowadays yeah, commenting on Reddit and chatting to friends in message groups does feel like socialising, even though you might go two weeks without seeing anyone other than coworkers, cashiers (maybe) and Uber Eats delivery drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; This is something I absolutely would not feel comfortable doing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part of it I think is to endure the uncomfortable for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I felt really uncomfortable in social settings, and still do sometimes. But I forced myself to ignore those feelings. Now I'm at a point that if people think I'm weird or whatever then that's their problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I try not to be rude, be considerate and such thing, I'm not totally unhinged. But I am much more relaxed about just being me. Sometimes it doesn't work, but often it's all good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;on my son's bday i drug our firepit out to the front yard and setup some chairs for my wife and I to welcome his friends as they arrived. Maybe a dozen people in our neighborhood walking their dog or out for a run just dropped by to say hello and talk. I guess the fire looked very inviting (it was a chilly evening). I'm going to start doing it regularly, it's an easy way to meet people in your community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The common retort is that these don't exist any more, but in my experience they're all over. If you have kids you start seeing them everywhere, too. They're not as classically romantic as an ancient Greek agora, but there are plenty of spaces. During the summer I'm probably at a different space 5 days a week with the kids after school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the real problem is that some people forget how to go places. It's so easy to do the routine of work -&amp;gt; dinner -&amp;gt; screen time -&amp;gt; sleep -&amp;gt; repeat that time vanishes from people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whenever I hear people, usually young and single, complain that their 8 hour job leaves 0 hours in the day to do anything and they're too tired on the weekends to go out, it's always this: Their time is disappearing into their screens, which makes it feel like their only waking hours go to work. I try to give gentle nudges to help give people ideas, but none of them really want to hear that it's something they can change. It's just so easy to believe that life has thrust this situation upon us and there's nothing we can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The common retort is that these don't exist any more&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually when I see the retort, its also with the understanding that 3rd places need to be free, or essentially free. If theres a significant expectation of money being spent in order to spend time there, its not really a “3rd place” by the intended definition. (Thats the argument I’ve seen)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That has never really been part of the definition. If you look at that Wikipedia article a couple comments up, I only see two examples (i.e. stoops and parks) that are free, and I think parks are a stretch because conversation is not a primary reason for most people going there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote on my white board, "There goes today's hour." So if I'm walking by and I read it again, and I just spent some time on some mindless phone thing, I remember that I could find a better use of my free time tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, people forgot how to find places. If you're driving a car, places speed by too fast to see or remember (and it's dangerous to spend too much time looking at them). On Google, places are actively hidden from you for the sake of making the map look "cleaner". Every time I go downtown (on transit, not by car) I notice new shit that just doesn't exist on the map unless you specifically type in the name to get Google to admit that it exists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I noticed this the first time I took a walk by myself to the town center rather than letting my parents drive me there. You know the routine: drive to the mall parking lot, go and get the thing you're looking for, drive home. Well, I didn't have my own car and figured I could walk there (about an hour, so probably 2-3km, in a country that uses sidewalks). It's basically magical how much stuff you notice that you would just ignore when in the car, even as a passenger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happens when they try to go to that place, they go there, they are there alone and bored. There is no one to talk with. So they end up being on the phone and more depressed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our lopsided emphasis on individualism, our definition of economic efficiency that does not include the mental health value, these have been detrimental to our connections, roots, community, family etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We said, let the mom and pop stores die, their replacements provide the same value but more efficiently. Let community bonds die they intrude upon our individual destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we did not correctly account for the value provided by those that we chose to replace. So it is not surprising that we find ourselves here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could it have played out any other way ? I doubt it. Our world is an underdamped system, so we will keep swinging towards the extremes, till we figure out how to get a critically damped system. The other serious problem is that the feedback system is so laggy, that's a biggy in feedback control loops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The world has become a much bigger place. You used to know who to avoid, the default was someone was acceptable. Now the ones to avoid move around and it's all too likely that a newcomer is such a person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Now the ones to avoid move around and it's all too likely that a newcomer is such a person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This seems a wild generalization to make, though I guess "be suspicious of newcomers" is a little biologically hardwired. What's your epistemology for believing "newcomers" are "the ones to avoid"?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This reads like that pattern where people assign blame for all issues to whatever thing they happen to not like. The US is the least individualistic it has ever been, but there was much more community and less loneliness in the past. That make it pretty obvious that the issue here isn't "individualism".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not from the US but your observation, if correct, would offer a counterexample worth thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are saying that in the past, more resources were spent supporting individuals than the resources spent supporting communities and yet communities were stronger. That sure would be an interesting thing to understand if true. My interest is certainly piqued, seems too good to be true though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No it doesn't. I live in a planned neighborhood in the suburbs. I can walk to a branch of my local library, a few restaurants, a bar, a bookstore, I even get my haircut in my neighborhood. And even if none of that existed, nothing has stopped me from being friends with my neighbors, or the parents of my kid's friends. The suburbs are a different model with tradeoffs, but they're also useful for periods and phases of life different from the ones served by urban settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A planned neighborhood is technically by definition not suburban sprawl, as sprawl requires a lack of planning. On the other hand, I'd argue if you can do all of that (and said walking distance is under a mile[0]) you're not even in a suburb, you're in a dense enough location to be a town or small city. Unfortunately thanks to American zoning and planning it can be very difficult to know what your home area is actually considered and it makes this type of anecdotal evidence not particularly useful[1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[0] A mile is essentially the farthest the average person will comfortable walk versus driving a car for travel that does not require carrying anything back. Once you add in carrying things (e.g. groceries) it drops to half a mile. Anything less dense than that and people won't want to walk, anything more dense than that and you're into standard city planning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[1] Assuming you're American of course and obviously I'm not about to ask you to dox yourself, considering this type of thing can vary right down to the neighbourhood level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sounds like you like in a “streetcar suburb”, not urban sprawl. I’ve been in real urban sprawl and you can’t walk to anything. Not that you’d want to, since there are no sidewalks. Drop a Google Maps pin anywhere in Texas not in the direct center of a major city to see what it’s really like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;I can walk to a branch of my local library, a few restaurants, a bar, a bookstore, I even get my haircut in my neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you can walk to these things, you don't live in the areas the parent comment is talking about. "Suburban sprawl" doesn't mean all suburbs, it's specifically the ones which don't have facilities and community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mean, the very first paragraph of your own link says: "However, subsequent investigations revealed that the extent of public apathy was exaggerated." and the second paragraph says, "Researchers have since uncovered major inaccuracies in the Times article, and police interviews revealed that some witnesses had attempted to contact authorities."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I live in probably the most walkable city in the world, but there are millions of lonely people here as well. From any of my observations, I can’t pinpoint to one single problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might be a composite effect of different things contributing to the easiness of being alone. Cultural skill that overtime gets eroded, and as less time people spend among others, it becomes even harder to go back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suburban sprawl is not going to be "fixed" in anyones lifetime. But it doesn't have to be limiting. I grew up in a very typical suburban style neighborhood in the 1970s. Tract homes, lots of cul-de-sac streets. But neighbors talked to one another, kids played together, there were summer gatherings in those cul-de-sacs on the 4th of July or Labor Day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't think you have to live in some idealized fantasy land to go talk to your neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I live in a suburban neighborhood with a couple bag ends, our neighborhood is pretty social. couple of neighborhood bbqs a year, kids all playing together every day, dinners, etc. It is quiet and not a lot of traffic with long term residents. I am not 100% on what exactly the key is for a town is, I think style matters, but Ive been in walkable neighborhoods without a good community, and non-walkable neighborhoods with one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll say that when I was a kid, the neighborhood was still as it was originally built, no sidewalks. Didn't stop anyone from socializing, didn't stop kids from biking around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The city added sidewalks there in the '00s or so, but when I go back there I almost never see anyone using them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the trend of isolation and loneliness is not really related to infrastructure or stuff like "walkability." Those things are pretty minor obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How big were the lots? How far of a walk was the closest bar, grocery store, cafe? Do you have to walk onto someone's property to talk to them if they are sitting on the porch?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I lived in a car dependent burb for 20+ years and would rarely, if ever, run into my neighbors out on the town. Living in a walkable neighborhood in a medium-low density city for under a year and I regularly run into my neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standard 0.25 acre suburban lots. No markets, cafes, or anything like that it was a bog-standard subdivision. There was a small park sort of centrally located but that was really the only ammenity. Supermarket was a few miles away. Nobody walked there, cars to go anywhere. Neighbors still knew one another, at least on the same streets. Kids met at school, figured out where each other lived.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I knew cul de sac was french for bag end, or end of sack or whatever the translation was. One time reading lord of the rings after learning Tolkien explicitly avoided french loan words, I realized Bilbo living at Bag End is kind of a joke. Its just saying Bilbo lives in the cul de sac.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, many (most?) countries have most of their people living in places that are not sprawling suburbs. It's worst in the "Anglosphere" countries (US/Canada/Australia) within the last 50-70 years, but it's absolutely not a fantasy land. It's the way things were everywhere before 1940, and most places still are today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I say that because it is fixable, if we let ourselves fix it...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your point stands though, even in a fairly antisocial layout of a suburb, you can still usually make friends with a decent number of people nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This. I also like the idea of libraries having a cafe, internet access, a place to meet, all non profit and owned by the community. Community is a function of distance, broadly speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within KCLS, there are two public libraries that have maker spaces (AFAIK): Bellevue, Federal Way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PS this is not meant to be confrontational, would love it if there were more maker spaces in libraries (when have asked in the past, the usual answer is that they do not have enough space for it).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm willing to bet that the libraries near the person you're talking to have all but maybe a cafe. I mean, I've never seen a library in the US that didn't have internet access and a place to meet and that weren't nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do this. Even to the point where I go to church yet am openly agnostic. Takes the right church, I enjoy a good pastor and message even if I don’t technically believe it can be rooted in morality or philosophy and I can filter out the religious aspects. I could do without the singing but that’s my wife’s favorite part.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing is, church works for this because it’s an agreed upon and set time of the week. It’s also a broad group of people. Having friends of all ages is beneficial. I prefer it to a hobby group or our parent groups where we are all very similar in many aspects, although I do those too I just feel like their impact is less on building my own character.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to lose what has been lost in the macro sense and then go from 0 to 1. A social movement like “screen free Saturday” or something would be ideal. Kids had to prearrange where to meet, where the teens will party (they don’t party anymore yall!), arrange logistics, and deal with being bored during some part of the day (underrated life skill, as a busy adult I love being bored, but hated it when young). I just recently explained to my kid how TV worked in the 80s. You couldn’t pick what to watch and there were very few times when cartoons were on. You either watched the news or MASH with the adults or found something else to do out of boredom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my experience, this is the key. “90% of life is showing up.” If you are around the same people every week, for whatever reason, with even a minimal amount of openness and friendliness, you will get community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm open and friendly to everyone I meet but get treated like a weirdo and ostracized (I am also a weirdo).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don't only have to be "open and friendly", you have to say the correct things in the correct way in the correct order in order for people to accept you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're answering the question, "In a loneliness epidemic, what can I do to be less lonely?" Your answer is to use self discipline (which is hard) to get out of your house consistently, a decent answer to that question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To actually fix the loneliness epidemic, you'd have to get everyone else to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 20th century, getting out of the house consistently was the easiest way to interact with other people. Now, you can interact with lots of other people (in a less satisfying way) without leaving your house. What's going to fix that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How do we get everyone to eat better? How do we get everyone to get enough sleep? How do we get everyone to exercise more? "Just tell them to do it" won't work. "Why don't we all just put our phones away?" won't work. We'd need a policy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(My best guess: in the US, mandate that health insurers pay for therapy, and provide therapy at low/no cost in countries with national health care.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was with you up until you said policy was the solution. No, action must come first. Policy needs people to agree on it, and can take a long time to enact. Action can be done now, and allows experimentation and disagreement. I am looking for actionable solutions that I can experiment with as one lone individual with time to spare on Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're looking for individual advice, instead of "solving" the whole epidemic, then here's mine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To solve loneliness for yourself, you've got to get out of the house more. But, deep down, you already knew that, right? Just like we all know we should exercise more, eat better, etc. Self discipline is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, my advice for that is to work with a therapist. A therapist can help you do the thing that you know you need to do but can't make yourself do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People often think therapy is only for "serious" problems, but it's great for just helping you to stop sabotaging yourself (and we all sabotage ourselves, in big ways and small).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therapists have regularly scheduled appointments, which also helps in its own right. (You'll get better workout results if you exercise weekly with a trainer.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scheduled recurring appointments make it easier to attend other social gatherings, too. The chess club means every Tuesday night. People will be watching Monday night football at the bar. Church is on Sunday. (Temple is on Saturday, Jumu'ah is on Friday, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you knew all that, already, too. To do what you already knew you need to do, try therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the whole thread, it's open-ended. People can brainstorm whatever they want to based on the title. It's good that it's ambiguous. The more conversations, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for me, I'm looking for ways that I can help solve other people's loneliness, both on an individual basis, and eventually en masse, but still me doing something as one individual.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what all my replies have been about, and why I posted one top-level comment asking that very specific question. I want to know what individuals can do that's actionable to help other people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investing in free places where people can do cool things in public like libraries can help. Investing in public transportation so that more people can get around easier can help. Making sure that people have enough money that they don't need to work 2 jobs to get by and they aren't under constant worry of not being able to pay rent would help. Making sure people are able to get the healthcare they need so that they are feeling well enough to go out places would help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's hard to act when you're sick and exhausted and physically isolated and broke and there's nowhere in public filled with people worth visiting. Policy can help improve that situation so that action can happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I am looking for actionable solutions that I can experiment with as one lone individual with time to spare on Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since you've probably already got the time, energy, and money to invest this should be pretty easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The easiest answer? Go find a protest group. There are people out pretty much every week all over the place. You'll meet tons of very friendly people and you'll already have something to discuss with the strangers you meet. You can spend your weekends with new passionate people outdoors holding signs and marching around. Doesn't get more actionable than that. Comes with a low risk of getting shot or teargassed and a high risk of being profiled by the feds (although these days who isn't on a list right?)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not political? Volunteer helping people. Soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and food banks are a great place to start. You'll be doing something good for others in your community and get a chance to meet and speak with other volunteers and the people you're helping. (Fair warning: repeated exposure to good people who are struggling may cause you to become more political)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you active? Join a sports team for a sport you enjoy or have always wanted to try. There are usually local groups looking for members and again you'll be starting with something to talk about and a shared interest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pay for classes in something you're interested in. Meet your teachers and classmates. Learn something cool in the process! Works best if you're learning something that requires you to create or do something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not in a relationship? Try dating. Be open about the fact that you're just looking to meet more interesting people. (this tip works infinitely better if you're a woman, but if you're comfortable with rejection, patient, and able to pay for multiple dating apps for indefinite periods of time where you don't get any takers it can work for almost anyone).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pick a local bar and become a regular. Pay attention and if after a month or two you haven't clocked who the other regulars are pick a different bar and repeat. Once you've found some other regulars introduce yourself. As a bonus you'll both be socially lubricated when you meet and if it goes badly you can drown your sorrows in more drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like to drink but want to meet fewer alcoholics? Do the same thing but go to bars during karaoke and/or trivia nights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nerdy? Check gaming stores or the internet for a D&amp;amp;D group looking for members or even better look up where your local Society for Creative Anachronism meets and go there. You can meet people while you learn blacksmithing, or calligraphy, or archery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Religious? Tour churches. This can be pretty fun even if you aren't religious. Most people will be very friendly and welcoming (results may vary depending on the church and your color/sexual orientation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;100%. Telling people they just need to work harder and do better feel like good advice but it isn't going to solve a population scale problem. Sure _you_ should do it because it's the only thing you can directly control, but also understand it isn't going to solve the problem an entire society is facing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 20th century you left the house because otherwise you were bored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love being alone but I am not "lonely" and I am never bored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I go for a walk on a beautiful summer night in America, always alone, there is rarely anyone outside. They are in the house, mostly alone unless they have a partner/kids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think we have a loneliness epidemic because we have a culture that makes it fun to be alone. Some people don't like this level of being alone but many do. Those that do aren't really going to pitch in to help so I am not sure what the solution is. You can throw a party but I am not going to show up. I would rather be alone. This is enough interaction. There is also a culture of narcissism, hyper stimulation or both involved I imagine. I can't just close the browser window in person if the conversation seems boring or jump to something more interesting instantly. I would even say that being alone is more fun now than hanging out at someone's house in the 20th century. There is just so much more to do. The group was less bored together but it was still pretty boring then. That is why going to the bar was so popular. Not much else to do then besides get drunk and smoke cigarettes in groups to get rid of the boredom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; People need to purposefully and intentionally do things. Sitting home on an app, watching TV is easy. There is no fear or rejection, there is no work to get out of the house, there is no risk. But there is also no reward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the wrong model:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sitting (alone) at home and working on program code or reading scientific textbooks does have a reward. Many things for which you go outside of the house or where you interact with other people have a much lower reward. So you rather loose a rather decent local optimum, and if you don't know very well where to look outside for something really good, you get much worse results than if you simply stayed at home and do there what you love.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think by "reward" in the context of this discussion on loneliness, OP may have meant the opportunity to meet people, make friends, perhaps hit it off with someone and land a date, if you're single. Not that it's entirely useless/detrimental to spend time at home reading or pursuing whatever solo hobbies you happen to have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be sure, there certainly are many introverts who are perfectly happy on their own with no need to get out and meet people. More power to them! But there are many that crave human connection, even if they happen to have many intellectual interests and for these types of individuals, they would be well served at least carving out some portion of their time to get out of the house with the explicit aim of meeting people. And yes, not every such outing will lead to lifelong friends or meeting your next soulmate, but it's a numbers game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Opportunity" is not reward. Actually making friends is reward. And that actually making friends requires a lot more then just "go outside somewhere we cant tell you where". If you just go to a cafe or club, you will sit alone in cafe or club. And if you walk to someone randomly, they wont appreciate it because it is weird.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; you get much worse results than if you simply stayed at home and do there what you love.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's a sense of risk and caution that gets too comfortable for some people to compete with over time. If you don't build yourself better options, all you want to do is sit at home and do the thing that guarantees a reward. Then you get in your car and move about the world in a way that you feel is guaranteed to protect you from conditions, other people, but really is dangerous. You bet only on certainty, and outcomes are predictable, but they're not compatible with not being lonely&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My son is comparing every alternative to what he can accomplish by staying home and practicing guitar. However, we are trying to start an anime theme song cover band (e.g. "Upstate NY's most energetic opening act") for which he's going to play Bass, Rhythm or Lead as needed and I'm going to be the Kitsune/Band Manager/Mascot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But reducing loneliness is just a means to an end. My point is that there exist a lot of rewarding things that you can do alone at home, which may give you a hapiness malus because of the loneliness, but also a happiness bonus because you like the activity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a solution to reducing loneliness shall be sustainable, it better increases the happiness or rewardingness overall, too. Otherwise you see loneliness as a problem, but see the alternatives as being the worse options, i.e. by rational choice, the loneliness will not be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What a stupid take, but it showcases the underlying problem: there is no loneliness issue, there is a "me me me" issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Friendship is a two way contract: you add something to someone's life and they will consider you their friend, they add something to your life, making them your friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you "optimize" for your own and only your own benefit, nobody is going to be your friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is good advice for your friends and family, but a bad answer to the question. "How can we solve the obesity epidemic? Stop eating so much and get some exercise." Well sure, but this misses the big picture. We built a social infrastructure that encourages a sedentary, solitary life. We shouldn't be confused by physical and emotional health implications. We can expect some people to be proactive about it, but we can't expect that of everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; We built a social infrastructure that encourages a sedentary, solitary life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. Pro-exercise propaganda has been extremely strong for longer than you've been alive. Large parts of the economy is focused on exercise and health, and it is accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it sure feels better to think that every problem is "society's fault". That's the easiest and cheapest cop-out. Just takes a few seconds to type on the keyboard, instead of doing something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure, but what about the people who don't do this? Those who sit at home all day, scrolling away, drinking themselves to death, wondering why life is so lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only time you ever see such people is when they're walking to the grocery store. How do you reach out to them to let them know about these ideas or encourage them to try it? Especially when they're filled with discouraging thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if all they need is one single person to say hi? How can I find them, reach them? This is what I'm asking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've reviewed this and your other comments on the thread, and I think you're making a mistake, believing that to solve the loneliness epidemic, you primarily need to "reach people."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As long as leaving the house and making real contact is harder (requires more self discipline) than staying in and scrolling, all you can do is project a message to folks at home, like "hi, you're not alone in feeling lonely," but you haven't solved the fundamental problem: it's harder to do the right thing than it is to do the wrong thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To solve the loneliness epidemic, you have to make the right thing easier than the wrong thing. "Reaching out" to more people will not accomplish that. Elsewhere in this thread, you've rejected the idea of pursuing a public policy, but policy is the only answer anyone's provided in this thread that could make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Now, it turns out that you'll have to do a lot of outreach to make a public policy happen, but you'll be asking for their vote, not a regular commitment to show up weekly at a club; outreach is the right approach to that problem.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need the Tiktoks of the world to realize their responsibility: users get addicted to the apps in order to numb their feelings of loneliness. So we'd need an intervention within these apps that makes them unbearable for the lonely, combined with a healthier way to engage with loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine TikTok asking you "you've scrolled for 30 minutes. You might be in a loneliness spiral. Write down the name of someone you would like to be closer to."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TikTok does in fact remind you, quite often, that you've been scrolling for a while, and suggests taking a break. Last year, for most of each day, I would just ignore this and keep scrolling. I'd see it so many times each day. That wouldn't change if they added a suggestion like writing a name down. I'd still ignore it, and I think most people in the same situation would too. But when I was at the store, or walking to the store, that's when someone could have found a way in, and been able to get me to make a connection and open up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're willing to put in the legwork, set up a event on your events platform of choice, take out an ad targeted locally and emphasize that it's free, and someone like me would sign up. I occasionally get ads for things happening locally but it's usually has some prepay component and feels like they are "dropshipping" an event. There are also [city] events pages on IG/fb&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; What if all they need is one single person to say hi?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then say 'hi'. By definition they're not going to seek you out nor are they going to be findable so you're only option is to say hi to everyone and hope one sticks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;edit: heh i hope you're not talking about me, i walk to the grocery store regularly by myself. It's how a take a break from work and get some exercise. i'm fine :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me that seems like not saying hi, rather a device to shift the risk of engaging off of you. Don't be scared. Just say a few banal words to people you don't know every day and gauge their reaction, start a conversation if you like and they seem to be up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You just have to become the most friendly ultimate host in the world. Start up random conversations with those people at the grocery store or on the street and invite them to your bbq you are having this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But ultimately, if a man is sitting in his kitchen and its on fire. Its up to him to run out. No amount of reaching out will help until he decides to make the change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this is true, it's worth mentioning that a regular coffee machine small talk in the office is not building any relationships. At least that's how I experience it. It can start one, but won't automatically make one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can go for a coffee and routinely get dragged into 30 min conversation about politics, or cars, or weather, or any other subject I literally don't care about. All the good relationships begin with finding a niche topic between 2 people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;YMMV I guess. I've got tons of friends I've made walking around the office and just dropping in and asking people what they're working on and introducing myself, or sitting at a table with people I didn't. Some are no more than acquaintances, but some are close friends now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It doesn't have to be an office - young people just need to get out and engage with the world in whatever way works for them. I tell this to my teenagers all the time. They are used to our nice house in the woods, 10 minutes outside of town, where their old parents work remotely and relax at home. But I remind them that this is a good place for our old age, not their youth. I spent my 20s exploring the world, climbing mountains, meeting new people, making mistakes, learning, and growing. They would be happier if they likewise got out and explored... hopefully with fewer mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there is far more to the world than offices, so while I agree 100% with the sentiment, I'd broaden those horizons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For sure. I would have been in real trouble if covid had happened when I was 20. The few times I tried to work remotely it took a matter of just a few days to go stir crazy. The office was a good environment for me (it helped that it was legitimately a good environment with good coworkers, not everyone has that).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a family man with a wife, two kids, two cats, and a dog ... working from home is no big deal for me now. I prefer it. I got lucky that we did not get forced into this until I was in a position to handle it well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree with this take. I'm definitely not friends with everyone I've worked with in person, but some of the most meaningful post-college friendships were formed by socializing with the people in the office (or people I met through socializing with office friends).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yep, I met my wife at an office party - she didn't work for the company, just stopped by with someone who did&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And not just the office friends that come from it -- I spent an hour a day on the bus, grabbed lunch around town, was downtown when work wrapped up and ended up at a nearby bar/restaurant, went to shows because I was downtown, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just being forced out of the house led to SO MUCH MORE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I work from home and while we do travel a lot, we barely ever leave the house when we're home. We didn't make a single new friend for like 5 years (and we are a VERY social couple, generally the center of most of our friend groups). We've only just now started making new friends again now that our daughter is a toddler and getting us out of the house -- and it is incredibly refreshing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not just willingness, as the OP mentions, being forced out of the house lots of things happen, some of them social. Having everything in the house, from work to shopping to entertainment is a convenience that could even save you some money, but it has a cost down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah I'm very willing to socialize and actually do far more than pretty much anyone I know, even those without kids (but maybe not as much as a 25 year old just getting started in the world and living in SF like I once was). I'm lucky in that regard I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This as well. You need to learn to talk to people, socialize, handle adversity, etc. Sitting at home and your only real connection to the outside world being an echo chamber like facebook or whatever cannot be good for us&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Absolutely, I agree. Some of the people I had the sharpest debates with and didn't always agree with had way more impact on who I am today than the softer acquaintances. Most of them definitely made me a better person in the end, even if we weren't really "friends".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yeah, even just having the basic daily connections can be a dopamine hit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah I thought that was weird, along with joining ethnic organizations. I don't really need to explain the religion thing, but ethnic organizations are weird since you are forming an identity based on your unchoosable parent's DNA. I've seen both used by leaders to weaponize their members at their members detriment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although, if you are doing politics, I can see this being pragmatically useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's weird to think that ethnic organisations are weird when it's the most natural social group you can form. You are literally genetically similar to these people. You have a shared history, culture, etc. In a biological sense, you have an innate interest in each other's prosperity (at least, moreso than you would an ethnically-distant stranger).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're taking your "anti-racism" to the point where it is unnatural, absurd, and alienating. People inherently want community with their kin but you are telling them that they are wrong for pursuing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Telling people to bond over traits they can't choose seems like an excellent way to isolate people with rare traits they can't choose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have more in common with a factory worker in China than I do with the president of my own country, even if we happen to share the same skin tone. I am defined by my experiences, after all, not things like genetics, culture or history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;it also doesn't even fight loneliness. Loneliness isn't solved by merely not being physically alone. I grew up in a Catholic environment but because I bought exactly none of it the religious environments were exactly where I felt most isolated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're not solving loneliness by joining a cult or a gang. You can only deal with it by making authentic connections to people you actually want to be with. Countless of people are lonely and miserable within families.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree, unless faith actually means something to you, forcing yourself to go to church won’t help. Sitting through Mass miserable, disbelieving, and avoiding everyone defeats the whole purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Churches get brought up a lot because they regularly gather people (weekly or even daily) and offer events, volunteer opportunities, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The point is to find an activity you like, with a specific group of people and consistently attend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;P.S As a fellow Catholic, I’m really sorry you went through such an isolating experience. I hope things feel much better for you now&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;based on the work of Robert Putnam is an essential backgrounder on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, if you're concerned about Gen Z, 2-4 are aspirational at best. Churches, clubs, live music events, and every other group my son attends have a lot of people who are 35+ and children that tag along but the 18-30 demo is almost absolutely absent at events away from the local colleges and universities. [1] It's quite depressing for someone his age who is looking to connect with his cohort in person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leaders of groups are somewhere between outright hostile, completely indifferent, or well-meaning but unable to do anything about the "cold start" problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm sympathetic to the argument of Ancient Wisdom Tradition (AWT) practitioners that secularism is to blame, but my consistent advice to anyone is you can control what you can control and that secularism would not have encroached as much as it has if AWT organizations weren't asleep at the switch if not doing the devil's work for him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally in the last year I've found a lot of meaning being an event photographer for this group&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;where I know you can find some people in the 18-30 hole because I read their age off their bibs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My son is doing all the ordinary things and I am supporting him in all the ordinary ways but I do believe extraordinary times require extraordinary methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can't advise that anyone follow my path but I felt a calling to shamanism two years ago which recently became real, I "go out" as&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;who is a "kidult" and who embodies [2] the wisdom, calm and presence of a 1000-year old fox who's earned his nine tails. In one of the worlds I inhabit I'd call this a "platform" for gathering information and making interventions as it builds rapport and bypasses barriers and the social isolation of Gen Z is my top priority for activism in my circle of influence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[1] ... and our data there seems to indicates that Asian students seem to be OK and white kids, if they do anything at all, drink.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I have no doubt that this is a liberating practice for you, for anyone else reading, you can also actually become a real shaman in pretty much any shamanic tradition, and I know many people who who have done that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is, in fact, an excellent way to fill your life with meaning and connection if it's something you're called to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A somewhat cynical response given the frequency of this topic/question being posted here and on other social media platforms. Add a weak "/s but not really" if you want:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People sitting at home living on apps and watching TV who decide to go to a new group social event to change things up will struggle to make a connection with someone else who was at home on an app and watching TV deciding to get out and meet someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The people who have friends.. already have friends. Those who don't are numerous social cycle iterations in on that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And how long before those people just end up talking about TV shows anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; who decide to go to a new group social event to change things up will struggle to make a connection with someone else&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can't imagine going to a general "group social event" like a party and making a connection. I'd end up just sitting there being bored until I left. I don't have the personality to just strike up a conversation about nothing with some one I don't know. But I do somewhat often go to events that revolve around my hobbies. There, I already have a connection with the strangers, through the hobby, and I have something to talk about or listen to. I've met plenty of new friends that way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nonsense. It's fine to be boring, and to have boring friends. This expectation that you need to be travel influencer or a deep philosopher in order to have anything to talk about is an artifact of social media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm old enough to remember what socialization was like pre-Internet. And by curated social media standards, it was really boring. It was also great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mean, if you've already convinced yourself that you'll have a bad time and no one will like you...that's what they call a self-fulfilling prophesy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's fine to feel intimidated or shy, but then find something else that does feel manageable. It's something you can get better with by practicing. And I say that as an introvert who went semi-feral after Covid lol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think what makes this good advice especially difficult is that it cannot be one-sided. When everyone is letting doom-scrolling replace their social interaction, then one person won't easily solve their own problem by going out to socialize. We need a broader solution, probably a cultural shift away from using technology as a crutch to avoid other people. Maybe the current younger generations will evolve a balance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, for years now I’ve had this creeping feeling that it’s a social version of the prisoners dilemma: if you’re the only one that puts down the phone (or gets off social media, etc) then you’re just left behind. It’s a coordination problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that there are a lot of people that are kind of waiting for other people to pitch something to do. Maybe you want to call them type A and B, leader and follower, I think of it as the Host and Attendees. The more of the Hosts the more things that will be happening, so trying to become a Host is just creates more opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agreed. I'm not sure how it happened, but it feels like we've experienced a societal shift where a large number of people now expect and wait for other people to create nicely packaged solutions to their (real or imagined) problems. From social apps to medicine to play dates to curated vacations, too many people are unwilling to face "the great unknown" that is just going out and seeing what happens, warts and all. Somehow the ability of boomers to make conversation with strangers has become a meme instead of a norm - they're good at it because they practice it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to do this "grow at least 2 roots into your community" idea but a huge challenge for me is simply that I'm 2nd shift. That naturally leads to a lot more isolation than 1st shift. (3rd shifties, my heart goes out to you. I've done that job. Not a fun time personally.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; 1. People need to make a point to talk to their neighbors&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are people who find this satisfying. However, you don't typically choose your neighbors. Don't be afraid to eschew spending time on this in favor of groups you deliberately choose based on common interests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might not choose your neighbors but, like your family, they're a part of your life anyway. You can choose to build bonds with them (rely on them to water plants, pick up packages, borrow spices) or create your own little world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also find these things elsewhere—I know someone whose dry cleaner cat sits for her—but your relationship with your neighbors can still really affect your life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The people who enjoy doing that should absolutely feel free to do so. My comment was addressed at people who don't, to remind people that it's okay to not, and to choose to spend your time in other ways instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My comment was saying that the people who _don't_ should learn how to do so. It's a skill like any others, and what you're proposing contributes to people being lonely. Instead of making connections with people around them, who they didn't choose, they hold out for some platonic ideal of a friend who they have the right amount of things in common with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You see it in this comment section where you've got people shooting down every idea that people put out there. Oh, I can't go to the gym, I don't like working out. Oh, I don't want to join clubs because they don't have my interests. But I also don't want to be lonely, so I guess I'm just stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, I understood the point perfectly, I just think it's completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's always possible to find people. If someone is shooting down every idea for doing so, they may have issues with motivation, or being defeatist, or any number of things. Those need solving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean finding perfection. It does mean actively doing something to find people you enjoy spending time with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Life gets immensely happier when you spend time primarily with people you find fulfilling. You can absolutely make a conversation work with anyone, it's absolutely a skill, and it can be useful. But you will in your life have a certain amount of time and energy to interact with people. Spend it well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. fair 2. did this but they are all 80+ 3. ok 4. not that good at anything, too old for most groups. gym no one talks with anyone. bjj was the best for this, since its more older and mostly men 5. remote work ruined my mental health&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As far as 2 goes: As far as churches go. The type of church matters a lot. If you go to a Universalist Unitarian, or progressive Lutheran Church, yeah itll probably be 80+. Evangelical/Baptist, Latter Day Saints, Orthodox, Catholic (more traditional parishes) all are significantly younger. The more conservative the denomination the younger the congregation. The more liberal, the older they are. With conservative/liberal being adherence to scripture. This also tracks to Judaism, with Reformed Synagogues being much older than Orthodox. I am not sure and haven't seen numbers of Islam, Buddhism, etc. i the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For 4: You don't really have to be good for like a rec league kickball, or beer league golf. Gyms are better if youre doing classes though I think, like BJJ or wrestling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The more liberal, the older they are. With conservative/liberal being adherence to scripture... The more liberal, the older they are. With conservative/liberal being adherence to scripture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet many young Evangelicals have deconstructed and dropped out of those conservative congregations over the last 20 years or so. They couldn't bridge the cognitive gap between the conservative political stance of their church and what they read in the bible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My experience is similar. I think there is a combination of "some gyms are more social" and "some people are good at breaking the ice with strangers". On social media, I frequently hear people say stuff like: "Oh yeah, I have a bunch of friends at the gym." I am not doubting their story, but it doesn't happen to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; remote work ruined my mental health&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm sorry to hear it. I'm not here to start a holy war about remote work. Can you share some details? For me, remote work has me very quickly "falling apart" -- showering at 2PM or not at all. Going to the office forces some structure into my life and everything else flows from that. To be clear: I understand that a lot of people love remote work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; "Oh yeah, I have a bunch of friends at the gym."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their definition of "a friend" can wildly vary from yours. Especially if such relationship is cultivated only at the gym. I'd hardly call it "friendship".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remote work has allowed me to build the structure I need to function and perform at a high level. I have severe ADHD and do not fit well into conventional office environments, not because I lack capability, but because my work is most effective when done on my own terms and schedule. I've worked remotely on and off for most of my life (I grew up on a farm, so "working from home" was already quite natural to me.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is also colored a little by the fact that remote work is no longer really just an optional for me. Due to a spinal cord injury, I need flexibility to manage just ongoing existence, rehabilitation, and frequent medical appointments. An in-office role simply isn’t compatible with those realities, though the most recent surgeries do make it more viable than it was even twelve months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m fortunate to work for a remote organisation that recognises this arrangement as mutually beneficial: I’m able to do my best work, and they get the full value of my expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With all of that being said, I know people whom are far more aligned with you. Remote work is not particuarly beneficial for them, they indeed need an externally inforced structure and so would be best (and happiest) in office. I would never tell them otherwise and nor would they do the same to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am thankful for the most part that many (though not all) of us somewhat have the ability to work in the way in which is best for us (and those employing us.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The great thing about the comment you're replying to is that it has a list of suggestions. So you've got two options: you can get angry that one of them doesn't cater to you, or you could skip that one and look at the others that do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd say particularly if you're an atheist. I've always been atheist, but fascinated by churches and religions regardless, because no matter what you believe, it's hard to refuse the proof that the ideas themselves are powerful and helps people a lot of the times. Why is that? Best way to find out is to talk and engage with those who have these different ideas, probably where they are the most comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doesn't mean you need to forget all the horrible impact it has had too, and how much better humanity would probably be without it, or even continue thinking about ideas how we could finally get rid of it once and for all, without violence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, probably different in different parts of the world, but in many places churches are just purely architecturally/visually beautiful and historically interesting buildings. Some of them have really interesting acoustics too, and organs. Many interesting stuff at churches :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you agree with the entire comment, except just that line, do you upvote or not? I think maybe that's why :) If that line was the only thing in the comment, the reaction would probably have been different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not even just an atheist issue. You have to have spiritual beliefs that value the specific repetitive church rituals so as not to be bored out of your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I always said science is kind of like a religion in a way. Wonder if that's closer or further from some truth than "technology". Interesting perspective nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was just a couple of months ago where I found myself complaining that we shouldn't have to pay exorbitant amounts of money for friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last time I went to a bar a pretty woman and her friends decided to sit next to me only after I closed my tab and was getting an Uber to go back home. She seemed super nervous just sitting next to me and I assumed that if I butted into their conversation I'd get ignored like last time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a decentralized open source Meetup alternative where people can find social events and meet new friends. https://codeberg.org/createthirdplaces&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see this as quite a problem in the US. The default place a lonely person has to go is usually a church - where you can expect a modicum, possibly even a seeming profusion, of welcome. This is their hook. They provide automatic acceptance - of sorts. This is also how the right wing fascist regime convinced people to let Trump take over the country - propaganda through the churches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only other options people hear about are 'join a club.' Interesting clubs aren't that easy to find. Hanging out at the local pub has obvious downsides, though I guess it sorta works in some countries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need more ways for people to casually meet others that aren't trying to manipulate you or program you with religious doctrine...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure, the way cult members are happy to greet new recruits. It's very insincere. If you have a real issue and you want to talk to someone - you are very likely to hear something like: "Well, pray to Jesus dear, only he can help you." In other words, if you actually need any support - go home and pray about it - don't expect real connection with people. The only connection comes through the imaginary friends they encourage you to divert all your attention and problems to...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think part of the problem is the stuff you’re suggesting. I think everyday life needs to happen organically and if everything is scheduled and regimented and needs to be planned for, it’s very hard for the vast majority of people to actually accomplish. In the past the way, this worked was you went to church which was societally and peer enforced. People need to have marriages that last a lifetime. It’s my opinion that marriages that are a partnership without any sort of hierarchy like we had in the past are essentially doomed to fail except in a small percentage of cases. You need to have kids with stable homes that can go out on the street and be outside all day without fear of crime. Extended families need to live close to each other so there are a lot of folks raising kids and approaching life’s every day problems together. You need to shut off indoor sources of entertainment like social media and video gaming. You need to have a solid education system that is factual and science based, and only lets kids get through on the basis of meritocracy so they can be good informed citizens, and not vote for populist nonsense like we currently have. In a nutshell, what I’m trying to say is people cannot act on what’s best for them but society can put enough peer pressure on everyone for everyone’s good. This might be very hard to listen to in an individualistic society like ours and I don’t even know if I would want to live in this society, but I believe that if that’s the only option, everyone is better off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think there's a single fix, but small design changes matter: more third places that don't revolve around consumption, work schedules that allow for regular community life, activities where showing up quietly is acceptable. Loneliness isn't just about lack of friends, it's about lack of belonging&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the past, whenever I felt lonely and hopeless, I jumped into helping others: volunteering, helping an old neighbor garden, help someone move, etc. Helping people gave me a short-term purpose, which eventually let me ride out the low phase of life. YMMV, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have noticed that doing the sign leads to some good conversations in which I've helped someone in a small way, and that gave me a nice little dopamine boost. It's also led to about half a dozen genuine friendships over the past few months. I wonder if that's the answer, a sort of meta-solution: organizing this thing I'm doing into something that other people in the same situation can do, as a way of meeting people and getting outside their comfort zone. Like setting up a chess table in public if chess is your thing. But no, there are already public chess tables, and they'd have already done that. I don't know, just thinking out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is my go-to strategy as well. When I feel irrepressible bits of loneliness or depression, I just make some food and go out and start handing out to the needy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or go for a walk and find people that need a hand. People moving, lifting things, carrying things. Small little acts of being useful and helpful for a moment help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The feeling will creep back in eventually, but at least for that time I was out and about, it's not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;there isn't a loneliness epidemic. There is a diffuse inability to stay truly alone. Acquiring that ability would also teach how to not stay alone when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Otherwise, people wouldn't resort to social media. Going to party aimlessly and hanging out isn't necessarily better. It depends on who you hang out with and what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need both. My sense is that only a minority of people are hardwired to preferably live as hermits. And whilst it's an important life skill to be happy alone, everyone has their breaking point, it's no coincidence that one of the best predictors of longevity is how rich ones social life is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something I've noticed with me and other gen-Zers is that meeting with friends or strangers over Discord VoIP is a great way to socialize. It's missing some of the social benefits of in-person meetups, but it's very low-commitment (just hope on a call) and it's much easier to find others who share your interests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote an article[0] on Tiny Neighborhoods (aka “Cohousing”) that starts with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; “I often wonder if the standard approach to housing is the best we can do. About 70% of Americans live in a suburb, which means that this design pattern affects our lives – where we shop, how we eat, who we know – more than any other part of modern life.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have been so uncritical of the set of ideas that make suburbia—single family homes, one car per adult, large private yards—even though these play a big role in how people act.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some people want to address loneliness by making incremental changes. But if the statistics are right and nearly everyone is somewhat lonely, we should expect that the required adjustments feel “drastic” compared to the current norm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People would be less lonely if they could live in a community of 15-20 families with (1) shared space and (2) shared expectations for working together on their shared space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I posted on another subthread but I think this is largely an excuse. If you live in a typical suburb you have 15-20 families on your street. You can easily walk next door and chat or just say hello when you see someone outside. It takes initiative, which is the key thing that's missing. You either hide in your house or you get out and be sociable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You can easily walk next door and chat or just say hello when you see someone outside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have no problem with socialization and I have an unusually-active social life for a thirty-eight year old married man with three kids, so I clearly don't lack initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that being said, all of my neighbors are either elderly, shut-ins, or just don't want to be bothered; even the ones with kids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My wife &amp;amp; I helped organize a Block Party last year and I'm fairly certain it resulted in 0 new friendships for any of the attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's the solution here? Friendships need to have mutual interest, no?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it's a circular problem. Like, my kids don't go outside much because there are no other kids outside to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's no question that there are 15-20 families within 300 yards of my house. But that group of people absolutely does not have a sense of shared anything but the road.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the fact is that this is true of the supermajority of suburban streets in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't disagree but 30 years ago the people in those kinds of neighborhoods did get out and talk to each other, did organize cookouts and other gatherings, and in general were sociable neighbors. The people changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I live in a completely different city, a post-soviet one, with dense streets, 9-storey apartment buildings. But still it's hard to socialize. It's the same both in the center, and on the fringe with large micro-districts, where the density is the same, but people are less in haste, and there are less strangers. Same way, people are avoidant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like in subway you pretend that others don't exist, and it's hard to get closer with people. It can take months or years to start saying hello to a kiosk salesman you recognize. It's hard to get past by hello with the house neighbors. If you make steps forward, people are unease. Sometimes others are too quick with their steps, you get unease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most compelling theory I know is that you need to meet people occasionally, without intention, to deepen the relationships. If all your communication with someone is intentional, I guess, this feels awkward for both sides. I can confirm this from experience: living in a 80K town, I'd walk down the main street to the little shopping mall with a local supermarket for groceries, and would meet people I knew, or friends, and sometimes we'd go walking by the streets, with groceries bag in my hand :) or we planned to meet in 15 minutes. Or go to each other's home. This is hard to replicate in a big city, where even if you see a friend, he/she is usually in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Near apartment blocks, there's no porch or garden or park, and even where there is one, I don't see locals sitting there regularly. People are very cautious, even suspicious of benches, because if there's a busy street nearby, once in a year there'll be a group of noisy young people sitting late at night, or one drunkard in a year, and everyone will get pissed off and want the bench removed. (If they allow to install it at all.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at some places, I theorized that maybe there should be a place where you could sit and let's say play board games _near_ those who come in and out. And of course, it should be indoors, because winters are long and cold. But But I'm not sure of a communal place indoors either. It could become a magnet for homeless, it can be a magnet for just the slacker drinking old men, and repel the rest of people. I've seen too many communities become place repulsive for "normies". Maintenance is a big question too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the answer to this question is likely multifaceted. That is, there isn't going to be one killer policy or app or attitude or event which will solve this problem, but it would require a multi-pronged approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since it's a societal problem, but solved on the microlevel of one person at a time, it seems the way to have a broader effect is to show the value of having connection with other people over the value of not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overcome any addictions (scrolling, gaming, etc.) that stand in the way would be easier if the goal was clear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overcoming attitudes and defensive beliefs (too many cliques, they won't talk to me...) go away when you can either recall a time when you had friends or know others who do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Convince people it's better (in their own value system) to be social, have friends of all kinds, and let them know their value and meaning increase by being a friend, I think you'd have a hard time stopping people from becoming social.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve always been someone who likes to go to local coffee shops, shops, and walks around the neighborhood. While I’ve met a few friendly employees who learn my name and say hi to me, in general I’ve found customers and people in general aren’t super approachable. They’re usually there as a part of an existing group of friends, or are focused on their work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not saying it’s impossible to meet people in this situation, but it is difficult to break the ice. Especially if your social skills are rusty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a larger scale, I think most people’s budget for anonymous social interaction is consumed through social media, where they scroll past strangers arguing and let’s be honest, mostly vitriolic comments. So in the real world, they don’t want to deal with anonymous strangers and intently focus on their own friendships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Groups are a good way to bridge this gap, but the groups that are easier to host aren’t always accessible to everyone. And they require a lot of time and ideally strong social skills to run effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve thought about starting a campaign to make socializing with people in person more of a common practice again, but I’m honestly not sure how to convince enough people&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anecdote: I had a friend in SF. He and I would hang out once in a while, and I always looked forward to these hangouts (we'd meet up for coffee, or go for a walk, hang out at Dolores Park, etc.). He is gay, I'm not. His perspective on things was often quite different than mine and I found that interesting. I got married, he stayed single. Even after marriage we would still hang out (though not as often as before). Then we had a child, which sucked all spare time out of my life; but even then we hung out once in a while. Then one winter there was cold/flu/COVID going around. We planned on hanging out and I unfortunately bailed on him at the last moment. This happened 2 more times. Then that bout of illnesses passed and I reached out to him to hang out again. But this time he seemed cold and distant. So I dropped it. And I didn't see him again for almost 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then one day I ran into him while walking through Dolores Park. He didn't see me, but I hesitated and still hollered out at him, for old times' sake. He responded and walked over. We chatted a little, I gave him a parting hug and we agreed to hang out again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks later we managed to hang out again. What I gathered from our meeting was that he had been miffed at what he thought was me blowing him off; and I, when I felt he was cold and distant, had misread his grief at losing his cat. We both misread each other and wasted 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moral of the story that I took away from it was: be more forgiving. Friendships are worth the extra effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can organize things. It's surprisingly easy. You just put up a FB event.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was younger and moved to a new (foreign) city, The first thing I did was to create a "picnic" for people coming from my country. No agenda, no nothing, let's just hang out and have some wine, cheese and chat while sitting on the grass. You'd be surprised how successful this was, and some of them keep running regularly without me for over a decade now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make a social app whose goal is to get people off their phone as quickly as possible. There used to be a slew of apps where you a press a button to indicate "I'm bored/free, who wants to hang out?" and then you get matched with your contact list and anyone else who pressed the button at the same time. But for whatever reason they all flamed out and died.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;one issue is that if you leave it to the free market, you will just get more issues. for monopolies, it's more profitable to keep someone unhealthy (and depressed) than it is to make someone healthy once forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy reasons. You don’t want a VC funded startup to know your contact list and your location (because hanging out in real life requires physical proximity).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the solution is for the app to advertise public social events where people can make connections and exchange contact information in person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Allowing random people to message each other without meeting in person is a mistake. The nonverbal cues people get from in person interactions are helpful for discovering shared interested and personality compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally I’m living with a partner (only 50% of the time for now), have only two social activities per month outside work in average and some small talk at work. I don’t need more and have no intention to volunteer, join church or anything like that just for the social aspect. I guess the big problem is the (growing?) minority having close to no social experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A young woman explained to me the other week what you're doing now. She said it's become a meme called Bean Soup. I'm grateful for all the friends I've made since I starting doing my signs. Genuinely fulfilling friendships, for the first time in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sports. CrossFit and similar social sports have been healthy for me and for many others, and I think the community is at least equal to the exercise in improving people's lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not saying this is the only way, but it made a big difference for me and my friends. I realize the physical challenges are artificial, but so is an Advent of Code puzzle when you already have a day job. Hard things are worth doing because they're hard, and they're even better when done together with those you love.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The common denominator is to have shared spaces where it's expected to be among strangers' presence, and for those strangers to eventually become repeat guests in a person's life. That's the maximally comfortable scenario for inducing social behavior and it's responsible for eons of human social history. Think church.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem there is that it's the responsibility of groups or society to arrange that. There's not much that a single lonely person can do there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The less common denominator, that an individual may partake in until society concocts a better solution, is to intentionally visit existing shared spaces even where they otherwise wouldn't (hint: bouldering gyms are good for this because there are repeat faces as well as a social okay-ness to congratulating strangers, or asking how certain challenges can be solved).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or break with convention, comfort, and perhaps etiquette, and instead just talk to people. Even outside of those spaces. (This is the advice that will piss a lot of people off if it's presented as their only option.) This advice is horrible until it isn't. It does, with enough practice, 'just work'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For an entrepreneur or organizer: it would just go a long way to think about things in terms of allowing conversation to happen unimpeded. Pay attention to where people talk, and about what. Conversations happen a lot in hallways but famously by water coolers, perhaps because it affords people enough time in a shared space to muster the internal capital to start a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In college I ran a forum for people to meet others and some of the most self-reportedly successful participants just asked questions into the void and were surprised by the number of responses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;The common denominator is to have shared spaces where it's expected to be among strangers' presence, and for those strangers to eventually become repeat guests in a person's life. That's the maximally comfortable scenario for inducing social behavior and it's responsible for eons of human social history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is spot on. It's why you meet so much people during your high school / college years. You're among strangers' presence, while attending to class, which makes a natural topic of interest between the people involved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start a community or join one. I have a friend that started a social community where they host discussion groups, sharing circles, art marking, picnics, field trips, cooking club, etc. The whole focus is on creating connection. I myself run an experimental games meetup where our small niche share what were working on each month. I also have a book club each week with some friends (although we chat more about life than books). I think 2026 is the year of community. Make an intentional effort. Show up in the same space repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Friendship is hard and requires a lot of energy, and it will not always pay off. You're going to get burned, ghosted, and bailed on. It's far too easy to push the hermit-mode button, and doomscroll your life away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social capital requires *active* participation. If you're willing to invest, put yourself out there. Be the person that kicks off the things that are interesting to you. You'll find that people are interested in things you thought were niche. As a mentor once told me: life is a body-contact sport; get out there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are, of course, multiple causes for loneliness. We can't fix them all with one clear action. Here are the main five, in my view:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, social media. It's too easy to temporarily forget about your loneliness by staying home and doomscrolling or watching TV.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, increased mobility. People move around the whole continent now for work, removing them from their closest and oldest social connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, God is dead. Churches as community centers are dying out. Young people don't trust them anymore, because they don't believe in God, and because churches had many scandals. Secular community centers are very rare and struggle with funding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, work is more stressful now. There used to be more time to socialize, but in our quest for productivity, work became denser with fewer idle times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fifth, fewer people want to have kids. Much has been written about this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now what can we do at societal scale? First of all, study the phenomenon more closely. Who is lonely? Who isn't? Which interventions work? Which cultural factors are important? At your local scale, you can just call or meet a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Fourth, work is more stressful now. There used to be more time to socialize, but in our quest for productivity, work became denser with fewer idle times&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The we here is not most people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The quest for higher productivity is not something people really care about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spending time in parts of Latin America or western Europe or east Asia and then coming back to the US, you can see a lot of ways in which we've built loneliness into the fabric of US culture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It goes beyond car culture. It's probably illegal to build a cafe within walking distance of your neighborhood or into the first floor of your apartment complex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Americans get an idea of how bad we have it when we go on vacation, but we don't see it as something that can be built at home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can attest both LatAm and Europe are quickly turning the same way. At least in the bigger cities. Take public transport and 70% are frying their brains with their phones on algorithmic timelines, dumb mobile games, or worse. Women even more. You go to a bar and try to start a conversation and people look at you like you are a creep or a scammer. I've heard this happens to Gen Z, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Public transport was never a place where you start conversation with a stranger. Nor even meant to be that space. I genuinely do not understand why would you pick public transport as a place where you would expect people to socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yes, I was using public transport before cell phones. And yes, women are using public transport more then men, always were, because if the family have only one car, man is typically the one using it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; or into the first floor of your apartment complex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wouldn't trust a cafe built into an apartment complex. I'd expect it to be low-quality, over-priced food placed specifically to try and make a quick buck off people who don't know any better or who physically can't get somewhere better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're right that it goes beyond car culture (and zoning laws are part of car culture), but I think it also goes beyond zoning laws. A lack of a social contract between people (individually) and businesses these days is probably involved, too. All these things are interrelated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're "literally surrounded" by cafes built into the first floor of your apartment complex? Because that's what I was very clearly talking about. Not shops within walking distance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(I didn't ask and don't care if you think your cheap meal's "very delicious," by the way. That's not the main indicator of quality. Many Americans would call a Big Mac "very delicious.")&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where do you live that this is so bizarre? Multi story buildings with retail space on the bottom and residential space at the top are very common in cities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I didn't ask and don't care if you think your cheap meal's "very delicious," by the way. That's not the main indicator of quality. Many Americans would call a Big Mac "very delicious."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s the point of this? This is just needlessly rude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a limit to the convenience factor. Fast food used to be cheap because it was faster than real food. Now it's expensive, and less real than it was to start with. A hip no-name cafe owned by a huge conglomerate charging $17 for a microwaved sandwich or something is objectively a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensuring you never have to leave the comfort of your apartment complex is also of questionable relevance to solving loneliness/getting people to meet each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; -t. not an Absurdist, but sometimes I use the tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did you accidentally paste part of a different comment or something?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've lived in places that had restaurants on the ground floor of the building and they were the same prices as anywhere else. I'm actually surprised you find this unrealistic since it's so common in Australian cities. It's pretty much standard to have retail on ground and apartments above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is common in American cities, too. And European cities I’ve visited. And probably most cities that I haven’t visited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I visited Tokyo one really jarring thing was to realize that restaurants and cafes and such were often on the 2nd or 3rd floor. It’s so dense and so high-rise, in some areas at least, that these “ground floor” shops are also pushed upwards and inhabit the bottom 2-3 floors instead of just the ground floor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why is that odd? Lots of apartment buildings in big cities have the first floor (or 2) for retail. Some apartments / condos have a whole mall downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As someone who was a libertarian as a child, I assure you the idea of relaxing regulations is quite unpopular.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lots of factors cause this. Obviously established businesses hate competition. There seems to be a tendency for politicians to make more laws as a bandaid rather than remove old(but this isnt universally true). And finally and probably most importantly, people like the status quo. Change is scary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also I live in the suburbs and we have a coffee shop within 2 minutes walking. I just have a hard time paying $4 for a coffee to meet people when most people are on their laptops anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My friends come from sports clubs, parties, and the parents of my kids via birthday parties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Americans get an idea of how bad we have it when we go on vacation, but we don't see it as something that can be built at home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's so strange how this works. They go, sometimes repeatedly, to enjoy these rather basic things, but behave as though they're visiting a quaint Disneyland of sorts and as though there could be no lessons they could take away and apply toward a vision of their own community...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I doubt it's the solution, but a silly program I want to build is something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Give users a modern Tamagotchi&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Give the digital pet a need to socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Strap a basic LLM to it so users can talk to their pet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Have the pet imprint on its owner through repeated socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Owner goes to bed, pet still has social needs, goes out into the digital world to find other pets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Pet talks to other pets while you're asleep, evaluates interactions, befriend those with good interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Owner wakes up the next morning, checks their pet, learns it befriended other pets based on shared interests, and is given an opportunity to connect with their pet's friends' owners. Ideally these connections have a better-than-random chance of succeeding since you're matched via shared interests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm sure there's a ton of unsexy technical reasons this is hard to make work well in practice... but dang, I think it would be so cool if it worked well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I realize this exacerbates the issue in some ways - promoting online-first interactions. But, I dunno. I'll take what I can get these days, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A thought-provoking vision. There seem many many underexplored opportunities for catalyzing social connections - match making.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I'm doing "broad and shallow" at a meetup, there are invariably "oh, you'll want to talk with X over there, they &amp;lt;overlap on some intent interest&amp;gt;". It can feel tragic to look out at a room of nifty people, in largely desultory conversations, knowing that there are some highly-valued conversations latent there, which won't occur, because our social and cultural and technical collaborative infrastructure still sucks so badly at all this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In lectures augmented by peer-instruction, addressing the "if you think your lectures are working, your assessment also isn't" problem, one version has students clicker-committing to a question answer, then turning to discuss it with a neighbor, then clickering again. One variant (which you now many not be able to use commercially, because of the failed-startup-to-bigco patent pipeline), has the system chose who everyone turns to (your phone tells you "discuss with the person behind left"), attempting to maximize discussion fruitfulness, using its insight into who is confused about what. So perhaps imagine Tamagotchis as part social liaison - "hey, did you know the gal at the optometry shop here also enjoys heavy bluewater sailing?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So on the topic question: Want to incentivize greater social contact...? Increase the payoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my mind, it's more like meeting new acquaintances at the dog park. Dogs start playing with each other and getting along and you end up chatting with the other dog's owner while watching the dogs play together. Trying to recreate those vibes with digital pets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Old geezer take: If you're referring to smart phones - social engagement in the US was already headed down 5 decades before those were invented. I blame TV.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No one is asking for this advice, but I'm sharing it anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My #1 top priority this year is _social health_. I'm taking it into my own hands. Mostly just continuing things I'm already doing with tremendous payoff. My measurable result is going to be throwing my own birthday party in fall. I've never done that before, I've never had enough friends in my city!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No one group or app is going to come save you from loneliness. You have to get up, go outside, and find people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;0. Say yes to everything, at least if you're new in town. Don't care how scared you are of X social situation. "Do it scared" - @jxnl&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. I am part of my community's swing dancing scene. I take classes, go to social dances, I _show up_ even when I don't feel like it. People recognize me now, know my name, etc. I'm also a regular at my gym. Find a place and be a regular face there. (_how did I become a swing dancer? I got invited, and my social policy prevented me from saying no!_)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. If I have no social plans for a week I do a timeleft dinner (dinner with 5 strangers). Always have something on the books. I call this my "social workout". If I vibe with anyone I ask if they want to grab ramen the following weekend. Leads me to point #3..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Initiate plans. Everyone is waiting for that text "hey, want to go do x with me?". Be that person. I have an almost 100% enthusiastic response rate to asking people to do literally anything. Go on a random walk? Go to costco? Go checkout ramen or pizza spot? You don't have to think of anything special. Whatever you're already doing.. ask someone to come with! Soon they start inviting you to do random stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. (experimental) I don't drink, which does curtail my social opportunities. I'm considering updating my drinking policy this year. My hypothesis is that the benefits of having a strong community out-weigh the health benefits of abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; 4. (experimental) I don't drink, which does curtail my social opportunities. I'm considering updating my drinking policy this year. My hypothesis is that the benefits of having a strong community out-weigh the health benefits of abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a very mature, balanced take. If I may advise: Try some experiments on yourself. You already know how you feel and how you socialise without drinking. Try drinking various amounts in different social settings. How does it feel? Do you like yourself and your life more before? Then go back. Else, continue experimenting until you find a sweet spot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It cannot be solved, at least not in the way I think people want it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re lonely because we are wired to avoid rejection and uncomfortable social situations, and because technology has given us hundreds of alternatives to sitting in the mess of connecting with people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can only solve it in your own life - by being courageous and spending more of your time in the physical world than in the digital one, willing to gro through the shitty feelings that come with being a human trying to meet other humans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You cannot solve it for other people. There’s no sexy solution here. Meetup.com or whatever dating app or tech platform or not for profit will not fix it, because it takes individuals choosing the hard path and that will never happen en masse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a twofold problem, I believe. People are lonely because of fear of rejection and also actively avoid new people out of caution and high standards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So two people who are otherwise lonely will make no effort to connect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think social networks have done a tremendous amount of damage to our collective psyche. Because on the web, you can single-click permanently block someone and never see them again. If you are admin of a group this person is in, you can also ban this person and prevent them from interacting with members of the group (in the group, that is, you cannot control private messages, but by banning someone from a community you are effectively isolating them), and I think we haven't considered how much power we are giving to random Reddit mods due to this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do believe high standards are behind a lot of the dating issues. Dating pools are so large that people hold out for the right combination of the things they find desirable--except they're never going to find that because they don't have exactly the right combination to attract that "perfect" match.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can't help but think that in 1910, both the concept of "fear of rejection" and "high standards" would have made no sense to people at the time. Yet I would agree that they are valid concepts today. We have to explore why these two concepts exist and why they did not exist in 1910. It seems valid to call them side effects of something bigger, what the bigger is I don't know. I don't see how society can address these two issues without addressing the other issues that lead to the existence of these.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure why you believe that "high standards" and "fear of rejection" didn't exist a hundred years ago. Think Gatsby, from the Great Gatsby (published 1925): dude longed for human connection (hence throwing massive parties), but was terrified of being outed as not belonging to the social strata he found himself in. That's fear of rejection. People being to good for others is basis of the class system, and that predates written history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reddit doesn't do hard IP bans, but they do a lot of fingerprinting to link alt accounts together and will ban them all. You can get around it but you have to be pretty careful, wiping cookies on all your devices, signing up from a new IP, never logging in to the old accounts again, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need weekly activity plans to introduce multi-racial, multi-age, multi-political people to each other in palaces for the people venues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read the book 'Palaces for the People'... Invest Billions in social infrastructure... and run the country like it was a retirement community. Everyone is welcome, everyone has value and we need to learn (with practice) how to love each other again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my opinion, it's entirely possible to build a social network or social media that doesn't incentivize rage but one that leads to actual friendships. I don't think internet itself is the issue, I think that the existing options just maximize outrage/drama and other negative addictive qualities rather than the slow-burn good things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seen some of this happening in Melbourne, Australia, and it's almost suffering from too much success. Recently a free concert had to be canceled because tens of thousands of people showed up and they couldn't handle the numbers safely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Very happy to see at least something is being tried to reverse the damage from covid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shame, Amyl and the Sniffers would've put on a hell of a show ;)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree though, Melbourne is absolutely bursting at the seam with events, groups and activities in almost anything you could possibly be interested in. It's particularly noticeable for me coming from Sydney. I saw someone in a local FB group suggest holding a whip-cracking jam meetup in a park and it generated significant interest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US is not lacking in public spaces, events and activities, or rec centres. The "loneliness epidemic" is a fairly modern phenomenon. Cities weren't structurally much different several decades ago, but now people choose not to leave the house, because they can amuse themselves to death there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So much of the pressure comes from horrendous working conditions from top to bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And as a secondary effect unions require meetings and hopefully cross organising with other unions having different people in them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we get better working conditions, we will have more time to meet other people rather than to sit exhausted with our phones having all the parasocial relationships that drain our social batteries without really connecting with a real person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a gap between thinking and action. I think the social media and gaming and online stimulions currently designed to bombard and drain your thinking brain, leaves nothing for the action you and your body needs to take. Your brain only has so much chemistry to trigger neural activation and we are blowing it on mental stress to the point where the body doesn’t have any more mental energy to tackle real world stress or handle real world emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try an A/B test. Do days with zero screen stimuli - no TV, no phones, no online interaction. Go into the world to a cafe, or a common area with people and do stuff. See how you feel and what you feel up to. Vacations might be good and relaxing because you disconnect. Maybe do it without paying for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having kids (with the right partner and good intentions as a parent) is a great way to avoid feeling lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kid(s) are tremendous source of connection. You may trade for a feeling of exhaustion, overwhelming responsibility, etc. but a lot less loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also go a step further and join support groups for parents. Community resources where kids play and parents can hang out and chat. Connection is built through shared experiences, and parenting is an experience you can share with other parents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between having kids and participating in events with other parents, there will be a lot less opportunities to feel lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's only a problem for people who want to find a spouse and have kids. You're going one step further down the "how" chain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My point had more to do with the fact that a lot of people are either undecided about kids or have decided not to have kids, and are then struggling with loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deciding you want to start a family and prioritizing it (the why) can come before the how.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm no expert in dating, but generally in life I've learned that it's easier to get my wants satisfied if I am clear about them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I want to start a family and find a partner who also wants to have kids" is a lot less abstract than "I want to feel less lonely".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, no, I don't think I missed a step. I just think that the best way to find a partner in parenting will depend a lot on the specific person, where they are, how old they are, what they do, etc and isn't conducive to general advice, and maybe HN is not the best place to figure it out?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s all about fostering community again, and that’s more than just shared calendars and town events.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s “third places” where folks can just hang out and work, play, share, and commiserate without having to pay money to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s bringing back establishments that promote lingering and loitering, like food halls or coffee shops, rather than chasing out folks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s about building community centers inside apartment complexes, more public green space, more venues and forums.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giving people space that doesn’t require a form of payment is the best approach, because humans will take advantage of what’s out there naturally. Sure, structure helps, but space is the issue at present I believe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it? There are a number of third places around here that sit effectively vacant. The few who are passionate about seeing those spaces thrive will tell you that the problem is getting anyone to come, not finding space to host them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ritual, purpose and community are what's required to build a group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I cured my own loneliness episode by joining a local running group. It provides the same kind of thing as church. Ritual, we meet every week and there's a few different groups. Purpose, it doesn't feel useless to be improving your fitness level. And community comes when you suffer through a run with others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Showing up regularly means you start to integrate people into your lives as you know when they skip a week for a vacation or something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I went from living in my town and not knowing anyone for 17 years to having 20+ friends or people I can say hello to and have a chat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just find a local running group, or start one. You want the "meet at Starbucks at 6:30 on Tuesday" ones. Show up and keep showing up and you'll make friends. It's impossible to be on your phone when you run and there's always something running related to keep the conversation going.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I doubt we can solve this for other people. Each person must solve it for themselves, but for most people the solution will be joining a church and attending weekly. From there, get involved with a ministry, that will lead to appreciation dinners, which will lead to getting invited to the non-religous stuff the people are involved with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have considered a "physical social network". Standing on my usual street corner and holding a sign that directs strangers to join me and whoever else shows up, for a casual chat at the local coffee place at a specific time, with a few topics for conversation listed on the sign up front. If anyone has ideas for those topics, let me know, I'm likely to do it this Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually I am open to the idea of an (minimalistic, non-profit) app helping solve this. What kind of app, I'm not sure, but I'm open to all ideas, including technology based ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I only said that because you reminded me of an idea I had, for a social experiment that tries to bring some "social media" elements into an in-person setting, to see what happens. (I do wish I could afford a camera and someone to man it, I've been told several times that I'd go viral.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When NextDoor first came around, I recall walking down the street to help a lady move her couch down to the ground floor. She then gave me some cookies she'd baked. Fun! The notifications it sends me these days are less enjoyable so I send them to spam because unsubscribing doesn't seem to reliably work for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Make a social network that is centered around people who live in a 1 kilometer radius…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't know if they still do, but Nextdoor required address verification via a postcard early on. I was pretty shocked at what some people in my area would post under their real names and locations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(And well outside the realm of political nonsense. Someone posted a pic of their toddler's first poop in the potty.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the power of shame has reduced significantly in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think shame is still powerful, but in the context of Nextdoor we just don't see our neighbors very often anymore. In many cases they might as well be random people on the other side of the country. I live in a small town and I'm quite friendly with my neighbors, but I still see and talk to them relatively rarely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you have a toddler it's very surprising what becomes normal. We're potty-training our son and I sometimes get texts from my spouse with a picture of a poop in a bad spot and then just the word "help."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone always gets the causality reversed. Social media didn't cause the epidemic, it filled a niche to help cure the epidemic. People were lonely long before the internet arrived, the internet just made it easier for those lonely people to connect to each other. And now many of them prefer the internet over socializing with people they don't care for that much in person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, the problem is structural. Moving to a new city where you don't know anyone, only work with people for a few years, and where there are no longer institutions like the church, how is anybody supposed to meet anyone? Meetups? Half the people can't even afford a car.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no solution other than meeting a lifelong partner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes of course people were lonely before the internet and social media, but that pushed them to go outside and solve the problem. Now they do the digital equivalent of taking drugs to make the problem go away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think you're oversimplifying and overgeneralizing. Plenty of people remained lonely back in the day, plenty of people socialize now. It's just that now they have the option to socialize through the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to the internet people were staying home and watching TV. The dynamic is much longer lived than you think. Check out the book 'Bowling Alone'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It used to be that you knocked on the door of the residence beside you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; And now many of them prefer the internet over socializing with people they don't care for that much in person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the crux of it. Your neighbours weren't ever likely to be your soulmate, but that is who was there to befriend, so you did. But now you don't have to. And since they now feel the same way, they aren't putting in the effort either.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also the problem of familiarity. It's awkward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditionally you'd live around the same people your whole life. Invariably they'd feel like family and it wouldn't feel awkward to get together. But that's not how modernity works. People move to different communities all the time, so it becomes difficult to build familial friendships with others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's the essential problem. The internet allows us to stay in touch with people who feel like family. That's what we want to do psychologically. If all those people were in the same city there'd be a lot more socializing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; People move to different communities all the time&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although now considerably less than in the past. Peak mobility occurred during the mid-1900s. Most, and increasingly more as time marches forward, will stay close to where they were born.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; That's the essential problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a problem for individuals in that situation, but does it explain a population-wide epidemic when most never actually leave their familial roots?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; If all those people were in the same city there'd be a lot more socializing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am among those who still live near where I was born and have known a lot of the people my whole life. Color me skeptical. Nobody has the time to. They're at work all day and when that's done it is into the car to drive their kid to who knows where to play in a sporting match thinking they are going to become a professional some day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a little different 15-20 years ago. You used to be able to go down to the community centre on a Saturday night and the whole town would be there, ready to mingle. But it turns out the draw was really alcohol, and when police started cracking down on drunk drivers and health concern messaging started to gain attention, it all dwindled pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's all about priorities, and socializing just isn't a priority for most people anymore. There are so many other things also vying for attention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree. When I say people lived in close proximity I don't mean 'across the city' or 'the next town over', I mean that traditionally you were actually in the same physical location where socializing required essentially no travel, and you'd often have to exist in communal spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These days even people who are nearby are still far. That 30 minute drive both ways along with coordinating a time is a lot of extra work to add onto an already busy life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if these same people lived on your street you could just pop over for a quick coffee. As is what actually happens. My wife and I have socialized with new friends in our neighborhood more than close family lately because they're right around us. The kicker is we built the friendships through our kids school and repeated proximity rather than artificially.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many large orgs have smaller chapters locally, but there are often regionally-relevant ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d start with personal passions, and work from there. It won’t really work, unless it’s something we care about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Volunteer orgs tend to be fairly disorganized, and there’s usually a lot of lively personalities. If one seems too dysfunctional, try another. Don’t just go for one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, it can take some time to get into the “inner circle.” Like any human society, trust takes time to build. We need to be willing to start small. Get to know the place. Figure out where we can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll bet that ChatGPT would be a great source of information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phrases like "I’d start with personal passions, and work from there" and "we need to be willing to start small" are NOT actionable, they are meaningless platitudes. Not to mention it assumes everyone has "personal passions," an the majority of people probably don't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't "just go for one." I spent like a month trying to volunteer , for anyone. I was on medical leave from work at time time so I had plenty of time to give. Nobody ever got back to me or picked up the phone. It was worse than applying for a job. I have an anxiety disorder, so even reaching out caused me massive stress and anxiety. So I caused myself distress to feel more worthless than I already felt. My heart is racing and I'm on the verge of tears just typing this up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I'll ask again, how does one "join a volunteer organization?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not the person that "ghosted" you, and don't think that I can give you what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The suggestion I gave, was in good faith, but it seems that your "question" was not. I am truly sorry that you had a bad experience, but I wasn't the one that did the nasty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;The suggestion I gave, was in good faith, but it seems that your "question" was not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My question was absolutely asked in good faith, not sure why you think it wasn't? You, yourself, made it sound very easy. I was looking for advice since you've made it sound like you've easily succeeded in volunteering and I wasn't able to. I was hoping, at the very least, for you to share how you got started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yeah, it's kinda offensive to get "draw the rest of the damn owl[ed]"[1] when you put yourself out there to genuinely ask for help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I still am asking for advice if you're willing to share. I would still love to volunteer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intentionally choose community and the effort it takes to build and cultivate it [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]. People are work, but you cannot live without community [6].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why, you ask? Because your comment seemed like you had read only the title and nothing else I wrote here, and wanted to contribute off the cuff links you had stored up. And you barely even bothered to summarize any of what they contain. I've been reading this book by Dr. Vivek Hallegere Murthy ever since you linked it, and it's definitely got some great insights into it, that mirror my own thoughts and struggles with this. But in your comment, it felt like a mere afterthought. And maybe that's fine, maybe that's fair, you're a busy guy and have your own stuff to do. It's not against the rules or general moral code to write a drive by comment. But it just feels like a low effort comment. Which is why I wanted to downvote it. And now that it's surfaced higher than mine, it just feels like pouring lemon juice on a papercut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you serious right now? I don't mean this in an insulting way at all, but I can see why you're dealing with loneliness. Take some time to self reflect and figure out why you lashed out here(seriously, really think about it or show some friends this dialogue without context and ask what they think, in person). Like the commenter, I hope you find you find your community, but you are far from the path. Your attitude is fixable, nobody is playing down the problems here and instead people who were in your shoes empathetically showed you a way out, but you need some serious self reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case it's not clear, original replier's comment here is absolutely correct and it doesn't necessarily have to be in a religious pretext (re: the church article), that's just a palpable example for most people. Neighbors, community centers, hobbies, etc-- these all require work on everybody's end and you must commit to these relationships to create a semblance of something to revolve your life around in lieu of drowning in loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For sure, my church citation wasn't about religion specifically, but that the decline in third spaces in general and a lack of community can be directly connected to early deaths and deaths of despair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Church does not have to be a church of faith, it can well be a church of reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What matters is that people with shared values get to spend time together on a regular basis without getting into status games that might eventually show up no matter what the church.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've tried a few types of churches of reason and they are pretty sad, honestly. Hard core, dedicated, non-religious person here, so I'm not saying that people should go to Church, but I've never seen anything approximating a Church of Reason that would have satisfied my (admittedly minimal) social desires.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hear you. For me things that have worked are those that are built around a hobby -- travelling to the wooded hills, astronomy, music recitals, caring for strays / abandoned pets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote that comment back when he had only one or two links, and this post had 4 comments anod 2 points. I stand by what I said: I wish I could have downvoted it for being a low effort drive by comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be blunt: what you said was completely out of line. You were mad that he wasn't responding to your other comment (why wasn't it in the OP if you wanted people to read that stuff before responding?). You then got mad that his comment was voted higher than yours (again, putting all that in the OP would've fixed that, not to mention complaining about vote counts is straight up childish).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just take the L man. You lashed out for no good reason, the person you responded had a hell of a lot more grace and tact than you showed this entire exchange, just learn from it and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agree to disagree. And as soon as I get to 500, I'm going to downvote his comment on principle alone, even if it happens next week. I'm not mad, and it's not about anything other than acting on what I believe to be right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You asked how to solve the loneliness epidemic. I provided citations and recommendations. Are you asking me how to be the person you need to be to make bids for friendship and connectivity to establish community? And where to find people you can have an opportunity to make connections with? I can do that too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I'm trying to reach those people who feel the way I feel have no way of connecting with anyone, or at least feel that they don't. Do you have any new ideas of how to achieve this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go out and find people looking for other people. Volunteer and find events and gatherings scoped to building connections between people. Third spaces are in decline [1] [2], or in some places, non existent. This will be work. It will not be easy. You will need to work on managing the feelings of rejection and shallow people not genuinely interested in you or building a friendship (boundaries are important in this regard; have them, communicate them, and enforce them). Success is not assured. But your only choices are to try or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From your comment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I also had it hammered into me as a kid that nobody wants me around, nobody could ever love me, I'm a failure, a burden, a creep, a weirdo, and nothing but a bothersome nuisance that nobody would ever want to spend 30 seconds alone with. I'm trying to reject these thoughts, but it's difficult when you have nobody to talk to. It's like pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. I wonder how many people have the same issue. I've made a few friends in person, but I rarely get to see them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In regards to this you commented, I highly recommend therapy if you can access it. It will help. This is an unnecessary burden to be carrying through adult life, and a professional might help unburden you of these feelings. The healthier you are emotionally, the easier it will be to create and maintain interpersonal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does all of this suck? Oh yes, certainly. But we play the hand we're dealt to the best of our ability. Good luck, in as genuine terms as I can communicate in text. If you feel like I can provide more value with more questions you might have, I will do my best to help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(tangentially, I recommend replacing "idiot who doesn't understand anything" with something more like "I am early in my journey to understand, but I look forward to the experience"; love yourself first, we are all learning and sharing for the portion of the timeline we share, and it is okay to not know if we continue to want and try to learn)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree you (OP) must work on developing a positive view of yourself. Maybe therapy. Don't overlook clergy even if you're not religious. Religion is as much about fellowship and how to live a fulfilling life as it is about worship. Some churches (e.g. unitarian) are quite inclusive and are much more spiritual than dogmatic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you will find it much harder to attract friendships if you come across as needy or wanting to unburden a lifetime of problems on your new prospective friend. Not to say a longtime friend can't eventually handle some of this, but it's not a good way to start off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would say avoid groups that are focused on personal success or networking. These tend to be full of people who are looking for an angle or benefit for themselves, not people genuinely trying to develop friendships and connections with a community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm a highly secular person and I see people constantly say things like "spiritual but not religious/dogmatic" and I cannot figure out what that is supposed to mean. What does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;In regards to this you commented, I highly recommend therapy if you can access it. It will help. This is an unnecessary burden to be carrying through adult life, and a professional might help unburden you of these feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not the GP, but I have the same experience to them. I have been in therapy and on psychotropic medication my entire adult life, that's 2.5 decades. I'd love to know when exactly the "unburdening of these feelings" happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might never happen for some, and that is terribly unfortunate (but not a reason to not make the attempt). I have no solution for that part of the human condition besides sympathy for bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd like to assert here that "community" can exist online as well. It's not just people staying indoors; it's about how they interact with what others write and whether they even care that another person wrote it. It's about things like coming to recognize usernames and build trust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, LLM generated content threatens that, so things have gotten worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I save myself from total loneliness by hanging out in the background through a virtual frosted glass with my friend (via the https://MeetingGlass.com/ app). We do that every day for a few hours. Its better than nothing. It gives a relief from being home alone. At least you can see that someone is out there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm wondering if there are any research groups led by sociologist that explore this topic which may be helped by a group of volunteer ?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've always wondered why applications like Tinder etc... have not been completely destroyed by open-source already ?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also forget that communities are essentially what allowed this escape in the first place ; I remember going to psytrance festivals but there are so many more escapes : theater, cinema groups, even in tech you have meetings for rust, programming languages and what not&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is definitely some kind of knowledge around being active in life ; and on that point I do not think that working count as active (I'm myself a workaholic so i'm definitely not the best example here)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are other drivers for isolation than not knowing how to integrate though - it's not always easy to find people who share those common interest or mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a very polarized time period which only exaggerate this - the best way to fight it off is to literally do something meaningless with people (eg : play)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I've always wondered why applications like Tinder etc... have not been completely destroyed by open-source already ?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same reason why Signal hasn't mogged WhatsApp, Telegram, Messenger, etc. Social apps have enormous network effects, and companies with large marketing budgets and early movers have big advantages when it comes to establishing a community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hard part of Tinder is not the software. It's marketing, moderation, balancing the needs of different users, etc. Something that makes the platform shitty for one type of user makes it more desirable for another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In urban areas, we really should have less cars. But it’s emblema of a deeper issue; the interests of control and convenience in one’s time has crowded out everything else. If you have an established social circle and a decent income there’s never been a better time to take charge of your social life. Unfortunately the most able to change the system for those who have neither of these things are the least likely to understand. It’s a tough and old question to be honest&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of very good suggestions already. I found meetups are also really good for finding people with similar interests to hang out with and another upside is usually you can also learn something new from meetups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social media and on demand media hijack the emotional triggers that would usually be resolved by talking to people. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* In line at the BMV, bored and feeling lonely. Should resolve loneliness by talking to strangers in line... mostly chit-chat, but sometimes you make a friend! Social media turns this into doom scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Sitting in the living room by yourself, feeling a little lonely. Should result in calling up a friend or relative, or heading to get a coffee/beer where you can interact with people. On demand media turns this into low risk watching shows (yes, old school TV was an option, but on demand, there's always something on that is interesting).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the trick is to make yourself ask if you should give someone a call or go somewhere public when you are pulling out the phone with intent to scroll or watch a show. When you find something you are interested in because you are watching lots of videos about it, or replying on forums, force yourself to engage in the real world. If you are arguing politics, find a group advocating your position and get involved (I've got to meet three majority leaders and two Presidents, plus a bunch of congresspeople you see on the news all the time as a side effect of getting involved because I was pissed off on the internet about business taxation issues). If you find a hobby, find a local group that does that. Learning to play the guitar from YouTube was fun, but jamming with other musicians? Off the charts fun and far more educational that just playing along with videos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, and this is the big one, try to never eat meals alone. Never say no to going to lunch with coworkers. Join stuff that meets for breakfast. Dinners are hard, but it's surprising what happens when you invite a couple people over for dinner and a beer once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on something called Open Enough Design (OED). The core idea: most rooms force a binary choice between total isolation (the bunker) and overwhelming exposure (the stage). Neither works. What works is a dial you can adjust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my book "Leave the Door Open" I suggest simple, high leverage moves anyone can do. Three examples of practical moves that cost nothing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-Turn your chair to face the door instead of a wall. Your nervous system relaxes when it can see who's coming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- If you live alone, open your door or window four inches for an hour. The sounds of life beyond your walls remind your body you're not alone on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Put out a second chair. Even if no one visits. It shifts your internal posture from "no one is coming" to "I'm expecting life to enter."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Small changes, I know. But the room shapes you as much as you shape it. It's a virtuous cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I write about this at oedmethod.substack.com if you want to go deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a fear of crowds and bums. Not where I'm paralyzed/medicated but one thing I'm trying to do is go downtown and do street photography. I wonder how do I say no to a stranger asking me for money. Or fear of getting robbed. It's not like my camera gear is that expensive but yeah. This would push me to get out there more as I've lived in the same place for 10 yrs and I haven't really explored/gone around much. Other than when I did Uber Eats, I would go all over the place. I would get wasted/drink at bars but end up with nothing end of the day, temporary day-long friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Funny I was at the gym yesterday, guy said hello to me, as a guy that keeps to himself usually (unless around friends) I gave him a bad look (not on purpose) and then I responded. I'll say hello next time I see him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah for me it's just fear and lack of exposure. I do make a lot of "work friends" go on walks. But yeah real friends I think I have 4 or 5 lifelong real friends. Women nothing, haven't been laid in like 12 years pretty said to say. Unfortunately it's something I value myself like "I'm a loser by not getting laid". Even though rest of my life is good, 2BR apt, sporty car, six-fig job, but yeah. It's my social awkardness, but I lift/improve myself, cutting down on weight I want abs. Idk I'm not going after women anymore either just trying to live life now, do shit, get out of debt, get out of 9-5, mental freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's funny if it's guys I'm very "charismatic" like I can be "everyone's friend" which doesn't work out due to conflicting interest. To that end it's really about taking an active interest in the other person, engaging them, asking them questions and remembering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My thing with women is I don't get along with them like a guy (where I don't want anything from them physically). If they're not attractive then it's easier to talk to them but yeah, I guess that comes from a desperation mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I found after many years, is that women (people in general, really) are not attracted to people who try too hard to get attention from them. Going through great lengths tends to result in being labeled as desperate or creepy. Try just to be friendly and talk "with" them and not "to" them, almost as if you are one of them. By doing that often enough, it will feel less awkward. Practice makes perfect. And then one day you feel a click with someone. Just my few cents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah that's the cliche saying, let them chase you or don't put on a pedestal. Idk not sure if it's because I was raised by women that I need their approval (no male figure). But I know other people who were in the same situation and aren't like me so it must be a personal choice/way you decide to overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh you haven't gone anywhere near far enough with this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You'll get laid the most when you adamantly pretend like you're not interested in getting laid. You actively have to act like you are "too good" for them. Play "hard to get". Learn what "negging" means.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Never, ever, show desperation for anything ever for any reason. It is the ultimate ick. Buddhists will even tell you that desire is ontologically/spiritually evil and icky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hear me out. Its not just social awkwardness. You're experiencing class boundaries and do not seem to have the right mentality to bridge the gap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, you call homeless people bums, which sets the stage for how you see and treat them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm an excellent engineer, but I was abused and impoverished as a child, homeless as a teenager. During my 20s, I started a few companies but my savings have been continually depleted taking care of family members. I don't have a sports car or a big bank account, or nice cameras. When I see a stranger or homeless person, I smile and wave. I keep cash on me so that I always have some to give out. I buy people lunch and sit on the curb eating with them and attempting to understand them. I learn the names of my local homeless folk and ingratiate myself in the community. I've moved to a few cities so I've had the opportunity to do this a few times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't do this because I lack social anxiety; I sometimes have extreme agoraphobia, to the point that I have to hype myself up for hours just to go to the grocery store, and I have to wear noise-cancelling headphones to reduce the amount of stimulation. I have PTSD. I'm an extreme introvert. A hermit at times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what saves me is the philosophical understanding that I have a duty to the social contract. That empathy and direct aid are nonnegotiable parts of being human. I've been homeless and I know what it's like to be truly hopeless and live a life of uncertainty, fear and hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need to bridge that gap. Class-induced anxiety is real and I acknowledge that it's probably difficult, but it's not an excuse. You sound like you're in a position to change someone's life. Taking those steps might change your own life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I buy people lunch and sit on the curb eating with them and attempting to understand them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I clearly don't have the same people on the street as you do. You should not be just sitting down and having lunch with people who are having daily psychotic breaks or are otherwise aggressive. You can't have a conversation with someone who is constantly riding the line of ODing. I have a regular I see who runs around in the road screaming at cars and people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The very incomplete "down on their luck" view of homelessness is killing progress in my city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have lived in many metropolitan areas and have seen the gamut of homelessness. As I mentioned in a downline comment, the trick is to ignore the people who are not in a position to receive help, and actively seek those who are in such a position. I am not suggesting walking up to random homeless folk in San Francisco who are tweaking out and hanging out with them. I am not suggesting to risk your safety by approaching the first person you see. You live in your area; study it, pay attention, and over time you'll start seeing some familiar faces. This has worked for me in New Orleans, it worked for me in Texas and worked for me in California.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I'm willing to bet that my understanding of homelessness is more nuanced/holistic than even yours. I have been homeless. Have you?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What progress do you feel is being hindered by a collective display of compassion?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's funny there was a moment I was at a bus station, somebody asked me for money and I dumped all the coins I had in my wallet in their hand for future bus rides. And some lady comes up to me jokingly like "you handing money out? what about me".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But yeah I think I should just give the money out, I think aside from the guy at the red light that's there almost everyday when it's warm, it's rare I encounter somebody personally. Until I go into the city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Buy someone new clothes. A sleeping bag. Utensils. A library card or bus pass. If it has to be cash, you don't have to stop at $5. I sometimes give out tens and twenties. Obviously at a place like California your altruism can be spread pretty thin; just ignore the people who are more difficult / less appreciative. Find someone who is appreciative. Get to know them and find out what is holding them back. Maybe you can't help, maybe you can. I've had people tell me I've made their day, their week, their year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's that thing though I'm pretty sure I was scammed by this couple at a gas station asking me for "gas money" even though they wanted cash then the lady said "your mother raised a good boy" lmao.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me this is a gov problem not an individual problem. Yeah if someone was dying in front of me I would try to help them. But now I gotta go to a store and buy em a tent and what not? I guess I am an asshole. Also read up "do you give money to homeless" on reddit. Almost all of the answers are no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have to go there and face my fear. See if I do get assaulted, I'm a 6ft buff dude so I don't think so but I'm also not a trained fighter. I just hate this fear, that normal people like living in NYC deal with on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting jumped is real though, I've been jumped before by a group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Might as well just give the $5 though and move on with my life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back to women, I have negative traits as demonstrated above, indecisiveness and low self-esteem/caring about what other people think of me too much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All this stuff is stupid, "I'm a good person because it's what people think you should do" give money to a non-taxed church, politicians, etc... then the individual person not giving a dollar to a homeless person is a bad guy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been fucked over plenty times, sometimes to the tune of 5 digits. Once even cost me my home, and I found myself homeless again for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A good friend of mine once gave someone a ride at a gas station, and they led him to a house where another person jumped inside the car with a gun. They held him hostage, tried to force him to do fentanyl at gunpoint, and drove him around to several ATMs so he could empty out his account. They used his vehicle to sell drugs, and held him hostage in a motel room where they were also sex trafficking women. They nearly killed him, and he is lucky to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also know others who have been jumped around here and had the shit beaten out of them. For reference, I live in a city frequently cited as a "murder capital" of the US. You have to be way more careful out here than in downtown San Francisco. As far as NYC, I imagine it's a mixed bag depending on your area. I'm not suggesting naively approaching strangers, I hope it doesn't come across that way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You aren't an asshole if you don't buy someone a tent, I was suggesting ways to help that have more tangible impact than handing someone a $5 bill which probably just goes towards an addiction. I don't hang around Reddit, so I can't speak for the general callousness of the community, but what I'm suggesting is to go beyond the average, to do more than most would, in reverence of the fact that we're all floating on this lonely space rock together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As far as women, all I can say is that my girlfriend would be fine with any of those traits, as long as I still maintained a level of compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also the thought of too many people to help. Like right now there are thousands/millions of people starving is it my fault? Should I empty all of what I have to help them because I'm guilty if I don't. That's what I'm wrestling with granted what we're talking about is not the same thing. Handing somebody $5 and moving on is not that but yeah idk. I guess as a person that keeps giving shit out eg. $100K to my own family, it gets old.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I will go out there, I'll see what happens. I need to face my fears.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hear you. I've had ungrateful family members drive me broke. Compassion is doing the right thing, even when it's scary, or it hurts, or no one is watching, or when people around you misunderstand and demonize you, or they are just plain ungrateful and leave you holding the bag. I admire your willingness to continue grappling with it and finding your own answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regarding women again, are you meeting enough of them? What's the scene like where you live? I don't know what it's like in NYC, but the social/dating scene in my current city just doesn't exist, and I'm watching some of my friends grapple with seriously heartbreaking loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't know what to tell them. I'm dating my high school sweetheart again, but we were broken up for several years, and many of the experiences I had with women during that time were quite traumatic. The rest of them were just not a good fit. I had completely given up on dating altogether, at least for a period of time, and only then did the love of my life find her way back to me. Despite years of extreme loneliness in new cities, I still consider myself lucky and wish I had some actionable advice I could tease from the situation. I've even experimented with building dating apps because this epidemic just scares the shit out of me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not in NYC sorry to give that impression. I was mentioning NYC as far as being densely populated, I'm in the midwest. Honestly I don't meet much women outside of work or the occasional girl I run into at a gym. I know the cliche saying "go join a club" meet girls that way. I could see that but it's also possible I like being alone too but yeah it just bothers me that my self-deemed value is whether or not I get laid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other problem too today is the fakeness of social media, filters on faces, photos looking like peopel go to beaches all the time/live extravagant lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bars it's like a self-control issue, use drinking for courage then you get too f'd up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the midwest but we have a small "city" with "skyscrapers" that I wanted to go into and do photography at.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found it uncomfortable as a kid when I saw how my parents handled begging: ignoring it. I remember one time my father saying "that's ok". And I either say "no, sorry" or ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've heard of kids from cities being given money so they always have something to give a mugger instead of looking like you're holding out, I don't go that far but I remember it to keep perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently made an effort to carry cash with me so I can leave tips in cash, still working on that. Would you be open to keeping singles on you to give? You can even give max of one per excursion and then decline or ignore the rest or any combination but maybe having that as a plan can help you feel comfortable. Yes you're training yourself and it's because you deserve the benefits of training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for non-bums hello is good, also fist bumps and nodding upwards; that stuff is cool AF and make people so damn happy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah it's funny I'll sound like I'm virtue signaling here, I donate. Food groups, NHA, stuff like that. Where I live there's usually a person at a red light waiting to "ambush" you. Same at a grocery store, soon as you exit the door solicitors going "excuse me sir".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But yeah it would be easy to just have a $5 to hand out. It's just you know how many people are there and will it stop there kind of thing. Yeah I sound like an asshole I get it. I also have sent over $100K to my own family in support and I'm -$80K in debt so it's not like I'm hoarding my money or something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It just annoys me. But sure it'll be easier to just say "here you go" and hand out cash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my experience a few times people will ask for money if they see you giving someone else something, but not that often, and you can shrug through it and say that was your last dollar or something. Keep the interactions short and easy and try to carry the loose bills outside of your wallet so no one can actually see how much you have inside it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exactly one time after I did this, a guy asked me to send something to his venmo since I really only had a dollar. Probably my strangest interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah I'll probably be smart and just empty my wallet except ID and some loose cash. I just don't like it the idea someone coming up to you asking you for money and you're expected to just do it, give it to them. It's funny too as soon as they get what they want or don't get what they want, they're like f you and move on. Ahh well I just wish I didn't care. I'm too soft/care what other people think of me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's like points on a website "oh no I got downvoted", there's a thing as being you/not being a conformist&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think I purposefully need to get into a fight you know overcome it, like expect anyone who comes up to me to fight me&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm gonna stop ranting but it's not like it's hard to get laid, it's just my standards are high like she's gotta be a dime or fit at least. So that means I also have to be fit/good looking which I haven't cared much before as far as good haircut/good clothes. I at least am lucky with my genetics for fitness but I also have not been as cut as I could be. But ultimately I know it's my mind that's f'd.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don't sound like an asshole because you aren't saying bad things about the people who have the least.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's up to you, you can just, to yourself, write down the words you'll use to write down that you'll ignore them to become more comfortable with your boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally I don't think handing out cash is helpful so it's not about charity it's my advice to pre-plan how you'll respond to be more comfortable than you are in reaction to these situations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a quick escape though to be like "here you go" and move on but also opens you up to "that's it?" I've had that happen even when I said "I don't have cash" well I have Venmo I'm like alright... yeah I don't want to have this mindset but also can't be naive too kumbaya.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not lonely, but occasionally wish I had some meaningful friendships. Most people who want to be my "friend" just want something from me -- a job, help them move, buy their dumb products, watch their kids, drive them to the airport, whatever else they want to dump on me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I get that comes with friendships, but people go from zero to super favors in 2.1 seconds these days. Seems too burdensome, so I typically tell people to F off -- easier that way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My wife will drag me to some social events. I have a hard time relating to any of the guys. The ones I meet are all obsessed with sports and entertainment. Did you watch the game? No, oh...well; did you go skiing last week? No, Oh...I gotta go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like a good football game, but the world is burning; I can't pretend it isn't. I'd like to help but don't know how. I just work on building my business to have enough resources to possibly make a slight difference; maybe I'll die without actually doing so, and it would have been better to just distract myself until I die, but my brain doesn't work that way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social media is just one big psyops. I liked X until major players started taking over and now it seems like Claude owns X as everyone just posts how Claude Code just vibe coding them 4,000 bitcoins in 24 hours. Quit all social media because it's just distorted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be honest, gave up on being friends with anyone about 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Damn. There are some things here that resonated with me and some that don’t. I had a time of my life where I just felt like I didn’t vibe with my ex’s friends. We’d go to parties and these people would feel so shallow. Having grown up poor around a bunch of perpetually rich people made me feel different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You also said that the world is burning, and it is to some defree. But it’s also filled with so many kind and amazing people making an impact where they are. Sure, maybe the gal serving coffee isn’t fixing climate change but she’s making the person she’s talking to that day feel special. That’s important too. Same goes down the soccer coach who’s helping kids find passion in something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The world is full of contradictions and imperfections. It’s also full of kindness and generosity everywhere you go, if you’re looking for it. If you’re looking for ways to validate that the world is burning, your gonna find those too&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social media blows, I hate it too. I’m not entirely sure society is moving in the right direction, but I’m just an atom in the ocean. I can affect those around me and hopefully those people affect more. My hope is that my joy spreads through other people, and if it doesn’t, that’s ok too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m bummed you’re hurting, and with a job and a million responsibilities it can be hard to lift your gaze to see the forest for the trees&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for the reply. I've accepted reality, so not really hurting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've got a wife, kids, 2 dogs, and more work than I can possibly do. I have plenty to do, but I lean toward Nihilistic thoughts like what is the point of all of this. I'm religious and have faith that my life has meaning, but sometimes it's hard to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally, I've found the most effective way to cope is just to accept things as they are and keep myself busy. The world is constantly saying that happiness is right around the corner if you are just smarter, richer, or better looking. Realizing that it's not true and finding contentment is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your experiences are fine but don't completely give up and focus on what you can control. Like you can post your thoughts on social media. And don't expect views. Just just write for your own sake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That would keep you busy and leave room for serendipity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make Single Room Occupancy (SRO) housing legal again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having barely room for little more than a bed forces you to get out during the day. Stuff happens when your default for where to spend your time is not at "home". SRO halls also usually had more room for common spaces to meet and socialize with other people in a similar position in life, and of course, SRO is a very cheap housing option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I lived on a kibbutz for nearly three years after university and had similar levels of personal space. While I definitely would not want to live on a kibbutz for my whole life, there were very significant downsides (internal politics), I made some lifelong friends there and overall consider that experience to have been very positive, in particular for my social life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;that's not comparable to SRO in the city, where you'd be sharing living space with far more diverse and vibrant characters. no one in their sane mind would choose to live in one of those, unless they were on the brink of homelessness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh we definitely had diverse and vibrant characters, and that was part of what made living there fun. I also find it strange that in a page about solutions to loneliness, you reject one that, by your own admission, would introduce someone lonely to a wide variety of new people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if you're trying to use it as a euphemism for drug addicts, I think you'll often find that they end up homeless, despite there being SROs, because they spend their SRO rent on drugs instead, and they get evicted. If you're trying to use a euphemism for sex workers, the successful SROs usually had strict rules around the Single Resident part.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically it's just like hotels, in the sense that there are both seedy, run-down, crummy hotels and there are upscale hotels. That there are some crummy hotels is not an indictment of hotels in general. If you make the category legal, you will find worse and better examples, and lonely people would have their choice of establishment that would help put them back into close proximity with others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a minor thing, but as an introvert, I really try and push myself to model social behaviour to my kids. Saying good morning to people in the street, chatting to other dog owners, being nice to waiters, travelling by bus, there are lots of tiny opportunities every day to show that world is full of lovely people who aren’t scary at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From wikipedia: ” An epidemic (from Greek ἐπί epi "upon or above" and δῆμος demos "people") is the rapid spread of disease to a large number of hosts in a given population within a short period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with covid, individual actions are not enough to stop the spread of the epidemic. You need vaccinations, health education, public policy etc. not just individual actions, so ”go dancing” and ”talk to people” doesn’t quite cut it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seems strange to me that at this site from the whole internet people don’t seem to see the connection between the raise of new technologies and lonelines (with a host of other mental health/social issues). And therefore this is the one problem the nerds don’t seem to be able to solve…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I cannot either, but I think we need to start looking at technology from a point of view of public health. Some sort of sociology/medical studies on the effects of computing on human body/mind and society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Seems strange to me that at this site from the whole internet people don’t seem to see the connection between the raise of new technologies and lonelines (with a host of other mental health/social issues). And therefore this is the one problem the nerds don’t seem to be able to solve…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It doesn't seem that strange that a website with a few thousand geeks isn't able to solve a global phenomenon by commenting on an article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HN is a place for discussion. It seems unreasonable to expect world changing outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suspect the "think global, act local"-motto applies here. You can certainly make a local impact by "going dancing".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I go to tech meetups, I often see a great deal of people sitting alone using their phones, because interacting with people you don't know is scary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try to resist! Yeah it's scary but most tech-heads are as nerdy/goofy as you and are interested in all the details of whatever you hacking on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working with https://fractal.boston/ and adjacent communities for the last year and my loneliness has been cured. I now have the opposite problem where I don’t get enough time to myself!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;joint families. In India those who have joint families – I live with siblings and parents in a multi-floor house with a floor for each sibling family. We party, visit temples and celebrate festivals/holidays together and don't need anyone else to join us. We also catch diseases together and help each other out during such times. It was conscious decision to remain together and not something we inheritted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this might sound unusual, I have a cousin that felt incredibly lonely when they came to the US for work and decided to go back just to be closer with the extended family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That being said, Im not sure if this is actionable advice for people that don’t already live in societies where this is a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build human scale cities with narrow streets and lots of outdoor parks and easily accessible reliable and frequent public transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not our American excuse for cities ruled by automobiles and asphalt everywhere with very limited options of all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PS - I imagine I’ll be downvoted because the epidemic is world wide and not unique to the US. That said, our acute situation is unique in that our infrastructure literally steers you into loneliness and no chance of randomly bumping into people and striking conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the other comments are wrong. The only right answer is: “Your mom was right, it’s that damn phone (and TV).”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was a big YouTube addict, and last year I did a full year of YouTube detox. I didn’t watch any videos at all, and my social life exploded. I was meeting new people every day, deepening my connections with old friends, and going to more social gatherings than ever before. By the end of the year, my only problem was that I had accumulated too many friends and acquaintances and didn’t have enough time for all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So yeah, it’s that damn phone. And if anyone says otherwise, they’re wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Pass a law letting people WFH where its reasonably possible. I WFH in a walkable city and me and my friends try new restaurants every week, always around noon. I've met lots of new people, and joined new groups that I wouldn't have found out about if I was stuck at my desk. Give people more freedom of movement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you have any strong evidence that this would improve the situation? It may be correlative and not causative, but as working from home is increasing, it seems that most related statistics to loneliness are increasing as well. What if it's actually part of the problem and not the solution?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not saying that I have evidence on hand to the contrary, just trying to challenge the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It looks like every comment here is suggesting that lonely people should do something to feel less lonely. But that's not how you stop an epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The epidemic is a systemic things, and you don't solve systemic things by giving advice to individuals. You solve systemic things by changing the whole culture. and you change the whole culture by large scale initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its mostly social anxiety. Which makes sense. Children have progressively been raised more and more on screens and devices. Teenagers rely more and more on technology to solve problems. Adults do too. No one has to interact anymore, which means many people no longer know how. Cue the anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In previous generations, you had to interact with others to get anything done at all. Kids had to play with kids, parents had to talk to the postman, the milkman, the newspaper boy, the telephone operator, the neighbors, you name it. It was a necessity for a functional life, so people did it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a difficult problem to want to solve. Some of it has to do with low income or joblessness. So this is the first focus I would set - make income easier to come by, more fair, more distributed. This in itself will not fix the solo state of people but it would alleviate some worries. Then we have to tackle the social problem. This is really difficult to want to solve. Activity helps, so the state should be able to encourage more activity overall. For instance, in my own youth I was physically more active, so you meet a lot of people through sports - that alone works fairly well. You can probably think of many more cohesive social structures and what not. I think it is a difficult to want to solve problem though. Not everyone uses social media by the way but is still isolated; Japan even gave some odd name to this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Get rid of AI chat bots, limit social media use to federated platforms, get out more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Encourage cities to build spaces for people rather than cars where folks can meet up without the pressure to buy things and leave. Spaces for walking and hanging out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm also in this group, so I have a few theories as to what causes it and how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For one thing, I was severely traumatized as a kid, which delayed a lot of my social skills. I'm catching up but not all the way there yet. When my social battery is full, I can do pretty well, but if I'm even a little down, it's basically impossible to act normally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also had it hammered into me as a kid that nobody wants me around, nobody could ever love me, I'm a failure, a burden, a creep, a weirdo, and nothing but a bothersome nuisance that nobody would ever want to spend 30 seconds alone with. I'm trying to reject these thoughts, but it's difficult when you have nobody to talk to. It's like pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. I wonder how many people have the same issue. I've made a few friends in person, but I rarely get to see them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well I've started doing public surveys in my nearby big city, and documenting the results. I just hold out a posterboard that says "how alone do you feel"[1] or "have you ever been in love" etc, and hold out a marker, and people come up and take the survey. At first I did this out of sheer loneliness and boredom. But I have done it for enough months that some people have come up to me and told me that I've helped them, or that they look forward to my signs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to reach those people who feel the way I feel have no way of connecting with anyone, or at least feel that they don't. Do you have any new ideas of how to achieve this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've posted this thought a few times in different ways, but in my experience, community is found and then built.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regularly sharing space with others is the way to start finding community. I think your surveying is an example of that. The next step is when the interactions begin taking place outside of the regular time/place, as evidenced by your epilogue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I haven't posted before is anything about how to successfully create those connections. Maybe we get lucky and someone will share our taste in music or movies or what have you, and the connection will be almost effortless. But to increase the rate of connection, I've found that learning to ask good questions is key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can learn a lot from popular interviewers like Terry Gross, Johnny Carson, or James Lipton. But to provide some direct tips: Lead with open-ended questions (i.e. not "yes or no"). Ask follow-up questions. Share a little bit while asking questions (e.g. "I'm not really into X music, more Y. Where would I start if I wanted to listen to X?")&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, sometimes friendships just aren't meant to be. It's tough, and can feel like a waste of time to have made the connection, but I've been surprised multiple times when a conversation that seemed like a slog of a one-off led to fruitful friendships later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After my dad died from cancer in 2018, I saw first hand the resulting loneliness and the lack of resources available. Being an engineer, I figured I might as well try to solve it, at least for some people. In 2020, I started a non-profit for small support groups[0]. We're small, and I've been mostly funding it myself, but it's growing. The main issue is we don't have the resources to cover every topic, so it's not for everyone (yet). Happy to chat if you have feedback, email is in my profile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traumatic childhood almost always messes with how one attaches with people. A small exceptional fraction somehow manage to remain unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When attachment styles get warped, behaviors that were a self protective behavior in childhood, become self-defeating behaviors in adult life. The person is quite oblivious to all this because those behaviors and fragile modes of attachment feel perfectly normal -- it is like growing up in a different g (acceleration due to gravity).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It feels like - I am right, it's the others who are wrong, unfair, greedy, needy, flakey, stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me this book [0] was very helpful for understanding what's going on in and around me&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only thing you have to catch up on is that there is nothing to catch up on. Everyone is at some stage of growth. No one is ever done growing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am impressed by your surveys. You're being open and engaging the world. That's awesome. Now hearing your story, I'd be happy to engage you or even buy you a coffee to hear the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet if I saw you on the street with a sign, I would likely hustle past. I've lived too long in big cities, and I've developed a crusty shell. So if I pass you by and ignore you, I apologize. I am the one with the problem. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like this poster thing. Anything that gives people a little connection to those around them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I sometimes sit on my front step and play guitar. 9/10 people ignore me but usually I'll have one or two nice conversations with a neighbor, and have made a couple friends this way. It helps that I live in a dense walkable place with lots of people who are similar to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've done sidewalk art with my kid. Between Spring and Fall last year, I'd make a new drawing every time it rained. Rarely was there a day without chalk on my sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did it to play with my kid (and learn a little Japanese by writing the title in kanji), but another outcome was talking to neighbors. I keep to myself and have been told I'm difficult to approach, but people often come up and compliment the drawings. One lady said that, when walking with her granddaughter, she makes sure to see what's new on my sidewalk. It's been a very "low risk" way to put myself out there. I draw without anyone looking, and chatty people come to me while I'm in the yard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wondering if your results are skewed towards people who are outside and therefore have a higher probability of not being lonely by virtue of them being amongst people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Helping people like you are seems like an amazing start. Maybe try to get a pyramid structure going where you teach people to help other people and then they teach people and then it’s a movement? But at all times a low level of effort so there is no pressure other than just holding up a sign or a marker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve found the hardest thing is breaking the ice and the sign / marker normalises a low stakes interaction where one participant can walk away at any time&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've thought a lot about this since you wrote it. I do wonder if this could become a pyramid activity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One problem is that it has to be people who are relatively comfortable talking to strangers, which by definition excludes the main people I'm trying to reach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, I wonder if there's a middle ground. Maybe people like myself, who feel unfulfilled, but don't have too much difficulty talking to strangers, could be the ones who hold the signs. And we could help those people get to the point we're at... it could work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think teaching people so that they can teach others is a necessity. I've fond that the most effective meetups are the ones where people have a shared sense of ownership, which includes being welcoming to people who are new. One board game group I am a part of ran for 2 years without an official host for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I was a small child, my grandfather used to beat me savagely and shake me and pin me to the ground, screaming that the devil was inside of me and that I would never be capable of loving or being loved. This was literally beaten into me. He'd beat me with the buckle end of the belt, like a whip, hitting my face, arms, whatever he could. He'd keep beating me until I couldn't cry anymore, telling me that men are not supposed to cry, and that it was his responsibility to teach me not to cry. I flashback at least once a day to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, he was wrong. I love a lot. So much that sometimes it's unbearable. I cry all the time. Sometimes out of pure love for someone. And there are people who I think love me. Of course the doubt is permanently sewn in. But my heart goes out to you, seriously. I love you just for existing and being yourself, and I hope you're okay. We're not alone. Email's in my bio if you ever want to talk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just want to say thanks for sharing your burden and how you were able to overcome it so others can be inspired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel like nowadays people are really encouraged to never display any vulnerability. It goes totally against the hype and hustle culture of the attention economy. To do that so candidly takes a lot of courage and confidence, and that's really impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm sorry that happened to you and I'm glad you're doing well. And if that doubt ever seeps into your thoughts, remember they were full of shit and you're absolutely capable of loving and being loved.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I appreciate the sentiment, but knowing that it's entirely coming from you and your experiences, and nothing to do with me and my own personality except for the one thing we have somewhat in common, means that your comment is to me merely a representation of you and what you stand for. Which is great and beautiful, but it doesn't cross the bridge of being a meaningful comment on my end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's actually the exact problem I'm facing, so it's incredibly relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A year ago, I was talking to the local Catholic priest (I was donating some religious statues that I had effectively inherited), and it came up in conversation that I was going through a rough time. He went in for a hug, and it felt so absolutely empty and disingenuous. I accepted it merely to avoid a scene, but it was absolutely not welcome or meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I'm out in the city, I want to reach out to those people who put that they feel "100%" alone just like I do. I wrote in the article some of my thoughts and feelings on this, and some things I tried and didn't try.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But ultimately, that's the gap I want to bridge now. We have a thing in common. How do we go from there? (Not you and me, but me and a stranger who has the same problem as me that they want to solve.) What do I say next? What's the next thing we can do in that interaction, or maybe a later one if I ever see them again? This is my question to myself, what I'm wondering in this whole post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; it's entirely coming from you and your experiences, and nothing to do with me and my own personality except for the one thing we have somewhat in common, means that your comment is to me merely a representation of you and what you stand for. Which is great and beautiful, but it doesn't cross the bridge of being a meaningful comment on my end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Man, well said. People who "over engage" are doing it out of a sense of kindness, but you're right that it feels hollow and is really just about them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the solution to this is basically what you're doing. Build small connections via whatever engagement mechanism you can and let them organically grow into meaningful ones. Jumping from zero to pretending you have a meaningful connection is exactly why those gestures feel hollow. There is no shortcut, it takes time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sounds like you're making those initial connections with your signs, which I think is great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not a doctor or anything, but what happens if you check your assumptions about someone's actions being hollow or making it about them and consider that they actually want to support you and show you love or empathy as a possibility? Removing some of our own defensive layers might be a first step - though I understand how difficult that can be since we've been burned so many times and they layers are there for a reason!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can assure you that there was nothing performative or hollow about my comment. OP said something that resonated with me, and so I shared my story in an attempt to bridge and find commonalities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's possible you are just projecting biases onto my comment. I'm not sure what "over-engaging" is, but you're free to ignore my comment if you feel that it was too personal or too long. I don't however, understand the contempt, or insinuations that I am attempting to take some kind of shortcut with personal connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can connect quickly with strangers if both parties are receptive. And as I just mentioned to OP, I have made life-long friends from this site, who I have met multiple times in person. I reach out to people often, and people often reach out to me, over email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is why I shared my story and mentioned to OP that my inbox was open: to develop or at least explore a possible connection. This is as intentional as it gets with making connections, but your priors are causing you to misunderstand my intentions and paint my comment in an insultingly negative light.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I can assure you that there was nothing performative or hollow about my comment. OP said something that resonated with me, and so I shared my story in an attempt to bridge and find commonalities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sorry, I didn't mean to say at all that what you're doing was somehow performative. By saying it feels "hollow", I mean that when you are on the receiving end of an action like this it often feels hollow because you have no relationship with the person. They are skipping several steps in the relationship development process from zero to "I want to engage with you on something that is deep and painful".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This may be totally fine for some people, but to me (and apparently to the person I was responding to) when it happens I feel like I am becoming some sort of symbolic prop to the person. It's uncomfortable. It doesn't feel like a human interaction at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My intention wasn't to cast doubt on your motivations, just to tell publicdebates that I understand the feeling he was describing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you. I understand where you're coming from. And I know interactions online can seem fleeting or meaningless. Personally I find meaning in connecting with strangers, even if once. I don't think we need to fully understand each other's internal experience in order to relate. I appreciate you clarifying your intent :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Absolutely, happy to. And likewise! I'm sorry if what I said came off as judgemental or insulting. Not at all the intent, I assumed the motivation was nothing but kindness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; knowing that it's entirely coming from you and your experiences, and nothing to do with me and my own personality&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's not the point of empathy and not the point of my outreach. I don't need to know you precisely or be within a certain proximity in order to empathize with you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; A year ago, I was talking to the local Catholic priest (I was donating some religious statues that I had effectively inherited), and it came up in conversation that I was going through a rough time. He went in for a hug, and it felt so absolutely empty and disingenuous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, the man who did these things to me was a Catholic deacon, and the hypocrisy is blood-boiling. He would give very pleasant-sounding homilies about love, acceptance, patience and understanding, and then come home and savagely beat and torture me through physically painful punishments and extended periods of isolation. I would not go to a Catholic leader if you are looking for surefire genuinity. The institution attracts performative, power-seeking individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; What do I say next? What's the next thing we can do in that interaction, or maybe a later one if I ever see them again?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a combination of bridging and bonding. Meeting individuals, like myself or a stranger on the street, and learning that you have something in common which provides substrate for conversation and communication through a shared experience, is bridging. Developing those relationships by building around that core is bonding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We typically bond contextually: We both go to the same school or office and see each other daily, or we run into each other at the store each week, etc. I once ended up becoming best friends and living with someone who was my cashier at Trader Joes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of telling me our personalities and experiences have nothing to do with each other, we could discuss our experiences, find commonalities that are more than surface-level, and bond over those. I've met great people on this website. I've met some of them in person. Friends are all over the place, hiding in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Everyone in my family knows what happened. His temper was famous. They all downplayed or ignored it. That includes my mom. She was too busy doing drugs and going in and out of prison to give a shit that I was being abused. My dad was also a drug addict and a sexual abuser and has not been in my life for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And my grandfather's siblings ignored it for reasons I can only imagine, since my grandfather would sometimes pin me to the ground and spit in my face while telling me that I should be grateful because what he did to me was nothing compared to what his father did to him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, now my mom pretends that living with her was always an option, and that remaining in my environment was my own choice. She is a major narcissist who victim blames, blames her children for everything and says horrible things to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I kid you not, like she used to remind me all the time that when I was a fetus inside of her, she fell once and landed on her back "to protect me" and that I'm the reason she has terrible back pain now, that's a sacrifice she made for me and I should be grateful, because it's basically my fault. As far as I am concerned, I do not love her and she is not allowed in my life. And anyway, as I mentioned elsewhere she's currently in prison for domestic abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I no longer speak to anyone in my family outside of my sister because no one stood up for me. Even my sister downplays the seriousness of what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My grandfather is now in his 80s and well-acquainted with the town's DA. There isn't a shot in hell that I can touch him. I do not know what he has done to other people, he was only ever this violent with me to my knowledge. My brother usually aided him in assaulting me and was not on the receiving end of violence. My grandfather was an award-winning boxer so it was quite a bit of violence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good questions. If we're going by Oxford's definition of "stop feeling angry or resentful", I think the PTSD is here to stay, along with other facets of my personality and life which will always remind me of my experiences. Past that, I have made peace with my life, because that's the thing I'll always have to grapple with. Otherwise, I would just be so bitter... Instead, I focus on how statistically lucky I am to still be alive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I have no intention of speaking to my father or grandfather ever again. As for my mother, I laid out clear terms for what it would take to begin communication with me again, and she responded about as narcissistically as you can imagine... So I have made my peace with that as well. She's in prison now and I have no plans to reach out to her while she's in there. She lied to me about the situation, lied to me about the case, and lied to me about the sentencing. So as far as I should know, she's not even in prison. I had to pay the local clerk of court for access to her court documents just to know the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think Christianity as a religion has evil roots. The character of Jesus is portrayed valiantly, but the character of God is frequently portrayed as nothing short of sociopathic and psychopathic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't respect the religion at all, nor any Abrahamic religion, as it's built upon falsehoods that justify prejudiced, authoritarian behavior. These religions have been the basis for untold amounts of conflict, conquest and cultural destruction. People who understand these things and still seek positions in such institutions should not be trusted. And we know the Vatican in particular has quite a sordid history of protecting child abusers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree, leaders in any capacity can abuse their position. Look no further than Boy Scouts of America for examples at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I personally went to a therapist who ended up in prison for fraud. I also went to a daycare that shut down after an investigation stemming from me coming home one day with lashes all over my face and tongue and no recollection of what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bad people are everywhere. At least we can try to avoid institutions built to justify abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I don't respect the religion at all, nor any Abrahamic religion, as it's built upon falsehoods that justify prejudiced, authoritarian behavior. These religions have been the basis for untold amounts of conflict, conquest and cultural destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many people claim that the Bible, the church, their faith, etc has helped them. What's your take on that? Do you feel that the bad has outweighed the good in terms of its effects on people? This is a tough one because people, if they're biased, look to examples that favor their view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would imagine that if more bad than good came out of religion, then that religion would eventually fade to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For every evil religious person I've met, I tend to know a few good and even awesome ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;God is a great author to reference. The Bible is filled with enough atrocities and inconsistencies that it remains my number one recommendation for deprogramming Christians.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;God told Abraham to kill his son as a test of fealty, then psyched him at the end:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, you could point out that many of the stories in Genesis, including the Garden of Eden, can actually be traced back to older works, such as the epic of Gilgamesh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some people, when confronted with Gen22, simply say "wow, I want nothing to do with this religion", and walk away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other's see the story and say "wow... how do Christian's get around this one?". And so volumes have been written on this story. There's a ton of rich theology there for folks who were wiling to look past the initial hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I.e. the argument that "look at this horrific story" only really works for a small subset of people who aren't willing to look into the theology of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, one could argue that people who find the theology of the story satisfying are somehow demented, but that's a different argument.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A rare show of vulnerability on hackernews. I commend you and echo the sentiment!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I really appreciate you sharing your story. Know that it does not define you and you are absolutely loved and are worthy of love, especially from yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Predominantly, rejecting all priors and aggressively maintaining an open mind, reading a lot as a child, intentionally deferring the formation of concrete opinions about things until I was on my own and able to guide my own hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was necessary because I was raised by two major conservatives, in rural, conservative areas, surrounded by racists and sexists, my computer use and reading materials were surveilled and restricted, I was only allowed to listen to approved Christian music, I couldn't really even choose my own clothes, shoes or hairstyles. My belongings were regularly searched and my school administrators and teachers were always looped into the surveillance circle, alerting my grandparents and school administrators and punishing me if I so much as drew a stick figure holding nunchaku or dared journal about my experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a very aggressive and invasive attempt to brainwash me and the only thing I could think to do was wait until I was on my own, and learn everything from scratch. This began at 16, when I became homeless after refusing to enter Confirmation as a Catholic (I am atheist). My grandparents kicked me out and stole/broke most of my things. My mom was too busy doing drugs and not working to support me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I read a lot of philosophy and studied various topics. This has helped immensely with forming a foundation for my morality, sense of ethics and motivation. I still battle with a lot of internal demons stemming from my childhood and disorders including ADHD, and I can get extremely depressed, and I've burned out a couple times, but I just devote myself to my work and studies and get by. My brother, on the other hand, turned into a domestic abuser, which tracks considering his large role in the violence I experienced growing up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's clear to me that intentionality was the defining factor in escaping most of the traumatic cycles present in my family tree, including drug addiction, violence and crime (as an example, my mom is currently in prison for abusing a mentally-handicapped quadriplegic)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You'll find virtually every dimension of your life will improve if you're on top of these four things. It will make you more ambitious in pursuing social engagement. And that will make socialization much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first step to solving it would be proving it exists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because it doesn't. It's been a phrase used for over 40 years to decry basically any change the author didn't like, from different technology, the rise of the 'me' generation or the declining religiousness of the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is there a loneliness epidemic? Or is this viewing history through rose colored glasses?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is the shift from how society used to work to how society has come to work real or just a grammatically correct statement?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Statistics are biased by those who compute them. Have we asked everyone or inferred and p-hacked up data points?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The single salary family is largely a myth. A relatively small percentage of the population ever achieved that. Is the same true for loneliness? Is it a bigger problem now than it has been?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this like in medicine where we think ADHD is up, cancer is up... it's an epidemic! When in reality as a percent of society things are normal, we just had no idea before how prevalent those things were before we measured.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems you can't ignore a lot of this is a product of fewer children, temporary and transitional relationships that are not governed by the boundaries of marriage, and fewer intact families. This leads to fewer siblings, fewer responsibilities toward others, and more opportunities to be and feel isolated. There is a reason why the concept of a family protected by certain legal responsibilities and obligations have been around for a long time. I can't imagine getting older and having no children or siblings. I look at my parents and the only reason why they advanced into old age with tons of support is because of their siblings and children. Friends only go so far. Also the loss of belief in God and purpose lived out through regular Church attendance, charitable activities with a purpose, and community prayer leads to fractured relationships, philosophical and existential anxieties, no matter how many people you have around you. There's a reason why religious communities and institutions have survived thousands of years through all sorts of political upheavals and change. The modern experimentation rejecting God and family doesn't seem to be working out so well. As the older population ages (and increasingly gets euthanized), the younger population shrinking, and the greater reliance on recreational drugs and technology to fill the void, it really doesn't seem that hard to understand the increasing loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I grew up in the 90s chronically online, isolated, abused, and socially awkward. Then I started working out, losing weight, trying to get better socially, then left atheism and became a Christian at 17, quit drugs and porn, met my wife, we now have 4 kids, love our church, and I can’t even imagine what loneliness feels like now. With 4 kids and a future with grandkids, pile in all our friends from church, hard to imagine a future where I’ll ever feel that emptiness and loneliness again. There’s a lot of hard work and pain I didn’t mention but it’s all been worth it&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, life isn't one of those "old single friends living together" sitcoms. Most interaction is with family, anything else is more of a bonus that can't be relied on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also plenty of cultures with family values not rooted in religion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We seem to agree that what replaced religion (for profit social media) is not a basis for a strong society, or fulfilling lives. Religion seems like a close 2nd worst option though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it’s bigger than a decrease in attendance in religious groups though I agree the impact is felt there too. Social clubs, non-profits, fraternal and civic organizations, neighborhood associations, labor unions, local political chapters, trade associations, etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically all forms of outward focused, community or geographic based groups seem to have been on a downward trend for decades in favor of hyperreal, inward-focused online spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Church is a big thing though, it's weekly and not some hobby or niche. Like I've moved more often than I kinda wanted to, and each time instantly started hanging out with friends I met after church, even though I wasn't going there to meet people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be quite the opposite, the magic man favours families, children, and population growth. The rejection of these beliefs seems to be what is detrimental to society. The other stuff I'll leave for you to decide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not convinced, I believe the institutions of church were and often still are the foundations of communities in many positive ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the fact that they rest on an arbitrary belief in one of the popular gods does make it a pretty shakey foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We see it right now, as the belief in Christianity has dwindled so too have the communities the church was supporting, the community can be separate to belief and probably should be of it is to support a greater community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The modern experimentation rejecting God and family doesn't seem to be working out so well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although I agree with the sentiment, I think the problem is what replaced it, not that they were replaced. Religious belief has been replaced by a quasi-religion revolving around clipling autodetermination and aggrandizement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think people suffer from not having faith in some god nowadays, I think they suffer for not having faith, period. I see people around me prefering to live in known discomfort, than choosing to "roll the dice". Religion played the role of teaching people not everything that happens to them is in their control, and comforting them that it would all turn out well. What we have nowadays is the awfuly debilitating belief that everything that happens in your life is your own doing, and that unless there's evidence thigns will work out, there's no reason to believe they will.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I personally see the risk-adversity this philosophy leads to everywhere. I see it in people prefering apps over potentially making a fools of themselves, or "risking it" with a stranger. I see it in people who want leave jobs or living situations but fail to take the leap. I see it in people strugging with even small decisions, obsessing over reading reviews for everything, refusing to commit in relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Religion also gave you a certain peace of mind concerning your purpose in life, and assured you you could be perfectly content with little. In fact it assures you can be more "successful" at life than people who achieve great wealth or fame, since in religion success is measured by, say, devotion, acts of service, building a family, or other means instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This can be replaced by positive philosophies that focus people in the prusuit of eudaimonia, but instead have been replaced by reverence to aggrandizement and too often hedonism. The goal too often becomes fame, money, status, or, again, control, both out of fear your life might not be determined by you solely, and for the pursue of vain pleasures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see this as a product of an obsessive reverence to libertarian capitalism. Overall, it works very well in its favour. Convincing people the course of their lives depends soley on their own decisions is ingraining reverence for individualism and rejection for collectivism. The pursuit of wealth and status is good for the economy; when people are truly happy with the small things in life, they tend to buy less. I'm not saying libertarian capitalism lead to this philosophy, or that this philosophy lead to libertarian capitalism; I think they go hand-in-hand, and as one grows so does the other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your refrain is a common one, but it seems pretty hollow upon deeper investigation. Maybe consider why modern Americans aren’t making the same family structure and child count decisions as long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the days of subsistence farming, a child was an additional free worker. Once we mechanized farming, we went from 50% subsistence farming to 1%. Children moved from the profit-center column to the cost-center column.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medicine improvements and government policies have reduced child mortality. Mothers no longer need to conceive 12 kids to ensure that 4 live to adulthood. Each birth is a much higher resource cost and a much larger responsibility than in generations past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The gratifying life of being a stay-at-home mom to 18 kids only works so long as the father keeps the money rolling in and doesn’t decide to abandon the family (this happened to an aunt of mine). The modern changes to family structure didn’t happen out of the blue — they were a response to inadequate protections and violations of freedoms that people had at the time. You might consider educating yourself on your blind spots about the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Churches are eating themselves. People aren’t “moving away from God” so much as seeing the churches as liars. Christianity is full of lies: many small, some big. The more that people are exposed to others with different perspectives, more education, and better ways to communicate complicated topics, the more likely people are to leave a church that lies to them. Churches which have been outed for covering up child sex abuse have seen outflows. Bad policies made it more likely that the child sex abuse would happen. Further bad policies prevented the abuser to go free without prosecution. Even further bad policies have allowed the internal investigations/reviews to be quietly ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately small churches have empty pews because they aren’t entertaining. MegaChurches / televangelists based in Orange County, Dallas, Houston are pulling in members while small town churches close due to lack of membership. Churchgoers tend to care more about being engaged in the showmanship of the leader than the common benefits of keeping a community alive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other functions that churches serve (community service, reminders of purpose) are being replaced by the free market of ideas. Some churches are turning the pulpit into a political campaign. Many secular non-profits are taking up the slack of dying community churches by doing a slice of the same work without the lies, sex abuse, coercion, and threats of damnation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then there are completely unrelated changes in society. More people care more about having pets (dogs, cats) than children. Values change as society changes. Companies get far better at marketing than individuals get better at resisting marketing. Drugs, gambling, sex/porn, outrage / attention economy, etc have all been turbocharged via capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The values of the average person have changed a lot. It doesn’t make sense to cling to the old institutions if they don’t meet the people where they are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kids make friends pretty easily when they go to school and later college. Only after graduating college it becomes very hard to make friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So one solution is have folks attend classes in schools and universities or even local libraries during weekends. Classes specifically designed for different age groups - 30s, 40s, 50s etc. Classes related music, personal finance, investing, art, sports, cooking etc&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Govt should offer tax breaks for attending these classes. That would attract a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some things I do: I organize a monthly brunch for friends. I try and grow it, invite people I've recently met.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If someone asks me to do something, I try and do it. Get invited to poker night, I'm there. Asked to play Fantasy Football, yep! Even though I don't watch football and have never played.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago I tried to create a platform to connect people to local communities. The twist was that each community had members that worked as buddies to help welcome and guide new members. I got 10s+ communities and members but since there was no business model associated and I needed to work, I couldn't kept it up. The website was https://tribalo.app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the few numbers I got, I figure out it help. Maybe one day I don't need to work and can focus on it again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encouraging people to meet up in everyday life and gathering them just to talk is where I’d simply start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that spirit I have created and deployed a vibe coded app: come have dinner.com (not the real website).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple website we share with my SO to our loved ones, friends, co workers and more. People can register to come have dinner at ours, with an attendance they don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The website has an admin interface with a simple password, some good jokes, email reminders and calendar invitations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on a basketball app to bring people together. Basketball was invented out of grief, by James Naismith who lost his grandfather, mother, father, and family home to a fire within 4 months. He was tasked with helping to have rambunctious youth learn the principles of teamwork and sharing and slowing down and thus created the game. It truly brings people together and I hope everyone gets a chance to experience the magic that is pickup basketball. It got me out of a deep hole after the pandemic after my mom had passed and I gained 30 lbs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been meaning to set up a bi-weekly dinner for hacker types who live mid peninsula, specifically near San Mateo. I have a group of 4 or so in mind and have a good place to host, but would like a slightly larger group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anyone would be interested in helping to get something stood up, send electronic post to carl chatfield snail (mail run by g)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Familiar relationships always come out of a sense of shared responsibility and utility, not out of a "secular" desire to "make friends", the way I see it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, live vigorously in a way that benefits from social relationships and they will necessarily come.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be useful to others and they often return the favor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dancing, knitting, cooking, sports, gardening, board games. Which activity is secondary, what is crucial is that people can come (no matter if they feel great or not), can bring friends, with low pressure (so they can sit and talk, no need to actually dance, cook or so).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe our built environment shouldn't consist solely of isolated houses in isolated gated communities where we drive our kids and sit in isolated cars in the school dropoff/pickup lines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This may just be me, but I hold the opposite view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I lived in a rural area with a few acres of property, I was much more social and engaged with my community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I live at the edge of the city in a medium-high density townhouse area with no private outdoor space. Since I can never really get away from people and be alone, I also have no desire to go out and do things and engage with the community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the variability is nice. If I can get home, relax, not have people around, have some private outdoor space, then I can recharge and have the energy to engage more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no "loneliness epidemic". It's a bad journalism epidemic. People in general are a combination of lone and grouping. Both are OK. People don't need to socialise all the time. People who want to socialise but can't usually suffer from emotional difficulties that they haven't addressed. Same for people who obssess about socialising all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been trying to make more friends in the real and virtual world the past two years, and I have been pretty successful. Most of my new friends come from the following: Volleyball, MtG, or a writing group.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really, I think that it comes down to make making or joining a space with a shared activity and moderating out the crap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem is most communities are losing those spaces in favor of private social clubs. That's what we need to fight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phone a friend. A buddy of mine texted me yesterday and we went to lunch together today. We’re talking about starting the old hackathon up again, this time with agent armies. It was just fun and easy and long overdue. Be the one to break the ice if you can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From my perspective, the issue is quite simple: progress optimizes everything other than the cost of human labor. Socialization, as defined today, inherently requires human labor, and thus falls under the Baumol effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 'loneliness epidemic' is merely the result of weakening demand, owing to a slew of low-cost alternatives. Thus, we end up with two options,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. automate the social experience&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. accept that the comparative cost of socialization will grow higher forever&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For some reason, the vast majority of humans in the 21st century are interested in morally rejecting (1), thus ensuring (2) as an outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: this is not to say I reject the notion that individuals can be helped. I think most comments in this thread are quite healthy, even as they narrowly focus on the individual case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it is rather impractical to adopt a positivist "how you can help" framing to address the epidemic at large. While certainly instrumentally useful, it is necessarily unlikely for the same traditional solutions to loneliness to spontaneously 'gain influence' against what has thus far been a gradual decline in their effectiveness and buying power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's branched from how I think about TFR. To merge,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- the common sentiment of "child raising is too expensive"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- the reality that wealth has drastically gone up&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think: okay, it must feel expensive for some reason. Probably because the work involved, despite not changing too much in an absolute sense, is relatively much pricier compared to all modern cheap sources of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, this notion of the cost-of-fun is easily transferred to general socialization &amp;amp; the loneliness problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nice. You are looking at it from an Economic Cost pov.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also a psychological concept of "Social Surrogates" which is fundamental here; see Social Surrogates, Social Motivations, and Everyday Activities: The Case for a Strong, Subtle, and Sneaky Social Self - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/chapter/bookseries/abs...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have standing lunches/dinners/coffees or even facetimes with your friends. I do them monthly with most. If you need to cancel, so be it, but having it pre-scheduled helps tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Best way to solve it is to recognize that it's intentional and start calling it the anti-social epidemic instead. If we keep calling it loneliness then everyone thinks its something that is happening to them, instead of something they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My girlfriend built a web app for meeting up in small groups. I think it's going to be fun! It's not public yet but almost there. Let me know if you live around Stockholm (or Sweden perhaps) and want to beta test it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IMO the biggest barrier to entry to the hobby is the price, coupled with the existing communities being really old. I'm trying to get people to print their own cards for casual kitchen table play through https://cardstocktcg.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I visit whatever sport activity I can find. Like Go Karting, gymnastics, bouldering, etc and always start asking pro guys: “yo, how come you visit this so often? How do you get fun from it?”. And people lovely tell their story. Later they teach me how to do things. It works for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some people think loneliness is somewhat a result of stress and anxiety, it’s far from it. It is precisely the lack of pressure that makes them stay home. You need to apply as much pressure on them so that staying at home becomes unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I remember watching old American educational videos for teens from something like the 50s (on YT). They talk A LOT about how to be likable and how much work one has to put into being accepted and included. The tone is very much "if you want friends and not be excluded (and being excluded is your own moral failing) you need to work on it".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel people have forgotten that. Having friends isn't easy. You do actually need to put in the effort - everyone needs to put in the effort, not just "the extrovert" that "adopts" you. And not just effort, it takes *SKILLS* that you need to actively develop and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now we have generations where no one really thought us the skills or instilled the value of "it's a YOU problem". Everyone is just waiting for someone else to do the hard work. Even more stupidly, people might be lonely, but they are also very picky and if the person isn't exactly what they are feeling at the moment they flake/don't engage. And then they are surprised they don't have a surplus of friends when they need them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how do we resolve this? By telling people it's their our damn problem and fault. And no, I'm not saying ignore it on a societal level, I'm saying that the public policy to fix this is to start educating people that social engagement requires effort and skills. Maybe take those old American movies as inspiration (naturally remove all the sexist and racist bullshit).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;just this week i was stuck with a machine i could use to log on websites, so I just browsed reddit anonymously, no profile, no suggestions, no "me" at all.. and it was delightful, suddenly I'm not here to respond or be heard and my brain went into focus mode, i was eager to read the article linked and not the comments.. very very refreshing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;except for critical needs, we should go back to paid limited network access, this will make people allocate their time and attention much better and also do more things outside potentially meeting people&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've wondered if LLMs can help match people. People give the LLM some public context about their lives and two LLMs can have a chat about availablity and world views.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use AI to scaffold relationships not replace them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Asking people to change their ways is pointless. When something is systemic, only a systemic solution can work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have become intimately convinced that engagement-based feeds are the root of many evils of our time, loneliness included.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some of the perverse effects (if ever they needed be told), and how they relate to the loneliness epidemic&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- they incentivize individuals from a young age to find stimulation from scrolling mindless content through short dopamine loops instead of seeking satisfaction through longer-term endeavors (e.g. projects, board games, bands, sports teams, etc.) which tend to foster connections with friends, neighbors, family, strangers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- they radicalize and polarize into extreme niche communities (political extremes, conspiracy theories, manosphere, etc) so that it's more difficult to find common ground with a random average person, giving you the impression that everyone is your enemy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- they reflect a skewed version of reality where societal standards (beauty, intelligence, success, wealth, etc) are distorted and artificial, which drives people to believe they are insufficient and ostracized&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I firmly believe that engagement-based feeds should be heavily regulated, the same way that other addictive behaviors have (e.g. tobacco, gambling, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think one solution is to have more accessible public spaces where people can meet. As a host of board game meetups, my biggest challenge is finding places to meet. I had to stop hosting Friday game nights because the available spaces were too expensive or closed early.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on an open source non-commercial website to drive up demand for public spaces. https://createthirdplaces.org/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The older people get the more disposable they are viewed as by society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you are younger, you belong in school. When you get older, you belong at work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you fall out of any of these social structures its extremely difficult to find your way back in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was already pretty disconnected from society and people in general when my divorce hit and now I am completely untethered from any kind of community. Living is miserable I hate my life and I do not want to exist like this anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of the solutions people provide are easy or functional. "Go meet people" is the most vague, unhelpful bullshit ever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the reality is some people, no matter how intelligent, caring or otherwise full of empathy they may be are just "too far gone" for anyone to have the initiative or concern to care about us. The world is so corroded and socially poisoned that any kind of meaningful effort in this kind of thing is pointless. Anybody with time or money is busy making money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can't solve the epidemic because it is a byproduct of multiple irreparably broken systems. People will continue to fall through the cracks and it will get worse. I don't know what happens after that but we'll probably all be dead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my opinion - just do it. What you want. Message someone you haven’t talked with for years. Ask someone out. Smile :-). Say hello. Strike a conversation with a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eliminate the Internet. I'm not joking -- it's much, MUCH harder to be lonely if you don't have Amazon, Instacart, UberEats, and social media fulfilling various needs in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built a mobile app that allows you to get a morning wake up call from a real person. Part of my motivation here was to help add a little human interaction to what is a lonely experience for some people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I normally don't contribute to HN comments these days (too much anger in the comments section) but I appreciate your post and activities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a tail-end boomer in the U.S. so my experiences were with a world where socializing was more functional: we shopped in public, played in public, read in public libraries, watched movies in public, rode transit together, etc. Being in public was a requirement, not a choice. While there are still remnants of this older culture still active in today's world in urban life, there are so many options for not being in public that it is simply easier to avoid it. We all want our space in one degree or another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the playground growing up, my world was filled with name-calling and backbiting. I was a heavier kid, so that was my burden. Other kids had bucked teeth, warts, limps, they were too short, or too tall, uncoordinated--whatever--nobody really escaped the wrath of the crowd. We were forced, by our parents, to just deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My parents like many others in their generation recognized this behavior for what it was--natural. Watch an episode of the Little Rascals--you will see what I am referring to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most if not all of those kids who were called names and isolated in some way found ways to break out of their pigeon hole: playing sports, playing music, making art, studying hard at school, boxing, singing, dancing, cracking jokes, whatever. Then they were heroes, and the crowd could celebrate them--and they thrived.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know this sounds overly idealistic, but it is true. I experienced this first hand in a neighborhood of several hundred kids from broken homes, poor homes, ethnic homes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Voiceless people must find their voice. The responsibility is their's. The crowd will not come to the rescue of the person who won't stand up for themselves and make their way in life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loneliness is very, very sad. The cure to loneliness is in the powerful hands of the lonely person. Do whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to work on those things that hold the lonely person back from achieving something--anything--for themselves and then engage with the crowd with more confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I appreciate what you are doing by helping others--that is one of your superpowers. Live a good, strong life!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your first paragraph is what I've always thought: "back in the day" most people simply didn't have the option to be a hermit. In modern life, your bills, grocery shopping, car registration, hobbies, etc. can all be handled online / in your home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my opinion, it takes a lot of time and energy to avoid loneliness in the modern era. So, advice about "just get yourself out there" is technically accurate, but it misses the mark since previous generations didn't need to put much thought, if any, into socializing. Perhaps not everyone is wired to focus so much energy into that aspect of their life and we're seeing that play out with modern amenities?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People who live in London, how did you find a solution for this? I am interested in hearing what you tried. I am in my very early 30s. Single male. I didn't feel up in UK. Moved here I my 20s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am somewhat suspicious of this loneliness epidemic. 81% of Americans are somewhat satisfied or very satisfied with their personal life[0]. And my personal experience is that both close friends and general civil community is easy to find[1]. I wasn't trying at all so it can't be that there are any real constraints here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think [0] is showing what you think it does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; % Very satisfied with the way things are going in personal life&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That Dropped from 65% in 2020 to 44% in 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Record-Low 44% of Americans Are 'Very Satisfied' With Their Personal Life&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also focusing on the raw percentages of these style reports is challenging, due to socially desirable response bias [0]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact it is dropping is the important part, it is a relative measure, not a absolute one, and I am sure Gallop would change there questions/responses in a modern survey that didn't need to maintain compatibility with historical data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Gallup (not Gallop) has the English questions and responses in the PDF at the bottom of the page. They will also respond if you email them so you can check if wording changed significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Yes, I am pretty sure the Gallup thing is showing exactly what I think it does considering I said "81% are [somewhat] satisfied or very satisfied" and the Gallup survey shows that 81% are somewhat satisfied or very satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* The fact that the Hacker News community was enthusiastic about the thesis of a loneliness epidemic during a period when satisfaction was rising casts aspersions on "the fact that it is dropping is the important part". When satisfaction was rising, there were still posts on that where everyone was agreeing about how bad it was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was looking at the PDF [0] and [1] and [0] calls out:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; In addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;``QN5:Personal Satisfaction is a binary question``, with a category for refused/didn't know that WAS NOT OFFERED IN THE QUESTION, with an additional question asking about very, sort of etc... They call out `QN5QN6COMBO: Personal Life Satisfaction`&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can't answer the HN sentiment straw man, the DELTA from previous results is what is important. Using it as an absolute scale would almost certainly be discouraged if you asked them via the email address in the PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basic statistics realities here, and Gallup knows the limits far better than the comment section here. And they understand that "81% are [somewhat] satisfied or very satisfied" especially when presented as two trivial properties, has limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once again they asked:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; In general, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with the way things are going in your personal life at this time?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then followed up with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Are you very [satisfied/dissatisfied], or just somewhat [satisfied/dissatisfied]?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note how both of those are binary, with a NULL being an option to mark down as an exception.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think it's a straw man. If it is true that the delta matters and it is also true that at the time when this metric was showing the most positive results and trending upwards, online communities such as this talk about the existence of the loneliness epidemic https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20468767 then one must ask oneself whether this is a property of the online communities in question.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time when the gallup poll showed an upward trend towards its peak this community was talking about the loneliness epidemic. When the gallup poll shows a downward trend toward its lowest, this community is talking about the loneliness epidemic. And it's the change in satisfaction that is the most significant. So there are two changes in opposite directions causing the same conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this were happening to me, I would ask myself "Am I sure this is a general property and not just a property of me?". Do you find this not convincing to move your estimate of the likelihood of the loneliness epidemic actually existing? If you don't, it's all right. We can leave it here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; 81% of Americans are satisfied or very satisfied with their personal life[0].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, 81% are "very satisfied" or "somewhat satisfied". I don't think "satisfied" is synonymous with "somewhat satisfied".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's worth noting, as the article states, that this is the lowest value in the history of the poll, going back to 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It shouldn't be too surprising that the overall value is high and stable over time. Hedonic adaptation[1] is a core property of our emotional wiring. The fact that the value is the lowest it's been in a quarter century should still be ringing alarm bells. We are not OK.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a 5 point scale, so landing a 4 or 5 on satisfaction on a 5 point scale seems significant. Also, when the value was at its highest in that time series, Hacker News had articles like this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20468767&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The comments there are full of people describing this loneliness epidemic when 65% of people were very satisfied and 90% of people were "somewhat satisfied or very satisfied". No matter what surveys of people's satisfaction with their personal lives show, there appears to be an enthusiasm for this subject of the loneliness epidemic. This makes me suspect that this is less an epidemic than an 'endemic' (if you'll forgive the word).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless, I didn't intend to mislead so I'll edit it to say "somewhat satisfied or very satisfied (4 or 5 on a 5 point scale).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; It's a 5 point scale, so landing a 4 or 5 on satisfaction on a 5 point scale seems significant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, it is absolutely not. Gallup is not asking "on a scale of 1-5, how would you rate your satisfaction?" They are asking:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"In general, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with the way things are going in your personal life at this time? Are you very [satisfied/dissatisfied], or just somewhat [satisfied/dissatisfied]?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it comes to surveys and social science the specific wording of questions has a huge impact on the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure, and 81% of people are somewhat satisfied or very satisfied. And the loneliness epidemic thesis was popular around the time that very satisfied was at its peak of 65% (when somewhat or very satisfied summed up to 90%).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did you read the article you cited or are you just evaluating the snapshot of numbers?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Forty-four percent of Americans say they are “very satisfied” with the way things are going in their personal life, the lowest by two percentage points in Gallup’s trend dating back to 2001. This also marks the continuation of a decline in personal satisfaction since January 2020, when the measure peaked at 65%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Record-Low 44% of Americans Are 'Very Satisfied' With Their Personal Life&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And then to link to your own blog post as though that were a supporting citation is strange to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My blog post is a more detailed expression of a sentence that starts with "my personal experience". I think that's fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And of course I read the article. That's why my sentence explicitly says "satisfied or very satisfied" whereas the text you quote only selects the "very satisfied". One can imagine that if I had only linked without reading I could not possibly have guessed 81% correctly either.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not saying "just stop being depressed". I'm questioning that any significant portion of the population is depressed. I think that's valid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can only speak anecdotally from what I have seen in TikTok videos and TikTok comments, and yes, a significant portion of people in society are very depressed, and drinking/smoking/screwing their way through it, putting on a Joker smile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think certain populations have this effect, yes. As an example, teen suicides have genuinely risen in the US in the post-smartphone/post-social-media era. So I think the evidence (suicides are not subject to measurement error as much) is pretty strong that certain populations (all teenagers, for instance) are encountering unhappiness to a great degree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But TikTok is renowned for having an algorithmically tailored feed that is specifically engagement maximizing. While there are some selection effects in the people one encounters in normal life, surely one must concede that an algorithmically tailored feed maximizing engagement cannot possibly be anything but highly selected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I dont know the solution but few things that are root cause:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Internet and Social Media&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Neighborhoods no longer are walkable especially suburbs at least in America. Kids are not encouraged to go bike to their friends place anymore because of traffic risks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- High Trust societies have degraded into "lets keep ot myself, I can't trust anyone these days". Decades ago, you could just walk into a neighbor's home and say hello. Now, you need an appointment just to talk to a neighbor or are too worried what they will think of you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- No real friendships after school/colleges. This is a huge deal once you are out on your own in the real world. Work relationships are meh at best and with remote work nowadays, it has become even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Even if you join a club or activity, they are too "planned" and "robotic". For example, my kids take a dance class and they said they don't like it. I realized why. There is no break. They don't even get to spend like 30 mins with other kids socializing etc. There is a fixed schedule. You go, you dance, you leave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this is the world today. So I don't know how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data from various studies, including those from academic institutions and public health organisations, supports the idea that regular church attendance helps reduce loneliness by fostering social connections, support networks, and a sense of community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been going to a church half a year now, and the sense of community is amazing, made new friends and know more people I could dream of. So there is a way, there is a light. Never felt lonely again since.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For what it's worth, I tried that a few years ago. It worked for a while. Then I realized that my church relationships were paper thin and that I'd be forgotten the day I stopped coming and/or I started showing that I didn't really believe in what was preached.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Got better connections through improv acting and role-playing game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm no fan of religion, but the situation you described is true for pretty much all social hobbies. It's just one of the early steps in making friends. First you do stuff, then you meet people through that stuff forming acquaintances. Then you spend some time forming setting-specific friendships. It's fine to have lots of these, but the next step is to break out of that specific setting. Starting with immediate invitations to adjacent events ("Hey, want to grab dinner after our workout?", "Want to grab lunch after church?", "Hey, want to hit the bar after work?"). Once you have a habit of doing that, you can escalate to invitations to non-adjacent events. ("Want to go to a concert this weekend?"). Do that ever 1-2 months, and you've got a general friend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem is you can't really just go to church to make friends without at all believing or supporting the rest of it. Similarly you couldn't go to a hobby group while entirely disliking the hobby, hoping to just get friends out of it and leave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've entertained the idea of going to church. My understanding is that a non-trivial number of people going to Unitarian Universalist churches are openly atheist and completely comfortable with that. So the preaching ends up being more about general good community ideas and less about dogma.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have not decided yet that it is a good fit, but I am definitely thinking that I should foster some community connections outside of my own family.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was involved in a UU church for a few years. It's a weird organization, and very unstable, with another revolution sweeping in new leadership (and completely new culture) every 5 to 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I first started going, it was VERY open to atheists and secular humanists. New leadership sweeps in, and there's a mandate to focus more on "worship" and other religious jargon... and let the atheists know that while they can be fellow travelers on some of the social justice stuff, they're not really in the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last I heard, that leadership wave had themselves been swept out under controversial circumstances. But by then I was long gone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could never really get a straight answer on WHAT we were supposed to be "worshipping", given that UU's don't profess faith in any any particular deity or pantheistic concept, etc. I finally reached the conclusion that we were supposed to just worship the leadership's political beliefs, and not think too much or ask questions. In fairness, maybe that DOES make it a real church?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As someone whose childhood included attendance to various churches, this mostly reflects my experience. That's not to say that it can't or won't produce deep connections, but it is in my estimation more unlikely than not, particularly if there's anything about oneself that the church doesn't agree with or if commitment to that particular denomination hasn't been established.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally speaking I find the need to conform to the church's norms/expectations to not be ostracized at minimum chafing and in the worst case stifling. The third place and social aspects can be nice but being told how to live and exist isn't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s possibly useful on an individual level, but not a solution. If existing institutions didn’t solve loneliness yet they aren’t going to without changing something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Promoting church attendance might help, but so would any number of group activities the issue is why that stuff is in decline not that stuff not working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a kid I went to church with my family and it was full of nice people who wanted to help others and were very kind, lots of my parents friends were and are from church.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it is gut-wrenching for me to be in church. I feel terrible, because I simply don't believe any of it. To stand there and be phony and pretend to love and believe in Jesus just kills me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unless you grew up surrounded by nonbelievers I'm guessing half a year ago wasn't the first time you've ever been to a church and there's a little more to this anecdote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don't have to be a believer to go to church. Have an open mind, don't belittle it to the people there just like you wouldn't belittle someone's interior decorating who invited you into their home, and don't hog all of the potato salad at the post-service lunch, and you'll be okay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been to churches before (accompanying a friend), but it’s very difficult to take any of it seriously. Sure I can be pleasant and respectful, but it’s hard to get much out of it knowing what you now know about them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; supports the idea that regular church attendance helps reduce loneliness by fostering social connections, support networks, and a sense of community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Correlation does not establish causation. Regular church attendance dominantly occurs among people who have shared values (clustered around what the church teaches); that doesn't imply that an outsider can just choose to fit in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it's not your thing, it's not your thing, but if 'lying' is really the only barrier, note that a lot of churches actually consider it part of their mission to work with nonbelievers and would take something like "I'm not a believer but I'd like to learn what it's like for you all" (or some other true formulation of your intentions) as a valid form of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you identify with that problem, and you want to solve it, and you are open to advice...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go to church, and be intentional to connect. Find a bible study, fellowship group, volunteer opportunity, or prayer meeting. Sit at church on Sunday with somebody from the bible study. Get lunch with one of those people. Find somebody at church who shares a hobby. Do your hobby together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have to put in the effort. Growth is uncomfortable. Real connection takes time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe you find something similar in other spaces, but I am certain you can find it in church.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For me, the answer was smoking. I made a ton of friends that way. Always went out to a pool hall, a bar, or a nice patio so I could smoke. It was great. You can’t smoke in your rental so you gotta get out and find places to smoke. Few states you can do it in anymore though. I moved to a state with a smoking ban and quit smoking, no point to it. Don’t get out as much nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I watched this video that proposed that the way to quit phone addiction was to give your hands something else to fiddle with, proposing that in older societies, people spent massive amounts of time on mindless hand work like weaving baskets, knitting, sharpening spears, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve seen the numbers, but honestly it’s pretty wild for me to read this thread. Many people’s stories paint a picture in my mind of lives that feel devoid of richness, almost like watching an advertisement or a sitcom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sadly, I come across this rarely in my everyday life. It would be a richer experience for me to have a more balanced sense of how people are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was mercifully spared from aloneness by having a powerful and outgoing best friend as a child, and by a nature that ruthlessly seeks “where the action is.” That said, I used to often feel alone when I was with people, specifically. I now call this “feeling unseen,” and it took me a long time to learn that, though sometimes I was just with the wrong people, much of the time it was because I wasn’t expressing myself authentically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve long since moved to the Bay Area, which, while an odd place, does offer many ladders out of the predicament of disconnection. There are many ways to actively learn the skills of connection here—through therapy, community practice, and structured relational work—and I practiced enough that I can now teach. Many people also learn and deepen their own skills by interacting with the community I’m part of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The question of whether there’s a solution ... well, when one becomes acquainted with the field of learning the underlying skills that can address loneliness—which goes by many names and has many purported aims—it turns out that the path is well-mapped from pretty much every perspective, and in ways tailored for most types of people. Some of the best books are international best-sellers, and you can just go buy them and read them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t think the solution, per se, is unknown. The issue seems to be that people don’t know they can help themselves, or don’t believe they can, or perhaps in some cases lack the resources or support to get help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most people, I think, are afraid. And if I had to guess at why this seems more common than it once was, it’s probably because many people are no longer being forced by circumstance to confront their fears in the way previous generations often were.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also seems to me that this is an inevitable result of our urban planning and the rising effective cost of housing since the ’70s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re such a person reading this who finds themselves alone, the main thing I have to say is: far more is possible than it probably feels like right now. I’ve seen many miracles happen, and correspondingly very few failures among those I’ve seen genuinely try. Paths to wholeness are innumerable—and what worked for me probably won’t work for you—but if you keep trying, there’s a good chance you’ll find yourself somewhere adjacent to where I find myself now: with more love and connection in my life than I know what to do with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The path begins with acknowledging your fear, and learning to feel and see it as a guide. This doesn’t mean leaping off a cliff; it often starts very small. Go toward what feels terrifying, what feels cringe, what you dismiss or push away. Investigate those things and find out for yourself what’s really there. Once you begin doing this, the path becomes obvious ... it’s right in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I should add, a very specific thing about the Bay Area that had an outsized contribution to my life was the group house culture. There are hundreds (or thousands?) of micro-communities sharing dwellings in the Bay in a way that's unlike anywhere else in the world, to my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've lived with men in their 60s in these contexts, but primarily this is an option for young people at the start of their careers, which I highly, highly recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any easy way to work on this problem is to simply lower the barriers to co-habitation. This could look like working to change zoning (I think Oregon has been a pioneer here), building businesses around the concept (many have tried, from small things you haven't heard of all the way up to WeWork), to experimental projects like: https://neighborhoodsf.com/Neighborhood+Notes/Published/The+....&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe increase the living conditions for people under 60?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All this talk is just about the symptoms, but the cause is that young people are born into a deeply unfair world where losing is by design (so that the baby boomers can continue to profit).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If someone in their 20 can start a family without being financially broken, things will improve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the societal level this trend has been happening for decades, and not just in the west. It’s a global trend correlated with the degree of integration into the “global machine.” This machine commodifies and extracts. It extracts more money if you’re lonely. If you’re isolated. If community is replaced with cold market exchange. If all your needs and wants are solved with a purchase or a monetized distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet even when the system makes it hard to imagine anything else, we’re never too far from our true nature. We need only take a step towards a neighbor and carve a space, no matter how small, separate from the machine. That’s the only way out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not perfect, but I've managed to make some friends on Bumble BFF, https://bumble.com/bff-us/ . If you are more of a one on one person and feel awkward in groups, this is the best thing i've found so far&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;oh yeah, my perception was that it was 75% gay, but, I think the grindr comparison is unfair, I think I've only been propositioned once or twice and no unsolicited dick pics!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Affordable home ownership, shorter work weeks, fund community activities, create more spaces where people can hang out without spending money, subsidise childcare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every facet of capitalism is trying to push individualism and consumption&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, let's start by confronting and acknowledging the very strong case that we -- "we" here being the tech world in general, and the audience of this site -- bear a heavy burden of responsibility for it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It could be argued that it was all inevitable given the development of the Internet: development of social media, the movement online of commerce and other activities that used to heavily involve "incidental" socialization, etc. And maybe it was. But "we" are still the ones who built it. So are "we" really the right ones to solve it, through the same old silicon valley playbook?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The usual thought process of trying to push local "community groups," hobby-based organizations etc is not bad, but I think it misses an important piece of the puzzle, which is that we've started a kind of death spiral, a positive feedback loop suppressing IRL interaction. People started to move online because it was easier, and more immediate than "IRL." But as more people, and a greater fraction of our social interaction moves online, "IRL" in turn becomes even more featureless. There are fewer community groups, fewer friends at the bar or the movies, fewer people open to spontaneous interaction. This, then, drives even more of culture online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What use is trying to get "back out into the real world," when everyone else has left it too, while you were gone?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not everyone has left the real world, only the people who got really sucked into the online/social media world. This can maybe seem like the whole world though, if you're in that bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bars are still packed on the weekends, people still gather at churches, or gyms, or bowling leagues, or book clubs, or any number of other "IRL" activities of all kinds that are going on. You do have to make the effort to go out and get involved though, nobody is going to come and rescue you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of these activities have gotten extremely expensive or just died out in the majority of places. There's 2600 bowling alleys in the US compared to 4000 20 years ago. That's a decline of 35% without accounting for population. Last time I went to a bowling alley the price for a lane without drinks was 100 dollars for an hour and a half. This isn't even in a very high cost of living area. Besides a place like the gym can hardly be considered a place where people gather, most people just see it as something functional and would rather not be disturbed (I believe this has gotten 'worse').&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree with the fact that it's exaggerated online but when you see these kinda numbers in the vast majority of activities which were affordable for most Americans not too long ago it's not solely to be blamed on individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe in the majority of the country things will only get worse with how little value is placed on being involved in things for 'community'. People have gotten more anti-social because of social media (and just media in general).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most tech workers won't be as impacted by this I assume, they can afford paying 200 dollars for bowling without thinking twice, same with many others of the upper middle class.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loneliness is a symptom of the loss of the third place. You can't solve loneliness, but we can as a society look at why many have lost their place for socializing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hyperfocus on productivity, the one dimensional man that know only rest and work, and the rise of narcisism and hyper individuality, all causes of the loss of the third place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone needs to take on the quest to find where they belong, but society needs to give people time to invest in this quest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I think it's as simple as working less and spending more time with people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shared stressors are what bring people together. Communities form when a group of people all have the same problem. Go around egging peoples homes in your neighbourhood, and keep doing it. By the time your neighbours finally catch you they will all have gotten to know and appreciate one another better. They will have formed a communtiy identity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Affordable third places[0] where people can impromptu join and serendipitously meet friendly faces repeatedly. All of my strong friendships were from exactly this at either skateparks, college dorm common area, or run clubs. Churches had this figured out for millenia&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;it seems like a lot of locales that would have been third places in the past have been neutered because the people go there and then immediately put up walls. coffeeshops have become ad-hoc offices where people will sit there with a laptop and give off "leave me alone, i'm working".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;people need to find a way to sit in a third space without pulling up a screen or a book that immediately re-isolates you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;also: don't underestimate the subtle effect of architecture and seating arrangements here. a coffee shop is filled with lots of little two-seat tables that intentionally isolate. for contrast, think about local pubs/bars -- there's one big central seating arrangement where evertybody is facing the bartender. the bartender is naturally placed in a position that makes them serve as a conversational mediator that can facilitate connections between then people hanging out on the periphery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyone suffering in the loneliness epidemic should have a copy of The Great Good Place, by Ray Oldenburg. The entire point is that you should be putting yourself into socially active areas in your community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This includes: a church, a local pub or coffee shop with regulars (ideally walking distance from where you live), a rec sports/game league or club.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knowing this, I've perused it in my life and it seems very effective. I'm a regular at a Trivia Night one night per week (I don't go every week, but enough to know both the bartender and host by name). I'm a regular at a bar three blocks away from where I live, even if I consume only one non-alcoholic beverage and one alcoholic beverage per visit (a couple night a week), that leaves me plenty of time to chat with my neighbors. I'm a member of a local golf club (a very cheap municipal course), and play there every other week, and after a couple years have very good relationships with many of the other members even if we don't interact much outside of the club. At my last apartment, I was a regular at the coffee shop enough to know multiple baristas by name, it wasn't exactly a third place situation, but it was getting close before I moved. I'm not religious, but I'm very familiar with academic institutions and open lecture series that I used tot attend in grad school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do this intentionally. My partner had never been a regular at a bar before, and she really, really enjoys it now even though she doesn't really drink. When she joins me, she will maybe consume one-half of a light beer. You don't have to be an alcoholic to be a regular, this is a major point that Oldenburg discusses when he contrasts German-style drinking culture with English-style drinking culture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cults have been viciously slandered by mainstream information sources, often because lurid cult stories generate clicks and headlines. Of course some cults are abusive, just like some marriages are abusive. But we still think marriage is good in general.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think all cults are bad, you're implicitly against all religion, since every mainstream religion was once a cult. Being anti-cult is also profoundly un-American. America was built by cultists. Freedom of religion is literally the first principle stated in the Bill of Rights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A cult is really just a professionally managed social environment. If you trust professionals like lawyers, doctors, or teachers with their respective duties, there's no reason in principle you shouldn't trust a cult leader to manage your social environment for you. Of course you should vet them, ask about their reputation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need an open-source dating / social platform that isn’t designed to monetise loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve outsourced forming relationships to profit-driven systems that trade comfort and convenience for reduced real-world social effort. By substituting the need to approach people in person, these platforms quietly erode social confidence and reinforce avoidance, exacerbating the social problems they claim to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can we please make this HN discussion stay open forever. This is one of those threads which has clicked me the most. I thank the creator of this a lot. A lot of these comments are super insightful and I wish to talk but I feel and explain my situation but I always sometimes feel like it takes a mental toll. I sincerely love this discussion and have gone I think 75% aruond and its so great to see people similar to us&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wish if this post could perhaps be made an exception or similar where people can talk about this for longer. Perhaps its just me but I wish for something like this avenue in some more time (perhaps right now I feel a bit closed off for some reason) where I wish to talk but words don't come out so much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't know if I am walking around the bush on what I would wish to talk about here because of it right now. I have been trying to screenshot all the posts I could find which are great here and I just don't know, I just want this HN thread/discussion to stay open forever so that I can talk here a month in or two months in when I feel even more comfortbale&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The point I am trying to say is that I was losing hope in HN and every social media because of botting and other issues and just lack of trust and direction and irl interactions are few and between. This feels such a great thread and I appreciate the author (I saw their work on their website which is phenomenal)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a way, I think atleast this thread will help solve or atleast help me (or that's how I feel) in loneliness epidemic and I am grateful for that but I just want this to stay forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the issues I have in creating a special place for talks like these is that I see very few people sign in//sign up or talk. HN has lots of users and I got some really insightful answers here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think its technically possible and I just want the moderators to do this once. Dang if you are reading this, I genuinely hope that you can keep this thread permanent/long time. Loneliness is a real concern and I just feel that some people are unable to reach out (perhaps me right now) and definitely need some right place and right time and if this could just stay or (stay longer at the very least) I would deeply appreciate it sir&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would Hackernews community allow for something like this or be interested in doing this or say, if I were to create this post (or perhaps the OP) every month, would that go against terms or still be allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it can be allowed but still just want to confirm if the community really wants this&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I saw an aspect of vulnerability in hackernews I hadn't seen prior which made things feel real atleast to me&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third places. Become a regular at game night, church (if you're into that), join a bowling league, join organized dinners through meetup.com or whatever the modern version is, take up martial arts, take adult education classes outside your existing interests. There are more options out there than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feinman" and really absorb the part where he explains how he had so many crazy adventures and encounters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the big solution consists of many small solutions. One problem I identified is that social media platforms (1) decimated local live music events coverage in mid-sized cities and (2) placed live music events into the same "filter bubble" algorithm as everything else, making it difficult for people to discover what is going on nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started https://musiclocal.org, a 501(c)(3), as a curated live music events platform for my local area (and hopefully others). We list all the live music events in the area, and we optimize the software for usability, performance, SEO, etc. The goal is to make discovering local live music events as easy as doom-scrolling. We have had an outstanding reception in the area we serve. We are not self-sustaining yet, but I am optimistic about our chances. As a non-profit, we do not do any of the dark-pattern garbage that has become omnipresent in social media and other consumer software. We just do the right thing as best we can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is some more background (from our "Issues" page):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At MusicLocal, we focus on the root challenges facing local music communities to address endemic issues of negative social media practices, isolation and community polarization, and economic concentration and monopolization. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;• We believe convenient, comprehensive live music event listings are critical to reversing the decline in local music journalism. • We believe ethically designed, steward-curated live music event listings provide a vital alternative to addictive social media platforms. • We believe that making live music more visible and accessible encourages in-person interaction, strengthening communities and alleviating loneliness and social isolation. • We believe that local live music listings are a critical component of strong local economies, helping to lessen the negative economic consequences of big tech and music industry monopolies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Technology has a purpose, and that purpose is to do good and to share" --Steve Wozniak&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being happy with yourself and being OK that you're not advancing anymore (you're just happy and don't have anything to pursue), or raising a family. The only two ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would suggest for the crowd here: tech meetups, even online ones and communities will connect you to people with your interests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another thing that you'll likely find in your area is a chess club.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe you won't love the chess itself, but it's an excuse to hang out with people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another one is volunteering work. Elderly, dogs, etc, many communities need help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my village I have started a "clean up" program where average citizens take few bags a picker and we clean areas of our village.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of people are "this is the job of the garbage collectors, the mayor should do it", so what? It also costs money, and nobody will do as carefully as the people living there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if 95% of my village won't care few will and we make an impact and socialize, etc and more start taking part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Who don't feel that they can join any local groups"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's your problem. Fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there aren't any local groups then help create one. If there are, go along, meet some people, see what works for you, join a different one if you didn't like the first one, keep going until you've found your people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you feel like you can't go to a group then create a support group for people who feel like they can't go to groups. Or go online and find the virtual space for people like you and then travel to see those people (or invite them to see you).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But there is no fix for you having to socialise if you're lonely. You're going to have to find a way in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This comment will get buried in the sea of individual responses here since I am too late. But for the dumpster divers, here is my contribution!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. People have obscenely high standards for social interaction. If this person is not an outlier (in a good way) with their behaviors, it's just not going to happen. Most people have a very low tolerance for new people in their life. This has always existed to some degree but people today much prefer to listen to endless content from their favorite streamers, comedians, etc. and form parasocial relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. The environment for interacting with people has much higher stakes. Think about all the people who get recorded and posted on TikTok every single day. These are people doing it where you can see it - not just the Meta glasses people who remove the recording light. You can act like being a weirdo has no consequences but everyone has this extremely powerful device that can broadcast whatever you do to billions of people immediately - and you can suffer real consequences from this. Every crashout you have in any kind of crowd will be posted for eternity so that the world can see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. There is less and less benefit to having social networks/friends. Your friends aren't going to help you get a job, buy you a house, or meet your spouse. Meeting a spouse through friends is increasingly rare as online dating is dominating. As much as everyone complains, it is the major way people meet their spouse in major cities. People assume this is because friend networks are getting smaller but it's not due to that. It's because standards for interaction within friend groups has changed and standards for partners has changed. Unless you are prolific top 1% social maximizer, you are not going to run into anywhere near enough eligible people in your social network to meet your maximized match. We expect to completely maximize and find the best possible fit for our spouse now. Compromise of any kind is considered worse than dying alone. Cost of housing has exploded, jobs have become very hard to keep/find, and this turns everything into a transaction. Living with friends and kicking them out when they can't make rent is a tough but very real situation. People are more transactional because the economy dictates its necessities. Your family is the only thing that will bail you out - your friends can't overlook you skipping $2000/month in rent for 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is more but anyway - loneliness epidemic is not going to get solved. It will continue to get worse until some kind of revolution which would require a complete reworking of our entire economy. I would accept this as the new normal and try to figure out how you can optimize your own individual experience in spite of all these things that are working against you. It is not worth trying to fight it on a systemic scale because there are simply too many components and the core cause is one our entire economy is based around. (A good investment is inherently counter to affordability)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think people in general need to stop letting differences rip them apart from each other. I've seen countless friendships crumble over stupid things like politics. (I'm not saying politics is stupid overall, but I do think it's stupid to let it affect a relationship, except in extreme situations). I'm not talking about the Neo-Nazi who openly expresses hatred towards other races, or the extreme other end who insists that anything other than full throated and vocal activism makes you a bad person. Those people are toxic and should be avoided. IME that's like 1% of the population if not less.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social media has (IMHO) exacerbated this by allowing us to selectively surround ourselves with people we know we'll agree with. It's a nice reprieve sometimes, but it's so, so unhealthy beyond short-term.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also talking to people in-person is very important. The less you do it, the harder it is, but it's worth doing. The natural humanizing effect of conversing with a person in meat-space does wonders for increasing understanding. Don't talk about topics you disagree on, focus on agreements and common interests. A good friend of mine is a trans-woman married to a woman. She decided to get into target shooting and approached others in good faith, and she said something like (not a direct quote): "I was worried they would be assholes, but it turns out they're just nerds like me, they just love to kit out their rigs".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another friend of mine fell into the right-wing youtube rabbit-hole and "infiltrated" an Antifa group. He's a good guy overall, but got a very clouded exposure to "the other side." After he was done, he said something like (not a direct quote) "I was actually really surprised at how accepting, respectful, and intellectual most of them were. We wouldn't agree on politics, but they were a lot more interested in real analysis and dealing in facts than I ever would have thought, and we ended up having some good conversations."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes there are going to be assholes out there, but give people a chance before jumping to conclusions. You might be surprised! Don't jump in the deep end all at once, and be mindful of personal danger and comfort-level, but don't be so afraid to reach out to humans (in-person) and try to connect, even if you think on the surface there's no way you could get along.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Countless voiceless people sit alone every day and have no one to talk to, people of all ages, who don't feel that they can join any local groups. So they sit on social media all day when they're not at work or school. How can we solve this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solve what? This is the world I have always dreamed of, before even computers became a thing in my life and community. I initially approximated it with books.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an individual problem and an individual's responsibility to solve, imo (Although I do think it's interesting to consider whether a project, company, or initiative could help make this easier to solve for millions.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless, there are four steps worth taking as an individual: (1) go out, (2) make friends, (3) turn friends into community, and (4) maintain community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're feeling lonely, you're probably failing at one step along this chain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Going out. I don't have a lot of tips here. Except to go to things that actually facilitate interacting with strangers. Don't just go to a bar or go work from a cafe. Go to a meet and greet, an event for strangers to mingle, etc. Or, if you're having trouble motivating yourself to go out, then that's something inside yourself to work on. I find that a shakeup to your life routine (e.g. moving cities, going on a vacation) can provide a good window to change your habits, where you'll start doing things you don't normally do in your home city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Making friends. This one is simple but hard for some. Basically: be personable, smile, engage in conversation, ask questions, be interested, avoid being threatening or clingy, dress and stylish normal-ish unless you really don't want to, etc. Then talk to people at these events, and if seems like you'd like hanging with them and have things in common, ask to exchange numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Turn friends into community. IMO this is where you go from the basics into the advanced, and where the most benefits lie. However, most people stop after #2, even though this step is easier than steps #1 or #2, and is extremely rewarding. Community is an in-person social network. The number of connections between people in a community determines the strength and stickiness of that community. Thus it's very important that you introduce your friends to other friends. For example, instead of going on a coffee date with a friend once every month or two, invite 2 or 3 friends to dinner. This has numerous benefits. All of your friends will meet each other, and suddenly they'll know who you're talking about when you mention other people. Also, conversation is easier when there are more people. Also, you'll find events and hangs happen more often, because (a) more people are able to initiate them, and (b) there's more reason to go. People are more motivated to go and less motivated to cancel when there's an event that allows them to see multiple friends at once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Maintain community. People move away. People have silly fights and disagreements and stop talking to each other. People get into relationships and disappear. People get sick, or old, or antisocial, and disappear. Shit happens. So you have to keep doing steps #2 and #3, at least occasionally, forever. You don't necessarily need to do step #1 as much, since the people in your community will naturally bring friends and whatnot to your events. But you still need to get to know these people, exchange numbers, and invite them to future events.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Its an issue that is caused by many factors which are mostly related to the way our large scale societies are structured and ran, but I believe it will be solved very soon... By AI. first disclaimer, I am not advocating one way or the other for this just spelling out what I see on the horizon. Very soon AI systems will become a lot more sophisticated then your average chat bot. We will interact with them naturally through voice and they will become more capable in expressing the various nuances of the human speech, conversation cadence, etc... This is where humans will find solace. In fact i believe AI will be a humans best friend, lover, parent, child, etc.... as technology progresses and these things get embodied and so on. This year alone I expect the start of mass adoption of voice agents. But yeah, that's the way i see things play out. If I am right and things go this way, and you are interacting with these things, the smart move is to make sure you own the full stack 100% and not use the api related nonsense that will eventually brainwash you for this or that reason. If you are gonna dig a hole at least dig one that doesn't have the obvious traps in it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;May I suggest that the political divide is extremely harmful? I don’t understand why [other camp] is so hateful, socially excluding at the first sign of our political leaning, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I agree we also need to organize activities, but when social circles are occupied by the other camp with a witchhunt bonus, it is discouraging to try. And recursively encourages political extremism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incoming comment: “Not our problem, don’t be a Nazi.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i always thought I had avoided this issue. then i moved to a new town. starting with zero friends in a new town, with very little in place as far as shows, groups, etc, it seems quite a bit harder than it was 20 years ago. meetup used to work but it has become a cesspool of zoom calls and pay meetings. i wish i knew a really good answer (and i dont drink so bars dont have the appeal. by the time i get off of work coffee shops are closed)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You certainly have a few hobbies no? Or anything you have been wanting to try for years?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I certainly don't have the time and energy to do all the things I would if I had more free time. There are so many sports/activities I'd like to do but don't have time to, many of those for which I could find a club/class for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've wanted to try out the "2 hour cocktail party", based on the book linked in this HN comment. The author started doing this after moving to NYC, just hosting a cocktail party every month or so and inviting interesting people that he'd met. I haven't tried it yet, but it seems to cover all the classic hosting missteps and pains that I've experienced in the few get-togethers I'd previously hosted:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was going to post this somewhere else, but I think this story fits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An old guy approached me and said "put the music on my phone mann".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alright.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My response: "Search on YouTube"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He keeps insisting on ME doing it for him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3 steps&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First his data was off. For presumably a while he's had his data off ( it's metro PCs so it's prepaid anyway) and I guess he was relying on WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One click to fix that in the Android tile menu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His Bluetooth was off too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turn that on. Turn on his headphones. Luckily it was already paired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally I had to open YouTube and find music for him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3 or 4 steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now he's happily listening to music.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But beyond that, he got to introduce himself to me, and I guess the next time he accidentally turns off his data he can ask for help again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also like to help people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Old people are awesome when it comes to this. They'll just ask someone to help them out, that's how you build community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don't know how to change your oil ? Cool Billy's a car guy he can help you out. Having trouble with your water pressure, maybe Sarah's a plumber and she can help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course if something serious you're still going to be expected to pay these people, but if it's something quick they'll help you free of charge. Maybe you'll bake them a cake for their kids birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recall when I was young a neighbor basically gave my mom a car. It was an absolute piece of crap, and out of the goodness of his heart he would come and fix it every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't realize it as a kid, but if you're passionate about cars and you get the emotional satisfaction of both helping a neighbor and seeing how long you can keep that old car running, that's its own reward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How many of you would love for a non technical neighbor to say their computer is slow. I recall someone on HN even offering to send out a free laptop to someone in need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditionally communities would have a blacksmith or a baker. That's what that person did and they had a status tied to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In modern economic systems what exactly we do is so abstracted away from anything meaningful we lack this connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a very fundamental level people need to feel needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're a programmer you should do everything to make the internet something you must sit down to use not something that follows you everywhere. The last 25 years of tech "progress" must be unmade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder if there would be some way to create a hyper-local MMO. Let people meet each other from the comfort of their homes and bond over the shared activity of the MMO, and make it so the people you are likely to play with are also in your general geographic region. That way, it would be an easy way to meet people, bond with them, and potentially meet up IRL to take the friendship further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think this would be an awesome idea but the main challenge here would be game design and implementation. You'd need a lot of capital and some big ass game studio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make as many third places as you can. People need to get out to do other things than work, and these should be low cost activities. If you introduce subscriptions and then ramp up prices, then you are the scum of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You have to be the one who creates things to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This. Isn't it fascinating that for all the different ways we have to reach people (almost immediately, anywhere in the world, at virtually no cost) and all the different social entertainment options, people feel unable to perform an action that is so simple? An action that their ancestors going back all the way to the hominids has done at massively greater costs to them?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Housing in my city has been expensive for years, and the knock-on effect is that most people I know live so far apart we barely see each other anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you stack a two hour trip each way on top of the rising cost of doing anything at all, on top of already crushing housing and living costs, you end up with a perfect storm where staying home becomes the default. Not because people don’t want to socialise, but because the effort and expense make it impractical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has been a prolem where I live for years and I've actively watched it become worse over time as people have been forced to move further and further apart, and further and further away from the active areas of the city in order to be able to afford to keep a roof over their head.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's so interesting to see the tech community all angsty about the loneliness epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;20 years ago, the Pope warned of the coming "epidemic of loneliness" that the tech industry would bring us, and the tech industry laughed at him. They said he was just an old man who didn't understand and that technology would bring us together in unity and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, here we are 20 years later, and hardly a day goes by that someone doesn't submit an article to HN about loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the USA, the loneliness epidemic is compounded by isolation. A large portion of our society has moved into suburban communities that are largely impersonal. There is very little in the way of in-person community outside of churches or political movements that only certain kinds of people want to be involved with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the Internet giving us the ability to interact with our chosen niche with little effort, we are willing to accept this still-impersonal alternative to our stagnant communities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have found that, as a city-dweller, I benefit from separating myself from social media and going out into the world looking for more personal connections, but this is somewhat of a privilege afforded to those people who live in more densely populated areas. Even then, my distance from social media can sometimes be a handicap when you interact with people who are still reliant on it to coordinate everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For most people, the social opportunities that existed in the 70's through the 90's simply doesn't exist anymore. If you aren't using social media, you're practically being anti-social, but there is something inherently anti-social about social media to begin with, so you're screwed if you do and screwed if you don't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have 2 answers to this, depending on how you define "loneliness epidemic"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Genuine loneliness, like what you described, can only really be solved by touching grass. Figure out your hobbies, or find one if you don't have any.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My answer to what a lot of people call "the male loneliness epidemic" as a woman is to say it doesn't exist, you need to figure out how to be attractive. We aren't throwing ourselves on shitty men, and most of the men that complain are complaining because they feel entitled to us and thus put no effort into being attractive. The quickest way to be attractive is have empathy and not be a douche. Listen to peoples needs, and don't feel entitled to our attention&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Believe me, us men are not as "lonely" as you think. We can very easily be friends with each other, it's you who has to stop treating us like we're douches by default. We don't bite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The quickest way to be attractive is have empathy and not be a douche.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This would suggest most people are attractive. Is an empathic non-asshole really attractive, even without other things that make him interesting (e.g. travel experiences or interesting takes on things)?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We (reading this) can't do anything. An enlightened government might set policy in such ways as to fix this over the course of decades, but I don't even seen that being acknowledged as possible or desirable in those same decades. The problem will continue to deteriorate until it becomes catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In person RPGs, tabletop wargames and boardgames are amazing for geek culture. Thanks to local Discord groups, I have an active nerd community that I play games with at least once a week. This has revolutionized by social life!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a introverted crafty side of painting and 3D printing miniatures that works great for me too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These games all work as essentially offline alternatives to videogames and are way more fun!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, my local game store serves beer; so its essentially a nerd bar even though most people don't drink.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wargaming related references: Tabletop Minions on YouTube, The HiveScum podcast, Companies such as Black Site Studios and Conferences such as Adepticon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that can happen even when you are among 1000s of people, not just alone , if you are among people thinking of something else, staring into the void or that you can't connect etc. you are a deep person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deep person + deep thinker is the worse. Also people aren't doing them any favor by singing the praise of being a deep person and a deep thinker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also has to do with abundance of everything and being not in need of cooperating 24/7/365 to avoid starving ....some people slip into deep thinking and deep emotional introspection...yeah fuck that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know homeless people and rich people, equally lonely and unfulfilled and unhappy. I don't know what the solution is. I'm trying to figure it out. But I know that throwing money at this problem does little to solve it. I know from experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I'm feeling lonely, I stop feeling lonely and feel awesome instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are lots of good suggestions in here. People just need to go do them. And if there are structural impediments to doing them, then eliminate those impediments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wasn't getting out enough during the day because I share the car with my wife. So I bought an EBike and now I go out all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I chose to live in a place with things near by that I can go to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whenever I'm thinking, I'd like to go do an activity, but I need something else first, it's usually not true, or the other thing I need is easy to get.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People just need to decide to stop doing things that make them unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Easy, same as obesity and environmental problems: fix the built environment by building places for humans, not cars. It all stems from that in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because voluntary association isn't really allowed in the United States. You are forced to associate with people you don't want to, for a variety of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i wonder if a resurgence in social clubs like the Elks club/Moose lodge would ever catch on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i don't know how big they ever were in the past, but it seemed like it was commonly represented in media in the 50s/60s (e.g., the flintstones had a parody of the lodge which would suggest that they were common enough that people were familiar)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, first, props to you because you're actually doing something to initiate contact. That's a really big deal; more people need to do that. (Maybe even some that don't wrestle with loneliness.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what's you're next step? Someone comes up and marks that they feel really lonely. Do you get contact information? Invite them to something? (Invite them to what? You may have to create something - a board game night at your house, or a "lonely people shopping together" time at a grocery store, or something. You probably have to create that "something", because you're the one who's able to at least reach out, and the ones who are responding probably aren't there yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're finding people that need something. The next step is to find a way to connect them - with you, or with each other, or with someone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For any activity you come up with, some people won't be able to, due to time or temperament or personality or something. So maybe what you need is more than one. (Eventually. Look, don't get overwhelmed by that. Just one is the next step, in my view. And maybe some helpers.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So your proposal is to start an ad hoc friend group with people who come up to me, and try to become friends with them personally?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure I'm the right person for that. I live in a suburb, not the city that I do the surveys in. And I'm extraordinarily boring, and too old.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems that I should try to think bigger. Try to find a way to help these people connect with each other. Something in person, not an app like Hinge. Maybe, hold a sign that says ad hoc meet and greet at such and such time and place, after collecting a list of common interests and putting those interests on the same sign that says the time and date. That could work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my city, an older guy organized an “urban hiking group” where he would plan walking routes through the city, usually stopping at a restaurant for brunch. It was very popular, but probably a lot of work. He was semi-retired, so he had the time to do it. He did research to have talking points on the history of some spots we passed, like a tour guide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a great low key meet up. You didn’t have to make friends with the organizer. If you were walking with someone you didn’t really like in the group, it was easy to drift to talk to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;go volunteer. they're needed everywhere. problem solved. most able-bodied lonely people are that way because they can't be arsed to get off the damn couch. they would just rather discuss loneliness on social media. I can't be arsed either, but I don't feel lonely when I'm alone, which is the majority of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't believe in a 'loneliness epidemic'. Where is it? What do these words mean to individuals?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do think there is a 'false expectation' ie delusion. Ie, after years of forced hyper-socialisation (school, work) and cultural ideas of friendship (Friends), architecture that stacks and packs people, the expectation that people hold of themselves and their relationships bears little relation to their natural, untrained selves. I could even argue that the loneliness expectation is the reverse - there is no meaningful quiet space for individuals. The very idea of being introspective is a problem to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I think we have is 'broken socialisation'. Nothing about human socialisation is natural.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think part of the problem is that social media is normalized and it is easy. It is way easier to engage socially (or at least you feel like you're engaging socially) with likes and lurking and stuff. It is way harder to put on pants and go out and it is normalized to do so (phrasing like bedrotting is super casual, whereas it is actually really hard to maintain an eating disorder because you have to be constantly hiding it from people).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also I think there's more groups whose social norms online teach you to be repulsive offline and again there's not enough social pushback against it. We do need to be harder on casual edginess online because it is teaching habitual behaviors that make it hard to engage socially. Your 50 year old hiking buddy is not going to understand your soycuck joke you are trying to show him on your phone. Your average wine mom at women-only book club is not going to love if you insist on talking about banning trans people from the club because they're "men invading the women's spaces" especially when there's very likely 0 trans people to exclude in the first place on account of trans people being rare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly there is usually a ton of stuff happening but the instructions on how to engage with it is nebulous. People who know the algorithm find it easy, the people who don't know the algorithm find it super hard. And IDK how to solve that because there's so much going on in people's heads that they don't realize the people around them seriously aren't scrutinizing them that much. There's like a socialization death spiral where every small awkward interaction hurts way more when you don't have enough experience to know that the small awkward interactions are normal. So you can't tell someone "just go to book club" because they'll go, have 1 normal situation like mishearing someone and then decide they are so embarrassed they can never go to book club again-- but since it is so normal it happens at every social event and they end up lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You actually bring up the biggest obstacle to my tentative idea for this Sunday, of holding up a sign that points to a time/place for a casual conversation with strangers. I thought this would be a good way to get very lonely passers-by out of their comfort zone and into a situation where they have a chance to make friends and bond, but the absolute diversity of interests is the main show stopper. My first thought was to essentially avoid sensitive topics on the poster, such as religion and politics, but it still leaves the huge diversity of potential common interests open. So I started doing some research on the most common hobbies that people have in cities and that can be talked about casually, in hopes of finding like 5 ot 6 to write on the sign to get people into the coffee shop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no easy solution to this problem. It's a conflux of many factors. (There are no more "third spaces". Too much rent-seeking behavior. The centralization of platforms consolidates power and creates inertia. The dopamine-hacking of recommendation algorithms. Social media in general.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've written at length about related topics. Unfortunately, there are powerful invested interests in keeping things shitty. It's often critiqued as "capitalism is bad" but we're seeing today is better described as techno-feudalism than capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step one might be to stop calling it the loneliness epidemic. Loneliness is an emotion, isolation is a condition, and we might even expect that if people felt lonely more often they would try harder to be social and actually be less isolated. This is also a network effect: my reaction to my loneliness affects someone else's loneliness if I go talk to them (or not).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been thinking recently about the scale at which it seems the vast vast majority of people participate in close to zero public discussion online and what a bummer it is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basically all discussion platforms are broken for any sort of long term meaningful discussion which I think is at least part of the problem. Even this thread and this comment just the fact that the thread is now 4 hours old the amount of views and chance of getting many responses drops precipitously. On most platforms unless you are someone with a large following you basically have to think like a marketer and post often and early on posts to stand a chance of getting a discussion going. It's always so ephemeral too. Even though posts on a platform like HN on reddit still exist and you can comment on old threads probably 99% of the activity happens in the first 6 or so hours and then it largely ends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It makes me miss forums where at least you had long lived threads with simple time based post order and a good chance of replies. This doesn't seem to exist on only platforms now and forums have largely faded away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fragmentation of discussion has also messed things up. For example yesterday I was listening to a HardFork podcast episode which is a fairly popular pod, topping the charts in at least the tech category, and after listening I wanted to check for discussion around the episode and probably leave a comment or two. I assume this episode had to have gotten at least in the low tens of thousands of plays though perhaps that is way off. I went searching for discussion and basically found a largely dead subreddit for the podcast with no threads being regularly created for the episode and an empty comment section on nytimes which any site comment section is a useless place for discussion anyways. The pod is also posted on youtube which the youtube comment section had the most activity of anything I found but the youtube comment section and the way it is structured/operates is perhaps the most useless of all the platforms for trying to have any discussion. I just don't understand how if at least say ten thousand people listened to the episode surely at least 1% would be interested in discussing it and 100+ people going back and forth would be a large, active, healthy discussion somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even threads that seem "active" on sites like HN or Reddit in the context of the actual audience sizes are shockingly small and confuse me. For example The Pitt season 2 just premiered and posted 5.4 million viewers, the subreddit post ep discussion currently has 5.3k comments which is quite high for a show. That is a joke of a percentage though, 0.1%! and even worse in the context of people that are posting probably post more than once in the thread. I understand many and even most people not wanting to post to discuss a show they just watched but how the hell is less than 1 in a thousand!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post got long which also damages the chance of any engagement due to TLDR culture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of these comments recommend church. While valid if it works for you, it doesn't mesh with me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found community through a shared enjoyment of an activity that must be done as a group. Grass roots motorsports in my case, but any activity that needs you to be there with others should work the same. The key is that you should enjoy it and you should have time to interact with people. I like to make car go vroom, but generalize the approach and it should work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first season, I won an event with a hero run that sent me from 5th to 1st. When I parked, a random guy stuck his head in my window and started hyping me up for it. I still think about that 3 years later and it still makes me feel good. That feeling made me want to do that for others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started approaching random people I'd seen before and just starting a conversation. It was rough the first few times but it gets easier. You already have a shared activity so just start with that. I made a point to remember people's names or at least their car (bad with names, but cars stick for some reason). If the name didn't stick, I'll ask again next time and maybe bring up their car so they know I remember them. When I know their name, I use it when I see them again. Maybe just "Hey bob!" as I'm passing, but something to let them know someone there knows them and cares enough to say hi. They're not a stranger at least. If I haven't seen them in a while, I ask how they've been and spend a bit more effort on the conversation than just a "hey".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It started with the regulars. Now I'm looking for the new faces. I know stuff and they need to know that stuff, so it's easy to talk. If they come back, they should be able to find someone to talk to so I introduce them to some of the other regulars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I look for people eating lunch alone and I go talk to them. Maybe 2 to 5 minutes, maybe longer. Depends on them. Sometimes I'm awkward. Sometimes I say dumb stuff. Whatever. I'm trying to help these people not be alone at a social event if they don't want to be. If they do, that's fine too, but I'll try again next time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some people are closed off and don't really want to talk. That's fine. I still say hi by name and see how it goes. Not trying to push, just keeping the door open. After a few times of trying, a lot of people will start to open up our let the guard down. Some don't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm an introvert and all of this takes extra mental energy on top of the events being competition and work. I don't have the time to compete at the highest level every event because I'm spending time helping others. Rather than getting a better driver in my car to tell me where I'm making mistakes, I'm trying to get the less skilled drivers in my car so they can see why I'm faster. Instead of reviewing data over lunch to see where I'm losing time, I'm trying to build community. I want people to come back. There's a cost to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I moved to the middle of nowhere 10 years ago and had no local friends. Work friends are rarely real friends. Tech meets, young professionals groups, nothing came out of those. It sucks to go to a bar alone. None of that produced anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Motorsport has been the only activity I've tried where I've started making friends who I talk to outside the events. A lot of it is still about motorsports, but I've gained a few friends who I sim race with or talk to online in the off season. It could have been any other group or activity, but those are the people who made me feel welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Real figures, there are at least 25 people I can walk up to and start a conversation with at an event and have good rapport, more that I know by name and just haven't clicked with, 2-3 people I consider actual friends. I started putting in the effort like this after my first season, so this is the product of 2 seasons of effort (winter doesn't count because there are no events). I'm still kind of lonely, but it's better and getting better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it's that I put in effort. I know I've helped some of those people feel like part of a community. I gave them a few people they could talk to so they didn't feel so alone. Maybe my role was just keeping them coming back until they found their clique. Maybe I need more time to get to know them. Some introverts need an extrovert to help them get started. Sometimes that extrovert is an introvert tryhard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason I do this is cause one guy stuck his head in my window after a run and said something like "bro that was awesome! Nice run!" And he was genuinely happy for me even though he barely knew me. I'm not good at that specific thing so I try in my own way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think people look for community. I did. I bounced off a few groups because I didn't fit in. I'm trying to do my part to help people "fit in". Tech solutions ain't gonna help here. Get face to face, make outsiders feel accepted, and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IMO it is not possible. The world has changed. Until modernity, people made connections out of economic necessity. Either you get a wife or have fun farming by yourself - literally it doesn't work so you die. Either you're friends with the baker or you don't get bread or get absolute shittiest-quality goods and you die. And so on. Shut-ins didn't exist because it was physically impossible to survive without leaving your room. No UberEats, no Amazon Prime, no remote work, no internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the economic necessity to form relationships with others disappeared, the naked truth was exposed - most people don't fucking like each other. Yes, when you're starving to death you'll be friends with the guy who has potatoes, but when you can buy the damn potatoes yourself in the supermarket, you're not going to tolerate his smelly ass.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most friendships form over common participation in a project. Doing something together, knowing that you have to put up with the other one to achieve higher goals. Without those goals, there are no incentives to deal with others. And what goals am I supposed to have if by doing nothing I already have a roof above my head, full fridge, clean house, and an entire library of video games?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think about the main message of feminism: "Girl, you can make it in life without a man. Don't settle for an aggressive alcoholic just because that's the only option. You can do it yourself.". It perfectly captures how forming relationships turned from an asset into a liability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loneliness epidemic started 30+ years ago. There were books written in the 90s about it(bowling alone). Nothing modern can be blamed on it. If anything, social media is helping the crisis; not causing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 'fixes' has been established for just as long. My nearby 'community centre' was built in 1987. Has this been successful at all? Not in the least bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reality of what is causing this hasnt changed. Without fixing this key problem, the crisis obviously has continued for 30+ years. I'm not nostradamus here. However, from many previous conversations it's crazy how absolutely nobody is ready to talk about the cause. They'd rather just call it a paradox or feign ignorance for why this is happening. Honestly it's rather conspiratorial creating when you think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of curiousity I asked what gemini 3 pro thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Revival of third places.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As if that hasnt been tried for 30+ years... fail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. replacing 'socializing' with "service"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is that cleaning a park will somehow make you less lonely is laughable at best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Bridging the generational gap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elderly teach the young skills? while youth teach digital literacy. My community centre literally has this. F mark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Urban design and walkability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need to spend trillions of dollars to completely redesign and rebuild cities? lol what.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. digital hygiene&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;social media is a sedative? crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love gemini, but man they are getting it so wrong. All of this will likely just caused the crisis to be worse in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me, has this been done unintentionally through the typical 'road to hell is paved with good intentions' or has this been intentionally done and maintained? The refusal to acknowledge the cause seems to push toward intentional. Guess we just live with the loneliness epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;We need to spend trillions of dollars to completely redesign and rebuild cities? lol what.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean the point is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US bet on the wrong urban planning ideas, and now it is facing the consequences. This is not unique to the US; other places have fallen into the same trap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This feels overly cynical and reductive. A problem existing for 30 years doesn’t mean modern forces haven’t made it worse or changed its shape. Bowling Alone didn’t argue “nothing can help,” it showed that social participation declined as work hours grew, commutes lengthened, communities hollowed out, and institutions lost funding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those trends didn’t stop in the 90s, they accelerated! I lived through it myself. Social media isn’t the sole cause, but it clearly displaces time, lowers the incentive to show up in person, and offers connection without obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Saying “community centers existed in 1987” misses the point... they stopped working when participation stopped being the default and became optional, inconvenient, and socially risky. People feel worn out and get "good enough" at home... so they choose the poor substitute. This also mirrors american food consumption habits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This doesn’t require a conspiracy. It’s an emergent outcome of optimizing society for efficiency, mobility, and consumption instead of continuity and belonging. Service, third places, walkability, and intergenerational spaces aren’t magic fixes... and loneliness isn’t solved by “hanging out,” it’s solved by repeated, role-based, low-friction interaction where people are needed. We all but know how to fix this problem, there are piles of research behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real failure isn’t that these ideas were tried, it’s that we stripped away the economic and cultural structures that made them functional at all, then declared them ineffective. Pretending that nothing structural can help just guarantees the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;from what I've looked into, on an individual level, the main thing I need to do is learn how to be a good company for others. Be for other strangers what I would want them to be for me. But it's easier said then done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From a practical perspective, there is the whole "3rd place" issue. How can I open a business that caters to the public, who will just sit there and loiter on their phones and laptops all day and be profitable. Starbucks sort of did it in the 90s, but they're not tolerating that anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forget businesses, can you walk to a park, a beach, a hiking trail on a whim and run into people? Can you hold events, watch parties,etc.. on public places easily like that? It's not easy at all these days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I blame cars. I despise the idea that electric cars are the replacement to cars, without considering changing transportation so that it is more efficient with trams, trains,etc... The side-effect of that is you run into strangers on public transport. This doesn't just affect the loneliness epidemic, it is in my opinion a direct cause of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and of course obesity. You can't even be homeless and sleep on the streets these days. Even the park benches are built to be hostile to anyone that wants to chill there for too long.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Society was restructured between 1950s-1980s so that it is suburbanized. It's all about the family unit, single family homes, freeways and roads built to facilitate single family homes (after WW2, starting families was all the rage, plus white-flight didn't help). Shopping centers built to cater to consumers driving from their suburban homes. Malls you can walk in, after you drove some time to park there. Even when you buy food items at grocery stores, pay attention to serving sizes, it is improving a little, but you'll see at minimum a serving size of two typically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Society was deliberately engineered so that you have more reasons to spend more as a consumer. Families spend more per-capita. suburbs mean more houses purchased, entire generations renting with their bank as a landlord via mortgages, home repair, home insurance, car insurance, car repairs, gas stations for cars where you can get the most unhealthy things out there in the most frequented and convenient places. Make kids, make wives, make ex-wives, get sick the whole lot of you for hospitals, health insurances,etc..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It wasn't planned by some central committees or secret cabal, but it was planned nonetheless by economists and policy makers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If everyone just got married and had kids, they won't be lonely would they? you don't need to hang out at park with strangers, you'll feel less of a member of your local neighborhood who look and think like you, and start thinking more as one people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the interpersonal interactions and opportunities to build relationships with people are commercialized and controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For one reason or another, people are just not getting married in their early 20's anymore, or having that many kids later on like before. Even when you get married, your interaction is by design with other married people, who are busy commuting in their cars to and fro work, kids school,kids sports, plays,etc... imagine taking your kids on busses and trains every day to these places which are fairly near-by, by necessity. you'll be spending time with them instead of operating machinery. They'll be meeting stranger kids from other schools, seeing random strangers all the time, you'll be talking to randos as you walk to the train, wait on the bus,etc.. but this can't be monetized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blame the economists and policy makers if you want to blame someone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want solutions, let's talk explicitly about the policy changes that need to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Too much traffic? tear down the freeways instead of building more lanes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It costs $10B to build a simple metro line? pass better laws to regulate bidding and costs, investigate fraud and waste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But to dig even deeper into the root of the matter, look at what is celebrated and prized in society. Most of its ills come from there. For most Americans, it is inconceivable to be able to just go out of your house without any plans or destination in mind and just start walking and see where you end up, and who you run into. That's a crucial and tragic ability that's been lost. We really have more urgent things to address to be fair, but ultimately, this can only be solved one small step at a time, but also big sweeping changes are needed. The first step is to define and accept what the problem is, and where the blame and cause lie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Blame the economists and policy makers if you want to blame someone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wouldn't go as far as blaming, but American society should at least acknowledge their responsibility for this. Its not like the KGB imposed zoning laws in Texas. You (Americans) did. Americans chose the urban model they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well the KGB are not economists, so you're right I guess. It was economists and war hawks, suburbanism was also desired because it makes cities a harder target for nukes. Like I said, it wasn't some secret cabal. But there are academics and policy makers behind it. it's important because we have academics and policy makers now too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; who don't feel that they can join any local groups&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crux of the issue right here. Idiots online keep blasting into their eyeballs that they are worthless and society has already collapsed. All they need to do is go down the road and join a club or a church or something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Especially for users of this website. Almost all clubs are in dire need of a webmaster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;on the topic of platonic friendship, I couldn’t disagree more with a lot of the comments. I have plenty of friends yet I don’t do clubs and will never, ever do organized religion. People advising it are religious freaks in my opinion. Some of my best friends took this advice to go to church and bible study. They complain every time I see them about the people in their church. Meanwhile I’ve made more and better friends online. Its not hard, get on social media, find an influencer/streamer that matches your vibes and go jump into the official or adjacent discord community and play video games with people in that community. If you engage in active listening and are a decent person, you will easily make plenty of friends. Additionally, I think in person hangouts are kinda mid, but I hangout with my friends in-person (at a minimum) every other day when I weight lift. Like seriously, I often would rather chill in Discord than go and hang out in-person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me the male loneliness epidemic is more about a lack of ability to find meaningful romantic relationships. I’ve been thinking about this a lot, and as somebody who has been doing online dating since it essentially started, I am pretty sure that the problem (or at least a major piece) is that match group has commodified romantic relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know a lot of people will focus on meeting people in public or whatever, but it has been my experience that dating has become completely garbage and a large part is because all of the current popular dating apps disallow index search and funnel you into swiping. From a mate selection perspective this makes no sense. Not only does it muddy the waters about who is actually a real match, but it also does psychic damage to make so many shallow judgements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back before match group bought OkCupid, I used to have excellent results finding people their who shared a lot of common ground with, messaging them with a thoughtful message, and going on dates. Swiping is an absolute crap shoot, and often I feel like I am being used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is up to them to change. They won't change, and this "loneliness epidemic" is starting to become really fucking annoying. It is almost a grift now to shit on tech by mids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These people don't want to go outside or engage with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is like people who are drug/alcohol/tobacco/gambling/sex/etc addicts. It is up to the individual to change. How is it anyone else's responsibility?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I surveyed a bunch of people on reddit, discords, etc. a couple years ago to figure out why people are lonely, back when this whole "loneliness" movement was starting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of these people say they have "trauma" or some other mental block as a primary reason why they're lonely (btw they're in discords with thousands of people, and playing online games with OTHER PEOPLE). I'm sorry but everyone has shit going on in their lives. You aren't really that special.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe 1-5% of people have dealt with actual, really horrific trauma, and even they have managed to go on to have fulfilling lives. They chose to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm an asshole, no doubt, and I've dealt with my own traumas in the past that were honestly way more fucking horrible than "I'm shy" or "nobody likes [insert some esoteric niche]" and guess what? Who cares? Go outside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no helping these people, or anyone to be honest, unless they really want to make a change. These aren't starving Sudanese or people who live in India or something where you can't just "go outside". Mfs be in CALIFORNIA and crying. I'd understand if they were lonely because they were living in Iraq or Venezuela or something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only solution is we build a Matrix, and put all these people into it. I will bet 100% of my net worth and any earnings from my entire lineage for perpetuity that they will still fucking complain and be lonely. I was really hopeful for metaverse, too bad but maybe there's still a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I never want to hear about "loneliness epidemic" again, to me it just sounds like DEI/ESG/Eacc and other bs grifting now to hate on tech. Everything is a choice. You press A in a video game even though you're lonely, why not press A to go outside?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These people aren't lonely, they exist in massive online echo chambers with other people. And honestly? I think they like it. Most drug addicts loved being on drugs even though it was a horrific existence. They don't like it when they're narcan'd during OD. But when they decide to get clean, I am proud that they actually did it how amazing is that? SO these lonely people have to stop crying and step outside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm also originally from India. My thoughts/opinions are my own and based on my experiences, and yes I stand by them. I remember the pollution, the trash everywhere, and I come from a poor family who lived in a 1 room home with no running water and an outdoor commode. My life was hell there, and I have to pinch myself every morning to make sure I'm not dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have the right to your opinion, and your own relative experience. You don't need to get so easily offended, relax.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wasn't being a dick, sry if it came off that way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have young boys in your life then teach them that it's ok to feel and express their emotions, and as they get older that their sexual self need not be frightening and that sex can exist outside of narratives of domination.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This requires them to have spaces where they can express themselves sexually without the fear that male sexuality will be judged as inherently violent or oppressive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've lost count of the times I've seen women praised while men were castigated, in the same space, for expressing any kind of honest sexual preference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why should we lie to them? Nearly all NSFW content takes the most extreme forms of taboos related to social oppression and ratchets them up well past 11. Almost no one in the USA can even begin to relate to sex in ways that don't involve "domination", or "race", or some weird Freudian familial relation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we need to begin by destigmatizing the male libido. Simply saying "male desire is good and it's fine to have it" is literally heretical anywhere except among gay men. Men never got any kind of sexual liberation. Young boys need only to look at their own usually mutilated manhoods to see what modern society thanks of their desire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To even begin to teach them that they can relate to sex without domination, first teach them that their own desires are not evil.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Yes, we live in a patriarchal society. That same patriarchy is at the core of our modern loneliness. Teaching young people that "it doesn't have to be this way" isn't lying. Telling them it's the natural order of things is the lie that ultimately tears people apart because their bodies know differently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; To even begin to teach them that they can relate to sex without domination, first teach them that their own desires are not evil.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's an annoyingly double-edged issue, and one that I believe neither side of the political spectrum (speaking in very broad strokes here) has addressed well at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though I usually consider myself progressive (to an annoying degree to some), the progressive "answer" to young men right now on how to find friends and partners is essentially something like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You should just be yourself! &amp;gt; But, if you aren't practically perfect and even slightly express your social and physical needs you are a monster. &amp;gt; But, even if you are perfect, we reserve the right to hate you based on experiences with other people of your gender, or because of your privilege, even though you probably have never felt it, and we're also allowed to make fun of you because of said privilege, since making fun of you is "punching up". &amp;gt; Also, you also should accept that you will *always* be considered a threat to half the population due to how you were born, and if you don't accept that or even try to prove the opposite, that makes you even more dangerous. &amp;gt; If you aren't happy with this you are an incel, and don't even mention the word "misandry", that's not a thing. The only way to change this is to either be gay or transition into a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously I'm employing a bit of hyperbole for emphasis and this is also me trying to empathize with what it's like being a boy right now despite lacking first-hand experience. Luckily, most women do not feel this way about men, but I've heard all of this said by my friends at one time or another (and I might have said something similar myself during my weaker moments, when I was upset).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the hardliners on the opposite side of the spectrum espouse the idea that actually men should be evil because it's manly. That women are lesser to them and that patriarchy is super cool actually. See Andrew Tate as an example, who has captured the ears of millions of teenage boys around the world. At first it's hard to comprehend why his ideology speaks to them, but you have to remember that most of them are just entering the time of their life where they have to figure themselves out, where they have to, for the first time in their life, find friendship, respect and companionship on their own outside of the family or the playground. And after all, everyone wants to be loved and respected in some way, and Andrew Tate offers them an answer: You can be an asshole and still be loved and respected, while the leftie answer tells them that you can be as perfect as you like, but you probably still won't be loved and respected, and if you fuck up, don't expect any grace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now the question is what should society actually do so that both young men and young women can find a harmonious place in it? I think really the only answer is to stop playing the blame game, stop trying to make one side the constant bad guy and scapegoat, try to comprehend that we are all equally human, and that whatever a person's gender is doesn't give you the right to be shitty to them. I don't know, maybe this is simply another utopian idea, of men and women living together in perfect unison, never being mean to each other. I think we should still strive to achieve some sort of balance, but sadly I don't really see an easy answer to this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sorry for this long rant, I've wanted to put this into words for a while. Occasionally I think about how bad it must be being a teenage boy right now, the thought scares me and I feel lucky not being one. Every time I read another woman saying that she's afraid of every man on the street walking in proximity to her, and every time it's dark out and I hear a man behind me and I get physically afraid, I think, what if I was a man and she was afraid for her life because of me? Just because I exist in the space next to her? Just because of a random coin-flip during my conception? And it feels awful. I don't want anyone to go through that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; It's an annoyingly double-edged issue, and one that I believe neither side of the political spectrum (speaking in very broad strokes here) has addressed well at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where would you expect to see it addressed? bell hooks wrote The Will To Change more than twenty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My experience suggests that Tate is talked about far more (like, orders of magnitude) than actually directly heard (unless you count fair-use clips in attempts at critique). The strongest advocates I've seen for the rights and well-being of men in general, and young men in the dating world in particular, have come from across the political spectrum in other regards, including literal socialists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; See Andrew Tate as an example, who has captured the ears of millions of teenage boys around the world. At first it's hard to comprehend why his ideology speaks to them,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is super easy to understand. He tells them they are superior and that feels good. He tells them they are entitled to dominate others and that makes them feel powerful. People LOVE to hear they are superior over others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And all your complains about progressives boils them to them acknowledging that Tate adjacent people exist, that philosophy runs in top levels of the government and the rest of us have to react to it. Like, all your complains about progressives are super mild compared to what conservative people say and think about the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; And now the question is what should society actually do so that both young men and young women can find a harmonious place in it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no harmony possible when the woman is degraded or subjugated. There is only fake harmony possible when it is not allowed to speak about threat of Tate like conservatives, because someones feelings might be hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I think we should still strive to achieve some sort of balance, but sadly I don't really see an easy answer to this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no balance with "I think women are inferior and should be mistreated".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Every time I read another woman saying that she's afraid of every man on the street walking in proximity to her, and every time it's dark out and I hear a man behind me and I get physically afraid, I think, what if I was a man and she was afraid for her life because of me? Just because I exist in the space next to her?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the context of male gendered violence literally promoted by conservative thinkers, it is women talking about the impact it has on them who is causing the unfair harm to men. This is absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is, frankly, a thing feminists books claim and I did not believed is a real thing. Except here you are, writing exactly those words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I blame the on-line attention economy - which always rewards yet-more-extreme reactions, positions, and performative "virtues". But attaches zero value to actual pro-social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; that their sexual self need not be frightening and that sex can exist outside of narratives of domination&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This makes a ton of sense but the language needs so much work here to be digested into a real conversation by your average parent, let alone preteen/teenager.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure how you arrived at that conclusion. The loneliness epidemic is relatively recent, and unless I'm misunderstanding you, this isn't something young boys were taught in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's more that they need to unlearn what society has been telling them for the past couple of decades. Young boys in the past weren't brought up being essentially told they are monsters and that expressing preferences is "objectifying women" etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HN has some odd people that don't jump to tech solutions for everything. Plus I'm banned from reddit for 3 days for making a dark joke, and besides, my reddit post asking the same thing went nowhere. At least people here engage in good faith and depth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I actually wanted to suggest government funded online dating, so we aren't beholden to godawful Tinder and its clones (OkCupid was great for me until it got bought out and turned into Tinder).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a slightly different angle on that - Government mandated open algorithms, exposure of sort factors (are you in the back of the line in the swipe queue), and monthly disclosure of male/female ratios. Yeah, it'll effectively crush their business models and then they actually need to start solving the problems they've created (extreme superficiality, not background checking users, not addressing bots, not acknowledging that US has an implicit class system)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to figure out if I have enough energy to try to pitch this to my representatives office, but I don't know if 30-40% adults never marrying or falling birth rates would be arguments that democratic politician would care to act upon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you talking about the US? If so, I heard this proposed on a podcast “Grey Area”. Mandatory two year draft for all, regardless of gender. It sounds crazy at first but it kind makes sense the more you think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think I get what you’re trying to say but realistically, it doesn’t add up. The draft was 33 years. The US is only 250 years old (give or take) so over 10% of our history had conscription. The Vietnam and Korean War was widely unpopular because it was the first broadcasted war. People watch their family get blown up on TV. It had nothing to do with “freedom to serve military”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you argue a draft is counterproductive because it a waste of resources and we have better means to serve young adults, I could buy it. But arguing a draft is not the American way because it’s “our freedom to decide what we want” is a bit silly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do absolutely agree that I wouldn’t trust the current administration or culture to faithfully execute on this idea though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;CVEs affecting the Svelte ecosystem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time to upgrade&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve released patches for 5 vulnerabilities across &lt;code&gt;devalue&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;svelte&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;@sveltejs/kit&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;@sveltejs/adapter-node&lt;/code&gt;. Here’s what you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Upgrade now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re using any of these packages, upgrade them to their corresponding non-vulnerable versions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;devalue&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;5.6.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;svelte&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;5.46.4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;@sveltejs/kit&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;2.49.5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;@sveltejs/adapter-node&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;5.5.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For cross-dependent packages — &lt;code&gt;svelte&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@sveltejs/kit&lt;/code&gt; depend on &lt;code&gt;devalue&lt;/code&gt; — patched versions already include upgraded dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Commentary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re extremely thankful to all of the security researchers who responsibly disclosed these vulnerabilities and worked with us to get them fixed, to the security team at Vercel who helped us navigate the disclosure process, and to the maintainers who worked to publish the fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks, we’ve seen a spate of high profile vulnerabilities affecting popular tools across the web development ecosystem. While they are unfortunate, it has been encouraging to see the community pulling together to keep end users safe. Using the lessons learned from these vulnerabilities, we will invest in processes that will help catch future bugs during the writing and review phases, before they go live.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think you have discovered a vulnerability in a package maintained by the Svelte team, we urge you to privately report it via the Security tab on the repo in question (or the Svelte repo, if unsure).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Details&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full reports are available in the published security advisories, but we’ve included a brief summary of each below.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JuiceFS is a high-performance POSIX file system released under Apache License 2.0, particularly designed for the cloud-native environment. The data, stored via JuiceFS, will be persisted in Object Storage (e.g. Amazon S3), and the corresponding metadata can be persisted in various compatible database engines such as Redis, MySQL, and TiKV based on the scenarios and requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With JuiceFS, massive cloud storage can be directly connected to big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and various application platforms in production environments. Without modifying code, the massive cloud storage can be used as efficiently as local storage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;📖 Document: Quick Start Guide&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fully POSIX-compatible: Use as a local file system, seamlessly docking with existing applications without breaking business workflow.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fully Hadoop-compatible: JuiceFS' Hadoop Java SDK is compatible with Hadoop 2.x and Hadoop 3.x as well as a variety of components in the Hadoop ecosystems.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;S3-compatible: JuiceFS' S3 Gateway provides an S3-compatible interface.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cloud Native: A Kubernetes CSI Driver is provided for easily using JuiceFS in Kubernetes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shareable: JuiceFS is a shared file storage that can be read and written by thousands of clients.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Strong Consistency: The confirmed modification will be immediately visible on all the servers mounted with the same file system.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Outstanding Performance: The latency can be as low as a few milliseconds, and the throughput can be expanded nearly unlimitedly (depending on the size of the Object Storage). Test results&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data Encryption: Supports data encryption in transit and at rest (please refer to the guide for more information).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Global File Locks: JuiceFS supports both BSD locks (flock) and POSIX record locks (fcntl).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data Compression: JuiceFS supports LZ4 or Zstandard to compress all your data.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Architecture | Getting Started | Advanced Topics | POSIX Compatibility | Performance Benchmark | Supported Object Storage | Who is using | Roadmap | Reporting Issues | Contributing | Community | Usage Tracking | License | Credits | FAQ&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JuiceFS consists of three parts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;JuiceFS Client: Coordinates Object Storage and metadata storage engine as well as implementation of file system interfaces such as POSIX, Hadoop, Kubernetes, and S3 gateway.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data Storage: Stores data, with supports of a variety of data storage media, e.g., local disk, public or private cloud Object Storage, and HDFS.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Metadata Engine: Stores the corresponding metadata that contains information of file name, file size, permission group, creation and modification time and directory structure, etc., with supports of different metadata engines, e.g., Redis, MySQL, SQLite and TiKV.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JuiceFS can store the metadata of file system on different metadata engines, like Redis, which is a fast, open-source, in-memory key-value data storage, particularly suitable for storing metadata; meanwhile, all the data will be stored in Object Storage through JuiceFS client. Learn more&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each file stored in JuiceFS is split into "Chunk" s at a fixed size with the default upper limit of 64 MiB. Each Chunk is composed of one or more "Slice"(s), and the length of the slice varies depending on how the file is written. Each slice is composed of size-fixed "Block" s, which are 4 MiB by default. These blocks will be stored in Object Storage in the end; at the same time, the metadata information of the file and its Chunks, Slices, and Blocks will be stored in metadata engines via JuiceFS. Learn more&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When using JuiceFS, files will eventually be split into Chunks, Slices and Blocks and stored in Object Storage. Therefore, the source files stored in JuiceFS cannot be found in the file browser of the Object Storage platform; instead, there are only a chunks directory and a bunch of digitally numbered directories and files in the bucket. Don't panic! This is just the secret of the high-performance operation of JuiceFS!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before you begin, make sure you have:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One supported metadata engine, see How to Set Up Metadata Engine&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One supported Object Storage for storing data blocks, see Supported Object Storage&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;JuiceFS Client downloaded and installed&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please refer to Quick Start Guide to start using JuiceFS right away!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out all the command line options in command reference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JuiceFS can be used as a persistent volume for Docker and Podman, please check here for details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is also very easy to use JuiceFS on Kubernetes. Please find more information here.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Aside from the POSIX features covered by pjdfstest, JuiceFS also provides:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Close-to-open consistency. Once a file is written and closed, it is guaranteed to view the written data in the following opens and reads from any client. Within the same mount point, all the written data can be read immediately.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rename and all other metadata operations are atomic, which are guaranteed by supported metadata engine transaction.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Opened files remain accessible after unlink from same mount point.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mmap (tested with FSx).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fallocate with punch hole support.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extended attributes (xattr).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;BSD locks (flock).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;POSIX record locks (fcntl).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JuiceFS provides a subcommand that can run a few basic benchmarks to help you understand how it works in your environment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A sequential read/write benchmark has also been performed on JuiceFS, EFS and S3FS by fio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above result figure shows that JuiceFS can provide 10X more throughput than the other two (see more details).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A simple mdtest benchmark has been performed on JuiceFS, EFS and S3FS by mdtest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result shows that JuiceFS can provide significantly more metadata IOPS than the other two (see more details).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The design of JuiceFS was inspired by Google File System, HDFS and MooseFS. Thanks for their great work!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JuiceFS supports many Object Storage services. Please check out this list first. If the Object Storage you want to use is compatible with S3, you could treat it as S3. Otherwise, try reporting any issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. Since v1.0.0 Beta3 JuiceFS supports the use of Redis Cluster as the metadata engine, but it should be noted that Redis Cluster requires that the keys of all operations in a transaction must be in the same hash slot, so a JuiceFS file system can only use one hash slot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See "Redis Best Practices" for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Google-level engineering productivity suite&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software engineering is being fundamentally transformed by AI, and we're building the tools to lead that shift. Aviator is creating the engineering productivity supertools that will define how the best teams build software in the AI era.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our platform already powers workflow automation at Slack, Figma, DoorDash, and other industry leaders. MergeQueue eliminates merge conflicts and broken builds. FlexReview intelligently routes code reviews. And Runbooks—our newest product—is a collaborative AI agent platform that lets engineering teams automate complex workflows through natural language specs and shared context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe the future of software development isn't engineers replaced by AI—it's engineers supercharged by it. Small teams will ship what once required hundreds of people. Complex workflows that took days will complete in minutes. We're building that future.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;All 23-Bit Still Lifes Are Glider Constructible&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;December 27, 2025 / gol&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the Game of Life, which still lifes can be produced by crashing gliders together? We’ve known for a few years that the answer cannot be “all of them”, because in 2022 Ilkka Törmä and Ville Salo found a patch of still life that, if it exists in the universe, must have existed since the beginning of time. And so, there is no way we could have produced it out of empty space through glider collisions. Similar such patches have been found since, with the goal of optimising size or population, and at the time of writing the record holder is an unsynthesizable still life with population 154 produced by forum user “400spartans”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding syntheses for small still lifes is easy, but at some unknown point below 154 it becomes impossible. Today, we completed our collaborative project to notch the lower bound up from 22 to 23, by giving explicit syntheses for all 1,646,147 (strict)A still life is strict when all its islands are necessary to maintain the stability of the pattern.&lt;lb/&gt; still lifes with population 23. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final holdout shown below has systematic name xs23_g88m9icz1iu146, and was solved by vilc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you might imagine, this is not the first project of this kind; all still lifes with 18 bits were synthesised in October 2019, 19 bits in February 2020, 20 bits in March 2021, 21 bits in November 2022 and 22 bits in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the number of bits increases, the number of distinct still lifes explodes exponentially, so that the 23-bit project had about 2.4× as many still lifes to consider as the 22-bit project. The situation is actually worse than that: not only are there more problems to get through, but each additional bit reveals knotty new ways for a still life to fit together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My contribution was the mass generation of synthesis recipes through computer searches. These disposed of roughly 99.97% of the targets, letting the people with actual synthesis talent focus on the ones where new ideas were needed. I’ll spend the rest of the post talking about the things I tried.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the solution for that final still life, split into steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solutions like this are typical: there is a natural reaction that produces a large chunk of still life, and then many “synthesis components” massage that into the target.There is an unfortunate clash of terminology between this kind of “component” and a connected component of a pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of these first steps are discovered via soup searches. Sometimes, a random soup will produce a still life of interest through the random collision of some simple reagents. If we are lucky, it is possible to reproduce the reaction by using gliders to re-create the same configuration of reagents. We can also find first steps by randomly colliding gliders directly; this was the topic of a previous post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of the action happens after this first step, in finding sequences of components that massage a known still life into the target.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Transfer and Stomp&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see in the above example, most synthesis steps only touch a small part of the still life. And because pattern behaviour in the Game of Life is determined locally, the incoming gliders in a synthesis step don’t particularly care what the rest of a still life looks like, only that the part they interact with is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this reason, there is hope of “transferring” synthesis steps from one still life to another. There is a &lt;code&gt;transfer.py&lt;/code&gt; script in
Shinjuku that does exactly this: from each component, one can
extract a “component template” which only remembers the placements of
the gliders and the part of the still life which is affected. Then,
for each component template and each target, the script tests whether
the output of the template matches any location on the target, and for
anywhere that matches, whether the component actually effects that
change successfully. This script, together with some extensions by
Alex Greason, were important in all the synthesis projects up to the
current one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;code&gt;transfer.py&lt;/code&gt; is a little slow, and a little limited.
Independently, vilc and myself worked on some C++ replacements:
&lt;code&gt;transfer.cpp&lt;/code&gt; and Stomp respectively.The &lt;code&gt;transfer.py&lt;/code&gt; script
spends a lot of its time in the underlying C++ &lt;code&gt;lifelib&lt;/code&gt; library, so
the change of language doesn’t have as much of an impact as you might
think.&lt;lb/&gt; Stomp is what I used to do the initial mass solving of the still lifes that only required one step to be transferred from a known component, as well as to find the long recipes that were necessary for some of the trickier still lifes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stomp does a few things that make it a lot faster; the first is that it is multithreaded. This is easy enough: processing each target is an embarrassingly parallel problem. Next, it uses a more refined notion of “template” that also takes into account neighbourhood counts for cells that don’t change. This cuts down on the number of false positive matches a lot. The templates are also not simply applied one at a time, instead, Stomp builds a tree of templates, where each node branches on the state of an additional cell in the template (up to some fairly shallow depth).This was apparently the intended strategy to be used in the &lt;code&gt;transfer.py&lt;/code&gt; script; one of the crucial functions
is called &lt;code&gt;apply_tree&lt;/code&gt; but doesn’t actually use a tree.&lt;lb/&gt; This allows us to throw out a lot of the templates without checking individually whether they match, once we reach a branch in the tree that no longer matches any location in the target pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of all the above, Stomp is quite discerning about which component templates it’s willing to consider. I tried a lot of heuristics while working on Stomp, and here are the ones I landed on by the end. We ignore components in any of the following situations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pure cleanup steps, where the thing being deleted is unattached to the remainder of the still life. Because we are doing a backwards search for components that lead to a target, allowing cleanup steps would lead to an explosion of precursors with, say, an extra block in all possible positions. (&lt;code&gt;transfer.py&lt;/code&gt;does the same.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;All the input still lifes are small (&amp;lt;7 in population). These are likely first steps derived from soups as discussed above, and not generalisable.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Less than 30% of the original still life survives unchanged; to avoid junk “components” that essentially blow up a still life and replace it with a new one.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There are multiple disconnected changes to the still life. These often arise when performing symmetric changes to a symmetric base, and we may as well apply both steps separately.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The component involves an unnecessary boat-bit reaction. There are a lot of these, and we may as well do that as a separate step.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With all the above, we still run into trouble with the search space exploding. The biggest problem is components that create a small still life, together with additional components that just shove it around pointlessly. For this reason, we further cut down on the new synthesis components we’re willing to consider while the search is running. We skip any new component where:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The input or output is too sparse. For these purposes, “sparse” means that there is some connected component that is too far away from the largest component by population.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The gliders interact with the largest connected component but not any smaller ones (if there are any).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is all glued into a tree search, prioritising precursors with lowest population. At the end of this post, you can see a solution that required a very deep tree search to find, and which would certainly not have been possible without these improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the existing components extracted from the Shinjuku database got us a lot of the way, with only around 2000 23-bit targets resisting solution at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, how do we find new components to feed into this machine?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Component Farming&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simplest strategy is to fire some gliders at an object and hope that it modifies it without destroying it. I did this using a modification of the GPU searcher from the previous post, to iterate through a list of objects and all possible 3-glider collisions that interact within a certain time range. If the still life is still mostly present but not exactly identical to the starting object, the configuration is logged. Sometimes some extra ash is left behind, so an additional script hunts for a minimal cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This kind of random searching surfaces components that couldn’t be found any other way, because they’re too weird and unexpected to have been dreamed up by a human. Here’s a few random examples, three of which have automatically-generated cleanup gliders:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a little more work and a more restricted search area, going through 4-glider collisions is manageable, though I ended up getting fewer interesting results than the 3-glider set. One additional strategy was to place entire spark-producing configurations of gliders rather than individual gliders. For this, I stole a large set of such configurations from this forum thread. Again, this turned up some interesting results, but not as many as I had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mr. Component&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kazyan had the following idea on Discord way back in 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the final step for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;xs26_08o0u1eoz32q9871&lt;/code&gt;. It consists of two very distinct halves. Those two subcomponents, at the time, were known, but since&lt;code&gt;transfer.py&lt;/code&gt;had never seen them be used together, it wouldn’t have known to use them if asked to take apart that xs26. This vaporware, which I’ve been thinking of as “Mr. Component”, would be supplied with a list of these halves, assemble as many complete pairings from that list as possible, and dump the resulting full components into shinjuku. Then,&lt;code&gt;transfer.py&lt;/code&gt;would do its thing.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For reference, here’s that last step that he’s referring to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve highlighted the crucial cell in red. This cell is never active, but is the single spot where the two halves of the component interact. In a single generation this cell goes from underpopulated to overpopulated, and to achieve this the two halves have to be correctly synchronised. Applying them to the starting still life in sequence would not work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote(For “wrote” read “vibecoded”, this worked disturbingly well.)&lt;lb/&gt; a small tool to realise Kazyan’s idea. This first goes through all known components and identifies the above situation; when there are two barely-interacting pieces that rely on each other to succeed. Each piece stores the “timing” it requires, that is, on which generation the above sort of neighbourhood change occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, like Stomp above, we run through some list of targets and try to apply all of these discovered parts to it. Each pair of matching parts is tested to see whether they actually succeed simultaneously, once their timing is aligned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course this is not fully general; in principle a component may have more than two pieces that require synchronisation at multiple generations. If you have any examples let me know! The two-part version of the tool worked well enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall Mr. Component worked well, and resulted in a bunch of automated solutions that I think would have had to be found by hand otherwise. Here’s a couple of example steps, with the crucial cells highlighted. Notice that the cell in the rightmost example actually goes from overpopulated to underpopulated, giving that tricky bridge motif in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Trickiest Recipe&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To conclude, here’s the 23-bit still life with the most complicated recipe at the time of writing: 47 steps and 178 gliders in total. This was found through a Stomp search with unlimited depth and maximum intermediate population of 32. If it works, it works!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

About the elm he wrote, 'It is content. It does not weep with remorse over its past, nor tremble for its future. It flings its loveliness to the sky, it is content with spring; it is glorious in summer, it is patient through the long winter.'"[47] As of 2017, this tree's measurements are: circumference 17 feet (5.2 m); height 80 feet (24 m).&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="6"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Great Elm at Phillips Academy&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;American elm (Ulmus americana)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Andover, USA&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;200+&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;This American elm tree is located on the Phillips Academy campus in Andover, MA.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;My Gripes with Prolog&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;It's not my favorite language&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the next release of Logic for Programmers, I'm finally adding the sections on Answer Set Programming and Constraint Logic Programming that I TODOd back in version 0.9. And this is making me re-experience some of my pain points with Prolog, which I will gripe about now. If you want to know more about why Prolog is cool instead, go here or here or here or here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;No standardized strings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ISO "strings" are just atoms or lists of single-character atoms (or lists of integer character codes). The various implementations of Prolog add custom string operators but they are not cross compatible, so code written with strings in SWI-Prolog will not work in Scryer Prolog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;No functions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code logic is expressed entirely in rules, predicates which return true or false for certain values. For example if you wanted to get the length of a Prolog list, you write this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;?- length([a, b, c], Len).

   Len = 3.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now this is pretty cool in that it allows bidirectionality, or running predicates "in reverse". To generate lists of length 3, you can write &lt;code&gt;length(L, 3)&lt;/code&gt;. But it also means that if you want to get the length a list plus one, you can't do that in one expression, you have to write &lt;code&gt;length(List, Out), X is Out+1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a while I thought no functions was necessary evil for bidirectionality, but then I discovered Picat has functions and works just fine. That by itself is a reason for me to prefer Picat for my LP needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Bidirectionality is a killer feature of Prolog, so it's a shame I so rarely run into situations that use it.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;No standardized collection types besides lists&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aside from atoms (&lt;code&gt;abc&lt;/code&gt;) and numbers, there are two data types:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linked lists like &lt;code&gt;[a,b,c,d]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compound terms like &lt;code&gt;dog(rex, poodle)&lt;/code&gt;, which seem like record types but are actually tuples. You can even convert compound terms to linked lists with&lt;code&gt;=..&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;?- L =.. [a, b, c].
   L = a(b, c).
?- a(b, c(c)) =.. L.
   L = [a, b, c(c)].
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's no proper key-value maps or even struct types. Again, this is something that individual distributions can fix (without cross compatibility), but these never feel integrated with the rest of the language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;No boolean values&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; aren't values, they're control flow statements. &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; is a noop and &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; says that the current search path is a dead end, so backtrack and start again. You can't explicitly store true and false as values, you have to implicitly have them in facts (&lt;code&gt;passed(test)&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;test.passed? == true&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This hasn't made any tasks impossible, and I can usually find a workaround to whatever I want to do. But I do think it makes things more inconvenient! Sometimes I want to do something dumb like "get all atoms that don't pass at least three of these rules", and that'd be a lot easier if I could shove intermediate results into a sack of booleans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(This is called "Negation as Failure". I think this might be necessary to make Prolog a Turing complete general programming language. Picat fixes a lot of Prolog's gripes and still has negation as failure. ASP has regular negation but it's not Turing complete.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cuts are confusing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prolog finds solutions through depth first search, and a "cut" (&lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;) symbol prevents backtracking past a certain point. This is necessary for optimization but can lead to invalid programs. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're not supposed to use cuts if you can avoid it, so I pretended cuts didn't exist. Which is why I was surprised to find that conditionals are implemented with cuts. Because cuts are spooky dark magic conditionals sometimes conditionals work as I expect them to and sometimes leave out valid solutions and I have no idea how to tell which it'll be. Usually I find it safer to just avoid conditionals entirely, which means my code gets a lot longer and messier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Non-cuts are confusing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original example in the last section was this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;foo(A, B) :-
    \+ (A = B),
    A = 1,
    B = 2.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;foo(1, 2)&lt;/code&gt; returns true, so you'd expect &lt;code&gt;f(A, B)&lt;/code&gt; to return &lt;code&gt;A=1, B=2&lt;/code&gt;. But it returns &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.  Whereas this works as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bar(A, B) :-
    A = 1,
    B = 2,
    \+ (A = B).
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought this was because &lt;code&gt;\+&lt;/code&gt; was implemented with cuts, and the Clocksin book suggests it's &lt;code&gt;call(P), !, fail&lt;/code&gt;, so this was my prime example about how cuts are confusing. But then I tried this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;?- member(A, [1,2,3]), \+ (A = 2), A = 3.
A = 3. % wtf?
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's no way to get that behavior with cuts! I don't think &lt;code&gt;\+&lt;/code&gt; uses cuts at all! And now I have to figure out why 
&lt;code&gt;foo(A, B)&lt;/code&gt; doesn't returns results. Is it floundering? Is it because &lt;code&gt;\+ P&lt;/code&gt; only succeeds if &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; fails, and &lt;code&gt;A = B&lt;/code&gt; always succeeds? A closed-world assumption? Something else?1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Straying outside of default queries is confusing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Say I have a program like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;tree(n, n1).
tree(n, n2).
tree(n1, n11).
tree(n2, n21).
tree(n2, n22).
tree(n11, n111).
tree(n11, n112).

branch(N) :- % two children
    tree(N, C1),
    tree(N, C2),
    C1 @&amp;lt; C2. % ordering
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I want to know all of the nodes that are parents of branches. The normal way to do this is with a query:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;?- tree(A, N), branch(N).
A = n, N = n2; % show more...
A = n1, N = n11.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is interactively making me query for every result. That's usually not what I want, I know the result of my query is finite and I want all of the results at once, so I can count or farble or whatever them. It took a while to figure out that the proper solution is &lt;code&gt;bagof(Template, Goal, Bag)&lt;/code&gt;, which will "Unify Bag with the alternatives of Template":&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;?- bagof(A, (tree(A, N), branch(N)), As).

As = [n1], N = n11;
As = [n], N = n2.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait crap that's still giving one result at a time, because &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; is a free variable in &lt;code&gt;bagof&lt;/code&gt; so it backtracks over that. It surprises me but I guess it's good to have as an option. So how do I get all of the results at once?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;?- bagof(A, N^(tree(A, N), branch(N)), As).

As = [n, n1]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only difference is the &lt;code&gt;N^Goal&lt;/code&gt;, which tells &lt;code&gt;bagof&lt;/code&gt; to ignore and group the results of &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;. As far as I can tell, this is the only place the ISO standard uses &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; to mean anything besides exponentiation. Supposedly it's the existential quantifier? In general whenever I try to stray outside simpler use-cases, especially if I try to do things non-interactively, I run into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;I have mixed feelings about symbol terms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took me a long time to realize the reason &lt;code&gt;bagof&lt;/code&gt;  "works" is because infix symbols are mapped to prefix compound terms, so that  &lt;code&gt;a^b&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;^(a, b)&lt;/code&gt;, and then different predicates can decide to do different things with &lt;code&gt;^(a, b)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is also why you can't just write &lt;code&gt;A = B+1&lt;/code&gt;: that unifies &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; with the compound term &lt;code&gt;+(B, 1)&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;A+1 = B+2&lt;/code&gt; is false, as &lt;code&gt;1 \= 2&lt;/code&gt;. You have to write &lt;code&gt;A+1 is B+2&lt;/code&gt;, as &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; is the operator that converts &lt;code&gt;+(B, 1)&lt;/code&gt; to a mathematical term.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(And that fails because &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; isn't fully bidirectional. The lhs must be a single variable. You have to import &lt;code&gt;clpfd&lt;/code&gt; and write &lt;code&gt;A + 1 #= B + 2&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't like this, but I'm a hypocrite for saying that because I appreciate the idea and don't mind custom symbols in other languages. I guess what annoys me is there's no official definition of what &lt;code&gt;^(a, b)&lt;/code&gt; is, it's purely a convention. ISO Prolog uses &lt;code&gt;-(a, b)&lt;/code&gt; (aka &lt;code&gt;a-b&lt;/code&gt;) as a convention to mean "pairs", and the only way to realize that is to see that an awful lot of standard modules use that convention. But you can use &lt;code&gt;-(a, b)&lt;/code&gt; to mean something else in your own code and nothing will warn you of the inconsistency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway I griped about pairs so I can gripe about &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;go home sort, ur drunk&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one's just a blunder:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;?- sort([3,1,2,1,3], Out).
   Out = [1, 2, 3]. % wat
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to an expert online this is because sort is supposed to return a sorted set, not a sorted list. If you want to preserve duplicates you're supposed to lift all of the values into &lt;code&gt;-($key, $value)&lt;/code&gt; compound terms, then use keysort, then extract the values. And, since there's no functions, this process takes at least three lines. This is also how you're supposed to sort by a custom predicate, like "the second value of a compound term". &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Most (but not all) distributions have a duplicate merge like msort. SWI-Prolog also has a sort by key but it removes duplicates.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Please just let me end rules with a trailing comma instead of a period, I'm begging you&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't care if it makes fact parsing ambiguous, I just don't want "reorder two lines" to be a syntax error anymore&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I expect by this time tomorrow I'll have been Cunningham'd and there will be a 2000 word essay about how all of my gripes are either easily fixable by doing XYZ or how they are the best possible choice that Prolog could have made. I mean, even in writing this I found out some fixes to problems I had. Like I was going to gripe about how I can't run SWI-Prolog queries from the command line but, in doing do diligence finally finally figured it out:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;swipl -t halt -g "bagof(X, Goal, Xs), print(Xs)" ./file.pl
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's pretty clunky but still better than the old process of having to enter an interactive session every time I wanted to validate a script change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Also, answer set programming is pretty darn cool. Excited to write about it in the book!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A, good language it is shud become de facto standard for AI&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of predicates have a last argument as the result and can thus be used as evaluation predicates for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;is/2&lt;/code&gt;. For example:&lt;code&gt;O is (length([a,b,c]) + 1).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Boeing knew of flaw in part linked to UPS plane crash, US safety board report says&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An aircraft that crashed in flames in Kentucky in November had a structural flaw that had been identified by Boeing on similar planes 15 years ago, according to investigators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MD-11F freighter operated by UPS, crashed after one of its engines separated from the wing as it was preparing to take off from Louisville.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The plane briefly lifted off from the runway, before hurtling out of control into an industrial area. Fifteen people died as a result, including three crew and 12 on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an update report, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) revealed that cracks found in the engine mounting assembly had previously occurred on several other aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time the manufacturer responsible for the aircraft, Boeing, concluded that the issue "would not result in a safety of flight condition".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MD-11 is a relatively elderly design that was originally produced by McDonnell Douglas. Boeing acquired the company in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last MD-11 came off the production line in 2001, but Boeing has continued providing parts and service support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the Kentucky disaster, the NTSB issued a preliminary report which drew attention to cracks in the engine attachment mechanism. Its latest update goes further, describing fractures due to evidence of "fatigue" – or repeated stresses - in a critical bearing, as well as the mounting it is meant to sit in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It points out that Boeing had previously found failures of the same part on four occasions, affecting three different aircraft. In 2011, the company sent a "service letter" to operators warning them of its findings. This is a non legally-binding document used to alert operators about important safety or maintenance information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case, Boeing recommended that the part be included in a general visual inspection every five years. It also pointed out changes to the inspection procedure contained in the aircraft maintenance manual, and drew attention to a revised bearing assembly that could be fitted – although this was not mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tim Atkinson, a former air accident investigator who now works as an aviation safety consultant, said the NTSB's update made disturbing reading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The structure concerned is not decorative, it's an essential part of the mechanism that attaches the engine to the wing, and carries loads such as thrust and drag," he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's extraordinary that Boeing concluded that a failure of this part would not have safety consequences," he claimed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boeing's internal processes have come under fire on a number of occasions in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Criticisms have focused on how the design of its 737 Max included flawed software that was implicated in two accidents, in 2018 and 2019, that together cost 346 lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quality controls in its factories have also come under scrutiny, after a door panel fell off a brand new 737 Max shortly after take-off in early 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a statement, Boeing said: "We continue to support the investigation led by the NTSB. Our deepest condolences go out to the families who lost loved ones and our thoughts remain with all those affected."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NTSB's investigation is continuing. It has not yet issued any firm conclusions about the cause of the accident, and is unlikely to do so until it publishes its final report.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Building a better Bugbot&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As coding agents became more capable, we found ourselves spending more time on review. To solve this, we built Bugbot, a code review agent that analyzes pull requests for logic bugs, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities before they reach production. By last summer, it was working so well that we decided to release it to users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The process of building Bugbot began with qualitative assessments and gradually evolved into a more systematic approach, using a custom AI-driven metric to hill-climb on quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since launch, we have run 40 major experiments that have increased Bugbot's resolution rate from 52% to over 70%, while lifting the average number of bugs flagged per run from 0.4 to 0.7. This means that the number of resolved bugs per PR has more than doubled, from roughly 0.2 to about 0.5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Humble beginnings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we first tried to build a code review agent, the models weren't capable enough for the reviews to be helpful. But as the baseline models improved, we realized we had a number of ways to increase the quality of bug reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We experimented with different configurations of models, pipelines, filters, and clever context management strategies, polling engineers internally along the way. If it seemed one configuration had fewer false positives, we adopted it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most effective quality improvements we found early on was running multiple bug-finding passes in parallel and combining their results with majority voting. Each pass received a different ordering of the diff, which nudged the model toward different lines of reasoning. When several passes independently flagged the same issue, we treated it as a stronger signal that the bug was real.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After weeks of internal qualitative iterations, we landed on a version of Bugbot that outperformed other code review tools on the market and gave us confidence to launch. It used this flow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run eight parallel passes with randomized diff order&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Combine similar bugs into one bucket&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Majority voting to filter out bugs found during only one pass&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Merge each bucket into a single clear description&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Filter out unwanted categories (like compiler warnings or documentation errors)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run results through a validator model to catch false positives&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dedupe against bugs posted from previous runs&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;From prototype to production&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make Bugbot usable in practice, we had to invest in a set of foundational systems alongside the core review logic. That included making repository access fast and reliable by rebuilding our Git integration in Rust and minimizing how much data we fetched, as well as adding rate-limit monitoring, request batching, and proxy-based infrastructure to operate within GitHub's constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As adoption grew, teams also needed a way to encode codebase-specific invariants like unsafe migrations or incorrect use of internal APIs. In response, we added Bugbot rules to support those checks without hardcoding them into the system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together, these pieces made Bugbot practical to run and adaptable to real codebases. But they didn't tell us whether quality was actually improving. Without a metric to measure progress, we couldn't quantitatively assess Bugbot's performance in the wild, and that put a ceiling on how far we could push it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Measuring what matters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, we devised a metric called the resolution rate. It uses AI to determine, at PR merge time, which bugs were actually resolved by the author in the final code. When developing this metric, we spot-checked every example internally with the PR author and we found that the LLM correctly classified nearly all of them as resolved or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Teams often ask us how to assess the impact Bugbot is having for them, so we surface this metric prominently in the dashboard. For teams evaluating effectiveness, it's a much clearer signal than anecdotal feedback or reactions on comments. Resolution rate directly answers whether Bugbot is finding real issues that engineers fix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hill-climbing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defining resolution rate changed how we built Bugbot. For the first time, we could hill-climb on the basis of real signal, rather than just feel. We began evaluating changes online using actual resolution rates and offline using BugBench, a curated benchmark of real code diffs with human annotated bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We ran dozens of experiments across models, prompts, iteration counts, validators, context management, category filtering, and agentic designs. Many changes, surprisingly, regressed our metrics. It turned out that a lot of our initial judgments from the early qualitative analyses were correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Agentic architecture&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We saw the largest gains when, this fall, we switched Bugbot to a fully agentic design. The agent could reason over the diff, call tools, and decide where to dig deeper instead of following a fixed sequence of passes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agentic loop forced us to rethink prompting. With earlier versions of Bugbot we needed to restrain the models to minimize false positives. But with the agentic approach we encountered the opposite problem: it was too cautious. We shifted to aggressive prompts that encouraged the agent to investigate every suspicious pattern and err on the side of flagging potential issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, the agentic architecture opened up a richer surface for experimentation. We were able to shift more information out of static context and into dynamic context, varying how much upfront context the model received and observing how it adapted. The model consistently pulled in the additional context it needed at runtime, without requiring everything to be provided ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same setup lets us iterate directly on the toolset itself. Because the model's behavior is shaped by the tools it can call, even small changes in tool design or availability had an outsized impact on outcomes. Through multiple rounds of iteration, we adjusted and refined that interface until the model's behavior consistently aligned with our expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What's next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, Bugbot reviews more than two million PRs per month for customers like Rippling, Discord, Samsara, Airtable, and Sierra AI. We also run Bugbot on all internal code at Cursor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking forward, we expect new models to arrive on a regular basis with different strengths and weaknesses, both from other providers and from our own training efforts. Continued progress requires finding the right combination of models, harness design, and review structure. Bugbot today is multiples better than Bugbot at launch. In a few months we expect it will be significantly better again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're already building toward that future. We just launched Bugbot Autofix in Beta, which automatically spawns a Cloud Agent to fix bugs found during PR reviews. The next major capabilities include letting Bugbot run code to verify its own bug reports and enabling deep research when it encounters complex issues. We're also experimenting with an always-on version that continuously scans your codebase rather than waiting for pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've made great strides so far that would not be possible without the contributions of some key teammates including Lee Danilek, Vincent Marti, Rohan Varma, Yuri Volkov, Jack Pertschuk, Michiel De Jong, Federico Cassano, Ravi Rahman, and Josh Ma. Together, our goal continues to be to help your teams maintain code quality as your AI development workflows scale.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Contributed by Peter N. M. Hansteen on from the raising my family dept.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; On our favorite operating system and its siblings, that special case has been handled via the &lt;code&gt;af-to&lt;/code&gt; option and special case rules since back in the OpenBSD 5.1 days.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; But that special case has always felt a bit awkward to some, and now David Gwynne (&lt;code&gt;dlg@&lt;/code&gt;) is airing a patch on &lt;code&gt;tech@&lt;/code&gt; with a view to making &lt;code&gt;af-to&lt;/code&gt; "less magical".
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the message titled pf: make af-to less magical, David explains the motivation,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;List: openbsd-tech Subject: pf: make af-to less magical From: David Gwynne &amp;lt;david () gwynne ! id ! au&amp;gt; Date: 2026-01-16 2:11:57 Message-ID: aWmebWvdwBi6z98j () animata ! net i only recently figured out that af-to is very special in pf, but i dont think it should be. currently af-to has the following restrictions: 1. it only works for incoming packets, ie, you can only use it on "pass in" rules in pf. 2. it forces the translated packet to be forwarded. a consequence of these, and 2 in particular, is that only one state is created for an af-to connection over the firewall. this is unlike other forwarded connections where there's generally two states created, one when the packet comes in from the wire into the stack, and another when the packet goes out from the stack to the wire.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;this difference means that af-to is special cased in pf a lot. i'm arguing that it would be better if we made af-to less special, which is what this diff does. the important bit here is af-to no longer forces forwarding of packets. this is implemented by having pf_test called by ip_input push the translated packet into ip6_input instead of ip6_forward. this leads to a problem where we need to skip processing by pf_test in this nested ip6_input call after the packet has been translated. this is the same problem we already have in ip_output and ip6_output when we redirect or reroute outgoing packets, which is solved using a little state machine with the PF_TAG_GENERATED and PF_TAG_REROUTE flags on mbufs. this diff makes this state machine work on the ip_input and ip6_input side to support af-to. because the translated packets are now handed to the other ip_input/ip6_input handler, it allows the local tcp/udp/etc stack to handle these translated packets like we do for rdr-to. we can also use this same semantic to support translation for "pass out" rules. this allows us to translate ipv4 or ipv6 packets from the local network stack to the other address family, and it Just Works(tm). there is a downside from an operator point of view though. because af-to no longer forces forwarding, forwarded connections now require rules to allow the outgoing traffic to pass. ie, this worked before: block pass in on em0 inet proto udp \ from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.2.1 \ af-to from 2407::1 to 2407:2::1 but now you need to add this rule too: pass out inet6 proto udp \ from 2407::1 to 2407:2::1 however, the code is so much simpler. we no longer have to special case and swap key indices around to cope with there only being one af-to state to cover both sides of a forwarded connection anymore. thoughts? i've only done minimal testing. my interest is mostly in making the code simpler, so i'd appreciate feedback from people who actually use af-to about whether it still works or not.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;followed by the patch that implements the change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you handle network environments where address family translation is something you do or if it is on your horizon, please offer your input after evaluating the proposed patch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would the changes David proposes make your life easier, or how could this be improved?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; We welcome your comments here, but good commentary will also be appreciated as followups to the thread on &lt;code&gt;tech@&lt;/code&gt;.

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;From Bare Metal to Containers: A Developer’s Guide to Execution Environments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;January 5, 2026&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;13 min read&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Software platform&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ever had that dreaded “but it works on my machine!” moment?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The culprit is often a subtle difference in the execution environment—the “stage” where your code performs. You might be dealing with a binary linked against the wrong glibc, a Python wheel built for a different architecture, or a kernel feature quietly missing in production. These invisible discrepancies are what turn a successful local build into a deployment disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting the environment right is crucial for writing, testing, and shipping software reliably. But the landscape is crowded with terms like virtual machines (VM), containers, virtual environments, and more. What’s the difference, and which one should you use?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re going to trace the evolution of the execution environment. We’ll start with raw hardware and work through VMs, containers, and the various ways we isolate code at the operating system (OS) and language level. Along the way, we’ll break down the trade-offs for each approach. By the end, you’ll know exactly which tool to grab for your next project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt; The Journey Toward Lightweight Isolation &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The history of computing is largely a history of resource sharing without chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early systems ran one workload per machine. Today, a single server might host thousands of isolated applications owned by different teams. The unifying idea behind this evolution is isolation: separating code, dependencies, and resources so they don’t interfere with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But isolation is not binary. It exists on a spectrum—hardware, kernel, process, filesystem, language runtime. Each execution paradigm chooses a different point on that spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rule of thumb: any layer below your chosen isolation boundary must already be compatible—containers won’t fix a kernel mismatch, and virtual environments won’t fix a missing system library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll move from the heaviest to the lightest abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt; 1. Physical Machine (Bare Metal) &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the foundation. One machine, one operating system, running your code directly on the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hardware (CPU, memory, Disk,…): Uniquely provided by a physical machine. Two separate environments imply two separate physical machines, each with its own dedicated hardware resources like CPU, memory, and disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of it as a detached house. You have all the resources to yourself, with no neighbors to bother you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pros: Maximum performance, full control over hardware.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cons: Expensive (you pay for idle resources), slow to provision, inflexible.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use Case: High-performance computing (HPC), large databases, or legacy systems that require direct hardware access.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt; 2. Virtual Machine (VM) &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VMs were the first major leap in efficiency. A piece of software called a hypervisor carves up a single physical machine into multiple, independent virtual ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Operating System: Uniquely provided by virtual machines. Two environments can run on the same hardware but will have their own separate, full-fledged operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is like an apartment building. You still have your own private space (kitchen, bathroom, Operating System), but you share the building’s underlying infrastructure (hardware).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pros: Strong isolation, can run different operating systems on one host (e.g., Windows and Linux).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cons: Significant overhead (each VM has a full OS), slower to start than containers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Common Tools: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;VirtualBox: Great for desktop virtualization.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Hyper-V: Microsoft’s native hypervisor for Windows.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;KVM: The go-to hypervisor for Linux.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;QEMU: A powerful machine emulator and virtualizer.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;LXD: While primarily a container manager, recent versions can also manage full virtual machines, offering a unified tool for both.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt; 3. Container &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Containers revolutionized modern software development. They bundle an application and its dependencies, but—here’s the key difference—they share the host machine’s operating system kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Application and Dependencies: Characterized by packaging an application along with all its dependencies. Multiple containerized environments share the host OS kernel but run in isolated user spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of containers as hotel rooms. Each is a self-contained, identical unit, but they all rely on the hotel’s core services (the host OS kernel). This makes them incredibly lightweight and fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under the hood, this isolation is enforced by Linux namespaces (which give each container its own view of processes, networking, and the filesystem) and cgroups (which strictly control how much CPU, memory, and I/O it can consume).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pros: Extremely fast startup, low overhead, highly portable, perfect for microservices.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cons: Weaker isolation than VMs (shared kernel can be a security concern).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Common Tools:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LXD’s Dual Nature:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LXD is a unique tool that intentionally blurs the lines. Its primary strength is managing LXC system containers, which feel like ultra-fast VMs but are technically containers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, as we’ve listed, LXD can also manage full virtual machines. This makes it a powerful, unified tool for developers who want a single interface for both environment types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What About Managing Many Containers? Orchestration&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tools like Docker and LXD are great for running containers on a single machine. Docker Compose builds on this by managing multi-container applications as a single unit. It allows you to define services like a web server and a database together, though it still operates on a single host.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you need to manage applications across many machines, you move to container orchestrators like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or Nomad. Orchestration is not isolation. They are the next layer of management for handling scheduling, scaling, and networking at scale. They do not solve environment drift, dependency mismatches, or build reproducibility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While orchestration is a deep topic for its own article, it’s the logical next step after adopting containers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt; 4. Process Sandbox &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a more specialized form of isolation, often used for security. It “jails” a process, restricting its view of system resources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interface-Level Isolation: Defined by filtering a process’s interaction with the Linux Kernel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Instead of providing a new environment, we strip away the process’s “powers” and limit its authority and vocabulary.&lt;lb/&gt;It provides a sandboxed execution space for a single process or a group of related processes.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is like putting a specific activity into a “Safety Cabinet.” You aren’t building a new room; you are simply limiting what the process is allowed to do within your existing system through thick glass and heavy gloves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pros: Very lightweight, OS-native security feature.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cons: Can be complex to configure correctly, less feature-rich than full container runtimes.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sandboxes shine when you want to reduce the blast radius of a single process—not when you need a reproducible environment. They are about limiting damage, not standardizing execution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To build a proper sandbox, we control three specific dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Where (Filesystem): Limiting the reach to specific folders.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;What (Privileges): Limiting the authority to specific actions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How (System Calls): Limiting the communication with the OS kernel.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt; The Sandboxing Toolbox &amp;amp; Mechanisms &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can combine the following mechanisms (to create a robust sandbox), or use them individually:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Filesystem Jails (Where): Restricts the process to a specific directory tree.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;chroot A classic UNIX utility that changes the (perceived) top-level root directory of a process. E.g.: make the process see &lt;code&gt;/tmp/jail&lt;/code&gt;as&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;proot An implementation of &lt;code&gt;chroot&lt;/code&gt;that works without root privileges. It’s a user-space implementation that uses ptrace to fake a root directory without requiring administrative privileges.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;chroot A classic UNIX utility that changes the (perceived) top-level root directory of a process. E.g.: make the process see &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privilege Dividers (What): Breaks “Root” powers into small pieces. Instead of giving a process full administrative power, you give it only the specific power it needs (like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE&lt;/code&gt;just to open a port).&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;libcap: Manages Linux Capabilities. Instead of a binary “Root vs. User” choice, it breaks root powers into 40+ granular bits (e.g., &lt;code&gt;CAP_NET_ADMIN&lt;/code&gt;to manage networks without being able to read everyone’s files).&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;setcap / getcap: The command-line utilities used to assign these specific powers to processes.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;libcap: Manages Linux Capabilities. Instead of a binary “Root vs. User” choice, it breaks root powers into 40+ granular bits (e.g., &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;System Call Filtering (How): A firewall for the Kernel. It prevents a process from executing dangerous commands (like reboot or ptrace) even if it has root privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;seccomp: A Linux kernel feature that filters system calls. For example, if a process tries to use an unapproved call (like &lt;code&gt;execve&lt;/code&gt;to start a shell), the kernel kills it instantly.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;seccomp: A Linux kernel feature that filters system calls. For example, if a process tries to use an unapproved call (like &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;bubblewrap and Firejail are high-level “wrappers” that combine all the above. They are the engines behind modern “Sandboxed” apps like Flatpaks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Info&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While these tools provide “surgical” isolation for individual processes, they are also the primary technologies that Containers (like Docker) automate and bundle into a single, portable package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt; 5. Virtual Environment &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This type of isolation is probably the one you use daily as a developer. It doesn’t isolate the OS or hardware, but rather the dependencies of a programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Language-Specific Workspace: Focused on isolating the dependencies of a specific programming language. This allows multiple projects on the same machine to use different versions of the same language and library without conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is your workshop organizer. You have one project that needs an old version of a library and another that needs the latest version. A virtual environment keeps their tools (dependencies) in separate, labeled drawers so they don’t get mixed up. This prevents “dependency hell.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pros: Essential for managing project dependencies, simple to use, developer-focused, Zero performance overhead.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cons: Provides no OS-level or security isolation; the code still has full access to your user files, network, and system hardware.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A critical limitation to remember: virtual environments solve dependency conflicts, not system compatibility. If your code depends on a specific libc version, OS package, kernel feature, or external binary, a &lt;code&gt;venv&lt;/code&gt; alone is no longer sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blunt heuristic: if your build or runtime depends on ambient system state you don’t explicitly control—system libraries, OS packages, kernel features—a virtual environment is already too weak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt; How Modern Isolation Works &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To build a clean workspace, we have to solve three problems. Historically, we needed a different tool for each, but modern unified Toolchains are merging them into one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Runtime (Runtime Managers): These tools handle the language version itself. They allow you to run Python 3.8 for a legacy project while using Python 3.14 for a new one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Examples:&lt;code&gt;pyenv&lt;/code&gt;(Python),&lt;code&gt;nvm&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;fnm&lt;/code&gt;(Node.js),&lt;code&gt;rustup&lt;/code&gt;(Rust),&lt;code&gt;goenv&lt;/code&gt;(Go).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Environment (Path Isolation): This tells the system where to look for libraries. In Python, tools like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;venv&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;virtualenv&lt;/code&gt;create a folder to store libraries. In Node.js and Rust, this is handled implicitly by looking for a local&lt;code&gt;node_modules/&lt;/code&gt;or a project-specific build directory (&lt;code&gt;target/&lt;/code&gt;) relative to your code.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dependencies (Package Management): These tools download and manage the actual libraries (dependencies) versions your code needs to run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Examples:&lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;(Python),&lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;(Node.js),&lt;code&gt;cargo&lt;/code&gt;(Rust),&lt;code&gt;go mod&lt;/code&gt;(Go).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Rise of the “All-in-Ones”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The modern trend is the move away from fragmented tools toward Context-Aware toolchains. These tools detect your project settings and automatically align the Runtime, Environment, and Dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;(Python): An extremely fast, single binary that replaces&lt;code&gt;pyenv&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;venv&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;. It can install Python versions and manage libraries in one go.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Conda&lt;/code&gt;(Data Science): A heavyweight manager that handles language versions, libraries, and even system-level dependencies like C++ compilers or GPU drivers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Rustup&lt;/code&gt;+&lt;code&gt;Cargo&lt;/code&gt;(Rust): The gold standard of integration. While technically two tools, they work as one. You can use&lt;code&gt;cargo +nightly build&lt;/code&gt;to swap the compiler on the fly, or a&lt;code&gt;rust-toolchain.toml&lt;/code&gt;file to pin the version for everyone on the team.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt; Combining Environments: The Best of All Worlds &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key insight is that these environments are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they are often layered to create robust, professional workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common setup looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You start with a Virtual Machine from a cloud provider like AWS or Google Cloud.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On that VM, you install Docker to manage Containers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inside a container, your application runs, using a language-specific Virtual Environment (like Python’s &lt;code&gt;venv&lt;/code&gt;) to manage its dependencies.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This layered approach gives you the hardware isolation of a VM, the packaging benefits of containers, and the clean dependency management of a virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt; The Future: Abstraction Without Losing the Mental Model &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The direction of travel is clear: execution environments are becoming more abstract—but not simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each new paradigm removes a layer of responsibility from the developer while fixing the isolation boundary at a higher level. The trade-offs don’t disappear; they just move.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt; Containers as the Default Interface &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Containers have effectively become the standard unit of execution. Tools like Dev Containers formalize this by shifting the development environment itself into a container.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The isolation boundary here sits squarely at the OS-kernel interface. You share the kernel, but everything above it—filesystem, dependencies, tooling—is locked down and reproducible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this boundary still leaks. Containers built for cgroups v2 or specific syscalls will fail on older hosts. When the container assumes kernel features the host lacks, the result is often a silent or catastrophic failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In these moments, the “universal” container abstraction breaks: you aren’t just running an image; you are still tethered to the underlying hardware and kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt; Serverless: Fixing the Boundary at the Function Level &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Serverless platforms push the isolation boundary even higher. You no longer manage machines, operating systems, or even containers directly. Instead, you hand over a function and accept a tightly constrained execution contract.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is powerful, but opinionated: cold starts, execution time limits, and restricted system access are not incidental—they are the price of abstraction. Serverless is ideal when you can fully live inside that contract, and painful when you can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt; WebAssembly (Wasm): A New Isolation Primitive &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wasm is interesting not because it replaces containers, but because it introduces a new kind of boundary. Instead of isolating at the kernel or process level, Wasm sandboxes execution at the instruction and capability level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is a portable, secure runtime that can run consistently across browsers, servers, and edge environments. If containers standardized how we package software, Wasm is attempting to standardize how software executes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The common thread is this: progress doesn’t eliminate isolation—it chooses it more deliberately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt; Final Thought &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every execution environment is a trade-off between control, isolation, performance, and convenience. Problems arise when we treat these tools as interchangeable—or worse, when we use them without understanding what they isolate and what they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When in doubt, ask a single question: what is the lowest layer that must be identical for this code to behave correctly? Hardware, kernel, OS packages, or just language dependencies. The answer points directly to the right execution environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we saw with containers and process sandboxes, choosing the wrong boundary doesn’t fail gracefully. It fails in ways that are subtle, security-sensitive, or painfully non-obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Practical decision shortcuts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use a virtual environment when only language-level dependencies vary.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use a container when system libraries, tooling, or runtime assumptions must be identical.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use a VM when kernel behavior, OS policies, or security boundaries must not be shared.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you see execution environments as layered abstractions rather than competing products, architectural decisions become clearer—and “it works on my machine” becomes a relic of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why confusing language-level isolation (like &lt;code&gt;venv&lt;/code&gt;) with OS-level isolation (containers or sandboxes) is so costly: they sit on entirely different points of the isolation spectrum, and they fail in fundamentally different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re ready to put this into practice with Docker, you might want to explore how to merge your Dev and Production environments into a single Dockerfile to eliminate drift entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
