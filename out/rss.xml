  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Everyone Loves pgvector (in theory)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve spent any time in the vector search space over the past year, you’ve probably read blog posts explaining why pgvector is the obvious choice for your vector database needs. The argument goes something like this: you already have Postgres, vector embeddings are just another data type, why add complexity with a dedicated vector database when you can keep everything in one place?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a compelling story. And like most of the AI influencer bullshit that fills my timeline, it glosses over the inconvenient details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not here to tell you pgvector is bad. It’s not. It’s a useful extension that brings vector similarity search to Postgres. But after spending some time trying to build a production system on top of it, I’ve learned that the gap between “works in a demo” and “scales in production” is&amp;amp;mldr; significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Nobody’s actually run this in production&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;What bothers me most: the majority of content about pgvector reads like it was written by someone who spun up a local Postgres instance, inserted 10,000 vectors, ran a few queries, and called it a day. The posts are optimistic, the benchmarks are clean, and the conclusions are confident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re also missing about 80% of what you actually need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve read through dozens of these posts.&lt;/p&gt;They all cover the same ground: here’s how to install pgvector, here’s how to create a vector column, here’s a simple similarity search query. Some of them even mention that you should probably add an index.&lt;p&gt;What they don’t tell you is what happens when you actually try to run this in production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Picking an index (there are no good options)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with indexes, because this is where the tradeoffs start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;pgvector gives you two index types: IVFFlat and HNSW. The blog posts will tell you that HNSW is newer and generally better, which is&amp;amp;mldr; technically true but deeply unhelpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;IVFFlat&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;IVFFlat (Inverted File with Flat quantization) partitions your vector space into clusters. During search, it identifies the nearest clusters and only searches within those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Lower memory footprint during index creation&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Reasonable query performance for many use cases&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Index creation is faster than HNSW&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bad:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Requires you to specify the number of lists (clusters) upfront&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;That number significantly impacts both recall and query performance&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The commonly recommended formula (&lt;code&gt;rows / 1000&lt;/code&gt;) is a starting point at best&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Recall can be&amp;amp;mldr; disappointing depending on your data distribution&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;New vectors get assigned to existing clusters, but clusters don’t rebalance without a full rebuild&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image source: IVFFlat or HNSW index for similarity search? by Simeon Emanuilov&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;HNSW&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) builds a multi-layer graph structure for search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Better recall than IVFFlat for most datasets&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;More consistent query performance&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Scales well to larger datasets&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bad:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Significantly higher memory requirements during index builds&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Index creation is slow—painfully slow for large datasets&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The memory requirements aren’t theoretical; they are real, and they’ll take down your database if you’re not careful&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image source: IVFFlat or HNSW index for similarity search? by Simeon Emanuilov&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the blogs mention that building an HNSW index on a few million vectors can consume 10+ GB of RAM or more (depending on your vector dimensions and dataset size). On your production database. While it’s running. For potentially hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Real-time search is basically impossible&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a typical application, you want newly uploaded data to be searchable immediately. User uploads a document, you generate embeddings, insert them into your database, and they should be available in search results. Simple, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How index updates actually work&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you insert new vectors into a table with an index, one of two things happens:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;IVFFlat: The new vectors are inserted into the appropriate clusters based on the existing structure. This works, but it means your cluster distribution gets increasingly suboptimal over time. The solution is to rebuild the index periodically. Which means downtime, or maintaining a separate index and doing an atomic swap, or accepting degraded search quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;HNSW: New vectors are added to the graph structure. This is better than IVFFlat, but it’s not free. Each insertion requires updating the graph, which means memory allocation, graph traversals, and potential lock contention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither of these is a deal-breaker in isolation. But here’s what happens in practice: you’re inserting vectors continuously throughout the day. Each insertion is individually cheap, but the aggregate load adds up. Your database is now handling your normal transactional workload, analytical queries, AND maintaining graph structures in memory for vector search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Handling new inserts&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you’re building a document search system. Users upload PDFs, you extract text, generate embeddings, and insert them. The user expects to immediately search for that document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what actually happens:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no index: The insert is fast, the document is immediately available, but your searches do a full sequential scan. This works fine for a few thousand documents. At a few hundred thousand? Your searches start taking seconds. Millions? Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With IVFFlat: The insert is still relatively fast. The vector gets assigned to a cluster. But whoops, a problem. Those initial cluster assignments were based on the data distribution when you built the index. As you add more data, especially if it’s not uniformly distributed, some clusters get overloaded. Your search quality degrades. You rebuild the index periodically to fix this, but during the rebuild (which can take hours for large datasets), what do you do with new inserts? Queue them? Write to a separate unindexed table and merge later?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With HNSW: The graph gets updated on each insert through incremental insertion, which sounds great. But updating an HNSW graph isn’t free—you’re traversing the graph to find the right place to insert the new node and updating connections. Each insert acquires locks on the graph structure. Under heavy write load, this becomes a bottleneck. And if your write rate is high enough, you start seeing lock contention that slows down both writes and reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The operational reality&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the real nightmare: you’re not just storing vectors. You have metadata—document titles, timestamps, user IDs, categories, etc. That metadata lives in other tables (or other columns in the same table). You need that metadata and the vectors to stay in sync.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a normal Postgres table, this is easy—transactions handle it. But when you’re dealing with index builds that take hours, keeping everything consistent gets complicated. For IVFFlat, periodic rebuilds are basically required to maintain search quality. For HNSW, you might need to rebuild if you want to tune parameters or if performance has degraded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that index builds are memory-intensive operations, and Postgres doesn’t have a great way to throttle them. You’re essentially asking your production database to allocate multiple (possibly dozens) gigabytes of RAM for an operation that might take hours, while continuing to serve queries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You end up with strategies like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Write to a staging table, build the index offline, then swap it in (but now you have a window where searches miss new data)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Maintain two indexes and write to both (double the memory, double the update cost)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Build indexes on replicas and promote them&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Accept eventual consistency (users upload documents that aren’t searchable for N minutes)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Provision significantly more RAM than your “working set” would suggest&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of these are “wrong” exactly. But they’re all workarounds for the fact that pgvector wasn’t really designed for high-velocity real-time ingestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pre- vs. Post-Filtering (or: why you need to become a query planner expert)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay but let’s say you solve your index and insert problems. Now you have a document search system with millions of vectors. Documents have metadata—maybe they’re marked as &lt;code&gt;draft&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;archived&lt;/code&gt;. A user searches for something, and you only want to return published documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1SELECT * FROM documents
2WHERE status = 'published'
3ORDER BY embedding &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; query_vector
4LIMIT 10;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple enough. But now you have a problem: should Postgres filter on status first (pre-filter) or do the vector search first and then filter (post-filter)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seems like an implementation detail. It’s not. It’s the difference between queries that take 50ms and queries that take 5 seconds. It’s also the difference between returning the most relevant results and&amp;amp;mldr; not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pre-filter works great when the filter is highly selective (1,000 docs out of 10M). It works terribly when the filter isn’t selective—you’re still searching millions of vectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-filter works when your filter is permissive. Here’s where it breaks: imagine you ask for 10 results with &lt;code&gt;LIMIT 10&lt;/code&gt;. pgvector finds the 10 nearest neighbors, then applies your filter. Only 3 of those 10 are published. You get 3 results back, even though there might be hundreds of relevant published documents slightly further away in the embedding space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user searched, got 3 mediocre results, and has no idea they’re missing way better matches that didn’t make it into the initial k=10 search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can work around this by fetching more vectors (say, &lt;code&gt;LIMIT 100&lt;/code&gt;) and then filtering, but now:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;You’re doing way more distance calculations than needed&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;You still don’t know if 100 is enough&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Your query performance suffers&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;You’re guessing at the right oversampling factor&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;With pre-filter, you avoid this problem, but you get the performance problems I mentioned. Pick your poison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Multiple filters&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now add another dimension: you’re filtering by user_id AND category AND date_range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1SELECT * FROM documents
2WHERE user_id = 'user123'
3  AND category = 'technical'
4  AND created_at &amp;gt; '2024-01-01'
5ORDER BY embedding &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; query_vector
6LIMIT 10;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s the right strategy now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Apply all filters first, then search? (Pre-filter)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Search first, then apply all filters? (Post-filter)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Apply some filters first, search, then apply remaining filters? (Hybrid)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Which filters should you apply in which order?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planner will look at table statistics, index selectivity, and estimated row counts and come up with a plan. That plan will probably be wrong, or at least suboptimal, because the planner’s cost model wasn’t built for vector similarity search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it gets worse: you’re inserting new vectors throughout the day. Your index statistics are outdated. The plans get increasingly suboptimal until you ANALYZE the table. But ANALYZE on a large table with millions of rows takes time and resources. And it doesn’t really understand vector data distribution in a meaningful way—it can tell you how many rows match &lt;code&gt;user_id = 'user123'&lt;/code&gt;, but not how clustered those vectors are in the embedding space, which is what actually matters for search performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Workarounds&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;You end up with hacks: query rewriting for different user types, partitioning your data into separate tables, CTE optimization fences to force the planner’s hand, or just fetching way more results than needed and filtering in application code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of these are sustainable at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What vector databases do&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dedicated vector databases have solved this. They understand the cost model of filtered vector search and make intelligent decisions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Adaptive strategies: Some databases dynamically choose pre-filter or post-filter based on estimated selectivity&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Configurable modes: Others let you specify the strategy explicitly when you know your data distribution&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Specialized indexes: Some build indexes that support efficient filtered search (like filtered HNSW)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Query optimization: They track statistics specific to vector operations and optimize accordingly&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenSearch’s k-NN plugin, for example, lets you specify pre-filter or post-filter behavior. Pinecone automatically handles filter selectivity. Weaviate has optimizations for common filter patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With pgvector, you get to build all of this yourself. Or live with suboptimal queries. Or hire a Postgres expert to spend weeks tuning your query patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hybrid search? Build it yourself&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you want hybrid search—combining vector similarity with traditional full-text search—you get to build that yourself too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postgres has excellent full-text search capabilities. pgvector has excellent vector search capabilities. Combining them in a meaningful way? That’s on you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Decide how to weight vector similarity vs. text relevance&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Normalize scores from two different scoring systems&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Tune the balance for your use case&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Probably implement Reciprocal Rank Fusion or something similar&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, not impossible. Just another thing that many dedicated vector databases provide out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;pgvectorscale (it doesn’t solve everything)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timescale has released pgvectorscale, which addresses some of these issues. It adds:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;StreamingDiskANN, a new search backend that’s more memory-efficient&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Better support for incremental index builds&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Improved filtering performance&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is great! It’s also an admission that pgvector out of the box isn’t sufficient for production use cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;pgvectorscale is still relatively new, and adopting it means adding another dependency, another extension, another thing to manage and upgrade. For some teams, that’s fine. For others, it’s just more evidence that maybe the “keep it simple, use Postgres” argument isn’t as simple as it seemed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you’re running on RDS, pgvectorscale isn’t available. AWS doesn’t support it. So enjoy managing your own Postgres instance if you want these improvements, or just&amp;amp;mldr; keep dealing with the limitations of vanilla pgvector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “just use Postgres” simplicity keeps getting simpler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Just use a real vector database&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;I get the appeal of pgvector. Consolidating your stack is good. Reducing operational complexity is good. Not having to manage another database is good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s what I’ve learned: for most teams, especially small teams, dedicated vector databases are actually simpler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What you actually get&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a managed vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, Turbopuffer, etc.), you typically get:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Intelligent query planning for filtered searches&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Hybrid search built in&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Real-time indexing without memory spikes&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Horizontal scaling without complexity&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Monitoring and observability designed for vector workloads&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It’s probably cheaper than you think&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s another service to pay for. But compare:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The cost of a managed vector database for your workload&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;vs. the cost of over-provisioning your Postgres instance to handle index builds&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;vs. the engineering time to tune queries and manage index rebuilds&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;vs. the opportunity cost of not building features because you’re fighting your database&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turbopuffer starts at $64 month with generous limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a lot of teams, the managed service is actually cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What I wish someone had told me&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;pgvector is an impressive piece of technology. It brings vector search to Postgres in a way that’s technically sound and genuinely useful for many applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s not a panacea. Understand the tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re building a production vector search system:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Index management is hard. Rebuilds are memory-intensive, time-consuming, and disruptive. Plan for this from day one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Query planning matters. Filtered vector search is a different beast than traditional queries, and Postgres’s planner wasn’t built for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real-time indexing has costs. Either in memory, in search quality, or in engineering time to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blog posts are lying to you (by omission). They’re showing you the happy path and ignoring the operational reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managed offerings exist for a reason. There’s a reason that Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, and others exist and are thriving. Vector search at scale has unique challenges that general-purpose databases weren’t designed to handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question isn’t “should I use pgvector?” It’s “am I willing to take on the operational complexity of running vector search in Postgres?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some teams, the answer is yes. You have database expertise, you need the tight integration, you’re willing to invest the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many teams—maybe most teams—the answer is probably no. Use a tool designed for the job. Your future self will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why Nextcloud feels slow to use&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nextcloud. I really want to like it, but it’s making it really difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like what Nextcloud offers with its feature set and how easily it replaces a bunch of services under one roof (files, calendar, contacts, notes, to-do lists, photos etc.), but no matter how hard I try and how much I optimize its resources on my home server, it feels slow to use, even on hardware that is ranging from decent to good. Then I opened developer tools and found the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s the Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a clean page load, you will be downloading about 15-20 MB of Javascript, which does compress down to about 4-5 MB in transit, but that is still a huge amount of Javascript. For context, I consider 1 MB of Javascript to be on the heavy side for a web page/app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, that Javascript will be cached in the browser for a while, but you will still be executing all of that on each visit to your Nextcloud instance, and that will take a long time due to the sheer amount of code your browser now has to execute on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A significant contributor to this heft seems to be the &lt;code&gt;core-common.js&lt;/code&gt; bundle, which based on its name seems to provide
some common functionality that’s shared across different Nextcloud apps that one can install. It’s coming in at 4.71
MB at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then you want notifications, right? &lt;code&gt;NotificationsApp.chunk.mjs&lt;/code&gt; is here to cover you, at 1.06 MB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then there are the app-specific views. The Calendar app is taking up 5.94 MB to show a basic calendar view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Files app includes a bunch of individual scripts, such as &lt;code&gt;EditorOutline&lt;/code&gt; (1.77 MB), &lt;code&gt;previewUtils&lt;/code&gt; (1.17 MB),
&lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; (1.09 MB), &lt;code&gt;emoji-picker&lt;/code&gt; (0.9 MB which I’ve never used!) and many smaller ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notes app with its basic bare-bones editor? 4.36 MB for the &lt;code&gt;notes-main.js&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that even on an iPhone 13 mini, opening the Tasks app (to-do list), will take a ridiculously long time. Imagine opening your shopping list at the store and having to wait 5-10 seconds before you see anything, even with a solid 5G connection. Sounds extremely annoying, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suspect that a lot of this is due to how Nextcloud is architected. There’s bound to be some hefty common libraries and tools that allow app developers to provide a unified experience, but even then there is something seriously wrong with the end result, the functionality to bundle size ratio is way off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a result, I’ve started branching out some things from Nextcloud, such as replacing the Tasks app with using a private Vikunja instance, and Photos to a private Immich instance. Vikunja is not perfect, but its 1.5 MB of Javascript is an order of magnitude smaller compared to Nextcloud, making it feel incredibly fast in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, with other functionality I have to admit that the convenience of Nextcloud is enough to dissuade me from replacing it elsewhere, due to the available feature set comparing well to alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m sure that there are some legitimate reasons behind the current state, and overworked development teams and volunteers are unfortunately the norm in the industry, but it doesn’t take away the fact that the user experience and accessibility suffers as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank Alex Russell for writing about web performance and why it matters, with supporting evidence and actionable advice, it has changed how I view websites and web apps and has pushed me to be better in my own work. I highly suggest reading his content, starting with the performance inequality gap series. It’s educational, insightful and incredibly irritating once you learn how crap most things are and how careless a lot of development teams are towards performance and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality close-up appearances. We propose Skyfall-GS, the first city-block scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and photorealistic textures.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a follow-up to my previous article, Terminal Emulators Battle Royale â Unicode Edition! from 2023, in which I documented Unicode support across terminal emulators. Since then, the ucs-detect tool and its supporting blessed library have been extended to automatically detect support of DEC Private Modes, sixel graphics, pixel size, and software version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ucs-detect program tests terminal cursor positioning by sending visible text followed by control sequences that request the cursor position. The terminal responds by writing the cursor location as simulated keyboard input. The ucs-detect program reads and compares these values against the Python wcwidth library result, logging any discrepancies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Width Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terminal emulators face a fundamental challenge: mapping the vast breadth of Unicode scripts into a fixed-width grid while maintaining legibility. A terminal must predict whether each character occupies one cell or two, whether combining marks overlay previous characters, and how emoji sequences collapse into single glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These predictions fail routinely. Zero-width joiners, variation selectors, and grapheme clustering compound in complexity. When terminals and CLI applications guess wrong, text becomes unreadable - cursors misalign and corrupt output and so then also corrupt the location of our input.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our results share which terminals have the best "Unicode support" -- the least likely to exhibit these kinds of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Gentleman Errant&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before presenting the latest results, Ghostty warrants particular attention, not only because it scored the highest among all terminals tested, but that it was publicly released only this year by Mitchell Hashimoto. It is a significant advancement. Developed from scratch in zig, the Unicode support implementation is thoroughly correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, Mitchell published Grapheme Clusters and Terminal Emulators, demonstrating a commitment to understanding and implementing the fundamentals. His recent announcement of libghostty provides a welcome alternative to libvte, potentially enabling a new generation of terminals on a foundation of strong Unicode support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Errant Champion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kovid Goyal's Kitty scored just as well, only outranked by the arbitrary weights that are not necessarily fair. More important than scoring is Kovid's publication of a text-splitting algorithm description that closely matches the Python wcwidth specification. This is unsurprising since both are derived from careful interpretation of Unicode.org standards and that it scores so highly in our test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kitty and Ghostty are the only terminals that correctly support Variation Selector 15, I have not written much about it because it is not likely to see any practical use, but, it will be added to a future release of Python wcwidth now that there are multiple standards and reference implementations in agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Testing Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first table, General Tabulated Summary describes unicode features of each terminal, then, a brief summary of DEC Private Modes, sixel support, and testing time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second table, DEC Private Modes Support (not pictured), contains the first feature capability matrix of DEC Private Modes for Terminals of any length. I hope this is useful most especially to developers of CLI libraries and applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Long Road&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most notable finding relates to performance. That many terminals perform so slowly was surprising, so I have included the elapsed time in the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;iTerm2 and Extraterm consume a majority of the CPU and perform so slowly that the test parameters were reduced to finish within the hour what many other terminals manage in a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GNOME Terminal and its VTE-based derivatives also perform too slowly for a full test, taking over 5 hours while consuming very little CPU. Many terminals exhibit stalls or inefficiencies in their event loops that result in slow automatic responses, but we should be forgiving; nobody really considered the need to handle hundreds of automatic sequence replies per second!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I expected Python wcwidth to consume the most CPU resources during testing, as it is frequently called and always the "highest-level" language in the mix, but it keeps up pretty well for most terminals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I dedicated effort to optimizing the Python wcwidth implementation using techniques including bit vectors, bloom filters, and varying sizes of LRU caches. The results confirmed that the existing implementation performed best: a binary search with a functools.lru_cache decorator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LRU cache is effective because human languages typically use a small, repetitive subset of Unicode. The ucs-detect tool tests hundreds of languages from the UDHR dataset, excluding only those without any interesting zero or wide characters. This dataset provides an extreme but practical demonstration of LRU cache benefits when processing Unicode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I previously considered distributing a C module with Python wcwidth for greater performance, but the existing Python implementation keeps up well enough with the fastest terminals. When fully exhausted the text scroll speed is fast enough to produce screen tearing artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tilting at Edges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terminology produces inconsistent results between executions. Our tests are designed to be deterministic, so these kinds of results suggest possible state corruption. Despite this issue, Terminology offers interesting visual effects that would be a welcome feature in other terminals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;iTerm2 reports "supported, but disabled, and cannot be changed" status for all DEC Private Modes queried, including fictional modes like 9876543. For this reason, the summary of DEC Private Modes shows only those modes that are changeable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Konsole does not reply to queries about DEC Private modes, but does support several modes when they are enabled. For this reason, ucs-detect cannot automatically infer which DEC Modes Konsole supports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, ucs-detect reports "No DEC Private Mode Support" for Contour. I investigated this discrepancy because Contour's author also authored a Mode 2027 specification dependent on this functionality. The issue was that Contour responded with a different mode number than the one queried. While developing a fix, Contour's latest release from December 2024 presented an additional complication: a bad escape key configuration. Each instance of being stuck in vi required typing CTRL + [ as a workaround!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terminals based on libvte with software version label VTE/7600 continue to show identical performance with low scores in our tests, unchanged from 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My attempt to discuss improving Unicode support in libvte received substantial criticism. However, recent libvte project issue Support Emoji Sequences is a positive indicator for improved language and Emoji support in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;On Mode 2027&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I included DEC Private Mode 2027 in the results to accompany Mitchell's table from his article, Grapheme Clusters and Terminal Emulators, and to verify for myself that it has limited utility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In theory, a CLI program can query this mode to classify a terminal as "reasonably supporting" unicode, but not which specific features or version level. Since other terminals with similar capabilities do not respond to Mode 2027 queries, this binary indicator has limited utility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only practical approach to determining Unicode support of a terminal is to interactively test for specific features, codepoints, and at the Unicode version levels of interest, as ucs-detect does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Beyond Fixed Widths&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terminals cannot reproduce many of the world's languages legibly when constrained to monospace cells. The measurements dictated by rapidly expanding Unicode standards and varying implementation levels create inherent tension.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The text sizing protocol published early this year represents a significant development. Kovid Goyal describes the motivation in a recent interview:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;And then my next windmill that I'm looking at is variable-sized text in the terminal. So when I'm catting a markdown file, I want to see the headings big.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this feature may enable more advanced typesetting-like capabilities in terminal apps, it also promises to increase accessibility. Allowing text to escape monospace constraints enables legible support of the diverse set of the world's languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, using Contour with ucs-detect --stop-at-error=lang, stopping to take a look at a result of the language KhÃ¼n:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case Contour and Python wcwidth disagree on measurement, but more important is the legibility. We can compare this given KhÃ¼n text to the Kate editor:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They are clearly different. I regret I cannot study it more carefully, but I suggest that terminals could more easily display complex scripts by switching to a variable size text mode, allowing the font engine to drive the text without careful processing of cell and cursor movement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although I have yet to experiment with it, I am encouraged to see some resolution to this problem by the progressive changes suggested by the text sizing protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;it's not working&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;Written January 19, 2024&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arthur Whitney is an esteemed computer scientist who led the design on a few well-known pieces of software:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The A, K, and Q programming languages&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;kdb, a high-performance database built on K used in fintech&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shakti, which is like kdb but faster, designed for trillion-row datasets.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've never even seen a trillion numbers, much less calculated them, but kdb is apparently a standard tool on Wall Street. They probably care about money, so I'll assume kdb does its job well. His languages take significantly after APL, which was a very popular language for similar applications before the invention of (qwerty) keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I'm not here to talk about boring things like "using software to make incomprehensible amounts of money in finance" or "human beings and their careers", I'm here to talk about how a guy writes C code weird. For a very simple version of the programming language K, there's a publicly available interpreter he wrote in a few days using about 50 lines of C to show the basics of interpreter writing. This is the C (specifically the January 16, 2024 version #2):&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is the entire interpreter, and this is apparently how he normally writes code. Opinions on his coding style are divided, though general consensus seems to be that it's incomprehensible. As daunting as it is, I figured I should give it a chance for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As I work on larger and larger codebases, scrolling up and down to track information has become a more common annoyance. Whitney's talked about coding the way he does to avoid exactly that: he wants to keep his logic on one screen. Perhaps learning to read code like this could give me ideas on writing my own code more compactly.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In a Hacker News comments section, somebody asked "would you rather spend 10 days reading 100,000 lines of code, or 4 days reading 1000?", and that raises a good point. The complexity of the code is because even a simple interpreter is pretty complex. Writing it in 500 lines wouldn't make the complexity go away, it just spreads it out. Does writing in this more compact format feel more daunting because you're exposed to more of the complexity at once? I think so. Does showing it all at once actually help you understand the whole thing faster? I don't know.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reading code has become a more important part of my job than writing it, so I should challenge my reading skills, regardless.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It confuses people, and that's basically the same as being smart.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I'm going to go line by line and explain my understanding. I tried to use the notes provided in the repo only when I was stuck, which was a few times early on, but by the end I could understand it pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A reading of a.h&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;typedef char*s,c;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This already shows some funky C. It defines &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, because the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; attaches to the name, not the type. It's an oddity of C syntax that I've never been a fan of. Otherwise this is pretty straight forward: &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is for string, and &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is for character.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;s Q=(s)128;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fuck. Shit. He assigned 128 to a string named &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt;. What does it mean? &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt;. Why is Q a pointer to the address 128? I thought I must have misunderstood, and &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; was actually a character or something, but it's clearly specified as &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is for string!&amp;#13;
I couldn't figure out the meaning, so I soon gave up and looked at the annotated code. The &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;unsigned long long&lt;/code&gt; in other versions, and they explain that the type is used for both integers and pointers. The code operates on vectors of 8-bit integers, either as ASCII or numbers, so it makes some sense to use &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt; from a memory layout perspective, but I don't use pointers as integers very often.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define _(e...) ({e;})&amp;#13;
#define x(a,e...) _(s x=a;e)&amp;#13;
#define $(a,b) if(a)b;else&amp;#13;
#define i(n,e) {int $n=n;int i=0;for(;i&amp;lt;$n;++i){e;}}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are all pretty straight forward, with one subtle caveat I only realized from the annotated code. They're all macros to make common operations more compact: wrapping an expression in a block, defining a variable &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and using it, conditional statements, and running an expression &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The subtle thing the annotations point out is the first macro, &lt;code&gt;({e;})&lt;/code&gt;. The parentheses around curly brackets make this a statement expression, a non-standard C extension that allows you to treat a block of statements as a single expression, if the last statement is an expression that provides a value. In other words, &lt;code&gt;int x = ({int a = func1(); int b = func2(a); a+b;});&lt;/code&gt; sets &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to whatever &lt;code&gt;a+b&lt;/code&gt; is. This is used everywhere in the code after this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define Q(e) if(Q==(e))return Q;&amp;#13;
#define Qs(e,s) if(e)return err(__func__,s);&amp;#13;
#define Qr(e) Qs(e,"rank")&amp;#13;
#define Qd(e) Qs(e,"domain")&amp;#13;
#define Qz(e) Qs(e,"nyi")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are error macros using that mysterious &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; defined earlier. &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; seems to have been used to represent errors, possibly short for "Quit". The &lt;code&gt;Qr/d/z&lt;/code&gt; functions seem to be types of errors. I have no idea what "nyi" means (I figure it out later).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define _s(f,e,x...) s f(x){return _(e);}&amp;#13;
#define _i(f,e) _s(f,e,c x)&amp;#13;
#define f(f,e)  _s(f,e,s x)&amp;#13;
#define F(f,e)  _s(f,e,s a,s x)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These replace function declarations, and we can see that &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; macro being used to add an implicit return.&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;_s&lt;/code&gt; could be used like&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;_s(my_function, puts("I rock!!!"); x*5+e, s x, int e)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;, which would create basically this standard C:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;char *my_function(char *x, int e) {&amp;#13;
	puts("I rock!!!");&amp;#13;
	return x*5+e;&amp;#13;
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the macros except the base &lt;code&gt;_s&lt;/code&gt; also add implicit arguments like &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and you bet it's hard to tell them apart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define ax (256&amp;gt;x)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was another one that baffled me until I looked at the annotations. Remember how I said &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; values were either integers or pointers? 256 is the cutoff value for these integers, which the annotations call atoms, so ax means "is &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; an atom?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define ix (c)x&amp;#13;
#define nx x[-1]&amp;#13;
#define xi x[i]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These aren't too confusing. &lt;code&gt;ix&lt;/code&gt; casts &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; to a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt; implies &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is some sort of fat pointer, meaning there's probably a length at &lt;code&gt;x[-1]&lt;/code&gt;, but we'll see. &lt;code&gt;xi&lt;/code&gt; just indexes &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as a normal pointer, using our implicitly defined &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;i(...)&lt;/code&gt; macro.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define aa x(a,ax)&amp;#13;
#define ia x(a,ix)&amp;#13;
#define na x(a,nx)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These copy &lt;code&gt;ax&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ix&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;nx&lt;/code&gt; respectively to work on the &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; variable, which is an implicit argument in functions defined using the &lt;code&gt;F(f,e)&lt;/code&gt; macro. You remembered the &lt;code&gt;x(name, expression)&lt;/code&gt; macro for assigning to a locally-scoped &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define oo w("oo\n")&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It prints &lt;code&gt;oo&lt;/code&gt;. It's not used anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;a reading of a.c&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wound up not needing to refer to the annotated code at all to understand this. The C code is mostly using everything in the headers to build the interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define r(n,e) _(s r=m(n);i(n,r[i]=e)r)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We create a vector &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;m(n)&lt;/code&gt; (which is defined later (it's malloc)), fill &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; with the results of &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;, and return it out of the statement expression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(w,write(1,ax?&amp;amp;x:x,ax?1:strlen(x));x)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This defines &lt;code&gt;s w(s x)&lt;/code&gt;, which is our print function. If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is an atom (&lt;code&gt;ax?&lt;/code&gt;), we print it as a single character by getting its address (&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;x&lt;/code&gt;) and providing a length of 1. If it's a vector, we print it as a string using &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt; to calculate how long it is, so now we also know vectors must be null-terminated here.&amp;#13;
&lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;strlen&lt;/code&gt; are standard functions that we call without including the headers, because fuck headers. Let the linker figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;F(err,w(a);w((s)58);w(x);w((s)10);Q)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our fancy shmancy error printing function, &lt;code&gt;s err(s a, s x)&lt;/code&gt;. The confusing thing is that &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; and the newline are represented by their ASCII numbers 58 and 10, respectively. This just prints a message in the format &lt;code&gt;{a}:{x}\n&lt;/code&gt; and returns our special error value &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;_i(wi,s b[5];sprintf(b,"%d ",x);w(b);0)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defines &lt;code&gt;s wi(c x)&lt;/code&gt;, which takes &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, formats it as an integer in up to &lt;code&gt;5*sizeof(char*)/sizeof(char)&lt;/code&gt; characters (40 on 64-bit machines), and writes that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(W,Q(x)$(ax,wi(ix))i(nx,wi(xi))w(10);x)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another print function, &lt;code&gt;s W(s x)&lt;/code&gt; either writes &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as an integer or a list of integers. It also refuses to print the &lt;code&gt;Q&lt;/code&gt; vector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(srt,Qz(1)0) f(uni,Qz(1)0) F(Cut,Qz(1)0) F(Drp,Qz(1)0)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I figured out what &lt;code&gt;nyi&lt;/code&gt; means! It means "Not yet implemented", as we can see from these function definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;_i(m,s a=malloc(1+x);*a++=x;a)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we find our previously-used function &lt;code&gt;s m(c x)&lt;/code&gt;, which allocates our buffer and returns a fat pointer (with the size at &lt;code&gt;x[-1]&lt;/code&gt;, hence the &lt;code&gt;1+x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;a++&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is the length we're allocating here, which means our vectors are limited to 255 bytes. The repo suggests upgrading capacity as an exercise to the reader, which could be fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define A(c) ((s)memchr(a,c,na)?:a+na)-a&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This macro finds the first occurence of the character &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; in our vector &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; as an index into the string (hence the &lt;code&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt;, since &lt;code&gt;memchr&lt;/code&gt; returns a pointer). If the result is null, it just returns the length of the string (&lt;code&gt;a+na - a&lt;/code&gt;). We see another fun bit of non-standard syntax, &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt;, which I had to look up. &lt;code&gt;a ?: b&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;a ? a : b&lt;/code&gt; without evaluating &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; twice. Pretty snazzy!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define g(a,v) ax?255&amp;amp;a:r(nx,v)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strange little operation, I'll have to see it in action. If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is an atom, it clamps &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; to be an atom with a simple mask (&lt;code&gt;255&amp;amp;a&lt;/code&gt;), otherwise it creates a new vector the same size as &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; filled with the result from &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(not,g(!ix,!xi)) f(sub,g(-ix,-xi)) F(At,Qr(aa)g(a[ix],a[xi])) F(_A,Qr(aa)g(A(ix),A(xi)))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah, I see now. &lt;code&gt;g(a, v)&lt;/code&gt; lets us define functions that work on both atoms and vectors. If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is an atom, it returns the atom result clamped within the correct bounds. Otherwise it allocates a new vector and computes the other expression.&amp;#13;
All the above functions work either on &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as an integer (&lt;code&gt;ix&lt;/code&gt;), or on every element of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;xi&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;s not(s x)&lt;/code&gt;does boolean negation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;s sub(s x)&lt;/code&gt;does arithmetic negation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;s At(s a, s x)&lt;/code&gt;indexes into&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, either to get one value or to shuffle them into a new vector.&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;has to be a vector.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;s _A(s a, s x)&lt;/code&gt;searches a vector&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;for the value of&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;and gives us the index, either one value or every value in the vector.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a lot of functionality in such a small bit of code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(ind,Qr(!ax)0&amp;gt;ix?r(-ix,-ix-1-i):r(ix,i))&amp;#13;
F(Ind,Qr(!aa)Qd(1&amp;gt;ia)g(ix%ia,xi%ia))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are some atom-only functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;s ind(s x)&lt;/code&gt;creates a vector of length |x| containing&lt;code&gt;0, 1... x-1&lt;/code&gt;if&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;is positive, otherwise it contains&lt;code&gt;-x-1, -x-2... 0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;s Ind(s a, s x)&lt;/code&gt;does&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;modulo&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, either on&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;as an integer or every value of the vector&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, I can buy that this method of coding produces fewer bugs, once you can actually write it, since you work only on small building blocks of the logic and reuse them. Like, where could a bug for &lt;code&gt;ind&lt;/code&gt; even be? Maybe an off-by-one in &lt;code&gt;-ix-1-i&lt;/code&gt;, but it's hard to miss what's happening once you can see the trees through the forest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define G(f,o) F(f,ax?aa?255&amp;amp;ia o ix:Ltn==f?f(sub(x),sub(a)):f(x,a):r(nx,(aa?ia:a[i])o xi))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's too many trees! I can't understand this many nested ternary operators at the same time because I'm not the alien from Arrival. I process things in linear time. I have to chunk this up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;F(f, ax ?&amp;#13;
		aa ?&amp;#13;
			255 &amp;amp; ia o ix&amp;#13;
			: Ltn==f ? &amp;#13;
				f(sub(x),sub(a))&amp;#13;
				: f(x,a)&amp;#13;
		: r(nx,(aa?ia:a[i])o xi))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, I see. It's 3 cases from 2 conditions: &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is an atom or a vector, and &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is an atom or a vector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;are atoms: apply some operator&lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt;to both values and clamp to 8 bits. I also didn't realize the bitwize and (&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;) had a lower precedence than the operators this macro is used on, meaning it's always&lt;code&gt;`C 255 &amp;amp; (ia o ix)&lt;/code&gt;`.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;is an atom and&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;is a vector: run this function with the arguments swapped. If the function is&lt;code&gt;Ltn&lt;/code&gt;, also negate the arguments, since less-than depends on argument order.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;is a vector: create a new vector, either applying&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;or each value of&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;to&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;using the operator. It assumes vector&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;is at least as long as&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, or it'll index past the end of&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;G(Ltn,&amp;lt;)G(Eql,==)G(Not,!=)G(Sum,+)G(Prd,*)G(And,&amp;amp;)G(Or,|)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using our fancy new macro, we quickly define seven new functions for the vectors, where they're all element-wise applications of binary operators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(cat,Qr(!ax)r(1,ix)) F(Cat,a=aa?cat(a):a;x=ax?cat(x):x;s r=m(na+nx);memcpy(r+na,x,nx);memcpy(r,a,na))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was confused by the first function, but I see now these are &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; as in "concatenate". For an atom, it creates a vector of length 1 containing that atom. &lt;code&gt;Cat&lt;/code&gt; does the more complex work of joining two vectors together, running &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; on each value if it's an atom to get a list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(at,At(x,0)) f(rev,Qr(ax)At(x,ind(255&amp;amp;-nx))) f(cnt,Qr(ax)nx)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some more simple functions. Lil &lt;code&gt;at&lt;/code&gt; gets the first item of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;rev&lt;/code&gt; reverses the list using our &lt;code&gt;ind&lt;/code&gt; function to generate the list of indeces in reverse, which is a little overkill but vectors are 256 bytes at max and memory is never freed so who cares; and &lt;code&gt;cnt&lt;/code&gt; gets the size of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;F(Tak,Qr(!aa||ax)Qd(0&amp;gt;ia||ia&amp;gt;nx)At(x,ind(a))) F(Sub,Sum(a,sub(x))) F(Mtn,Ltn(x,a)) f(qz,Qz(1)0)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some more simple functions. &lt;code&gt;Tak&lt;/code&gt; returns the first &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; characters from the vector &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as a new list; &lt;code&gt;Sub&lt;/code&gt; subtracts; &lt;code&gt;Mtn&lt;/code&gt; is "more than"; and &lt;code&gt;qz&lt;/code&gt; returns our "not yet implemented" error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#define v(e) ((strchr(V,e)?:V)-V)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A shorthand to get the first occurence of a character from a string &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt;, returning an offset into the array or zero if it's not present. This seems ambiguous, since that's also the result if we match with the first character, but we'll see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;s U[26],V=" +-*&amp;amp;|&amp;lt;&amp;gt;=~!@?#_^,",&amp;#13;
(*f[])()={0,abs,sub,qz ,qz,rev,qz ,qz, qz ,not,ind,at,uni,cnt,qz ,srt,cat},&amp;#13;
(*F[])()={0,Sum,Sub,Prd,And,Or,Ltn,Mtn,Eql,Not,Ind,At,_A ,Tak,Drp,Cut,Cat};&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah, we have seen. The first character of &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt; is a space, and it looks like the arrays of function pointers match up with the characters of &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt; to give us our functions, with space being null. However, I think &lt;code&gt;abs&lt;/code&gt; is from the standard library here, since it's not defined anywhere else? That seems like a bug. It'd work for atoms, but it'd break vectors.&amp;#13;
This also defines an array of 26 vectors, which I assume will be our variables. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;_i(n, 10u&amp;gt;x-48? x-48 : 26u&amp;gt;x-97? U[x-97] : 0)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;s n(c x)&lt;/code&gt; reads a char and returns one of several things. I'll have to consult an ASCII table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;is between 48 and 57 (inclusive), we subtract 48 and return that. Meaning, if&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;is an ASCII character representing 0-9, we subtract 48 so it's the integer 0-9, rather than the character. It's phrased strangely,&lt;code&gt;10u &amp;gt; x-48&lt;/code&gt;, instead of the more obvious&lt;code&gt;x&amp;gt;47&amp;amp;&amp;amp;58&amp;gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. Maybe it's because it's two characters shorter. Maybe Arthur wanted to show the length of the span of characters (10) more than the start and end, which this does once you understand it. Maybe he just thought the underflow trickery was neat.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;is between 97 and 122 (inclusive), it's a lowercase character of the alphabet in ASCII, in which case the function returns one of our variables from the&lt;code&gt;U&lt;/code&gt;array, mapping 'a' to 'z'.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Otherwise, the function returns 0.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it looks like this function is specifically to read values, either numerals or variables, all of which are one character.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(e,s z=x;c i=*z++;!*z?n(i):v(i)?x(e(z),Q(x)f[v(i)](x)):x(e(z+1),Q(x)58==*z?U[i-97]=x:_(c f=v(*z);Qd(!f)F[f](n(i),x))))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uh, let's spread this out a little.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;f(e, s z=x; c i=*z++; !*z ? n(i)&amp;#13;
	: v(i) ? x(e(z), Q(x) f[v(i)](x))&amp;#13;
		: x(e(z+1), Q(x) 58==*z ? U[i-97]=x &amp;#13;
			: _(c f=v(*z); Qd(!f) F[f](n(i),x))))&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, easy. It's a recursive function that checks each character of vector &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, called &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#13;
If we're at the end of the string, we check if &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is a value and return it.&amp;#13;
Otherwise, we first check if it's an operator (from our &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt; string). If it is, we evaluate the rest of the string, check for errors, and then apply the operation to the result from the rest of the evaluation.&amp;#13;
If it wasn't an operation, we evaluate the rest of the string, skipping one character. If the skipped character is a colon (ASCII 58), we assign the result of the evaluation to one of the slots in &lt;code&gt;U&lt;/code&gt; (if the character &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is not a lowercase ASCII letter, this will corrupt memory, so don't write bugs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm pretty sure spaces are a syntax error in every location, and I don't see code to create array literals. If the skipped character is an operator, we instead apply that binary operator on the evaluation result and &lt;code&gt;n(i)&lt;/code&gt;, which is either a variable or a number.&amp;#13;
This means code is executed from right to left, with no operator precedent, which is standard for APL-type languages from what I understand.&amp;#13;
Because this language has only single-character variable names, numbers, and operators, this is all the tokenizing, parsing, and evaluation we need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;C int main(){c b[99]; while(1) if(w(32),b[read(0,b,99)-1]=0,*b) 58==b[1] ? e(b) : W(e(b));}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And finally, &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;#13;
In an infinite loop, we read up to 99 characters from a user, and then write the evaluated result of that text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Et voila. We have a tiny interpreter for a simple array language. It's not exactly production-ready, but it does quite a lot in its tiny footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think I can say I understand this code pretty well, even more than most code I read. I don't know how much of that is because of the coding style, or because I spent eight hours writing several thousand words about fifty lines of code in a borderline-delusional fugue state brought on by drinking one small Starbucks™ Frapuccino® (Mocha® Flavored*) I bought from a gas station at 10 PM on a Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had some fun dreams about macros with one-character names applying operations on scalars and vectors that morning (I went to sleep at 6:40 AM).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a fun exercise. To summarize my thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Good ideas&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Well-considered primitives. I've read and written a lot of macro-ridden C, but this feels like a proper little language designed with composable, useful macros that removed enough repetition to make common operations, like iteration, easy to decipher. In other languages, higher-order functions and similar constructs could be used the same way.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fewer lines. I didn't have to scroll so much when I forgot what a macro or a function did! I have a wide screen monitor, I don't need lines limited to 10-20 characters of actual code most of the time. If people can read English in compact paragraphs, why not code?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Bad ideas&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-semantic types. I was completely baffled by the &lt;code&gt;char *&lt;/code&gt;being treated as an integer at first, and simply assumed I was misunderstanding the code somehow until I checked the annotated version. In my own code, I use types as one of the core building blocks. What the data is defines how I use it. For a full interpreter, this would be a custom type anyway, since right now it assumes&lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;will never give it a pointer to an address less than 256, which is probably true but not guaranteed, and also the integer 128 is reserved for invalid results, which is probably the bigger limitation.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code golf. I can understand the large gains to density like macros, and even the medium gains like short names, but there's a point where the code becomes significantly harder to follow for very minor gains, such as the use of ASCII codes like &lt;code&gt;58&lt;/code&gt;instead of character literals like&lt;code&gt;':'&lt;/code&gt;, or the use of&lt;code&gt;10u&amp;gt;x-48&lt;/code&gt;instead of&lt;code&gt;x&amp;gt;48&amp;amp;&amp;amp;58&amp;gt;x&lt;/code&gt;for checking if&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;is within a range. And while I think more code can be put on a line, I'm not throwing out my space key just yet, epecially between function declarations.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ideas I'm ambivalent about&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Non-standard syntax. There's some very interesting features in this code that utilize GCC-specific extensions, like &lt;code&gt;a ?: b&lt;/code&gt;ternaries and statement expressions. I don't typically need to compile for everything on earth, so learning the tricks of one reasonably cross-platform compiler isn't a bad idea. At the same time, even using clang, the same compiler Arthur was using, I had to include&lt;code&gt;stdio.h&lt;/code&gt;due to not linking&lt;code&gt;sprintf&lt;/code&gt;otherwise. If I wanted to build using Visual Studio I'd just have to rewrite a bunch of stuff. Also, compiling without&lt;code&gt;-w&lt;/code&gt;generates almost three compiler warnings per line of code. Those are useful sometimes, if they aren't flooded!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Implicit arguments. Many of the density gains in this code come from using the variables &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;in nearly every context, allowing macros to use them by default and skip listing other parameters. I didn't find it to be a problem after a brief adjustment, but it's also a very small codebase. Implicit arguments are a feature in many dynamically typed languages, and in "point-free" or "tacit" programming, but it's fallen out of style due to its difficulty to parse at first glance. Whitney's languages all being based around tacit programming is surely an influence on his tendency to make arguments implicit.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Short names. Beyond the very first introduction, there'd be virtually no benefit to renaming &lt;code&gt;ax&lt;/code&gt;as&lt;code&gt;vector_is_atom(x)&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;_(...)&lt;/code&gt;as 'execute(...)', or most other primitives after they're introduced. Most are small enough that you can parse what it does right away. However, this doesn't lend any signal as to why it does. You have to figure out what it does from context. For code that's meant to be read by another person, there should probably be some explanation as to why a primitive does what it does, even if it has a short name. This is especially true of more complex operations, like the evaluation function&lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Nested ternary operators. Too confusing for me to follow without parentheses, especially without whitespace.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This coding style feels most appropriate for "done" code, or code that's been worked out on paper or some other environment and is now being written down in a compact way. It's more like finalized mathematical notation than typical code. I don't see myself being able to effectively write code like this, since I tend to quickly jot down ideas, compile and run to validate, and edit what I've done based on the results. Making a small set of good primitives and building heavily on those requires basically having solved the problem before writing a single line. Otherwise you get bad primitives that cause more confusion than help, and adjusting those primitives would involve rewriting all the code that depends on them, which is all the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I think that's my key takeaway: I tend to work out problems in the code, which can lead to messy results. I write the dumbest possible solution, and then have to try and refactor as I develop a better mental model of the problem. What I like most about this code isn't how few characters are used, or everything fitting in one screen. I like how it seems the code was well-understood before it was written. You can't refactor a 500-line jumble of C into code like this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real lesson is that I'm probably too quick to jump into coding things. I could spend more time working out how I want to model a problem in a more free-form way, like writing notation on paper, before jumping into the rigid world of programming syntax. With a clear mental model, I can then write code in terms of how I was thinking about the problem, instead of thinking about the problem in terms of how I wrote the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Next time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think a fun exercise would be to extend this interpreter while maintaining its code style, to see how I fare actually working with it. The repository this came from has various suggested exercises, but my ideas would be adding the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Swapping the bytes for float vectors&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vectors longer than 255 values&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-character numbers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Array literals (you can do it with comma, but that runs &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;on every value, which isn't ideal)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Whitespace insensitivity&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory management&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The unimplemented functions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-character variable names&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-character operators&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Indication for syntax errors&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

Is Thinking</title><link>https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/11/10/the-case-that-ai-is-thinking</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="2f41991cbdb78dfb"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dario Amodei, the C.E.O. of the artificial-intelligence company Anthropic, has been predicting that an A.I. “smarter than a Nobel Prize winner” in such fields as biology, math, engineering, and writing might come online by 2027. He envisions millions of copies of a model whirring away, each conducting its own research: a “country of geniuses in a datacenter.” In June, Sam Altman, of OpenAI, wrote that the industry was on the cusp of building “digital superintelligence.” “The 2030s are likely going to be wildly different from any time that has come before,” he asserted. Meanwhile, the A.I. tools that most people currently interact with on a day-to-day basis are reminiscent of Clippy, the onetime Microsoft Office “assistant” that was actually more of a gadfly. A Zoom A.I. tool suggests that you ask it “What are some meeting icebreakers?” or instruct it to “Write a short message to share gratitude.” Siri is good at setting reminders but not much else. A friend of mine saw a button in Gmail that said “Thank and tell anecdote.” When he clicked it, Google’s A.I. invented a funny story about a trip to Turkey that he never took.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rushed and uneven rollout of A.I. has created a fog in which it is tempting to conclude that there is nothing to see here—that it’s all hype. There is, to be sure, plenty of hype: Amodei’s timeline is science-fictional. (A.I. models aren’t improving that fast.) But it is another kind of wishful thinking to suppose that large language models are just shuffling words around. I used to be sympathetic to that view. I sought comfort in the idea that A.I. had little to do with real intelligence or understanding. I even celebrated its shortcomings—rooting for the home team. Then I began using A.I. in my work as a programmer, fearing that if I didn’t I would fall behind. (My employer, a trading firm, has several investments in and partnerships with A.I. companies, including Anthropic.) Writing code is, by many accounts, the thing that A.I. is best at; code has more structure than prose does, and it’s often possible to automatically validate that a given program works. My conversion was swift. At first, I consulted A.I. models in lieu of looking something up. Then I gave them small, self-contained problems. Eventually, I gave them real work—the kind I’d trained my whole career to do. I saw these models digest, in seconds, the intricate details of thousands of lines of code. They could spot subtle bugs and orchestrate complex new features. Finally, I was transferred to a fast-growing team that aims to make better use of A.I. tools, and to create our own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The science-fiction author William Gibson is said to have observed that the future is already here, just not evenly distributed—which might explain why A.I. seems to have minted two cultures, one dismissive and the other enthralled. In our daily lives, A.I. “agents” that can book vacations or file taxes are a flop, but I have colleagues who compose much of their code using A.I. and sometimes run multiple coding agents at a time. Models sometimes make amateur mistakes or get caught in inane loops, but, as I’ve learned to use them effectively, they have allowed me to accomplish in an evening what used to take a month. Not too long ago, I made two iOS apps without knowing how to make an iOS app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I once had a boss who said that a job interview should probe for strengths, not for the absence of weaknesses. Large language models have many weaknesses: they famously hallucinate reasonable-sounding falsehoods; they can be servile even when you’re wrong; they are fooled by simple puzzles. But I remember a time when the obvious strengths of today’s A.I. models—fluency, fluidity, an ability to “get” what someone is talking about—were considered holy grails. When you experience these strengths firsthand, you wonder: How convincing does the illusion of understanding have to be before you stop calling it an illusion?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a brutally hot day this summer, my friend Max met up with his family at a playground. For some reason, a sprinkler for kids was switched off, and Max’s wife had promised everyone that her husband would fix it. Confronted by red-faced six- and seven-year-olds, Max entered a utility shed hoping to find a big, fat “On” switch. Instead, he found a maze of ancient pipes and valves. He was about to give up when, on a whim, he pulled out his phone and fed a photo into ChatGPT-4o, along with a description of his problem. The A.I. thought for a second, or maybe didn’t think, but all the same it said that he was looking at a backflow-preventer system typical of irrigation setups. Did he see that yellow ball valve toward the bottom? That probably controlled the flow. Max went for it, and cheers rang out across the playground as the water turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Was ChatGPT mindlessly stringing words together, or did it understand the problem? The answer could teach us something important about understanding itself. “Neuroscientists have to confront this humbling truth,” Doris Tsao, a neuroscience professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told me. “The advances in machine learning have taught us more about the essence of intelligence than anything that neuroscience has discovered in the past hundred years.” Tsao is best known for decoding how macaque monkeys perceive faces. Her team learned to predict which neurons would fire when a monkey saw a specific face; even more strikingly, given a pattern of neurons firing, Tsao’s team could render the face. Their work built on research into how faces are represented inside A.I. models. These days, her favorite question to ask people is “What is the deepest insight you have gained from ChatGPT?” “My own answer,” she said, “is that I think it radically demystifies thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most basic account of how we got here goes something like this. In the nineteen-eighties, a small team of cognitive psychologists and computer scientists tried to simulate thinking in a machine. Among the more famous of them were David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and James McClelland, who went on to form a research group at U.C. San Diego. They saw the brain as a vast network in which neurons fire in patterns, causing other sets of neurons to fire, and so on; this dance of patterns is thinking. The brain learns by changing the strength of the connections between neurons. Crucially, the scientists mimicked this process by creating an artificial neural network, and by applying a simple algorithm called gradient descent to increase the accuracy of its predictions. (The algorithm could be compared to a hiker navigating from a mountaintop to a valley; a simple strategy for eventually finding one’s way is to insure that every step moves downhill.) The use of such algorithms in large networks is known as deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other people in A.I. were skeptical that neural networks were sophisticated enough for real-world tasks, but, as the networks got bigger, they began to solve previously unsolvable problems. People would devote entire dissertations to developing techniques for distinguishing handwritten digits or for recognizing faces in images; then a deep-learning algorithm would digest the underlying data, discover the subtleties of the problem, and make those projects seem obsolete. Deep learning soon conquered speech recognition, translation, image captioning, board games, and even the problem of predicting how proteins will fold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s leading A.I. models are trained on a large portion of the internet, using a technique called next-token prediction. A model learns by making guesses about what it will read next, then comparing those guesses to whatever actually appears. Wrong guesses inspire changes in the connection strength between the neurons; this is gradient descent. Eventually, the model becomes so good at predicting text that it appears to know things and make sense. So that is something to think about. A group of people sought the secret of how the brain works. As their model grew toward a brain-like size, it started doing things that were thought to require brain-like intelligence. Is it possible that they found what they were looking for?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is understandable resistance to such a simplistic and triumphant account of A.I. The case against it was well argued by Ted Chiang, who wrote an article for this magazine in early 2023 titled “ChatGPT Is a Blurry JPEG of the Web.” He meant it in a more or less deflationary way: that’s all ChatGPT is. You feed the whole internet to a program and it regurgitates it back to you imperfectly, like a copy of a copy of a photograph—but with just enough facility to fool you into believing that the program is intelligent. This spring, a similar argument was made in a book, “The AI Con,” by Emily M. Bender, a linguist, and Alex Hanna, a sociologist. Bender is perhaps best known for describing L.L.M.s as “stochastic parrots.” “Large language models do not, cannot, and will not ‘understand’ anything at all,” the writer Tyler Austin Harper declared in a book review in The Atlantic. Models “produce writing not by thinking but by making statistically informed guesses about which lexical item is likely to follow another.” Harper buttressed these technical arguments with moral ones. A.I. enriches the powerful, consumes enough energy to accelerate climate change, and marginalizes workers. He concluded that “the foundation of the AI industry is a scam.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the moral case against A.I. may ultimately be stronger than the technical one. “The ‘stochastic parrot’ thing has to be dead at some point,” Samuel J. Gershman, a Harvard cognitive scientist who is no A.I. hype man, told me. “Only the most hardcore skeptics can deny these systems are doing things many of us didn’t think were going to be achieved.” Jonathan Cohen, a cognitive neuroscientist at Princeton, emphasized the limitations of A.I., but argued that, in some cases, L.L.M.s seem to mirror one of the largest and most important parts of the human brain. “To a first approximation, your neocortex is your deep-learning mechanism,” Cohen said. Humans have a much larger neocortex than other animals, relative to body size, and the species with the largest neocortices—elephants, dolphins, gorillas, chimpanzees, dogs—are among the most intelligent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2003, the machine-learning researcher Eric B. Baum published a book called “What Is Thought?” (I stumbled upon it in my college’s library stacks, drawn by the title.) The gist of Baum’s argument is that understanding is compression, and compression is understanding. In statistics, when you want to make sense of points on a graph, you can use a technique called linear regression to draw a “line of best fit” through them. If there’s an underlying regularity in the data—maybe you’re plotting shoe size against height—the line of best fit will efficiently express it, predicting where new points could fall. The neocortex can be understood as distilling a sea of raw experience—sounds, sights, and other sensations—into “lines of best fit,” which it can use to make predictions. A baby exploring the world tries to guess how a toy will taste or where food will go when it hits the floor. When a prediction is wrong, the connections between neurons are adjusted. Over time, those connections begin to capture regularities in the data. They form a compressed model of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Artificial neural networks compress experience just like real neural networks do. One of the best open-source A.I. models, DeepSeek, is capable of writing novels, suggesting medical diagnoses, and sounding like a native speaker in dozens of languages. It was trained using next-token prediction on many terabytes of data. But when you download the model it is one six-hundredth of that. A distillation of the internet, compressed to fit on your laptop. Ted Chiang was right to call an early version of ChatGPT a blurry JPEG of the web—but, in my view, this is the very reason these models have become increasingly intelligent. Chiang noted in his piece that, to compress a text file filled with millions of examples of arithmetic, you wouldn’t create a zip file. You’d write a calculator program. “The greatest degree of compression can be achieved by understanding the text,” he wrote. Perhaps L.L.M.s are starting to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can seem unnatural, even repulsive, to imagine that a computer program actually understands, actually thinks. We usually conceptualize thinking as something conscious, like a Joycean inner monologue or the flow of sense memories in a Proustian daydream. Or we might mean reasoning: working through a problem step by step. In our conversations about A.I., we often conflate these different kinds of thinking, and it makes our judgments pat. ChatGPT is obviously not thinking, goes one argument, because it is obviously not having a Proustian reverie; ChatGPT clearly is thinking, goes another, because it can work through logic puzzles better than you can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Something more subtle is going on. I do not believe that ChatGPT has an inner life, and yet it seems to know what it’s talking about. Understanding—having a grasp of what’s going on—is an underappreciated kind of thinking, because it’s mostly unconscious. Douglas Hofstadter, a professor of cognitive science and comparative literature at Indiana University, likes to say that cognition is recognition. Hofstadter became famous for a book about the mind and consciousness called “Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid,” which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1980. Hofstadter’s theory, developed through decades of research, is that “seeing as” is the essence of thinking. You see one patch of color as a car and another as a key chain; you recognize the letter “A” no matter what font it is written in or how bad the handwriting might be. Hofstadter argued that the same process underlies more abstract kinds of perception. When a grand master examines a chess board, years of practice are channelled into a way of seeing: white’s bishop is weak; that endgame is probably a draw. You see an eddy in a river as a sign that it’s dangerous to cross. You see a meeting you’re in as an emperor-has-no-clothes situation. My nearly two-year-old son recognizes that late-morning stroller walks might be an opportunity for a croissant and makes demands accordingly. For Hofstadter, that’s intelligence in a nutshell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hofstadter was one of the original A.I. deflationists, and my own skepticism was rooted in his. He wrote that most A.I. research had little to do with real thinking, and when I was in college, in the two-thousands, I agreed with him. There were exceptions. He found the U.C.S.D. group interesting. And he admired the work of a lesser-known Finnish American cognitive scientist, Pentti Kanerva, who noticed some unusual properties in the mathematics of high-dimensional spaces. In a high-dimensional space, any two random points may be extremely far apart. But, counterintuitively, each point also has a large cloud of neighbors around it, so you can easily find your way to it if you get “close enough.” That reminded Kanerva of the way that memory works. In a 1988 book called “Sparse Distributed Memory,” Kanerva argued that thoughts, sensations, and recollections could be represented as coördinates in high-dimensional space. The brain seemed like the perfect piece of hardware for storing such things. Every memory has a sort of address, defined by the neurons that are active when you recall it. New experiences cause new sets of neurons to fire, representing new addresses. Two addresses can be different in many ways but similar in others; one perception or memory triggers other memories nearby. The scent of hay recalls a memory of summer camp. The first three notes of Beethoven’s Fifth beget the fourth. A chess position that you’ve never seen reminds you of old games—not all of them, just the ones in the right neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hofstadter realized that Kanerva was describing something like a “seeing as” machine. “Pentti Kanerva’s memory model was a revelation for me,” he wrote in a foreword to Kanerva’s book. “It was the very first piece of research I had ever run across that made me feel I could glimpse the distant goal of understanding how the brain works as a whole.” Every kind of thinking—whether Joycean, Proustian, or logical—depends on the relevant thing coming to mind at the right time. It’s how we figure out what situation we’re in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kanerva’s book receded from view, and Hofstadter’s own star faded—except when he occasionally poked up his head to criticize a new A.I. system. In 2018, he wrote of Google Translate and similar technologies: “There is still something deeply lacking in the approach, which is conveyed by a single word: understanding.” But GPT-4, which was released in 2023, produced Hofstadter’s conversion moment. “I’m mind-boggled by some of the things that the systems do,” he told me recently. “It would have been inconceivable even only ten years ago.” The staunchest deflationist could deflate no longer. Here was a program that could translate as well as an expert, make analogies, extemporize, generalize. Who were we to say that it didn’t understand? “They do things that are very much like thinking,” he said. “You could say they are thinking, just in a somewhat alien way.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;L.L.M.s appear to have a “seeing as” machine at their core. They represent each word with a series of numbers denoting its coördinates—its vector—in a high-dimensional space. In GPT-4, a word vector has thousands of dimensions, which describe its shades of similarity to and difference from every other word. During training, a large language model tweaks a word’s coördinates whenever it makes a prediction error; words that appear in texts together are nudged closer in space. This produces an incredibly dense representation of usages and meanings, in which analogy becomes a matter of geometry. In a classic example, if you take the word vector for “Paris,” subtract “France,” and then add “Italy,” the nearest other vector will be “Rome.” L.L.M.s can “vectorize” an image by encoding what’s in it, its mood, even the expressions on people’s faces, with enough detail to redraw it in a particular style or to write a paragraph about it. When Max asked ChatGPT to help him out with the sprinkler at the park, the model wasn’t just spewing text. The photograph of the plumbing was compressed, along with Max’s prompt, into a vector that captured its most important features. That vector served as an address for calling up nearby words and concepts. Those ideas, in turn, called up others as the model built up a sense of the situation. It composed its response with those ideas “in mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I was reading an interview with an Anthropic researcher, Trenton Bricken, who has worked with colleagues to probe the insides of Claude, the company’s series of A.I. models. (Their research has not been peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal.) His team has identified ensembles of artificial neurons, or “features,” that activate when Claude is about to say one thing or another. Features turn out to be like volume knobs for concepts; turn them up and the model will talk about little else. (In a sort of thought-control experiment, the feature representing the Golden Gate Bridge was turned up; when one user asked Claude for a chocolate-cake recipe, its suggested ingredients included “1/4 cup dry fog” and “1 cup warm seawater.”) In the interview, Bricken mentioned Google’s Transformer architecture, a recipe for constructing neural networks that underlies leading A.I. models. (The “T” in ChatGPT stands for “Transformer.”) He argued that the mathematics at the heart of the Transformer architecture closely approximated a model proposed decades earlier—by Pentti Kanerva, in “Sparse Distributed Memory.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should we be surprised by the correspondence between A.I. and our own brains? L.L.M.s are, after all, artificial neural networks that psychologists and neuroscientists helped develop. What’s more surprising is that when models practiced something rote—predicting words—they began to behave in such a brain-like way. These days, the fields of neuroscience and artificial intelligence are becoming entangled; brain experts are using A.I. as a kind of model organism. Evelina Fedorenko, a neuroscientist at M.I.T., has used L.L.M.s to study how brains process language. “I never thought I would be able to think about these kinds of things in my lifetime,” she told me. “I never thought we’d have models that are good enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has become commonplace to say that A.I. is a black box, but the opposite is arguably true: a scientist can probe the activity of individual artificial neurons and even alter them. “Having a working system that instantiates a theory of human intelligence—it’s the dream of cognitive neuroscience,” Kenneth Norman, a Princeton neuroscientist, told me. Norman has created computer models of the hippocampus, the brain region where episodic memories are stored, but in the past they were so simple that he could only feed them crude approximations of what might enter a human mind. “Now you can give memory models the exact stimuli you give to a person,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Wright brothers studied birds during their early efforts to build an airplane. They noted that birds take off into the wind, even though a reasonable person might have assumed they’d want the wind at their backs, and that they warp the tips of their wings for balance. These findings influenced their rudimentary glider designs. Then they built a six-foot-long wind tunnel, which allowed them to test a set of artificial wings under precisely controlled conditions. Their next round of glider flights was far more successful. Strangely, it was only well after they’d made a working flying machine that it became possible to understand exactly how the birds do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A.I. enables scientists to place thinking itself in a wind tunnel. For a paper provocatively titled “On the Biology of a Large Language Model,” Anthropic researchers observed Claude responding to queries and described “circuits”—cascades of features that, together, perform complex computations. (Calling up the right memories is one step toward thinking; combining and manipulating them in circuits is arguably another.) One longstanding criticism of L.L.M.s has been that, because they must generate one token of their response at a time, they can’t plan or reason. But, when you ask Claude to finish a rhyming couplet in a poem, a circuit begins considering the last word of the new line, to insure that it will rhyme. It then works backward to compose the line as a whole. Anthropic researchers counted this as evidence that their models do engage in planning. Squint a little and you might feel, for the first time, that the inner workings of a mind are in view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You really do have to squint, though. “The worry I have is that people flipped the bit from ‘I’m really skeptical of this’ to totally dropping their shields,” Norman, the Princeton neuroscientist, told me. “Many things still have to get figured out.” I’m one of the people that Norman is talking about. (Perhaps I am too easily moved by the seeming convergence of “Sparse Distributed Memory” and an Anthropic model.) In the past year or two, I started to believe what Geoffrey Hinton, who recently won a Nobel Prize for his A.I. research, told the journalist Karen Hao in 2020: “Deep learning is going to be able to do everything.” But we have also seen that larger models aren’t always better models. Curves plotting model performance against size have begun flattening out. It’s becoming difficult to find high-quality data that the models haven’t already digested, and computing power is increasingly expensive. When GPT-5 came out, in August, it was a merely incremental improvement—and so profound a disappointment that it threatened to pop the A.I. investment bubble. The moment demands a middle kind of skepticism: one that takes today’s A.I. models seriously without believing that there are no hard problems left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most consequential of these problems is how to design a model that learns as efficiently as humans do. It is estimated that GPT-4 was exposed to trillions of words in training; children need only a few million to become fluent. Cognitive scientists tell us that a newborn’s brain has certain “inductive biases” that accelerate learning. (Of course, the brain is the result of millions of years of evolution—itself a sort of training data.) For instance, human babies have the expectation that the world is made of objects, and that other beings have beliefs and intentions. When Mama says “banana,” an infant connects that word to the entire yellow object she’s looking at—not just its tip or its peel. Infants perform little experiments: Can I eat this? How far can I throw that? They are motivated by emotions such as desire, curiosity, and frustration. Children are always trying to do something just beyond their ability. Their learning is efficient because it’s embodied, adaptive, deliberate, and continuous. Maybe truly understanding the world requires participating in it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An A.I.’s experience, in comparison, is so impoverished that it can’t really be called “experience.” Large language models are trained on data that is already extraordinarily refined. “I think the reason they work is that they’re piggybacking on language,” Tsao, the U.C. Berkeley neuroscientist, told me. Language is like experience pre-chewed; other kinds of data are less dense with meaning. “Why is it that we haven’t had a comparable revolution in terms of reasoning about video data?” Gershman, the Harvard cognitive scientist, asked. “The kinds of vision models that we have still struggle with common-sense reasoning about physics.” A recent model from DeepMind can generate videos in which paints are mixed correctly and mazes are solved—but they also depict a glass bouncing, instead of shattering, and ropes defying physics by being smooshed into a knot. Ida Momennejad, a cognitive neuroscientist who now works for Microsoft Research, has done experiments in which an L.L.M. is given a virtual walk-through of a building and then asked questions about routes and shortcuts—spatial inferences that come easily to humans. With all but the most basic setups, the A.I.s tend to fail or hallucinate nonexistent paths. “Do they really do planning?” she said. “Not really.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my conversations with neuroscientists, I sensed a concern that the A.I. industry is racing ahead somewhat thoughtlessly. If the goal is to make artificial minds as capable as human minds are, then “we’re not training the systems in the right way,” Brenden M. Lake, a cognitive scientist at Princeton, told me. When an A.I. is done training, the neural network’s “brain” is frozen. If you tell the model some facts about yourself, it doesn’t rewire its neurons. Instead, it uses a crude substitute: it writes down a bit of text—“The user has a toddler and is studying French”—and considers that before other instructions you give. The human brain updates itself continuously, and there’s a beautiful theory about one of its ways of doing so: when you sleep, selected snapshots from your episodic memory are replayed for your neocortex in order to train it. Your high-dimensional thought space gets dimpled by the replayed memories; you wake up with a slightly new way of seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The A.I. community has become so addicted to—and so financially invested in—breakneck progress that it sometimes pretends that advancement is inevitable and there’s no science left to do. Science has the inconvenient property of sometimes stalling out. Silicon Valley may call A.I. companies “labs,” and some employees there “researchers,” but fundamentally it has an engineering culture that does whatever works. “It’s just so remarkable how little the machine-learning community bothers looking at, let alone respects, the history and cognitive science that precedes it,” Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s A.I. models owe their success to decades-old discoveries about the brain, but they are still deeply unlike brains. Which differences are incidental and which are fundamental? Every group of neuroscientists has its pet theory. These theories can be put to the test in a way that wasn’t possible before. Still, no one expects easy answers. The problems that continue to plague A.I. models “are solved by carefully identifying ways in which the models don’t behave as intelligently as we want them to and then addressing them,” Norman said. “That is still a human-scientist-in-the-loop process.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the nineties, billions of dollars poured into the Human Genome Project on the assumption that sequencing DNA might solve medicine’s most vexing problems: cancer, hereditary conditions, even aging. It was a time of bluster and confidence—the era of Dolly the cloned sheep and “Jurassic Park”—when biotech was ascendant and the commentariat reckoned with whether humans should be playing God. Biologists soon found that the reality was more complicated. We didn’t cure cancer or discover the causes of Alzheimer’s or autism. We learned that DNA tells just one part of the story of life. In fact, one could argue that biology got swept up in a kind of gene fever, fixating on DNA because we had the means to study and understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, nobody would claim that Francis Crick was wrong when, on the day in 1953 that he helped confirm the structure of DNA, he walked into a Cambridge pub talking about having discovered the secret of life. He and his colleagues did more to demystify life than almost anyone, ever. The decades following their discovery were among the most productive and exciting in the history of science. DNA became a household term; every high schooler learns about the double helix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With A.I., we once again find ourselves in a moment of bluster and confidence. Sam Altman talks about raising half a trillion dollars to build Stargate, a new cluster of A.I. data centers, in the U.S. People discuss the race for superintelligence with a gravitas and an urgency that can seem ungrounded, even silly. But I suspect the reason that the Amodeis and Altmans of the world are making messianic pronouncements is that they believe that the basic picture of intelligence has been worked out; the rest is just details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even some neuroscientists believe that a crucial threshold has been crossed. “I really think it could be the right model for cognition,” Uri Hasson, a colleague of Cohen’s, Norman’s, and Lake’s at Princeton, said of neural networks. This upsets him as much as it excites him. “I have the opposite worry of most people,” he said. “My worry is not that these models are similar to us. It’s that we are similar to these models.” If simple training techniques can enable a program to behave like a human, maybe humans aren’t as special as we thought. Could it also mean that A.I. will surpass us not only in knowledge but also in judgment, ingenuity, cunning—and, as a result, power? To my surprise, Hasson told me that he is “worried these days that we might succeed in understanding how the brain works. Pursuing this question may have been a colossal mistake for humanity.” He likened A.I. researchers to nuclear scientists in the nineteen-thirties: “This is the most interesting time in the life of these people. And, at the same time, they know that what they are working on has grave implications for humanity. But they cannot stop because of the curiosity to learn.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of my favorite books by Hofstadter is a nerdy volume called “Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought.” When I was in college, it electrified me. The premise was that a question such as “What is thinking?” was not merely philosophical but, rather, had a real answer. In 1995, when the book was published, Hofstadter and his research group could only gesture at what the answer might be. Thinking back on the book, I wondered whether Hofstadter would feel excited that A.I. researchers may have attained what he had yearned for: a mechanical account of the rudiments of thinking. When we spoke, however, he sounded profoundly disappointed—and frightened. Current A.I. research “confirms a lot of my ideas, but it also takes away from the beauty of what humanity is,” he told me. “When I was younger, much younger, I wanted to know what underlay creativity, the mechanisms of creativity. That was a holy grail for me. But now I want it to remain a mystery.” Perhaps the secrets of thinking are simpler than anyone expected—the kind of thing that a high schooler, or even a machine, could understand. ♦&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve just open-sourced Agent-o-rama, a library for building scalable and stateful LLM agents on the JVM. Agent-o-rama provides two first-class APIs, one for Java and one for Clojure, with feature parity between them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI tooling today is overwhelmingly centered on Python, and while the JVM ecosystem has seen growing support through libraries like LangChain4j, it lacks the kind of integrated tooling that lets developers evaluate, observe, and deploy LLM-based systems rigorously and at scale. Available tools are fragmented or complex to set up, and nothing handles the entire workflow from development to production with proper observability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agent-o-rama fills that gap. It brings the same ideas popularized by LangGraph and LangSmith – structured agent graphs, tracing, datasets, experiments, evaluation – but makes them native to Java and Clojure. LLMs are powerful but inherently unpredictable, so building applications with LLMs that are helpful and performant with minimal hallucination requires being rigorous about testing and monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents are defined as simple graphs of Java or Clojure functions that execute in parallel. Agent-o-rama automatically captures detailed traces and includes a web UI for offline experimentation, online evaluation, and time-series telemetry (e.g. model latency, token usage, database latency). It also supports streaming, with a simple client API to stream model calls or other outputs from nodes in real time. Agent-o-rama extends the ideas from LangGraph and LangSmith with far greater scalability, full parallel execution, and built-in high-performance data storage and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agent-o-rama is deployed onto your own infrastructure on a Rama cluster. Rama is free to use for clusters up to two nodes and can scale to thousands with a commercial license. Every part of Agent-o-rama is built-in and requires no other dependency besides Rama. Agent-o-rama also integrates seamlessly with any other tool, such as databases, vector stores, external APIs, or anything else. Unlike hosted observability tools, all data and traces stay within your infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Example agent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at an example agent! This is a research agent from the examples/ directory in the project. In that directory you’ll find equivalent Java and Clojure versions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll need Java 21 installed and API keys for OpenAI and Tavily (Tavily’s free tier is sufficient). Put the API keys in environment variables like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;export TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_key_here&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To run the agent, clone Agent-o-rama and follow these instructions (for Java or Clojure, whichever you prefer):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;8&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;9&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;# Java instructions&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;cd examples/java&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;./run-example com.rpl.agent.research.ResearchAgentExample&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;# Clojure instructions&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;cd examples/clj&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;lein repl&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;(require '[com.rpl.agent.research-agent :as research-agent])&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;(research-agent/run-agent)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This runs Rama’s “in-process cluster” (IPC) and launches the research agent on it. You’ll get a prompt at the terminal to enter a research topic. The agent will generate a set of analyst personas to analyze the topic, and you’ll be prompted again whether you want to give feedback on the generated analysts. Once you tell the agent you have no more feedback, it will spend a few minutes generating the report, including using information it finds through web searches and through Wikipedia, and then the final report will be printed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the report is being generated or when it’s finished, you can open the Agent-o-rama UI at &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:1974&lt;/code&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s an example back and forth:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you click on the research agent in the UI, you’ll see this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The invoke there is what we just ran. Clicking on it brings up the trace for the invoke:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is displaying the parallel execution of the agent, with orange nodes being aggregations of data computed on multiple branches. On the right is aggregated statistics of everything that happened during the agent’s execution. You can see how many tokens it used, and if it did any database reads/writes you’d see stats about those too. If the agent invokes other agents, you can see a breakdown of stats by agent as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clicking on the “write-report” node brings up a detailed trace of what happened when that node executed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This node did one LLM call, and you can see the arguments to that LLM, what was returned, and stats on the call in the “Operations” section. The code for this node is just this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;8&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;9&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;.node("write-report", "finish-report", (AgentNode agentNode, String sections, String topic) -&amp;gt; {&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;ChatModel openai = agentNode.getAgentObject("openai");&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;String instructions = String.format(REPORT_WRITER_INSTRUCTIONS, topic, sections);&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;List&amp;lt;ChatMessage&amp;gt; chatMessages = Arrays.asList(&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;new SystemMessage(instructions),&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;new UserMessage("Write a report based upon these memos."));&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;String report = openai.chat(chatMessages).aiMessage().text();&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;agentNode.emit("finish-report", "report", report);&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;})&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;8&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;9&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;10&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;11&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;12&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;(aor/node&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;"write-report"&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;"finish-report"&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;(fn [agent-node sections topic]&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;(let [openai (aor/get-agent-object agent-node "openai")&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;instr (report-writer-instructions topic sections)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;text (chat-and-get-text&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;openai&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;[(SystemMessage. instr)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;(UserMessage. "Write a report based upon these memos.")])]&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;(aor/emit! agent-node "finish-report" "report" text)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;)))&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This code says that the node’s name is “write-report”, the node emits to the node “finish-report”, and the node’s implementation is the given function. The &lt;code&gt;agentNode&lt;/code&gt;

/

&lt;code&gt;agent-node&lt;/code&gt;

argument is how you interact with the graph to return a result, emit to other nodes, or get agent objects like models, database connections, or anything else. When you emit to other nodes, you simply say what node you want to emit to and what arguments to pass to that node. Agent nodes run on virtual threads, so they can be efficiently written in a blocking style like this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s most of what’s involved in programming agents with Agent-o-rama! There’s a bit more to learn with aggregation and how to declare agent objects, and this is all documented on the programming agents guide. The rest of using Agent-o-rama is creating and managing datasets, running experiments, setting up online evaluation and other actions on production runs, and analyzing agent telemetry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, you can see from this code and the trace that model calls are automatically traced – this node didn’t have to record any tracing info explicitly. Though you can include your own info in traces with a simple API (see this Javadoc and this Clojuredoc).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at running this on a real cluster! Let’s quickly set up a cluster locally by following these instructions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download the latest Rama release from here.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unpack the release somewhere.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Run: &lt;code&gt;./rama devZookeeper &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Run: &lt;code&gt;./rama conductor &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Run: &lt;code&gt;./rama supervisor &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Visit: &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8888&lt;/code&gt;. When the page loads, the cluster is ready.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download the latest Agent-o-rama release from here.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unpack it somewhere.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Run: &lt;code&gt;./aor --rama /path/to/rama-root &amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, to deploy you need to build a jar first. Here’s how to build either the Java or Clojure version from the Agent-o-rama project:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;# For Java version &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;cd examples/java&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;# For Clojure version&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;cd examples/clj&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;lein uberjar&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Java version will build &lt;code&gt;target/java-examples-with-dependencies.jar&lt;/code&gt;

, and the Clojure version will build

&lt;code&gt;target/agent-o-rama-examples-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar&lt;/code&gt;

.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, to deploy the module just run this command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;8&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;9&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;10&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;12&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;13&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;14&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;15&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;16&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;17&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;# Deploy the module (Java uberjar)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;./rama deploy \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--action launch \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--jar /path/to/java-examples-with-dependencies.jar \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--module com.rpl.agent.research.ResearchAgentModule \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--tasks 4 \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--threads 2 \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--workers 1&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;# Deploy the module (Clojure uberjar)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;./rama deploy \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--action launch \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--jar /path/to/agent-o-rama-examples-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--module com.rpl.agent.research-agent/ResearchAgentModule \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--tasks 4 \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--threads 2 \&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;--workers 1&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now it’s up and running! You can view the agent in the UI at &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:1974&lt;/code&gt;

and play with it. From the agent screen you can invoke the agent with the arguments

&lt;code&gt;["", {"topic": "your topic here"}]&lt;/code&gt;

. On the trace, you’ll be able to see any human input prompts the agent makes and respond to them there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rama handles all of storage, deployment, and scaling. There are no other dependencies needed to run this. Setting up a production cluster is only slightly more work, and there are one-click deploys for AWS and for Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agent-o-rama lets developers gain the benefits of Rama without needing to learn it. Rama’s distributed programming model is powerful but has a learning curve: it introduces a rich dataflow API and uses compound data structures for indexing instead of fixed data models. Agent-o-rama abstracts away those concepts into a familiar API so developers can take advantage of Rama’s strengths for the specific domain of building LLM agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those who want to learn how to program Rama directly, Agent-o-rama also serves as a great example of Rama in practice. The backend is about 15K lines of code and the front-end about 11K, yet together they form a complete, end-to-end distributed system with a diverse feature set. Along with our Twitter-scale Mastodon implementation, it shows the breadth of what can be built with Rama.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’d love to hear what you build with Agent-o-rama. Join the rama-user mailing list or the #rama channel on the Clojurians Slack to ask questions, share feedback, or discuss ideas with others using Agent-o-rama.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’d like to talk directly with us about Agent-o-rama, whether to exchange ideas, get technical guidance, or explore working together on building an LLM agent, you can book a call with us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Lead image: Philip Goldstein) – In the early 1960s the New York City Fire Department was facing a host of problems. The world around them was growing ever taller, ever more compact, and ever more dangerous with respect to fire. There were times when the very infrastructure that was supposed to be supplying them the water to extinguish a blaze simply stopped flowing, there were other times that the equipment they had proved to be woefully insufficient to stop a fire that should have been controlled, resulting in massive blazes that ate up homes, businesses, lives, and millions upon millions of dollars. In April of 1963, a massive fire on Staten Island taxed the city’s fire service to the absolute breaking point while destroying millions and millions in property.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The day is still referred to as Black Saturday by the people who lived through it. Due to the lack of suitable water supplies, the fire was far larger than it should have been. There was a drought that year and many of the sources that the firemen were used to pulling water from had literally run dry. This began a series of events that led to the construction of the most powerful land based fire fighting truck ever created, the Mack Super Pumper System. It was actually five trucks that worked as a brigade to battle the worst flaming disasters that the city could throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From 1965 through the early 1980s, the Mack Super Pumper System responded to more than 2,200 calls with more than 900 firefighters serving to operate it in some capacity. The five trucks that made up the super pumper system were a massive, locomotive-engined central pumping truck, a tender truck full of hoses, manifolds, and other gear, and three satellite trucks that looked like standard fire engines but were not equipped with their own pumps. It cost the city of New York $875,000 when it was new and we’ll wager to say that it was probably the best money ever spent to keep Gotham safe. There’s never been anything else like it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pumping unit –&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The keystone of the whole operation was the massive central pumping unit that could draw water from eight hydrants at once, drop lines into bodies of water, supply a mind-boggling number of lines with water simultaneously, and flow over 10,000 gallons per minute at low pressures if the situation called for it. When the pressure was ramped up to to 350psi, it could move 8,800 GPM. This was enough to supply the other satellite trucks as well as feed a massive water cannon on the tender truck that could heave water over 600ft. That’s right, nearly and eight of a mile in whatever direction you wanted it to go. How was this possible? It was possible because of innovations in diesel engine technology during WWII. The grunt for the Super Pumper system came from a Napier-Deltic diesel engine. This was an engine designed by the British during WWII as a lightweight, high speed means to propel their ships. Making 2,400 horsepower and even more prodigious torque numbers, the engine was “light” enough to be mounted in a trailer behind a tractor and carted around. The Napier-Deltic was used to power locomotives and other massive land craft as well for a while. The engine’s design is interesting in the fact that it had three crankshafts and was an opposed piston style engine meaning that the pistons travel at each other. With turbochargers and a two stroke design, it was as mighty a compact piston powered engine the world had ever known to that point. It was thirsty and noisy as well. When working at full song, the engine would consume 137 gallons of diesel fuel per hour and the noise was so deafening that firemen near the truck had to wear strong ear protection to prevent hearing damage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mack was awarded the contract to build the truck in 1964 and by the end of the year, the unit was nearly ready to hit the streets of NYC. The tractor employed to drag the pumping unit around was a F715FSTP cab over that used a 255hp Mack END864 engine. The top speed of the whole rig was 42mph but since it was intended for responding to calls in the city, high mph was not as much a concern as maneuverability, and the ability to zip around at lower speeds happily. There were custom built PTOs to power the priming pump for the water pump and to to run an air compressor that needed 450psi to light off the pump engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The custom built trailer housed the engine and all of the stuff needed to keep it alive like the cooling system, fuel tanks, etc. At the rear of the trailer was the enormous six stage pump which was built by a company called DeLaval and that’s where the real magic happened. When the big Deltic was put to work turning that bad boy, fire, at least any on the first 60 stories of a building, didn’t stand a chance. The whole rig weighed in at 68,000lbs and for as much reading and research as we have done, there are no accounts of it ever faltering, failing, or leaving firefighters without the resources they needed to battle a fire. Often times we read about awesome machines like this and discover that they were unreliable or prone to fail but not this big guy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some pretty stunning facts about the truck and the pumper:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At 8,800 GPM it was throwing nearly 70,000lbs of water on a fire per minute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During a fire in the Bronx, firemen laid 7,000ft of hose to get to a suitable water supply and the truck pumped as though it was dipping its feet into the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1967 the Super Pumper responded to a fire at a postal annex in NYC and managed to supply water to the massive gun on the tender truck, its three satellite units, two tower ladder trucks, and a portable manifold with multiple hand lines all by itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hoses on the truck were pressure tested to 1,000psi of pressure but typically operated anywhere in the 350-800psi range depending on the situation. This is way higher (by several times!) what modern trucks use by our understanding. The hoses were a derivative of hoses developed by the Navy in WWII for high pressure applications and while incredibly heavy when compared to modern hoses, they were cutting edge at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The truck still exists, living at a museum in Michigan and standing as a great reminder that human beings are amazingly inventive and creative beings when forced to find solutions to problems that endanger lots of lives or lots of valuable property!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your computer modem screeches as it tries to connect to something called the internet. Maybe it works. Maybe you try again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the first time in history, you can exchange letters with someone across the world in seconds. Only 2000-something websites exist1, so you could theoretically visit them all over a weekend. Most websites are just text on gray backgrounds with the occasional pixelated image2. Loading times are brutal. A single image takes a minute, a 1-minute video could take hours. Most people do not trust putting their credit cards online. The advice everyone gives: don’t trust strangers on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People split into two camps very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Optimists predict grand transformations. Some believe digital commerce will overtake physical retail within years. Others insist we’ll wander around in virtual reality worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“I expect that within the next five years more than one in ten people will wear head-mounted computer displays while traveling in buses, trains, and planes.” - Nicholas Negroponte, MIT Professor, 1993&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pessimists call the internet a fad and a bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you told the average person in 1995 that within 25 years, we’d consume news from strangers on social media over newspapers, watch shows on-demand in place of cable TV, find romantic partners through apps more than through friends, and flip “don’t trust strangers on the internet” so completely that we’d let internet strangers pick us up in their personal vehicles and sleep in their spare bedrooms, most people would find that hard to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re in 1995 again. This time with Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And both sides of today’s debate are making similar mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One side warns that AI will eliminate entire professions and cause mass unemployment within a couple of years. The other claims that AI will create more jobs than it destroys. One camp dismisses AI as overhyped vaporware destined for a bubble burst, while the other predicts it will automate every knowledge task and reshape civilization within the decade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both are part right and part wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Employment Paradox: Why Automation’s Impact Depends On The Industry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Geoffrey Hinton, who some call the Father of AI, warned in 2016 that AI would trigger mass unemployment. “People should stop training radiologists now,” he declared, certain that AI would replace them within years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet as Deena Mousa, a researcher, shows in “The Algorithm Will See You Now,” AI hasn’t replaced radiologists, despite predictions. It is thriving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In 2025, American diagnostic radiology residency programs offered a record 1,208 positions across all radiology specialties, a four percent increase from 2024, and the field’s vacancy rates are at all-time highs. In 2025, radiology was the second-highest-paid medical specialty in the country, with an average income of $520,000, over 48 percent higher than the average salary in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mousa identifies a few factors for why the prediction failed - real-world complexity, the job involves more than image recognition, and regulatory/insurance hurdles. Most critical she points is Jevons Paradox, which is the economic principle that a technological improvement in resource efficiency leads to an increase in the total consumption of that resource, rather than a decrease. Her argument is that as AI makes radiologists more productive, better diagnostics and faster turnaround at lower costs mean more people get scans. So employment doesn’t decrease. It increases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is also the Tech world’s consensus. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella agrees, as does Box CEO Aaron Levie, who suggests:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“The least understood yet most important concept in the world is Jevons Paradox. When we make a technology more efficient, demand goes well beyond the original level. AI is the perfect example of this—almost anything that AI is applied to will see more demand, not less.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re only half right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, as Andrej Karpathy, the computer scientist who coined the term vibe coding, points out, radiology is not the right job to look for initial job displacements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Radiology is too multi-faceted, too high risk, too regulated. When looking for jobs that will change a lot due to AI on shorter time scales, I’d look in other places - jobs that look like repetition of one rote task, each task being relatively independent, closed (not requiring too much context), short (in time), forgiving (the cost of mistake is low), and of course automatable giving current (and digital) capability. Even then, I’d expect to see AI adopted as a tool at first, where jobs change and refactor (e.g. more monitoring or supervising than manual doing, etc).”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, the tech consensus that we will see increased employment actually depends on the industry. Specifically, how much unfulfilled demand can be unlocked in that industry, and whether this unfulfilled demand growth outpaces continued automation and productivity improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand this better, look at what actually happened in three industries over a 200-year period from 1800 to 2000. In the paper Automation and jobs: when technology boosts employment, James Bessen, an economist, shows the employment, productivity, and demand data for textile, iron &amp;amp; steel, and motor vehicle industries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After automation, both textile and iron/steel workers saw employment increase for nearly a century before experiencing a steep decline. Vehicle manufacturing, by contrast, holds steady and hasn’t seen the same steep decline yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To answer why those two industries saw sharp declines but motor vehicle manufacturing did not, first look at the productivity of workers in all three industries:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then look at the demand across those three industries:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What the graphs show is a consistent pattern (note: the productivity and demand graphs are logarithmic, meaning productivity and demand grew exponentially). Early on, a service or product is expensive because many workers are needed to produce it. Most people can’t afford it or use them sparingly. For example, in the early 1800s, most people could only afford a pair of pants or shirt. Then automation makes workers dramatically more productive. A textile worker in 1900 could produce fifty times more than one in 1800. This productivity explosion crashes prices, which creates massive new demand. Suddenly everyone can afford multiple outfits instead of just one or two. Employment and productivity both surge (note: employment growth masks internal segment displacement and wage changes. See footnote3)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once demand saturates, employment doesn’t further increase but holds steady at peak demand. But as automation continues and workers keep getting more productive, employment starts to decline. In textiles, mechanization enabled massive output growth but ultimately displaced workers once consumption plateaued while automation and productivity continued climbing. We probably don’t need infinite clothing. Similarly, patients will likely never need a million radiology reports, no matter how cheap they become and so radiologists will eventually hit a ceiling. We don’t need infinite food, clothing, tax returns, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Motor vehicles, in Bessen’s graphs, tell a different story because demand remains far from saturated. Most people globally still don’t own cars. Automation hasn’t completely conquered manufacturing either (Tesla’s retreat from full manufacturing automation proves the current technical limits). When both demand and automation potential remain high, employment can sustain or even grow despite productivity gains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software presents an even more interesting question. How many apps do you need? What about software that generates applications on demand, that creates entire software ecosystems autonomously? Until now, handcrafted software was the constraint. Expensive software engineers and their labor costs limited what companies could afford to build. Automation changes this equation by making those engineers far more productive. Both consumer and enterprise software markets suggest significant unmet demand because businesses have consistently left projects unbuilt4. They couldn’t justify the development costs or had to allocate limited resources to their top priority projects. I saw this firsthand at Amazon. Thousands of ideas went unfunded not because they lacked business value, but because of the lack of engineering resources to build them. If AI can produce software at a fraction of the cost, that unleashes enormous latent demand. The key question then is if and when that demand will saturate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So to generalize, for each industry, employment hinges on a race between two forces:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The magnitude and growth of unmet market demand, and&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Whether that demand growth outpaces productivity improvements from automation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Different industries will experience different outcomes depending on who’s winning that demand and productivity race.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Bubble: Irrational Exuberance Builds the Future&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second debate centers on whether this AI boom is a bubble waiting to burst.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dotcom boom of the 1990s saw a wave of companies adding “.com” to their name to ride the mania and watch their valuations soar. Infra companies poured billions into fiber optics and undersea cables - expensive projects only possible because people believed the hype5. All of this eventually burst in spectacular fashion in the dotcom crash in 2000-2001. Infrastructure companies like Cisco briefly became the most valuable in the world only to come tumbling down6. Pets.com served as the poster child of this exuberance raising $82.5 million in its IPO, spending millions on a Super Bowl ad only to collapse nine months later7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the dotcom bubble also got several things right. More importantly, it eventually bought us the physical infrastructure that made YouTube, Netflix, and Facebook possible. Sure, companies like Worldcom, NorthPoint, and Global Crossing making these investments went bankrupt, but they also laid the foundation for the future. Although the crash proved the skeptics right in the short term, it proved the optimists were directionally correct in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s AI boom shows similar exuberance. Consider the AI startup founded by former OpenAI executive Mira Murati, which raised $2 billion at a $10 billion valuation, the largest seed round in history8. This despite having no product and declining to reveal what it’s building or how it will generate returns. Several AI wrappers have raised millions in seed funding with little to no moat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet some investments will outlast the hype and will likely help future AI companies even if this is a bubble. For example, the annual capital expenditures of Hyperscalers9 that have more than doubled since ChatGPT’s release - Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon are collectively spending almost half a trillion dollars on data centers, chips, and compute infrastructure. Regardless of which specific companies survive, this infrastructure being built now will create the foundation for our AI future - from inference capacity to the power generation needed to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The infrastructure investments may have long-term value, but are we already in bubble territory? Azeem Azhar, a tech analyst and investor, provides an excellent practical framework to answer the AI bubble question. He benchmarks today’s AI boom using five gauges: economic strain (investment as a share of GDP), industry strain (capex to revenue ratios), revenue growth trajectories (doubling time), valuation heat (price-to-earnings multiples), and funding quality (the resilience of capital sources). His analysis shows that AI remains in a demand-led boom rather than a bubble, but if two of the five gauges head into red, we will be in bubble territory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The demand is real. After all OpenAI is one of the fastest-growing companies in history10. But that alone doesn’t prevent bubbles. OpenAI will likely be fine given its product-market fit, but many other AI companies face the same unit economics questions that plagued dotcom companies in the 1990s. Pets.com had millions of users too (a then large portion of internet users), but as the tech axiom goes, you can acquire infinite customers and generate infinite revenue if you sell dollars for 85 cents11. So despite the demand, the pattern may rhyme with the 1990s. Expect overbuilding. Expect some spectacular failures. But also expect the infrastructure to outlast the hype cycle and enable things we can’t yet imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Predictably Unpredictable Future&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So where does this leave us?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re early in the AI revolution. We’re at that metaphorical screeching modem phase of the internet era. Just as infrastructure companies poured billions into fiber optics, hyperscalers now pour billions into compute. Startups add “.ai” to their names like companies once added “.com” as they seek higher valuations. The hype will cycle through both euphoria and despair. Some predictions will look laughably wrong. Some that seem crazy will prove conservative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Different industries will experience different outcomes. Unlike what the Jevons optimists suggest, demand for many things plateaus once human needs are met. Employment outcomes in any industry depend on the magnitude and growth of unmet market demand and whether that demand growth outpaces productivity improvements from automation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cost reduction will unlock market segments. Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor, (in)famously undervalued Uber assuming it would only capture a portion of the existing taxi market12. He missed that making rides dramatically cheaper would expand the market itself as people took Ubers to destinations they’d never have paid taxi prices to reach. AI will similarly enable products and services currently too expensive to build with human intelligence. A restaurant owner might use AI to create custom supply chain software that say at $100,000 with human developers would never have been built. A non-profit might deploy AI to contest a legal battle that was previously unaffordable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can predict change, but we can’t predict the details. No one in 1995 predicted we’d date strangers from the internet, ride in their ubers, or sleep in their airbnbs. Or that a job called influencers would become the most sought-after career among young people. Human creativity generates outcomes we can’t forecast with our current mental models. Expect new domains and industries to emerge. AI has already helped us decode more animal communication in the last five years than in the last fifty. Can we predict what jobs a technology that allows us to have full-blown conversations with them will unlock? A job that doesn’t exist today will likely be the most sought-after job in 2050. We can’t name it because it hasn’t been invented yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Job categories will transform. Even as the internet made some jobs obsolete, it also transformed others and created new categories. Expect the same with AI. Karpathy ends with a question:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;About 6 months ago, I was also asked to vote if we will have less or more software engineers in 5 years. Exercise left for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To answer this question, go back to 1995 and ask the same question but with journalists. You might have predicted more journalists because the internet would create more demand by enabling you to reach the whole world. You’d be right for 10 or so years as employment in journalism grew until the early 2000s. But 30 years later, the number of newspapers and the number of journalists both have declined, even though more “journalism” happens than ever. Just not by people we call journalists. Bloggers, influencers, YouTubers, and newsletter writers do the work that traditional journalists used to do13.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The same pattern will play out with software engineers. We’ll see more people doing software engineering work and in a decade or so, what “software engineer” means will have transformed. Consider the restaurant owner from earlier who uses AI to create custom inventory software that is useful only for them. They won’t call themselves a software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So just like in 1995, if the AI optimists today say that within 25 years, we’d prefer news from AI over social media influencers, watch AI-generated characters in place of human actors, find romantic partners through AI matchmakers more than through dating apps (or perhaps use AI romantic partners itself), and flip “don’t trust AI” so completely that we’d rely on AI for life-or-death decisions and trust it to raise our children, most people would find that hard to believe. Even with all the intelligence, both natural and artificial, no one can predict with certainty what our AI future will look like. Not the tech CEOs, not the AI researchers, and certainly not some random guy pontificating on the internet. But whether we get the details right or not, our AI future is loading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approximately 2,879 websites were established before 1995, expanding to 23,500 by June 1995. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_websites_founded_before_1995&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Historical data from the Industrial Revolution shows that even as aggregate textile employment grew, workers shifted between job types within the industry as some roles became redundant. And correspondingly, some jobs saw wages collapse while others saw increases. For example, domestic hand-loom weavers were displaced by power looms and saw their wages collapse, while self-acting mule spinners (a newly created role) and factory workers saw stable employment and steady compensation growth. Additionally, Britain’s deflationary period (1815-1850) saw food prices fall by half, meaning real purchasing power often rose even when nominal wages declined. Despite all this, the psychological reality was harsh. Even with falling prices, watching your paycheck shrink while neighbors lost jobs and debts grew harder to pay (lower wages but fixed obligations) created real instability regardless of aggregate statistics improvements. Also see Acemoglu &amp;amp; Johnson, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask any tech product leader about their roadmap planning, and they’ll all universally report far more worthwhile projects than resources to build them, forcing ruthless prioritization to decide what gets built.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hyperscalers are large cloud computing companies like Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon that operate massive data centers and provide the computing infrastructure necessary to train and run AI models at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Damodaran valued Uber at $6B, assuming a 10% market share of the then $100B taxi market. Uber’s market cap as of October 2025 is $190B.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Job transformation doesn’t guarantee comparable compensation. Much of this new “journalism” or content creation happens for free or at rates far below what traditional news organizations paid, separating the work from stable employment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on and off on a new linker. To my surprise, I’ve discovered in talking about this that some people, even some computer programmers, are unfamiliar with the details of the linking process. I’ve decided to write some notes about linkers, with the goal of producing an essay similar to my existing one about the GNU configure and build system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I only have the time to write one thing a day, I’m going to do this on my blog over time, and gather the final essay together later. I believe that I may be up to five readers, and I hope y’all will accept this digression into stuff that matters. I will return to random philosophizing and minding other people’s business soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Personal Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who am I to write about linkers?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote my first linker back in 1988, for the AMOS operating system which ran on Alpha Micro systems. (If you don’t understand the following description, don’t worry; all will be explained below). I used a single global database to register all symbols. Object files were checked into the database after they had been compiled. The link process mainly required identifying the object file holding the main function. Other objects files were pulled in by reference. I reverse engineered the object file format, which was undocumented but quite simple. The goal of all this was speed, and indeed this linker was much faster than the system one, mainly because of the speed of the database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote my second linker in 1993 and 1994. This linker was designed and prototyped by Steve Chamberlain while we both worked at Cygnus Support (later Cygnus Solutions, later part of Red Hat). This was a complete reimplementation of the BFD based linker which Steve had written a couple of years before. The primary target was a.out and COFF. Again the goal was speed, especially compared to the original BFD based linker. On SunOS 4 this linker was almost as fast as running the cat program on the input .o files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The linker I am now working, called gold, on will be my third. It is exclusively an ELF linker. Once again, the goal is speed, in this case being faster than my second linker. That linker has been significantly slowed down over the years by adding support for ELF and for shared libraries. This support was patched in rather than being designed in. Future plans for the new linker include support for incremental linking–which is another way of increasing speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is an obvious pattern here: everybody wants linkers to be faster. This is because the job which a linker does is uninteresting. The linker is a speed bump for a developer, a process which takes a relatively long time but adds no real value. So why do we have linkers at all? That brings us to our next topic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Technical Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does a linker do?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s simple: a linker converts object files into executables and shared libraries. Let’s look at what that means. For cases where a linker is used, the software development process consists of writing program code in some language: e.g., C or C++ or Fortran (but typically not Java, as Java normally works differently, using a loader rather than a linker). A compiler translates this program code, which is human readable text, into into another form of human readable text known as assembly code. Assembly code is a readable form of the machine language which the computer can execute directly. An assembler is used to turn this assembly code into an object file. For completeness, I’ll note that some compilers include an assembler internally, and produce an object file directly. Either way, this is where things get interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the old days, when dinosaurs roamed the data centers, many programs were complete in themselves. In those days there was generally no compiler–people wrote directly in assembly code–and the assembler actually generated an executable file which the machine could execute directly. As languages liked Fortran and Cobol started to appear, people began to think in terms of libraries of subroutines, which meant that there had to be some way to run the assembler at two different times, and combine the output into a single executable file. This required the assembler to generate a different type of output, which became known as an object file (I have no idea where this name came from). And a new program was required to combine different object files together into a single executable. This new program became known as the linker (the source of this name should be obvious).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linkers still do the same job today. In the decades that followed, one new feature has been added: shared libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Friendly Tour of Process Memory on Linux&lt;/head&gt;- 24 mins&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A Friendly Tour of Process Memory on Linux&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;You run a program. It reads and writes addresses as if a giant, continuous slab of memory had been waiting there all along. It didn’t. Linux builds that illusion on the fly, one page at a time. This is a walk through what your process actually owns, what happens on the first touch of a byte, how protections and huge pages fit in, how to see the truth from &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;, and why modern kernels do a little extra dance to defend against Meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: This tour targets Linux on x86‑64, other architectures differ in details (page sizes, cache rules), but the ideas carry over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Intro&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The picture below is a quick introduction. It is a simple map you can keep in mind as you read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical RAM is the real memory. It is a bunch of frames scattered around. The virtual view is the clean line your program sees. It does not match the real layout. The page table is a list. It tells which spot on the virtual line points to which frame in RAM. Disk is extra space the system can use when RAM is full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is how it plays out. When you read or write, the CPU looks in the page table. If there is an entry it goes to that frame. If there is no entry you get a page fault. The system then fills a frame and adds the entry, or it stops you with an error. We will explain faults later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When RAM is tight the system makes room. It moves pages you have not used in a while to disk, or drops file pages it can load again. If you touch one of those later it brings it back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainers appear throughout so anyone can follow along, regardless of background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;is a virtual filesystem the kernel builds in memory. It exposes process and kernel state as files. You can read them with normal tools like&lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The floor plan you never see&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the kernel, your process owns one object that represents its whole address space. Think of it as a floor plan. Each room on that plan is a virtual memory area (VMA) a contiguous range with the same permissions (read, write, execute) and the same kind of backing (anonymous memory or a file).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: VMA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;A VMA is a continuous virtual address range with one set of rights and one kind of backing.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the plan sit the page tables that the hardware reads to translate your virtual addresses to real page frames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: page tables and PTE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Page tables are lookup structures the CPU walks to translate addresses. A page table entry (PTE) maps one virtual page to one physical page and holds bits like present and writable.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All threads in the process share the same plan. When the scheduler runs you, the CPU is pointed at your page tables, so pointer dereferences don’t need a syscall once a mapping exists, the hardware does the translation on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You change the plan in three ways: &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt; draws a room, &lt;code&gt;mprotect&lt;/code&gt; changes the sign on its door (R/W/X), and &lt;code&gt;munmap&lt;/code&gt; tears it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;reserves a virtual range with given permissions and a backing source.&lt;lb/&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;code&gt;mprotect&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;mprotect&lt;/code&gt;changes the permissions on an existing range.&lt;lb/&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;code&gt;munmap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;munmap&lt;/code&gt;removes a mapping from the address space.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything else (creating pages, reading file data, swapping) happens lazily when you touch memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: page&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Hardware manages memory in fixed chunks called pages. On many x86‑64 machines a base page is 4 KiB. Bigger pages exist at 2 MiB and 1 GiB.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A quick glance at your own house&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run:&lt;code&gt;cat /proc/self/maps | sed -n '1,80p'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll see your main binary’s segments (code, data, bss), the heap, anonymous mappings (allocators use these for big chunks), shared libraries, and thread stacks near the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll typically also see two small regions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;[vdso]&lt;/code&gt;: a tiny shared object the kernel maps in so a few calls like&lt;code&gt;gettimeofday&lt;/code&gt;can run without a kernel trap.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;[vvar]&lt;/code&gt;: read‑only data those helpers use.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;vdso&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;vvar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;vdso&lt;/code&gt;is code the kernel maps into your process to make some syscalls fast.&lt;code&gt;vvar&lt;/code&gt;holds data that code reads.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re why asking the time is fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;, without the fog&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you call &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;, you’re not “allocating memory” so much as drawing a promise on the floor plan. You say give me a range of addresses with these rights and back it by this file plus offset or by anonymous memory. Linux picks an address, makes sure it doesn’t collide, adjusts VMAs so each remains uniform, and records the promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: ASLR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Address Space Layout Randomization places mappings at randomized locations to make exploits harder.&lt;lb/&gt;Tiny explainer: anonymous vs file mapping&lt;lb/&gt;Anonymous memory is not tied to a file and starts as zeros. File mappings mirror file contents.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does not allocate pages yet. That comes later at first touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two gotchas come up over and over:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;File mappings: &lt;code&gt;offset&lt;/code&gt;must be page aligned or&lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;returns&lt;code&gt;EINVAL&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Mapping past end of file is allowed, but touching beyond the true end raises &lt;code&gt;SIGBUS&lt;/code&gt;. The VMA exists, the data does not.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAP_PRIVATE&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;MAP_SHARED&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAP_SHARED&lt;/code&gt;means writes go back to the file and are visible to others that share it.&lt;code&gt;MAP_PRIVATE&lt;/code&gt;means you see the file but writes go to private copy‑on‑write pages.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anonymous mappings start life as zeroes. File mappings mirror the file. If the file ends mid page the tail of that last page reads as zeros but still belongs to the file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAP_FIXED&lt;/code&gt; means exactly here and it overwrites anything already mapped at that address. Prefer &lt;code&gt;MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE&lt;/code&gt; to fail instead of clobbering. Without either flag your &lt;code&gt;addr&lt;/code&gt; is just a hint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Ask for an exact address and fail if something is already there. Safer than overwriting.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The first touch&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine &lt;code&gt;*p = 42;&lt;/code&gt; to a fresh mapping. The CPU tries to translate the address. It finds no entry so it raises a page fault that includes the address and an error code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: page fault&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;A page fault is the CPU asking the kernel to handle a missing or illegal translation for an address.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kernel’s handler runs on your behalf and asks three questions in this order:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Is the address inside any VMA&lt;lb/&gt;If not you are poking a hole in the plan →&lt;code&gt;SIGSEGV&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Do the rights allow this access&lt;lb/&gt;Write to a read only page or execute from non exec →&lt;code&gt;SIGSEGV&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If it is valid but missing make it real&lt;lb/&gt;For an anonymous mapping the kernel allocates a zero filled physical page, wires a page table entry with your requested permissions, and returns to your instruction. For a file mapping it first checks the page cache. If the data is not in RAM it reads from storage, then installs the translation and retries your instruction. Your store lands. You keep going.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: page cache&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The page cache is the kernel’s cache of file data in RAM. File mappings read and write through it.&lt;lb/&gt;Tiny explainer: zero page&lt;lb/&gt;Some reads from fresh anonymous memory can be satisfied by a shared read only page of zeros. A private page is created on the first write.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;People count these faults:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;A minor fault means the data was already in RAM and only the translation was missing.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;A major fault means the kernel had to wait for I/O which is expensive.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: stack guard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;User stacks have a guard page. Touching just below the current stack can grow it. Touching far below looks like a bug and gets a&lt;code&gt;SIGSEGV&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This same lazy first touch explains how memory is shared after &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; and how &lt;code&gt;MAP_PRIVATE&lt;/code&gt; works. The next section shows that path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Copy on write with &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MAP_PRIVATE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why this is here. We just talked about first touch. The same rule explains why pages do not copy on &lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt; and why &lt;code&gt;MAP_PRIVATE&lt;/code&gt; does not change the file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt; does not duplicate pages. The child points at the same physical pages as the parent. The kernel flips those pages to read only for both. The first write hits a copy on write fault. The kernel allocates a new page, copies the bytes, updates the writer’s page table entry to the new page with write permission, and returns. Reads still share the original page. That is why RSS stays flat after &lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt; until you write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: RSS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Resident Set Size is how many pages of this process are currently in RAM. Tiny explainer: copy on write&lt;lb/&gt;Share the same page for reads. Make a private copy only when a write happens.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAP_PRIVATE&lt;/code&gt; uses the same idea. You read file data through the page cache. When you write, the kernel gives you a private page. The file stays unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things you will also run into:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;fork&lt;/code&gt;then&lt;code&gt;execve&lt;/code&gt;. The child replaces its whole address space soon after. That avoids most CoW work.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;vfork&lt;/code&gt;. The child runs in the parent’s address space until it calls&lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;_exit&lt;/code&gt;. The parent waits. Do not touch memory in the child.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;clone&lt;/code&gt;with&lt;code&gt;CLONE_VM&lt;/code&gt;. This makes a thread. One address space. No copy.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;MAP_SHARED&lt;/code&gt;. Writes go to the shared page and to the file or shmem. No CoW.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;MADV_DONTFORK&lt;/code&gt;. Leave this mapping out of the child.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;MADV_WIPEONFORK&lt;/code&gt;. The child sees zeros for this mapping.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Transparent huge pages. Breaking CoW on a huge page may split it first. Small extra cost.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Changing rights, and the little pause you feel&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why you care. JITs and loaders flip a region from writable to executable after codegen which is W^X. That flip is not free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: W^X&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Write xor Execute is a policy. A page is never writable and executable at the same time.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mprotect(addr, len, prot)&lt;/code&gt; changes permissions. Internally the kernel may split VMAs so each remains uniform, edits the page table entries for the range, and then does one more necessary thing. It invalidates old translations from the CPU’s small cache of address translations which is the TLB. That invalidation is the small pause you sometimes feel when a JIT flips RW to RX or back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: TLB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The Translation Lookaside Buffer caches recent translations so the CPU does not walk page tables every time.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most systems enforce W^X. A page should not be writable and executable at the same time. JITs keep to that by flipping after codegen or by keeping two virtual mappings of the same memory so no single mapping is both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember there are two layers of permission checks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Filesystem or mount policy like &lt;code&gt;noexec&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Page permissions like &lt;code&gt;PROT_EXEC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either layer can block execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Seeing what’s really mapped&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;For everyday questions the friendly view is enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/maps&lt;/code&gt;shapes: addresses, rights, file names&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/smaps&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;smaps_rollup&lt;/code&gt;add per region accounting like how much is resident which is RSS, private vs shared, and whether huge pages were used like&lt;code&gt;AnonHugePages&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;FilePmdMapped&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you need truth at the per page level Linux exposes sharper tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/pagemap&lt;/code&gt; has one 64 bit entry per virtual page. It tells you whether a page is present, swapped, soft dirty, exclusively mapped with caveats for huge pages, whether it is write protected via userfaultfd, or part of a guard region. It can also reveal the page frame number which is PFN but modern kernels hide PFNs from unprivileged users. You need the right capability or root.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: PFN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Page Frame Number is the physical page index used inside the kernel. Tiny explainer: userfaultfd&lt;lb/&gt;A file descriptor that lets a userspace thread handle faults and write protect events for a range.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc/kpagecount&lt;/code&gt; is indexed by PFN and tells you how many mappings point at a given physical page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/proc/kpageflags&lt;/code&gt; is also indexed by PFN and tells you what kind of page it is and what is happening to it like anonymous or file backed, part of a transparent huge page, in the LRU, dirty, under writeback, a page table page, or the shared zero page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Common wrinkles&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Sparse files. To tell hole vs data, combine &lt;code&gt;mincore()&lt;/code&gt;which says resident or not with&lt;code&gt;lseek(..., SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE)&lt;/code&gt;on the backing file.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Shared memory and swap. Shared and shmem pages may be non present at the PTE level while still logically allocated. Expect swap entries and non present PTEs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Privileges. Modern kernels restrict PFN and some flag visibility to privileged users for security.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mincore&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;mincore&lt;/code&gt;tells you which pages of a mapping are in RAM.&lt;lb/&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;code&gt;SEEK_DATA&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;SEEK_HOLE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;File offsets that let you skip to the next data chunk or the next hole in a sparse file.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: soft dirty vs written&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Soft dirty marks pages dirtied by userland but it can get lost across swaps or VMA merges. Newer kernels offer an ioctl named&lt;code&gt;PAGEMAP_SCAN&lt;/code&gt;that scans a range for pages written since last write protect and can in the same step write protect them again. It pairs with userfaultfd write protect to give fast and race free userspace dirty tracking for snapshotting and live migration.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When your page suddenly gets bigger&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your CPU would rather cover more ground with fewer entries in its TLB. Linux can help by backing hot memory with bigger pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: THP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Transparent Huge Pages automatically try to use larger pages for performance when safe.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transparent Huge Pages do this automatically for anonymous memory and shmem or tmpfs. A fault can be satisfied with a 2 MiB page instead of 512 small ones. A background thread named khugepaged can also collapse adjacent base pages into a huge page when it is safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;khugepaged&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;A kernel thread that scans and merges adjacent small pages into huge pages when conditions are right.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern kernels add multi size THP which is mTHP on some architectures. Groups of base pages like 16 KiB or 64 KiB reduce fault count and TLB pressure without always jumping to 2 MiB. They are still PTE mapped but behave as larger folios inside the VM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: mTHP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Multi size THP allows variable order large folios so you get some of the benefit without a full 2 MiB page.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can ask for THP in a region with &lt;code&gt;madvise(..., MADV_HUGEPAGE)&lt;/code&gt; or opt out with &lt;code&gt;MADV_NOHUGEPAGE&lt;/code&gt;. System wide behavior lives under &lt;code&gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/&lt;/code&gt; with per size controls. &lt;code&gt;enabled&lt;/code&gt; can be &lt;code&gt;always&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;madvise&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;never&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;inherit&lt;/code&gt;. Shmem or tmpfs have their own knobs like a &lt;code&gt;huge=&lt;/code&gt; mount option with &lt;code&gt;always&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;advise&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;within_size&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;never&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to tell if it worked. In &lt;code&gt;/proc/self/smaps&lt;/code&gt; the lines for a region include &lt;code&gt;AnonHugePages&lt;/code&gt; for anonymous THP and &lt;code&gt;FilePmdMapped&lt;/code&gt; for file or shmem huge mappings. System wide &lt;code&gt;/proc/meminfo&lt;/code&gt; has &lt;code&gt;AnonHugePages&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ShmemPmdMapped&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ShmemHugePages&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;/proc/vmstat&lt;/code&gt; keeps a diary of THP events allocated on fault, fell back, split, swapped as a whole, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controls plain map:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Top level: &lt;code&gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled&lt;/code&gt;which is&lt;code&gt;always&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;madvise&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;never&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Defrag effort: &lt;code&gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag&lt;/code&gt;tunes how hard the kernel tries on the fault path vs deferring to khugepaged&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Shmem or tmpfs: &lt;code&gt;huge=always|within_size|advise|never&lt;/code&gt;plus shmem specific knobs&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern kernels may also create variable order large folios that are bigger than 4 KiB but PTE mapped not full 2 MiB PMD. This reduces fault count and TLB pressure without always jumping to 2 MiB. Behavior differs by kernel and architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One trade off. Assembling a huge page may require compaction which moves other pages to free a contiguous chunk and this can add a small pause. If first touch latency matters more than steady state speed the defrag knob lets you temper how hard the kernel tries which pushes work to khugepaged instead of doing it inline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: THP vs hugetlbfs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;THP is automatic and pageable. Explicit huge pages from&lt;code&gt;MAP_HUGETLB&lt;/code&gt;or hugetlbfs are quota managed and non swap.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dirty‑tracking in userspace, without racing the kernel&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you want to copy only the pages an application modified since your last snapshot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Give yourself the ability to catch write protect faults with userfaultfd in write protect mode.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;PAGEMAP_SCAN&lt;/code&gt;over your range with the category written since last write protect. Ask the kernel to write protect matching pages and to return compact ranges of what it found.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Copy those ranges. When the app later writes to one of them userfaultfd wakes your thread. Log the dirtied page, clear write protect, and let it proceed.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;This avoids walking every PTE and avoids the classic race where a page is dirtied while you were looking. It is also fast because scan plus write protect happens as one atomic operation inside the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;PAGEMAP_SCAN&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;An ioctl that scans a virtual range for pages with properties like written since last protect and can also apply write protect in the same step.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The TLB, and why &lt;code&gt;mprotect&lt;/code&gt; costs a little&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Translation Lookaside Buffer remembers recent translations so the CPU does not walk page tables on every access. If Linux changes a mapping or its permissions it must make sure stale entries are not used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On x86 there are two broad ways to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Precise invalidation. Invalidate one page at a time with &lt;code&gt;INVLPG&lt;/code&gt;. Good for small changes. A single invalidation on a huge page mapping drops the whole 2 MiB entry.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Broader flushes. Drop many or all entries for example by reloading the page table root register. Fewer instructions now and more misses later while refilling.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is better depends on how big a change you made, whether you are changing small or huge pages, and the microarchitecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: PCID&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Process Context Identifiers tag TLB entries so switching page tables does not flush everything.&lt;lb/&gt;Tiny explainer: INVPCID&lt;lb/&gt;Allows targeted invalidation of TLB entries for a given tag without switching to it.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a debug knob on some x86 builds named &lt;code&gt;tlb_single_page_flush_ceiling&lt;/code&gt; that nudges when the kernel switches from per page invalidations to a broad flush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;INVLPG&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;A privileged instruction that invalidates TLB entries for the page containing a given address in the current address space tag.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Meltdown, and why the kernel sometimes switches maps on entry&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early 2018 brought Meltdown. Speculative execution plus a cache side channel could leak data across the user and kernel boundary. Even if a user mode load from a kernel address would fault, the CPU might speculatively execute it and touch data that leaves a measurable cache trace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux’s defense on x86‑64 is Page Table Isolation which is PTI. Keep two views and switch between them on entry and exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: CR3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;CR3 holds the current page table root and on x86 switching it changes the active address space.&lt;lb/&gt;Tiny explainer: PTI&lt;lb/&gt;PTI keeps a reduced userspace view without normal kernel data mapped and a full kernel view used while in the kernel.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost. More page table switches, different TLB sharing behavior, and a small memory bump for extra top level tables and the per CPU entry area. With PCID Linux keeps separate TLB tags for the two views to reduce flushes. Some systems allow opting out with &lt;code&gt;nopti&lt;/code&gt; when acceptable. Default is on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: what Meltdown reads&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Permissions never turn off. The architectural access still faults. The leak is in transient speculation which leaves a timing trace.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How the kernel changes mappings safely&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Linux edits page tables the order is deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Handle cache rules first on architectures that need it.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Modify page tables by adding, removing, or changing PTEs.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Invalidate the TLB so the CPU forgets stale translations.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the hood are functions that match the granularity of the change like flush an address space, flush a range, or flush a single page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a parallel story for kernel only mappings made with &lt;code&gt;vmap&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;vmalloc&lt;/code&gt;. Before I/O the kernel flushes the vmap range so the physical page sees the latest bytes. After I/O it invalidates the vmap range so speculative reads do not go stale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;vmap&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;vmalloc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;APIs that create kernel virtual mappings to non contiguous physical pages for use inside the kernel.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On x86 you rarely think about the instruction cache because it is coherent with data stores. On others, copying code into executable memory requires an explicit instruction cache flush before running it. The VM has hooks like &lt;code&gt;copy_to_user_page&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;flush_icache_range&lt;/code&gt; where architectures do this housekeeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: icache flush&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Some CPUs need an instruction cache sync after writing new code so execution sees the new bytes.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A tiny x86 aside: stacks and calls, without the haze&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 64 bit mode registers wear an R. &lt;code&gt;RIP&lt;/code&gt; is the instruction pointer, &lt;code&gt;RSP&lt;/code&gt; is the stack, &lt;code&gt;RBP&lt;/code&gt; is the frame. The stack grows down. &lt;code&gt;push&lt;/code&gt; decrements &lt;code&gt;RSP&lt;/code&gt; and stores. &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt; loads then increments. &lt;code&gt;CALL&lt;/code&gt; pushes the return address and jumps. &lt;code&gt;RET&lt;/code&gt; pops it into &lt;code&gt;RIP&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Linux the System V AMD64 ABI passes the first arguments in registers which are &lt;code&gt;RDI&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RSI&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RDX&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RCX&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;R8&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;R9&lt;/code&gt; and returns values in &lt;code&gt;RAX&lt;/code&gt;. Large objects go by pointer. Your stack must be readable and writable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: System V AMD64 ABI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The calling convention for 64 bit Unix like systems on x86‑64 that defines where arguments and return values go.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;User code runs in ring 3. The kernel runs in ring 0. Crossings like syscalls, interrupts, and exceptions go through CPU defined gates. In 64 bit mode Linux uses a flat segmentation model and relies on paging for isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny explainer: rings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Rings are CPU privilege levels. Ring 3 is user mode. Ring 0 is kernel mode.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny note for ARM64 readers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The ideas like stack growth and user vs kernel separation are similar. Register names, calling conventions, and syscall entry differ.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When things go sideways (and what that usually means)&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;→&lt;code&gt;EINVAL&lt;/code&gt;often a misaligned file&lt;code&gt;offset&lt;/code&gt;which must be page aligned or an impossible flag combo&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;→&lt;code&gt;ENOMEM&lt;/code&gt;you may be out of virtual space or VMA count or you hit strict overcommit&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Store to a file mapping → &lt;code&gt;SIGBUS&lt;/code&gt;you walked past EOF. The VMA existed, the data did not&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;mprotect(PROT_EXEC)&lt;/code&gt;→&lt;code&gt;EACCES&lt;/code&gt;could be a&lt;code&gt;noexec&lt;/code&gt;mount or a W^X policy&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Big &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;creates a new line in&lt;code&gt;maps&lt;/code&gt;your allocator used&lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt;for that size&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;RSS balloons after &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt;copy on write did its job and you wrote to lots of shared pages&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Accidentally clobbered a mapping you probably used &lt;code&gt;MAP_FIXED&lt;/code&gt;. Prefer&lt;code&gt;MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE&lt;/code&gt;to fail instead of overwrite&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it is mysterious, look. Start friendly with &lt;code&gt;smaps_rollup&lt;/code&gt; for the big picture and &lt;code&gt;maps&lt;/code&gt; for shapes.

    &lt;p&gt;After eight glorious weeks of freedom, I got rehired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First thing I did was walk over to the machine shop to look for my F-150. The oil stain was there but the truck wasn’t. It wasn’t in the rock lot where the bulldozers parked either.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who would have stooped so low as to co-opt that piece of shit? It had no heat and no air-conditioning. The radio bubbled static. Door handles were missing. Floorboards, fenders, and frame all rusted and rotted. It certainly hadn’t been what could be called roadworthy. And, my God, the smell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I went into the machine shop. One of the welders lifted his hood and told me the bad news—they’d had to move the truck for a rebar delivery and the engine on that old thing finally blew, so the truck got dragged to the scrapyard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a dusty corner, I saw a pile of salvaged tools from the truck. I took some wrenches and my tape measure but didn’t see what I was really looking for—my Truck Desk®. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I caught a ride out to the unit with the foreman and the rest of the crew. Our goal for the day was to unbolt components from a heat exchanger and fly them off with a crane. Once the exchanger was apart and inspected, we’d begin our real repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The morning went well. The mornings always go well. Everybody knows what they’re doing. We’re professionals, equals. Same pay. Same benefits. All working together toward retirement. We look out for each other. Whoever has the hardest task in this crew today could be the foreman tomorrow, and vice versa. Nobody wants to be the boss, so our bosses are the best kind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first break we packed into our truck and drove shoulder-to-shoulder back to the trailer compound for coffee. During the five-minute drive, I couldn’t help but think how good I’d had it when I had the luxury of using that piece of shit F-150.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See, the truck nobody else wanted had been my office. I’d built a portable desk inside it. My truck desk, I called it. A couple of planks screwed together, our union sticker slapped on, the whole deal sealed with shellac. I’d built the desk so it slid into the bottom of the steering wheel and sat across the armrests. I used to hang back at the job and sneak in some creative work while the rest of the crew went to break. My desk—which I’d taken far too long to build and perfect through many prototypes—had been stowed behind the driver’s seat when the truck was hauled off by the wrecker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back at the break trailer, I took my old seat and joined in on the jokes, insults, tall tales. That trailer was, to me, the best place for storytelling in the world—but, as always, it was too loud, too raucous, too fun to do any writing or reading, which is all I ever want to do on break. At lunch, I retreated into the relative quiet of the machine shop. I sat down by the drill press and took out my cell phone and started writing. Just like I used to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For nearly two decades I’ve worked off and on at this petrochemical plant as a mechanic and welder. The union dispatched me here: When it gets slow, I get laid off; when work picks up, I boomerang back. And the whole time, I’ve written stories and parts of my novels during breaks—fifteen minutes for coffee and then half an hour for lunch. I’ve also made use of the heaven-sent delays brought on by lightning, severe rainstorms, evacuations, permitting problems, equipment issues, and so on. I’m thankful for each and every delay that happens on this construction site, and, believe me, there are many.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most artists I know are like this. Finding time to make art while working another job, or taking care of loved ones. They improvise. They get better. They get worse. They get better again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really it mostly comes down to that first thing: finding time. When I talk to people who want to find more time, I repeat something an old-timer said to me early on: “You’ve gotta make your own conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does that mean? Well. Is it raining? You can either stand out in the rain and get wet, or you can find a coil of tie-wire and hang up tarps for a hooch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s another expression I like, which goes: “Let your wallet be your guide.” I try to remember that every time I feel the urge to quit my job and never return.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So ever since cell phones got smart, I’ve sat somewhere quiet, semi-on-the-clock, texting myself poems, paragraphs that became stories and novels, and things about my life, or I should say just life, like this thing you’re reading right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Writing on my cell phone, pecking away, was good enough for many years, but then after a rightfully humbling decade of manual labor, I started having irrational fantasies about convenience and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course I have a desk in my apartment, but I couldn’t help myself. Somehow I’d gotten seduced by the prospect of attaining my very own cubicle amid this massive junkyard full of toxic waste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One day I walked into the payroll trailer where the secretaries and site manager sat. There wasn’t an explicit sign that said NO CONTRACTORS ALLOWED, but it was an unspoken rule. The trailer had a few unused old cubicles tucked to the side. I sat down in one and happily pecked away with my thumbs. Every break for a week I went in and worked on my writing. After a few days I started to feel like I should hang pictures of my mom and dad and my wife inside it. But I didn’t dare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then things really heated up. I brought in a Bluetooth keyboard and wrote a whole story that day on my breaks. There was no going back. My heart soared. I thought I should adopt a brown dog with a bandanna around his neck just so I could thumbtack his picture to the cubicle wall. I hadn’t interacted with any of the office staff, but they’d seen me. They’d followed my oily bootprints down the hallway and begun to leer. Who is this diesel-stinking contractor? He’s probably the one who’s been eating Janelle’s Oreos. He raided the mango-kiwi yogurt from the fridge. He glommed all the sporks. I knew my cubicle dreams were over the morning I found the site manager waiting in “my” cubicle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What are you doing here?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all my years working at that place, I’d never seen the site manager out on the site. I’m not sure he knew what it was or where it was. You went to him to order tools; he was the one who said no. I’d only ever seen him at a urinal or buying bacon and eggs off the lunch truck. But if I had ever seen him out on the site, it would have never occurred to me to ask him what he was doing there. He was wearing a blue polo shirt and khakis, and I was in his world—and he was asking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Office work,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What kind, exactly?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can you explain literary fiction to a site manager?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Little bit of everything,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started writing in the machine shop again. It wasn’t the same. Once I’d been infected by the cubicle virus, there was no going back. Out of scrap lumber I gathered from various dumpsters, I built a proper desk for myself in the northeast corner of the shop. That desk was a huge leap forward in possibility and productivity. In the evenings, if I wrote something by hand or on my typewriter at home, I could now use my time at work to retype it at my shop desk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shop desk was not ideal. Some days I arrived to find someone had disassembled a small motor on top of it, gaskets and hardware spread out on newspaper. Other times I found pneumatic guns taken apart, or electrical devices with wiring splayed in a colorful tangle, or—fair enough—important blueprints laid out the entire length of the desk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right around this time I first saw the F-150. One of the workers had abandoned it by the shop. I put a battery in. That lasted one shift. Then I took an alternator out of another junk truck and, lo and behold, I had my own four wheels. The fan belt screamed. The engine smoked. The brakes worked when they wanted to. It was mine that whole dangerous year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, one day, my luck changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A crate full of chain falls got delivered. It was a glorious crate, made of sanded spruce. I unscrewed some of the planking and built my first Truck Desk prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was made of three boards cut at twenty-four inches. Light and compact. Sealed with shellac. It slid into the bottom of the steering wheel, one side supported by a curved rebar I welded into a nut that fit exactly in a recess on the driver’s door. The center console supported the other side of the desk. I kept it stored behind the seat. Whenever break time came and the crew drove back to the trailer compound, I stayed parked on the unit and got at least ten extra minutes to write.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that I had my Truck Desk, that vehicle was my very own rolling cubicle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having that truck reminded me of when I lived on 173rd Street in New York City. Back then I used to drive around endlessly looking for street parking. I would see men and women sitting in their cars. They weren’t leaving, though; they were reading a book or a magazine, smoking cigarettes, playing Sudoku, scribbling love letters. They were the wisest men and women in the entire city, using their vehicles as a kind of office down on the street, a sanctuary where they could do their real work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the F-150 was scrapped, I never got a replacement truck. I never found that first Truck Desk either, even when I called the scrapyard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I did do, though, was go over to the carpenter’s side of the shop and cut a scaffold plank at twenty-nine inches. This simple plank fits across the armrests of whatever Chevy or Ford pickup the crew has that day. This dramatic redesign of Truck Desk into Truck Plank® took all of ten seconds. I didn’t bother with the sticker or shellac.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The years on the job have rolled on. Now editors send me Word documents with comments and questions and tracked changes. I bring my backpack to work with my laptop inside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every morning, when I find out what crew I’m in, I bring that plank with me. I stick it on the dashboard and climb into the driver’s seat. I drive us all out to the job and at break time I take them to the trailer. I clean my hands with pumice wipes and sit alone in whoever’s truck it is that day, pulling the plank off the dashboard and setting it across the armrests. Within a minute or so, I’ve got the laptop out and I’m working. If somebody from the crew is still in the back seat, bandanna over their eyes, snoozing, I do my best to keep extra quiet. And if they begin to snore, I don’t let that bother me at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest lessons I learned early in my career was from Drew DeVault at Linode, 10 years ago. He was one of the youngest developers in the company (only I was younger, at 20, at the time) but he cared really strongly about thinking through architecture and code decisions when the culture at the time was, and I love those guys, a little haphazard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drew had no special position. We all had the same title, "Developer". But he argued so persuasively and so doggedly even when the entire organization seemed against him and somehow he eventually transformed the entire engineering organization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's supposed to be impossible! It was entirely new to me. That you don't need to wait behind people with more experience to make the right decision. That you can be part of making the right decision if you can find the logic and the will to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It isn't that simple of course. Politics is politics. But there are plenty of companies with people who will make a good faith effort to do what makes sense but might, without someone's unasked-for effort, do not what makes sense but what is popular because what's popular just kinda seems easiest. And I always like working for these companies, and for the most part have been able to identify them during the interview process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I learned from Drew to put limited value in seniority. I learned that it's ok to debate. I learned to be prepared and to try to present the facts. I learned to be persistent when I wanted change. I learned that with these skills, it's possible for an individual to redirect the path of an organization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took a while longer (and me driving one or two people on my team to quit, to my great regret) to learn when to do these things and when to let things go. Still, this lesson from Drew on what's possible always stands out in my memory. Thank you, Drew.&lt;/p&gt;
