  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2024, Apple signed a deal with Taboola to serve ads in its app, notably Apple News. John Gruber, writing in Daring Fireball said at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If you told me that the ads in Apple News have been sold by Taboola for the last few years, I’d have said, “Oh, that makes sense.” Because the ads in Apple News — at least the ones I see1 — already look like chumbox Taboola ads. Even worse, they’re incredibly repetitious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use Apple News to keep up on topics that I don’t find in sources I pay for (The Guardian and The New York Times). But there’s no way I’m going to pay the exorbitant price Apple wants for Apple News+ – £13 – because, while you get more publications, you still get ads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And those ads have gotten worse recently. Many if not most of them look like and probably are scams. Here are a few examples from Apple News today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are three ads that are scammy; the first two were clearly generated by AI, and the third may have been created by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why are they scams? When I searched domain information for the domains, I found that they were registered very recently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Domain Name: MUSTYLEVO.COM&lt;lb/&gt; Registry Domain ID: 3059688301_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.gname.com&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar URL: http://www.gname.com&lt;lb/&gt; Updated Date: 2026-02-04T07:23:58Z&lt;lb/&gt; Creation Date: 2026-01-21T07:23:43Z&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Domain Name: SOLVERACO.COM&lt;lb/&gt; Registry Domain ID: 3045027870_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar WHOIS Server: grs-whois.hichina.com&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar URL: http://wanwang.aliyun.com&lt;lb/&gt; Updated Date: 2025-12-05T06:10:51Z&lt;lb/&gt; Creation Date: 2025-12-05T06:07:40Z&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Domain Name: SHIYAATELIER.COM&lt;lb/&gt; Registry Domain ID: 3037972202_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.name.com&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar URL: http://www.name.com&lt;lb/&gt; Updated Date: 2025-11-12T06:47:14Z&lt;lb/&gt; Creation Date: 2025-11-12T06:47:13Z&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This recent registration doesn’t necessarily mean they are scams, but they don’t inspire much confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s one example. This ad from Tidenox, whose website says I am retiring, showing a photo of an elderly woman, who says, “For 26 years, Tidenox has been port of your journey in creating earth and comfort at home.” The image of the retiring owner is probably made by AI. (Update: someone on Hacker News pointed out the partly masked Google Gemini logo on the bottom right. I hadn’t spotted that, in part because I don’t use any AI image generation tools.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These fake “going out of business ads” have been around for a few years, and even the US Better Business Bureau warns about them, as they take peoples’ money then shut down. Does Apple care? Does Taboola care? Does Apple care that Taboola serves ads like this? My guess: no, no, and no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note the registration date for the tidenox.com domain. It’s nowhere near 26 years old, and it’s registered in China:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Domain Name: TIDENOX.COM&lt;lb/&gt; Registry Domain ID: 2987356919_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar WHOIS Server: grs-whois.hichina.com&lt;lb/&gt; Registrar URL: http://wanwang.aliyun.com&lt;lb/&gt; Updated Date: 2025-05-29T09:17:31Z&lt;lb/&gt; Creation Date: 2025-05-29T09:14:35Z&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shame on Apple for creating a honeypot for scam ads in what they consider to be a premium news service. This company cannot be trusted with ads in its products any more.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;A security-focused library OS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project is currently actively evolving and improving. While we are working toward a stable release, some APIs and interfaces may change as the design continues to mature. You are welcome to explore and experiment, but if you need long-term stability, it may be best to wait for a stable release, or be prepared to adapt to updates along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LiteBox is a sandboxing library OS that drastically cuts down the interface to the host, thereby reducing attack surface. It focuses on easy interop of various "North" shims and "South" platforms. LiteBox is designed for usage in both kernel and non-kernel scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LiteBox exposes a Rust-y &lt;code&gt;nix&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;rustix&lt;/code&gt;-inspired "North" interface when it is provided a &lt;code&gt;Platform&lt;/code&gt; interface at its "South".  These interfaces allow for a wide variety of use-cases, easily allowing for connection between any of the North--South pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example use cases include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Running unmodified Linux programs on Windows&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Sandboxing Linux applications on Linux&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run programs on top of SEV SNP&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Running OP-TEE programs on Linux&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Running on LVBS&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;An Update on Heroku&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Last Updated: February 06, 2026&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, Heroku is transitioning to a sustaining engineering model focused on stability, security, reliability, and support. Heroku remains an actively supported, production-ready platform, with an emphasis on maintaining quality and operational excellence rather than introducing new features. We know changes like this can raise questions, and we want to be clear about what this means for customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no change for customers using Heroku today. Customers who pay via credit card in the Heroku dashboard—both existing and new—can continue to use Heroku with no changes to pricing, billing, service, or day-to-day usage. Core platform functionality, including applications, pipelines, teams, and add-ons, is unaffected, and customers can continue to rely on Heroku for their production, business-critical workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enterprise Account contracts will no longer be offered to new customers. Existing Enterprise subscriptions and support contracts will continue to be fully honored and may renew as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why this change&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re focusing our product and engineering investments on areas where we can deliver the greatest long-term customer value, including helping organizations build and deploy enterprise-grade AI in a secure and trusted way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Waymo World Model: A New Frontier For Autonomous Driving Simulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Waymo Driver has traveled nearly 200 million fully autonomous miles, becoming a vital part of the urban fabric in major U.S. cities and improving road safety. What riders and local communities don’t see is our Driver navigating billions of miles in virtual worlds, mastering complex scenarios long before it encounters them on public roads. Today, we are excited to introduce the Waymo World Model, a frontier generative model that sets a new bar for large-scale, hyper-realistic autonomous driving simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simulation is a critical component of Waymo’s AI ecosystem and one of the three key pillars of our approach to demonstrably safe AI. The Waymo World Model, which we detail below, is the component that is responsible for generating hyper-realistic simulated environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Waymo World Model is built upon Genie 3—Google DeepMind's most advanced general-purpose world model that generates photorealistic and interactive 3D environments—and is adapted for the rigors of the driving domain. By leveraging Genie’s immense world knowledge, it can simulate exceedingly rare events—from a tornado to a casual encounter with an elephant—that are almost impossible to capture at scale in reality. The model’s architecture offers high controllability, allowing our engineers to modify simulations with simple language prompts, driving inputs, and scene layouts. Notably, the Waymo World Model generates high-fidelity, multi-sensor outputs that include both camera and lidar data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This combination of broad world knowledge, fine-grained controllability, and multi-modal realism enhances Waymo’s ability to safely scale our service across more places and new driving environments. In the following sections we showcase the Waymo World Model in action, featuring simulations of the Waymo Driver navigating diverse rare edge-case scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🌎 Emergent Multimodal World Knowledge&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most simulation models in the autonomous driving industry are trained from scratch based on only the on-road data they collect. That approach means the system only learns from limited experience. Genie 3’s strong world knowledge, gained from its pre-training on an extremely large and diverse set of videos, allows us to explore situations that were never directly observed by our fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through our specialized post-training, we are transferring that vast world knowledge from 2D video into 3D lidar outputs unique to Waymo’s hardware suite. While cameras excel at depicting visual details, lidar sensors provide valuable complementary signals like precise depth. The Waymo World Model can generate virtually any scene—from regular, day-to-day driving to rare, long-tail scenarios—across multiple sensor modalities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;🌪️ Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;💥 Rare and safety-critical events&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;🐘 Long-tail (pun intended!) objects and more&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the interactive viewers below, you can immersively view the realistic 4D point clouds generated by the Waymo World Model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🕹️ Strong Simulation Controllability&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Waymo World Model offers strong simulation controllability through three main mechanisms: driving action control, scene layout control, and language control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Driving action control allows us to have a responsive simulator that adheres to specific driving inputs. This enables us to simulate “what if” counterfactual events such as whether the Waymo Driver could have safely driven more confidently instead of yielding in a particular situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Counterfactual driving. We demonstrate simulations both under the original route in a past recorded drive, or a completely new route. While purely reconstructive simulation methods (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splats, or 3DGS) suffer from visual breakdowns due to missing observations when the simulated route is too different from the original driving, the fully learned Waymo World Model maintains good realism and consistency thanks to its strong generative capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scene layout control allows for customization of the road layouts, traffic signal states, and the behavior of other road users. This way, we can create custom scenarios via selective placement of other road users, or applying custom mutations to road layouts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scene layout conditioning following&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Language control is our most flexible tool that allows us to adjust time-of-day, weather conditions, or even generate an entirely synthetic scene (such as the long-tail scenarios shown previously).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;World Mutation - Time of Day&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;World Mutation - Weather&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;🎞️ Converting Dashcam Videos&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During a scenic drive, it is common to record videos of the journey on mobile devices or dashcams, perhaps capturing piled up snow banks or a highway at sunset. The Waymo World Model can convert those kinds of videos, or any taken with a regular camera, into a multimodal simulation—showing how the Waymo Driver would see that exact scene. This process enables the highest degree of realism and factuality, since simulations are derived from actual footage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;⚙️ Scalable Inference&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some scenes we want to simulate may take longer to play out, for example, negotiating passage in a narrow lane. That’s harder to do because the longer the simulation, the tougher it is to compute and maintain stable quality. However, through a more efficient variant of the Waymo World Model, we can simulate longer scenes with dramatic reduction in compute while maintaining high realism and fidelity to enable large-scale simulations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;🚀 Long rollout (4x speed playback) on an efficient variant of the Waymo World Model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By simulating the “impossible”, we proactively prepare the Waymo Driver for some of the most rare and complex scenarios. This creates a more rigorous safety benchmark, ensuring the Waymo Driver can navigate long-tail challenges long before it encounters them in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Blog post • 7 min read&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I Spent 5 Years in DevOps. Solutions Engineering Gave Me What I Was Missing.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Published on&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was good at DevOps. This isn't a story about escaping a job I hated. I spent five years as a DevSecOps engineer at two large financial services companies. I built things I was proud of. I learned a ton. I was respected by my team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But somewhere around year four, something shifted. The work didn't change. I did. After five years, I made a change that surprised everyone who knew me: I left for a sales-adjacent role. Today, I'm one year into working as a Solutions Engineer at Infisical, and I want to share what I've learned. I think there are other DevOps engineers out there who might be feeling the same thing I felt, even if they can't quite name it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What I Was Actually Missing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a long time, I couldn't pinpoint what was wrong. The job was fine. I was good at it. But I started dreading the monotony of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part of it was repetition. My days had become predictable: check the dashboards, respond to tickets, debug whatever broke overnight, push some Terraform, go home. Maintain the HashiCorp Vault clusters, manage the secrets pipelines, answer the same support questions. Repeat. The work that used to feel engaging had become routine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part of it was stagnation. When I first started, I was learning constantly. Vault architecture, PKI fundamentals, secrets rotation, the politics of platform adoption in a large enterprise. But once I'd mastered the core toolset and codebase, the learning curve flattened. I wasn't being challenged anymore. I was just keeping things running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And part of it was isolation. Most days, it was just me and my pipelines. My primary relationships were with CI/CD tools and YAML files. The humans I did interact with were usually frustrated. They needed something from me, or something I owned was blocking them. I missed working with people, not just unblocking them from behind a ticket queue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't have a word for what I was looking for. I just knew that what I was doing wasn't it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Discovering a Role I Didn't Know Existed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had no idea Solutions Engineering was a real career path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I knew sales existed. I vaguely knew there were "technical sales" people. But I assumed those were salespeople who'd learned enough technical vocabulary to get by, not engineers who actually stayed technical while working with customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some friends in sales pointed it out to me. They'd watched me get animated whenever someone asked how something worked, and one of them eventually said: "You know there's a job where you explain technical stuff to people all day and help them solve problems, right?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd never considered anything sales-adjacent because I assumed it meant leaving the technical world. But the more I learned about SE, the more I realized it might solve everything I was missing. New problems to solve every day. Constant learning. And more people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ended up joining Infisical. There's some irony there: I spent years managing HashiCorp Vault, and now I work for a Vault competitor. But that background is exactly why the role made sense. I knew the space. I knew the pain points. I knew what it felt like to be the engineer on the other side, evaluating these tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;One Year In: What Actually Changed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The biggest change is the simplest one: I talk to people now. A lot of people. Every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a single week, I might have a discovery call with a fintech startup, demo to a platform team at an aerospace company, help a healthcare organization troubleshoot their Kubernetes deployment, and run a workshop for a manufacturing company's security team. Fintech to aerospace to healthcare to manufacturing, all with completely different stacks and problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it's not all over Zoom. I get to visit customers on-site, sit down with their teams face to face, and actually understand how they work. Over time, you build real relationships with these people. You become their trusted technical advisor, not just a vendor they talk to once. That's something I never experienced in DevOps, where my "customers" were internal teams who mostly just wanted me to unblock them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The contrast with my DevOps days is stark. Monday morning used to mean checking dashboards, then the ticket queue, then the same Slack questions I'd answered last week. Now Monday morning might mean prepping for a demo with a company I've never spoken to, or helping a long-time customer work through a new challenge. I genuinely don't know what most days will look like until they start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing I didn't expect: I'm not just talking to customers. I've become a bridge between the people using our product and the people building it. Every customer conversation surfaces pain points, feature gaps, edge cases our docs don't cover. I take that back to engineering and product. I'm actually influencing what we build next, which is something I never had in DevOps. I was always downstream of decisions, not shaping them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Superpower I Didn't Know I Had&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My biggest fear going in was that I'd lose my technical edge. That I'd become "the sales guy" and slowly forget how things actually worked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That didn't happen. As an SE, I'm exposed to everything. Customers running Kubernetes, ECS, Lambda, bare metal, air-gapped environments. AWS, Azure, GCP, hybrid setups. CI/CD in Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab, CircleCI. I have to understand their environment well enough to actually help them, so the learning is constant. The stagnation I felt in DevOps? Gone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But all those years in DevOps weren't just background. They're the reason I'm useful in this role.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I get on calls and prospects describe problems I've literally lived. They talk about the pain of managing secrets at scale, and I can say "yeah, I've been there" and actually mean it. That shared experience changes the dynamic completely. I'm not a salesperson trying to manufacture urgency. I'm an engineer who dealt with the same problems and found something that helped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it all upside? No. Demoing is a skill I had to build from scratch. The context-switching is intense. The stress is different, more human, more ambiguous. But it's the kind of challenge that makes me better, not the kind that grinds me down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who This Might Be For&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This path isn't for everyone. If you love going deep on a single system and optimizing it over years, SE might feel too scattered. If you genuinely prefer working alone with your tools, the constant human interaction might drain you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But if any of this resonates, if you're good at DevOps but feel stuck, if the work has become repetitive, if you miss collaborating with people, if you find yourself energized when explaining technical concepts or helping someone work through a problem, Solutions Engineering might be worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't know this role existed until someone pointed it out to me. Now, one year in, I can't imagine going back. Not because DevOps is bad. It's critical work, and the people who do it well deserve more credit than they get.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for me, it was missing something I didn't know how to name until I found it: the chance to be technical and connected. To keep learning, to solve new problems every day, and to do it alongside people instead of behind a queue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're a DevOps engineer feeling something similar, even if you can't quite articulate it, maybe this is what you're looking for too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't know this role existed until someone pointed it out to me. Consider this me pointing it out to you. We're hiring at Infisical.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1 Establish a Clear Vision&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are a human, you know how this world behaves, how your team and colleagues behave, and what your users expect. You have experienced the world, and you want to work together with a system that has no experience in this world you live in. Every decision in your project that you don’t take and document will be taken for you by the AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your responsibility of delivering quality code cannot be met if not even you know where long-lasting and difficult-to-change decisions are taken.&lt;lb/&gt;You must know what parts of your code need to be thought through and what must be vigorously tested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think about and discuss the architecture, interfaces, data structures, and algorithms you want to use. Think about how to test and validate your code to these specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2 Maintain Precise documentation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need to communicate to the AI in detail what you want to achieve, otherwise it will result in code that is unusable for your purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other developers also need to communicate this information to the AI. That makes it efficient to write as much documentation as practical in a standardized format and into the code repository itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Document the requirements, specifications, constraints, and architecture of your project in detail.&lt;lb/&gt;Document your coding standards, best practices, and design patterns.&lt;lb/&gt;Use flowcharts, UML diagrams, and other visual aids to communicate complex structures and workflows.&lt;lb/&gt;Write pseudocode for complex algorithms and logic to guide the AI in understanding your intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3 Build debug systems that aid the AI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop efficient debug systems for the AI to use, reducing the need for multiple expensive CLI commands or browsers to verify code functionality. This will save time and resources while simplifying the process for the AI to identify and resolve code issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example: Build a system that collects logs from all nodes in a distributed system and provides abstracted information like “The Data was send to all nodes”, “The Data X is saved on Node 1 but not on Node 2”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4 Mark code review levels&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not all code is equally important. Some parts of your codebase are critical and need to be reviewed with extra care. Other parts are less important and can be generated with less oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use a system that allows you to mark how thoroughly each function has been reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example you can use a prompt that will let the AI put the comment &lt;code&gt;//A&lt;/code&gt; behind functions it wrote to indicate that the function has been written by an AI and is not yet reviewed by a human.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;5 Write high level specifications and test by yourself&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AIs will cheat and use shortcuts eventually. They will write mocks, stubs, and hard coded values to make the code tests succeed while the code itself is not working and most of the time dangerous. Often AIs will adapt or outright delete test code to let the code pass tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You must discourage this behavior by writing property based high level specification tests yourself. Build them in a way that makes it hard for the AI to cheat without having big code segments dedicated to it.&lt;lb/&gt;For example, use property based testing, restart the server and check in between if the database has the correct values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Separate these test so the AI cannot edit them and prompt the AI not to change them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;6 Write interface tests in a separate context&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let an AI write property based interface tests for the expected behavior with as little context of the rest of the code as possible.&lt;lb/&gt;This will generate tests that are uninfluenced by the “implementation AI” which will prevent the tests from being adapted to the implementation in a way that makes them useless or less effective.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Separate these tests so the AI cannot edit them without approval and prompt the AI not to change them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;7 Use strict linting and formatting rules&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use strict linting and formatting rules to ensure code quality and consistency. This will help you and your AI to find issues early.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;8 Use context specific coding agent prompts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Save time and money by utilizing path specific coding agent prompts like CLAUDE.md.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can generate them automatically which will give your AI information it would otherwise as to create from scratch every time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try to provide as much high level information as practical, such as coding standards, best practices, design patterns, and specific requirements for the project. This will help the AI to generate code that is more aligned with your expectations and will reduce lookup time and cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;9 Find and mark functions that have a high security risk&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identify and mark functions that have a high security risk, such as authentication, authorization, and data handling. These functions should be reviewed and tested with extra care and in such a way that a human has comprehended the logic of the function in all its dimensions and is confident about its correctness and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make this explicit with a comment like &lt;code&gt;//HIGH-RISK-UNREVIEWED&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;//HIGH-RISK-REVIEWED&lt;/code&gt; to make sure that other developers are aware of the importance of these functions and will review them with extra care.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure that the AI is instructed to change the review state of these functions as soon as it changes a single character in the function.&lt;lb/&gt;Developers must make sure that the status of these functions is always correct.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;10 Reduce code complexity where possible&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aim to reduce the complexity of the generated code where possible. Each single line of code will eat up your context window and make it harder for the AI and You to keep track of the overall logic of your code.&lt;lb/&gt;Each avoidable line of code is costing energy, money and probability of future unsuccessful AI tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;11 Explore problems with experiments and prototypes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI written code is cheap, use this to your advantage by exploring different solutions to a problem with experiments and prototypes with minimal specifications. This will allow you to find the best solution to a problem without investing too much time and resources in a single solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;12 Do not generate blindly or to much complexity at once&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable tasks for the AI. Instead of asking the AI to generate the complete project or component at once, break it down into smaller tasks, such as generating individual functions or classes. This will help you to maintain control over the code and it’s logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have to check each component or module for its adherence to the specifications and requirements.&lt;lb/&gt;If you have lost the overview of the complexity and inner workings of the code, you have lost control over your code and must restart from a state where you were in control of your code.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a tool that encrypts files and splits the decryption key among trusted friends using Shamir's Secret Sharing. For example, you can give pieces to 5 friends and require any 3 of them to cooperate to recover the key. No single friend can access your data alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each friend receives a self-contained bundle with &lt;code&gt;recover.html&lt;/code&gt;—a browser-based tool that works
        offline, with no servers or internet required. If this website disappears, recovery still works.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your file is encrypted, the key is split into shares, and friends combine shares to recover it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Your File → Encrypt → Split key into 5 shares → Distribute to friends&lt;lb/&gt; ↓&lt;lb/&gt; Any 3 friends → Combine shares → Decrypt → File recovered &lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;bundle-alice/recover.html&lt;/code&gt; in your browser&lt;p&gt;This is the best way to understand what your friends would experience during a real recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted a way to ensure trusted friends could access important files if something happened to me—without trusting any single person or service with everything. Shamir's Secret Sharing seemed like the right approach, but I couldn't find a tool that gave friends a simple, self-contained way to recover files together. So I built one. I'm sharing it in case it's useful to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;User Stories&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What designers and product managers like you have to say&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;âAs someone who often jumps into design work, Vecti is a game-changer. I can quickly mock up interfaces, share them with my team for feedback, and export clean assets, all without leaving my flow.â&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;âI finally found a design tool where I can collaborate seamlessly with developers and stakeholders. No more endless email threads. The permission controls and presentation mode have completely transformed how I run design reviews.â&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;âVecti's interface felt instantly familiar, but the performance with my massive design system? Night and day difference. I'm never going back.â&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h5"&gt;About&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Our Story&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;After nearly two decades in UI and design, I saw an opportunity to build something different, a design tool with a better philosophy. So I built it. Vecti is a browser-based UI design tool built from the ground up with one core belief, that creators deserve tools built specifically for them. Better performance, better privacy, and better alignment with their actual needs. A tool that just works, built by someone who genuinely cares about the people using it.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Serge @ Vecti&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Founder&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To give designers and developers a design tool they can trust. We prioritize performance, privacy, and creative freedom. Vecti is built and based in the EU, following European privacy standards. We're transparent about how we operate. Design software should serve creators first - that's our commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our Vision&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A world where design tools are built with the community, not imposed on them. Where solo creators and small teams have access to professional-grade software that respects them. We're building Vecti to be that tool-performant, transparent, and genuinely aligned with the people who use it every day. This is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experimental - This project is still in development, and not ready for the prime time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A minimal, secure Python interpreter written in Rust for use by AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monty avoids the cost, latency, complexity and general faff of using a full container based sandbox for running LLM generated code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, it lets you safely run Python code written by an LLM embedded in your agent, with startup times measured in single digit microseconds not hundreds of milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Monty can do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run a reasonable subset of Python code - enough for your agent to express what it wants to do&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Completely block access to the host environment: filesystem, env variables and network access are all implemented via external function calls the developer can control&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Call functions on the host - only functions you give it access to&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run typechecking - monty supports full modern python type hints and comes with ty included in a single binary to run typechecking&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Be snapshotted to bytes at external function calls, meaning you can store the interpreter state in a file or database, and resume later&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Startup extremely fast (&amp;lt;1μs to go from code to execution result), and has runtime performance that is similar to CPython (generally between 5x faster and 5x slower)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Be called from Rust, Python, or Javascript - because Monty has no dependencies on cpython, you can use it anywhere you can run Rust&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Control resource usage - Monty can track memory usage, allocations, stack depth, and execution time and cancel execution if it exceeds preset limits&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Collect stdout and stderr and return it to the caller&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run async or sync code on the host via async or sync code on the host&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Monty cannot do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use the standard library (except a few select modules: &lt;code&gt;sys&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;typing&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;asyncio&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;dataclasses&lt;/code&gt;(soon),&lt;code&gt;json&lt;/code&gt;(soon))&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use third party libraries (like Pydantic), support for external python library is not a goal&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;define classes (support should come soon)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;use match statements (again, support should come soon)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, Monty is extremely limited and designed for one use case:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To run code written by agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For motivation on why you might want to do this, see:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Codemode from Cloudflare&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Programmatic Tool Calling from Anthropic&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code Execution with MCP from Anthropic&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Smol Agents from Hugging Face&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In very simple terms, the idea of all the above is that LLMs can work faster, cheaper and more reliably if they're asked to write Python (or Javascript) code, instead of relying on traditional tool calling. Monty makes that possible without the complexity of a sandbox or risk of running code directly on the host.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: Monty will (soon) be used to implement &lt;code&gt;codemode&lt;/code&gt; in Pydantic AI&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monty can be called from Python, JavaScript/TypeScript or Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To install:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uv add pydantic-monty&lt;/code&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;start()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;resume()&lt;/code&gt; to handle external function calls iteratively,
giving you control over each call:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import pydantic_monty

code = """
data = fetch(url)
len(data)
"""

m = pydantic_monty.Monty(code, inputs=['url'], external_functions=['fetch'])

# Start execution - pauses when fetch() is called
result = m.start(inputs={'url': 'https://example.com'})

print(type(result))
#&amp;gt; &amp;lt;class 'pydantic_monty.MontySnapshot'&amp;gt;
print(result.function_name)  # fetch
#&amp;gt; fetch
print(result.args)
#&amp;gt; ('https://example.com',)

# Perform the actual fetch, then resume with the result
result = result.resume(return_value='hello world')

print(type(result))
#&amp;gt; &amp;lt;class 'pydantic_monty.MontyComplete'&amp;gt;
print(result.output)
#&amp;gt; 11&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both &lt;code&gt;Monty&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MontySnapshot&lt;/code&gt; can be serialized to bytes and restored later.
This allows caching parsed code or suspending execution across process boundaries:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import pydantic_monty

# Serialize parsed code to avoid re-parsing
m = pydantic_monty.Monty('x + 1', inputs=['x'])
data = m.dump()

# Later, restore and run
m2 = pydantic_monty.Monty.load(data)
print(m2.run(inputs={'x': 41}))
#&amp;gt; 42

# Serialize execution state mid-flight
m = pydantic_monty.Monty('fetch(url)', inputs=['url'], external_functions=['fetch'])
progress = m.start(inputs={'url': 'https://example.com'})
state = progress.dump()

# Later, restore and resume (e.g., in a different process)
progress2 = pydantic_monty.MontySnapshot.load(state)
result = progress2.resume(return_value='response data')
print(result.output)
#&amp;gt; response data&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;use monty::{MontyRun, MontyObject, NoLimitTracker, StdPrint};

let code = r#"

    if n &amp;lt;= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)

let runner = MontyRun::new(code.to_owned(), "fib.py", vec!["x".to_owned()], vec![]).unwrap();
let result = runner.run(vec![MontyObject::Int(10)], NoLimitTracker, &amp;amp;mut StdPrint).unwrap();
assert_eq!(result, MontyObject::Int(55));&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MontyRun&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RunProgress&lt;/code&gt; can be serialized using the &lt;code&gt;dump()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;load()&lt;/code&gt; methods:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;use monty::{MontyRun, MontyObject, NoLimitTracker, StdPrint};

// Serialize parsed code
let runner = MontyRun::new("x + 1".to_owned(), "main.py", vec!["x".to_owned()], vec![]).unwrap();
let bytes = runner.dump().unwrap();

// Later, restore and run
let runner2 = MontyRun::load(&amp;amp;bytes).unwrap();
let result = runner2.run(vec![MontyObject::Int(41)], NoLimitTracker, &amp;amp;mut StdPrint).unwrap();
assert_eq!(result, MontyObject::Int(42));&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monty will power code-mode in Pydantic AI. Instead of making sequential tool calls, the LLM writes Python code that calls your tools as functions and Monty executes it safely.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are generally two responses when you show people Monty:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Oh my god, this solves so many problems, I want it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Why not X?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where X is some alternative technology. Oddly often these responses are combined, suggesting people have not yet found an alternative that works for them, but are incredulous that there's really no good alternative to creating an entire Python implementation from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll try to run through the most obvious alternatives, and why there aren't right for what we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE: all these technologies are impressive and have widespread uses, this commentary on their limitations for our use case should not be seen as a criticism. Most of these solutions were not conceived with the goal of providing an LLM sandbox, which is why they're not necessary great at it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;See ./scripts/startup_performance.py for the script used to calculate the startup performance numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Details on each row below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Language completeness: No classes (yet), limited stdlib, no third-party libraries&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Security: Explicitly controlled filesystem, network, and env access, strict limits on execution time and memory usage&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start latency: Starts in microseconds&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Setup complexity: just &lt;code&gt;pip install pydantic-monty&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;npm install @pydantic/monty&lt;/code&gt;, ~4.5MB download&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File mounting: Strictly controlled, see #85&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Snapshotting: Monty's pause and resume functionality with &lt;code&gt;dump()&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;load()&lt;/code&gt;makes it trivial to pause, resume and fork execution&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Language completeness: Full CPython with any library&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Security: Process and filesystem isolation, network policies, but container escapes exist, memory limitation is possible&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start latency: Container startup overhead (~195ms measured)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Setup complexity: Requires Docker daemon, container images, orchestration, &lt;code&gt;python:3.14-alpine&lt;/code&gt;is 50MB - docker can't be installed from PyPI&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File mounting: Volume mounts work well&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Snapshotting: Possible with durable execution solutions like Temporal, or snapshotting an image and saving it as a Docker image.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Language completeness: Full CPython compiled to WASM, almost all libraries available&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Security: Relies on browser/WASM sandbox - not designed for server-side isolation, python code can run arbitrary code in the JS runtime, only deno allows isolation, memory limits are hard/impossible to enforce with deno&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start latency: WASM runtime loading is slow (~2800ms cold start)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Setup complexity: Need to load WASM runtime, handle async initialization, pyodide NPM package is ~12MB, deno is ~50MB - Pyodide can't be called with just PyPI packages&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File mounting: Virtual filesystem via browser APIs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Snapshotting: Possible with durable execution solutions like Temporal presumably, but hard&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See starlark-rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Language completeness: Configuration language, not Python - no classes, exceptions, async&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Security: Deterministic and hermetic by design&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start latency: runs embedded in the process like Monty, hence impressive startup time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Setup complexity: Usable in python via starlark-pyo3&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File mounting: No file handling by design AFAIK?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Snapshotting: Impossible AFAIK?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Services like Daytona, E2B, Modal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are similar challenges, more setup complexity but lower network latency for setting up your own sandbox setup with k8s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Language completeness: Full CPython with any library&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Security: Professionally managed container isolation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start latency: Network round-trip and container startup time. I got ~1s cold start time with Daytona EU from London, Daytona advertise sub 90ms latency, presumably that's for an existing container, not clear if it includes network latency&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cost: Pay per execution or compute time&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Setup complexity: API integration, auth tokens - fine for startups but generally a non-start for enterprises&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File mounting: Upload/download via API calls&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Snapshotting: Possible with durable execution solutions like Temporal, also the services offer some solutions for this, I think based con docker containers&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running Python directly via &lt;code&gt;exec()&lt;/code&gt; (~0.1ms) or subprocess (~30ms).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Language completeness: Full CPython with any library&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Security: None - full filesystem, network, env vars, system commands&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Start latency: Near-zero for &lt;code&gt;exec()&lt;/code&gt;, ~30ms for subprocess&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Setup complexity: None&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;File mounting: Direct filesystem access (that's the problem)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Snapshotting: Possible with durable execution solutions like Temporal&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a demo for how you can turn an ESP32-S3 microcontroller into a tiny instant-on PC with its own shell, editor, compiler, and online apps installer. Something like Raspberry Pi, minus the overhead of a full server/desktop grade OS. I think ESP32 is underrated in hobby maker community for this PC-like use case. This demo uses BreezyBox, my mini-shell ESP-IDF component.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First of all, seeing is believing (click to watch the video):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It started as a "cyberdeck" style crafting project. Then I got carried away with the software part. I chose ESP32-S3 for the base platform. It has the nostalgic appeal of the DOS era PCs, with similar resources, and elbow-deep-in-bytes coding experience, plus modern wireless comms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;ESP32-S3 can do everything those PCs did and more, but that is inconvenient out of the box, because that is not the commercial use case it is positioned for. It also forces away the code bloat. If you are like me, and love small elegant things, and technology that punches way above its weight, you ought to try it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So anyway, I decided to try and package some key missing parts: a basic vterm, the current working directory (CWD) tracking, a few familiar UNIX-like commands, and an app installer. Believe it or not, the rest is already there in ESP-IDF components, including the elf_loader with dynamic linking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is called "BreezyBox", by analogy with the BusyBox commands suite. The name is just a light joke, it is not meant to be a full clone. You can import it with one command in your ESP-IDF project, and if you have some stdio going, even at "Hello World" level, it should mostly just work. I call it a "mini shell", a naïve user might call it an OS (it is not, it runs on FreeRTOS), and you can also call it the userland layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The BreezyBox component leaves the display and other board configuration details to the user's firmware project, providing mainly the vterm/vfs features, and some shell commands. This particular example/demo project supports only one specific dev board: Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7B (no affiliation). But you can see how all the parts connect, and adapt it to your display/board, or just copy some code snippets from here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suggest just fork it, clone it, and try to make it work on your board. Mine was about 40€; you can start with some random $10 two inch LCD S3 dev board if you like. Hint: LVGL text label control is the easiest path to stdout on LCD that works almost everywhere. You can also start with a headless board over USB console, that takes zero code, and gives you free ANSI codes in standard IDF Monitor in VSCode (or in Tabby).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You do not have to write your own font renderer like I did here; that was just to push past 30 FPS on a display slightly too large for this chip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is free software under MIT License.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best help is currently more testing beyond "works on my computer", more shared examples and fun use cases:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;More ELF apps – see the examples at my breezyapps repo, they are super easy to follow. Even a carefully written stdlib C program with no platform-specific bits may work sometimes, also with some ANSI codes. But be sure to verify on the actual ESP32-S3: the memory is tight, the larger PSRAM requires alignment, and there are other limits and quirks. You can publish and install the apps using your own repo.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;More full example firmware repositories: for different boards, with different styles. Maybe you provide the basic LVGL text label example on some popular board. Maybe you prefer C++ to plain C. Maybe you embrace the GUI. Maybe you port some retro games. Maybe you even make it work on P4, or C6 (RISC-V, a completely different CPU). Maybe you attach some cool gadgets to it. Maybe you build an extra cool cyberdeck case. Or maybe you reproduce the exact same thing, and just share your setup experience and hands-on impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be so cool to see more people using BreezyBox, and to have more ready-to-clone examples for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenCiv3 (formerly known by the codename “C7”) is an open-source, cross-platform, mod-oriented, modernized reimagining of Civilization III by the fan community built with the Godot Engine and C#, with capabilities inspired by the best of the 4X genre and lessons learned from modding Civ3. Our vision is to make Civ3 as it could have been, rebuilt for today’s modders and players: removing arbitary limits, fixing broken features, expanding mod capabilities, and supporting modern graphics and platforms. A game that can go beyond C3C but retain all of its gameplay and content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenCiv3 is under active development and currently in an early pre-alpha state. It is a rudimentary playable game but lacking many mechanics and late-game content, and errors are likely. Keep up with our development for the latest updates and opportunities to contribute!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE: OpenCiv3 is not affiliated with civfanatics.com, Firaxis Games, BreakAway Games, Hasbro Interactive, Infogrames Interactive, Atari Interactive, or Take-Two Interactive Software. All trademarks are property of their respective owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OpenCiv3 team is pleased to announce the first preview release of the v0.3 “Dutch” milestone. This is a major enhancement over the “Carthage” release, and our debut with standalone mode featuring placeholder graphics without the need for Civ3 media files. A local installation of Civ3 is still recommended for a more polished experience. See the release notes for a full list of new features in each version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenCiv3 Dutch Preview 1 with the same game in Standalone mode (top) and with imported Civ3 graphics (bottom)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download the appropriate zip file for your OS from the Dutch Preview 1 release&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All official releases of OpenCiv3 along with more detailed release notes can be found on the GitHub releases page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a Windows 64-bit executable.

    &lt;p&gt;The fundamental modes of vocal fold vibration. Every sound you make lives somewhere on this spectrum. Master these before anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;De grundlæggende måder stemmebåndene vibrerer på. Enhver lyd du laver befinder sig et sted på dette spektrum. Mestér disse før alt andet.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Chest VoiceYour speaking register. Thick vocal folds, full closure.Dit taleregister. Tykke stemmebånd, fuld lukning.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Rich, warm, powerful, grounded. Vibrations felt in upper torso. Fyldig, varm, kraftfuld, jordbunden. Vibrationer mærkes i brystkassen.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Johnny Cash, Adele (vers), Elvis Presley, Amy Winehouse&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt; Place hand on chest and speak — feel the buzz. That's chest resonance. Sing "Hey!" like calling someone across the street. Keep that forward, spoken quality as you move to pitch.&lt;p&gt;Exercise: "Hey man!" projection on scales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise: Speak-sing counting 1–10 Læg hånden på brystet og tal — mærk vibrationen. Det er brystresonans. Syng "Hej!" som om du kalder på nogen over gaden. Bevar den fremadrettede, talte kvalitet når du synger på tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: "Hej du!" projektion på skalaer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Talesyng og tæl 1–10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Lighter than chest but with depth and ring. Resonant, clear, projecting. Not breathy. Lettere end bryst, men med dybde og klang. Resonant, klar, projicerende. Ikke luftig.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Freddie Mercury, Whitney Houston, Pavarotti, Ariana Grande&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt; Imagine calling over a fence — "Hellooo?" That lifting feeling is head voice. Keep cord closure (no air leaking). The sound should ring, not whisper.&lt;p&gt;Exercise: "Hoo" on descending 5-note scales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise: "Wee" sirens from low to high Forestil dig at du kalder over et hegn — "Hallooo?" Den løftende fornemmelse er hovedklang. Bevar lukning af stemmebåndene (ingen luft slipper ud). Lyden skal ringe, ikke hviske.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: "Hoo" på nedadgående 5-tone skalaer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: "Wee" sirener fra lav til høj&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;FalsettoFolds don't fully close. Air leaks through. Light and airy.Stemmebåndene lukker ikke helt. Luft slipper igennem. Let og luftig.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Breathy, ethereal, flute-like, intimate. Lighter than head voice. Hollow quality. Luftig, æterisk, fløjteagtig, intim. Lettere end hovedklang. Hul kvalitet.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Bee Gees, Jeff Buckley, Thom Yorke, Prince, Justin Timberlake&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt; Sigh gently on a high note — that airy release is falsetto. The vocal folds thin out and partially separate. Don't push volume; let it be light.&lt;p&gt;Exercise: Gentle sighs down 5-note scale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise: "Hoo" (like an owl) on high notes Suk blidt på en høj tone — den luftige løsladelse er falset. Stemmebåndene bliver tynde og adskilles delvist. Pres ikke volumen; lad det være let.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Bløde suk ned ad 5-tone skala&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: "Hoo" (som en ugle) på høje toner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Powerful high notes that feel connected and full. Seamless transition through registers. Kraftige høje toner der føles forbundne og fyldte. Sømløs overgang mellem registre.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Freddie Mercury, Brendon Urie, Beyoncé, Chris Cornell, Ariana Grande&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt; The bridge between chest and head — neither cracks nor flips. Start with bratty "Nay" on scales to force cord closure while ascending. Shade vowels toward "OH/OO" as you go higher.&lt;p&gt;Exercise: Bratty "Nay" on octave scales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise: "Gee" ascending (keeps cords together)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise: "Gug" for chest-to-head bridge Broen mellem bryst og hoved — hverken knak eller flip. Start med frækt "Næ" på skalaer for at tvinge stemmebåndene sammen under stigning. Skift vokaler mod "OH/OO" jo højere du synger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Frækt "Næ" på oktavskalaer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: "Gee" opadgående (holder båndene sammen)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: "Gug" for bryst-til-hoved bro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Loud, bright, ringing, emotionally intense. Like a controlled shout. The "money note" sound. Høj, lys, klingende, emotionelt intens. Som et kontrolleret råb. "Pengene-tonen."&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt; Good belting = right balance of chest and head, not just yelling. Open mouth naturally, jaw relaxed. Breath support from diaphragm. Bright, forward vowels. Think "calling out" not "pushing up."&lt;p&gt;Exercise: "Hey man!" at increasing pitch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise: Bratty "Nae" on ascending 5ths God belting = den rette balance mellem bryst og hoved, ikke bare at råbe. Åbn munden naturligt, kæben afslappet. Åndedrætssstøtte fra mellemgulvet. Lyse, fremadrettede vokaler. Tænk "kald ud" ikke "pres op."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: "Hej du!" på stigende tonehøjde&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Frækt "Næ" på stigende kvinter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;⚠ Bad belting (pure chest pushed high) causes strain and nodules. Never belt without warming up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;⚠ Dårlig belting (ren bryst presset højt op) forårsager belastning og knuder. Belt aldrig uden opvarmning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Bright, piercing, "nasal" but in a good way. Adds volume and cut without extra effort. Lys, gennemtrængende, "nasal" men på den gode måde. Tilføjer volumen og skarphed uden ekstra anstrengelse.&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Steven Tyler, Dolly Parton, AC/DC, musical theatre&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt; Think of a duck quacking, or a witch cackling "nyah nyah!" That nasal, buzzy quality is twang. It narrows the vocal tract, amplifying sound. Hugely useful for projection without strain.&lt;p&gt;Exercise: Quack like a duck on scales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise: "Nyah nyah" bratty sound, ascending Tænk på en and der rapper, eller en heks der kagler "næh næh!" Den nasale, summende kvalitet er twang. Det indsnævrer stemmekanalen og forstærker lyden. Enormt nyttigt til projektion uden belastning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Rap som en and på skalaer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: "Næh næh" frækt, opadgående&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Chris Cornell, Pavarotti, Beyoncé — alle store sangere&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt; As you sing higher, narrow your vowels slightly. "AH" → "UH", "EE" → "IH", "AY" → "EH". This matches the resonant frequency of your vocal tract to the pitch.&lt;p&gt;Exercise: Sing "Ah" up a scale, let it shade to "Uh" above the break&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise: "Me" → "Meh" → "Muh" ascending Jo højere du synger, desto mere indsnævrer du vokalerne. "AH" → "UH", "EE" → "IH", "AY" → "EH". Dette matcher resonansfrekvensen i din stemmekanal til tonehøjden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Syng "Ah" op ad en skala, lad det glide til "Uh" over bruddet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: "Me" → "Meh" → "Muh" opadgående&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt; False fold engagement + compression + breath support. The false folds cover the true vocal folds to create buzz. Think "clearing your throat" gently, then sustain.

De falske folder dækker de rigtige stemmebånd og skaber buzz. Tænk "rømme sig" blidt, hold det derefter. Stærk mellemgulvsstøtte er afgørende.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Røm dig → hold raslen på tone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Kargyraa-stil lav brummen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;⚠ High risk. Requires solid clean singing foundation. Work with a specialist. Never push through pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;⚠ Høj risiko. Kræver solid fundament i ren sang. Arbejd med specialist. Syng aldrig igennem smerte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt; A brief false fold "bite" at the very beginning of a note. Short grunt or bark — then open into clean tone.

Kort grynt eller bjæf — åbn derefter i ren tone. Ornamentalt, ikke vedvarende.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Kort bjæf → ren holdt tone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: "Grr-ahh" på enkelttoner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

Korrekt åndedrætssstøtte + frigivet spænding = vibrato opstår af sig selv. Afslap kæbe, tunge, hals mens du opretholder mellemgulvsstøtte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Hold "Ah" — pulsér mellemgulvet blidt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Øvelse: Skift mellem to nabotoner hurtigt → langsomt til det smelter sammen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;

In this book, we hope to give a gentle introduction to the core methods for people with some level of quantitative background. The book starts with the origins of RLHF -- both in recent literature and in a convergence of disparate fields of science in economics, philosophy, and optimal control. We then set the stage with definitions, problem formulation, data collection, and other common math used in the literature. The core of the book details every optimization stage in using RLHF, from starting with instruction tuning to training a reward model and finally all of rejection sampling, reinforcement learning, and direct alignment algorithms. The book concludes with advanced topics -- understudied research questions in synthetic data and evaluation -- and open questions for the field.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Submission history&lt;/head&gt;From: Nathan Lambert [view email]&lt;p&gt;[v1] Wed, 16 Apr 2025 21:36:46 UTC (5,200 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v2] Wed, 11 Jun 2025 15:15:22 UTC (7,032 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v3] Sun, 2 Nov 2025 20:03:47 UTC (7,093 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v4] Fri, 2 Jan 2026 00:09:40 UTC (8,065 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v5] Sat, 17 Jan 2026 17:17:41 UTC (8,732 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Software Engineering is back&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Coding agents have replaced every framework I used&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t post a lot. But when I do, it’s because I think few people are saying out loud what I’m noticing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been building a product from the ground up. Not the “I spun up a Next.js template” kind of ground up. I mean from network configuration to product design to pricing decisions. Truly end to end. And I’ve been doing it using frontier models and coding agents for hours and hours every single day, both on this project and in my full time work. I’ve been trying to stay away from the chaos and the hype, filtering hard for what is actually valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since December 2025, things have dramatically changed for the better. Many have noticed. Few are drawing the right conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Automated Programming&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Antirez likes to call it “automated programming”, and I really like that framing. It captures the essence far better than the shallow, almost dismissive label of “vibe coding”. Automation was at the core of most of the work and cultural revolutions of human history. The printing press, the loom, the assembly line. This one doesn’t differ much.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of my work is still there. I still have to deeply think about every important aspect of what I want to build. The architecture, the trade offs, the product decisions, the edge cases that will bite you at 3am. What’s gone is the tearing, exhausting manual labour of typing every single line of code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point in time, models and tools, when put in a clean and maniacally well set up environment, can truly make the difference. I can be the architect without the wearing act of laying every single brick and spreading the mortar. I can design the dress without the act of cutting and sewing each individual piece of fabric. But I can do all of this with the experience on my back of having laid the bricks, spread the mortar, cut and sewn for twenty years. If I don’t like something, I can go in, understand it and fix it as I please, instructing once and for all my setup to do what I want next time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automated programming especially allows me to quickly build the tools I need so fast that every blacksmith that ever existed on this earth would envy me deeply. Finally able to really focus on the things they have in mind. Finally dedicating more time of their craft to the art they conceive, not the sweat of the forge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Epiphany&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s been months now that I have this thought crystallized in my mind. It is so clear to me that I genuinely don’t understand why everyone is not screaming it to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can finally get rid of all that middle work. That adapting layer of garbage we blindly accepted during these years. A huge amount of frameworks and libraries and tooling that has completely polluted software engineering, especially in web, mobile and desktop development. Layers upon layers of abstractions that abstract nothing meaningful, that solve problems we shouldn’t have had in the first place, that create ten new problems for every one they claim to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think about what happened. We, as an industry, looked at the genuine complexity of building software and instead of sharpening our thinking, we bought someone else’s thinking off the shelf. We wrapped everything in frameworks like wrapping a broken leg in silk. It looks nice. The leg is still broken.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The three problems frameworks solve (or claim to)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my mind, besides the self declared objectives, frameworks solve three problems. Two explicit and one obvious but never declared.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Simplification”. Software engineers are scared of designing things themselves. They would rather accept someone else’s structure, despite having to force fit it into their product, rather than taking the time to start from the goal and work backwards to create the perfect suit for their idea. Like an architect blindly accepting another architect’s blueprints and applying them regardless of the context, the needs, the terrain, the new technological possibilities. We decided to remove complexity not by sharpening our mental models around the products we build, but by buying a one size fits all design and applying it everywhere. That is not simplification. That is intellectual surrender.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automation. This is the only point I can actually, more or less, understand and buy. Boilerplate is boring work. I hate it. And I especially hate using libraries that I then need to study, keep updated, be aware of vulnerabilities for, just for the purpose of removing the creation of duplicated but necessary code. Think about ORMs, CRUD management, code generation, API documentation and so on. The grunt work that nobody wants to do but everybody needs done. Fair enough. But hold that thought, because this is exactly the point where everything changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Labour cost. This is the quiet one. The one nobody puts on the conference slide. For companies, it is much better having Google, Meta, Vercel deciding for you how you build product and ship code. Adopt their framework. Pay the cost of lock in. Be enchanted by their cloud managed solution to host, deploy, store your stuff. And you unlock a feature that has nothing to do with engineering: you no longer need to hire a software engineer. You hire a React Developer. No need to train. Plug and play. Easy to replace. A cog in a machine designed by someone else, maintaining a system architected by someone else, solving problems defined by someone else. This is not engineering. This is operating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Software Engineering Is Back&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my opinion Software engineering, the true one, is back again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not speaking out of my lungs only. I’ve been developing this way almost flawlessly for over two years at this point. But the true revolution happened clearly last year, and since December 2025 this is obvious to anyone paying attention. From now on it will be even more so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have the chance again to get rid of useless complexity and keep working on the true and welcome complexity of our ideas, our features, our products. The complexity that matters. The complexity that is actually yours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automation and boilerplating have never been so cheap to overcome. I’ve been basically never writing twice the same line of code. I’m instantly building small tools I need, purpose built, exactly shaped around the problem at hand. I don’t need any fancy monorepo manager. A simple Makefile covers 100% of my needs for 99% of my use cases. When things will get very complicated, and if they get very complicated, I’ll think about it. But only then. Not a second before. This is engineering. You solve the problem you have, not the problem someone on a conference stage told you that you’ll eventually have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents are really well prepared when it comes to basic tools. Tools that have been around not for months, but literally for decades. Bash was born in 1989, just preceding me by two months. The most mediocre model running at this time knows bash better than any person in the world. Bash is the universal adapter. It is not a coincidence that coding agents are shifting from complex and expensive MCP configurations to a simple agent loop with bash as a way to interact, literally, with the world. The oldest tool turned out to be the most future proof. There’s a lesson in there if you care to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Think about it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why do you ever need, for most of the use cases you can think of, a useless, expensive, flawed, often vulnerable framework, and the parade of libraries that comes with it, that you probably use for only 10% of its capabilities? With all the costs associated with it. From the “least” expensive: operational costs like keeping everything updated because they once again found a critical vulnerability in your Next.js version. To the most expensive one: the cost to your Design Choices. The invisible cost. The one you pay every day without even realizing it, because you’ve been paying it so long you forgot what freedom felt like.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you keep accepting this trade off, you are not only losing the biggest opportunity we’ve seen in software engineering in decades. You are probably not recognizing your own laziness in once again buying whatever the hyperscalers have decided for you. You’re letting Google and Meta and Vercel be your architect, your designer, your thinker. And in exchange, you get to be their operator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tools are here. The models are here. The revolution already happened and most people are still decorating the old house.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stop wrapping broken legs in silk. Start building things that are yours.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
