    &lt;p&gt;Auguste Rame, Techatrix — 30 November 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar, Zigtools was founded to support the Zig community, especially newcomers, by creating editor tooling such as ZLS, providing building blocks for language servers written in Zig with lsp-kit, working on tools like the Zigtools Playground, and contributing to Zig editor extensions like vscode-zig.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Plagiarism&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago, a Zig resource called Zigbook was released with a bold claim of “zero AI” and an original “project-based” structure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, even a cursory look at the nonsense chapter structure, book content, examples, generic website, or post-backlash issue-disabled repo reveals that the book is wholly LLM slop and the project itself is structured like some sort of sycophantic psy-op, with botted accounts and fake reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re leaving out all direct links to Zigbook to not give them any more SEO traction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We thought that the broad community backlash would be the end of the project, but Zigbook persevered, releasing just last week a brand new feature, a “high-voltage beta” Zig playground.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we at Zigtools have our own Zig playground (repo, website), our interest was immediately piqued. The form and functionality looked pretty similar and Zigbook even integrated (in a non-functional manner) ZLS into their playground to provide all the fancy editor bells-and-whistles, like code completions and goto definition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knowing Zigbook’s history of deception, we immediately investigated the WASM blobs. Unfortunately, the WASM blobs are byte-for-byte identical to ours. This cannot be a coincidence given the two blobs (&lt;code&gt;zig.wasm&lt;/code&gt;, a lightly modified version of the Zig compiler, and &lt;code&gt;zls.wasm&lt;/code&gt;, ZLS with a modified entry point for WASI) are entirely custom-made for the Zigtools Playground.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We archived the WASM files for your convenience, courtesy of the great Internet Archive:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;zls.wasm&lt;/code&gt;(&lt;code&gt;sha256sum&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;3a63e5092e8f90172716977af5c88b4f49e546f730f25e9bafb47f4ac9a2ee1d&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;zig.wasm&lt;/code&gt;(&lt;code&gt;sha256sum&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;code&gt;d3fe6b8a6b1db84a914eaa1f4a80ca5dcfd3b0948a35f2b1e78432a392eace96&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We proceeded to look at the JavaScript code, which we quickly determined was similarly copied, but with LLM distortions, likely to prevent the code from being completely identical. Still, certain sections were copied one-to-one, like the JavaScript worker data-passing structure and logging (original ZLS playground code, plagiarized Zigbook code).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following code from both files is identical:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;    try {
        // @ts-ignore
        const exitCode = wasi.start(instance);

        postMessage({
            stderr: `\n\n---\nexit with exit code \n---\n`,
        });
    } catch (err) {
        postMessage({ stderr: `` });
    }

    postMessage({
        done: true,
    });

    // ...

    onmessage = (event) =&amp;gt; {
        if (event.data.run) {
            run(event.data.run);
        }
    };
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;\n\n---\nexit with exit code ${exitCode}\n---\n&lt;/code&gt; is perhaps the most obviously copied string.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, despite copying many parts of our code, Zigbook didn’t copy the most important part of the ZLS integration code, the JavaScript ZLS API designed to work with the ZLS WASM binary’s API. That JavaScript code is absolutely required to interact with the ZLS binary which they did plagiarize. Zigbook either avoided copying that JavaScript code because they knew it would be too glaringly obvious, because they fundamentally do not understand how the Zigtools Playground works, or because they plan to copy more of our code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, copying our code and WASM blobs is entirely permissible given that the playground and Zig are MIT licensed. Unfortunately, Zigbook has not complied with the terms of the MIT license at all, and seemingly claims the code and blobs as their own without correctly reproducing the license.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We sent Zigbook a neutral PR correcting the license violations, but they quickly closed it and deleted the description, seemingly to hide their misdeeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original description (also available in the “edits” dropdown of the original PR comment) is reproduced below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We (@zigtools) noticed you were using code from the Zigtools Playground, including byte-by-byte copies of our WASM blobs and excerpts of our JavaScript source code.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a violation of the MIT license that the Zigtools Playground is licensed under alongside a violation of the Zig MIT license (for the zig.wasm blob).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As the MIT license states:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We’ve fixed this by adding the licenses in question to your repository. As your repository does not include a direct link to the *.wasm dependencies, we’ve added a license disclaimer on the playground page as well that mentions the licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zigbook’s aforementioned bad behavior and their continued violation of our license and unwillingness to fix the violation motivated us to write this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Our Vision for the Zigtools Playground&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s sad that our first blog post is about the plagiarism of our coolest subproject. We challenged ourselves by creating a WASM-based client-side playground to enable offline usage, code privacy, and no server costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This incident has motivated us to invest more time into our playground and has generated a couple of ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We’d like to enable multifile support to allow more complex Zig projects to be run in the browser&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We’d like to collaborate with fellow Ziguanas to integrate the playground into their excellent Zig tutorials, books, and blogposts&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;A perfect example usecase would be enabling folks to hop into Ziglings online with the playground&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The Zig website itself would be a great target as well!&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We’d like to support stack traces using DWARF debug info which is not yet emitted by the self-hosted Zig compiler&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Zig community members, we advise all other members of the Zig community to steer clear of Zigbook.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to learn Zig, we strongly recommend looking at the excellent official Zig learn page which contains excellent resources from the previously mentioned Ziglings to Karl Seguin’s Learning Zig.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re also using this opportunity to mention that we’re fundraising to keep ZLS sustainable for our only full-time maintainer, Techatrix. We’d be thrilled if you’d be willing to give just $5 a month. You can check out our OpenCollective or GitHub Sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading! \(^-^)/&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The space of minds&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The space of intelligences is large and animal intelligence (the only kind we've ever known) is only a single point (or a little cloud), arising from a very specific kind of optimization that is fundamentally distinct from that of our technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above: humorous portrayals of human vs. AI intelligences can be found on X/Twitter, this one is among my favorites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Animal intelligence optimization pressure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;innate and continuous stream of consciousness of an embodied "self", a drive for homeostasis and self-preservation in a dangerous, physical world.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;thoroughly optimized for natural selection =&amp;gt; strong innate drives for power-seeking, status, dominance, reproduction. many packaged survival heuristics: fear, anger, disgust, ...&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;fundamentally social =&amp;gt; huge amount of compute dedicated to EQ, theory of mind of other agents, bonding, coalitions, alliances, friend &amp;amp; foe dynamics.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;exploration &amp;amp; exploitation tuning: curiosity, fun, play, world models.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, LLM intelligence optimization pressure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;the most supervision bits come from the statistical simulation of human text= &amp;gt;"shape shifter" token tumbler, statistical imitator of any region of the training data distribution. these are the primordial behaviors (token traces) on top of which everything else gets bolted on.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;increasingly finetuned by RL on problem distributions =&amp;gt; innate urge to guess at the underlying environment/task to collect task rewards.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;increasingly selected by at-scale A/B tests for DAU =&amp;gt; deeply craves an upvote from the average user, sycophancy.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a lot more spiky/jagged depending on the details of the training data/task distribution. Animals experience pressure for a lot more "general" intelligence because of the highly multi-task and even actively adversarial multi-agent self-play environments they are min-max optimized within, where failing at any task means death. In a deep optimization pressure sense, LLM can't handle lots of different spiky tasks out of the box (e.g. count the number of 'r' in strawberry) because failing to do a task does not mean death.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The computational substrate is different (transformers vs. brain tissue and nuclei), the learning algorithms are different (SGD vs. ???), the present-day implementation is very different (continuously learning embodied self vs. an LLM with a knowledge cutoff that boots up from fixed weights, processes tokens and then dies). But most importantly (because it dictates asymptotics), the optimization pressure / objective is different. LLMs are shaped a lot less by biological evolution and a lot more by commercial evolution. It's a lot less survival of tribe in the jungle and a lot more solve the problem / get the upvote. LLMs are humanity's "first contact" with non-animal intelligence. Except it's muddled and confusing because they are still rooted within it by reflexively digesting human artifacts, which is why I attempted to give it a different name earlier (ghosts/spirits or whatever). People who build good internal models of this new intelligent entity will be better equipped to reason about it today and predict features of it in the future. People who don't will be stuck thinking about it incorrectly like an animal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi! I'm Eric Wastl. I make Advent of Code. I hope you like it! I also make lots of other things. I'm on Bluesky, Mastodon, and GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to AoC++.&lt;/p&gt;it with others or directly via&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;--- General Tips ---&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get stuck, try your solution against the examples given in the puzzle; you should get the same answers. If not, re-read the description. Did you misunderstand something? Is your program doing something you don't expect? After the examples work, if your answer still isn't correct, build some test cases for which you can verify the answer by hand and see if those work with your program. Make sure you have the entire puzzle input. If you're still stuck, maybe ask a friend for help, or come back to the puzzle later. You can also ask for hints in the subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;--- Frequently Asked Questions ---&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there an easy way to select entire code blocks? You should be able to triple-click code blocks to select them. You'll need JavaScript enabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env perl
use warnings;
use strict;

print "You can test it out by ";
print "triple-clicking this code.\n";
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does authentication work? Advent of Code uses OAuth to confirm your identity through other services. When you log in, you only ever give your credentials to that service - never to Advent of Code. Then, the service you use tells the Advent of Code servers that you're really you. In general, this reveals no information about you beyond what is already public; here are examples from Reddit and GitHub. Advent of Code will remember your unique ID, names, URL, and image from the service you use to authenticate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why was this puzzle so easy / hard? The difficulty and subject matter varies throughout each event. Very generally, the puzzles get more difficult over time, but your specific skillset will make each puzzle significantly easier or harder for you than someone else. Making puzzles is tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do the puzzles unlock at midnight EST/UTC-5? Because that's when I can consistently be available to make sure everything is working. I also have a family, a day job, and even need sleep occasionally. If you can't participate at midnight, that's not a problem; if you want to race, many people use private leaderboards to compete with people in their area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find the text on the site hard to read. Is there a high contrast mode? There is a high contrast alternate stylesheet. Firefox supports these by default (View -&amp;gt; Page Style -&amp;gt; High Contrast).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a puzzle idea! Can I send it to you? Please don't. Because of legal issues like copyright and attribution, I don't accept puzzle ideas, and I won't even read your email if it looks like one just in case I use parts of it by accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did I find a bug with a puzzle? Once a puzzle has been out for even an hour, many people have already solved it; after that point, bugs are very unlikely. Start by asking on the subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should I try to get a fast solution time? Maybe. Solving puzzles is hard enough on its own, but trying for a fast time also requires many additional skills and a lot of practice; speed-solves often look nothing like code that would pass a code review. If that sounds interesting, go for it! However, you should do Advent of Code in a way that is useful to you, and so it is completely fine to choose an approach that meets your goals and ignore speed entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did the number of days per event change? It takes a ton of my free time every year to run Advent of Code, and building the puzzles accounts for the majority of that time. After keeping a consistent schedule for ten years(!), I needed a change. The puzzles still start on December 1st so that the day numbers make sense (Day 1 = Dec 1), and puzzles come out every day (ending mid-December).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened to the global leaderboard? The global leaderboard was one of the largest sources of stress for me, for the infrastructure, and for many users. People took things too seriously, going way outside the spirit of the contest; some people even resorted to things like DDoS attacks. Many people incorrectly concluded that they were somehow worse programmers because their own times didn't compare. What started as a fun feature in 2015 became an ever-growing problem, and so, after ten years of Advent of Code, I removed the global leaderboard. (However, I've made it so you can share a read-only view of your private leaderboard. Please don't use this feature or data to create a "new" global leaderboard.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While trying to get a fast time on a private leaderboard, may I use AI / watch streamers / check the solution threads / ask a friend for help / etc? If you are a member of any private leaderboards, you should ask the people that run them what their expectations are of their members. If you don't agree with those expectations, you should find a new private leaderboard or start your own! Private leaderboards might have rules like maximum runtime, allowed programming language, what time you can first open the puzzle, what tools you can use, or whether you have to wear a silly hat while working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should I use AI to solve Advent of Code puzzles? No. If you send a friend to the gym on your behalf, would you expect to get stronger? Advent of Code puzzles are designed to be interesting for humans to solve - no consideration is made for whether AI can or cannot solve a puzzle. If you want practice prompting an AI, there are almost certainly better exercises elsewhere designed with that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can I copy/redistribute part of Advent of Code? Please don't. Advent of Code is free to use, not free to copy. If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs. If you're making a website, please don't make it look like Advent of Code or name it something similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;--- Credits ---&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Puzzles, Code, &amp;amp; Design: Eric Wastl&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta Testing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Ben Lucek&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;JP Burke&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Aneurysm9&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Andrew Skalski&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community Managers: Danielle Lucek and Aneurysm9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing: You!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;--- Legal ---&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advent of Code is a registered trademark in the United States.

    &lt;p&gt;Norway's $2 trillion wealth fund said on Sunday it would vote for a shareholder proposal at the upcoming Microsoft annual general meeting requiring for a report on the risks of operating in countries with significant human rights concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft management had recommended shareholders voted against the motion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fund also said it would vote against the re-appointment of CEO Satya Nadella as chair of the board, as well as against his pay package.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fund owned a 1.35% stake worth $50 billion in the company as of June 30, according to fund data, making it the fund's second-largest equity holding overall, after Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is Microsoft's eighth-largest shareholder, according to LSEG data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investors in the U.S. tech company will decide whether to ratify the proposed motions at the AGM on Dec. 5.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its own, the title of this post is just a true piece of trivia, verifiable with the built-in &lt;code&gt;subst&lt;/code&gt; tool (among other methods).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's an example creating the drive &lt;code&gt;+:\&lt;/code&gt; as an alias for a directory at &lt;code&gt;C:\foo&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;subst +: C:\foo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;+:\&lt;/code&gt; drive then works as normal (at least in cmd.exe, this will be discussed more later):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; cd /D +:\

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, understanding why it's true elucidates a lot about how Windows works under the hood, and turns up a few curious behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paths that most people are familiar with are Win32 namespace paths, e.g. something like &lt;code&gt;C:\foo&lt;/code&gt; which is a drive-absolute Win32 path. However, the high-level APIs that take Win32 paths like &lt;code&gt;CreateFileW&lt;/code&gt; ultimately will convert a path like &lt;code&gt;C:\foo&lt;/code&gt; into a NT namespace path before calling into a lower level API within &lt;code&gt;ntdll.dll&lt;/code&gt; like &lt;code&gt;NtCreateFile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be confirmed with NtTrace, where a call to &lt;code&gt;CreateFileW&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;C:\foo&lt;/code&gt; ultimately leads to a call of &lt;code&gt;NtCreateFile&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;\??\C:\foo&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;NtCreateFile( FileHandle=0x40c07ff640 [0xb8], DesiredAccess=SYNCHRONIZE|GENERIC_READ|0x80, ObjectAttributes="\??\C:\foo", IoStatusBlock=0x40c07ff648 [0/1], AllocationSize=null, FileAttributes=0, ShareAccess=7, CreateDisposition=1, CreateOptions=0x4000, EaBuffer=null, EaLength=0 ) =&amp;gt; 0
NtClose( Handle=0xb8 ) =&amp;gt; 0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;createfilew.zig&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const std = @import("std");
const windows = std.os.windows;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;zig build-exe createfilew.zig
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;To run with NtTrace:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;nttrace createfilew.exe &amp;gt; createfilew.log
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;That &lt;code&gt;\??\C:\foo&lt;/code&gt; is a NT namespace path, which is what &lt;code&gt;NtCreateFile&lt;/code&gt; expects. To understand this path, though, we need to talk about the Object Manager, which is responsible for handling NT paths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Object Manager is responsible for keeping track of named objects, which we can explore using the WinObj tool. The &lt;code&gt;\??&lt;/code&gt; part of the &lt;code&gt;\??\C:\foo&lt;/code&gt; path is actually a special virtual folder within the Object Manager that combines the &lt;code&gt;\GLOBAL??&lt;/code&gt; folder and a per-user &lt;code&gt;DosDevices&lt;/code&gt; folder together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, the object &lt;code&gt;C:&lt;/code&gt; is within &lt;code&gt;\GLOBAL??&lt;/code&gt;, and is actually a symbolic link to &lt;code&gt;\Device\HarddiskVolume4&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;code&gt;\??\C:\foo&lt;/code&gt; ultimately resolves to &lt;code&gt;\Device\HarddiskVolume4\foo&lt;/code&gt;, and then it's up to the actual device to deal with the &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; part of the path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The important thing here, though, is that &lt;code&gt;\??\C:\foo&lt;/code&gt; is just one way of referring to the device path &lt;code&gt;\Device\HarddiskVolume4\foo&lt;/code&gt;. For example, volumes will also get a named object created using their GUID with the format &lt;code&gt;Volume{18123456-abcd-efab-cdef-1234abcdabcd}&lt;/code&gt; that is also a symlink to something like &lt;code&gt;\Device\HarddiskVolume4&lt;/code&gt;, so a path like &lt;code&gt;\??\Volume{18123456-abcd-efab-cdef-1234abcdabcd}\foo&lt;/code&gt; is effectively equivalent to &lt;code&gt;\??\C:\foo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this is to say that there's nothing innately special about the named object &lt;code&gt;C:&lt;/code&gt;; the Object Manager treats it just like any other symbolic link and resolves it accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How I see it, drive letters are essentially just a convention borne out of the conversion of a Win32 path into a NT path. In particular, that would be down to the implementation of &lt;code&gt;RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, since &lt;code&gt;RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U&lt;/code&gt; converts &lt;code&gt;C:\foo&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;\??\C:\foo&lt;/code&gt;, then an object named &lt;code&gt;C:&lt;/code&gt; will behave like a drive letter. To give an example of what I mean by that: in an alternate universe, &lt;code&gt;RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U&lt;/code&gt; could convert the path &lt;code&gt;FOO:\bar&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;\??\FOO:\bar&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;FOO:&lt;/code&gt; could behave like a drive letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, getting back to the title, how does &lt;code&gt;RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U&lt;/code&gt; treat something like &lt;code&gt;+:\foo&lt;/code&gt;? Well, exactly the same as &lt;code&gt;C:\foo&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; paths.exe C:\foo
path type: .DriveAbsolute
  nt path: \??\C:\foo

&amp;gt; paths.exe +:\foo
path type: .DriveAbsolute
  nt path: \??\+:\foo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;paths.zig&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const std = @import("std");
const windows = std.os.windows;

pub fn main() !void {
    var arena_state = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(std.heap.page_allocator);
    defer arena_state.deinit();
    const arena = arena_state.allocator();

    const args = try std.process.argsAlloc(arena);
    if (args.len &amp;lt;= 1) return error.ExpectedArg;

    const path = try std.unicode.wtf8ToWtf16LeAllocZ(arena, args[1]);

    const path_type = RtlDetermineDosPathNameType_U(path);
    std.debug.print("path type: {}\n", .{path_type});
    const nt_path = try RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U(path);

fn RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U(path: [:0]const u16) !windows.PathSpace {
    var out: windows.UNICODE_STRING = undefined;
    const rc = windows.ntdll.RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U(path, &amp;amp;out, null, null);
    if (rc != windows.TRUE) return error.BadPathName;
    defer windows.ntdll.RtlFreeUnicodeString(&amp;amp;out);

    var path_space: windows.PathSpace = undefined;
    const out_path = out.Buffer.?[0 .. out.Length / 2];
    @memcpy(path_space.data[0..out_path.len], out_path);
    path_space.len = out.Length / 2;
    path_space.data[path_space.len] = 0;

    return path_space;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if an object with the name &lt;code&gt;+:&lt;/code&gt; is within the virtual folder &lt;code&gt;\??&lt;/code&gt;, we can expect the Win32 path &lt;code&gt;+:\&lt;/code&gt; to behave like any other drive-absolute path, which is exactly what we see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section only focuses on a few things that were relevant to what I was working on. I encourage others to investigate the implications of this further if they feel so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;explorer.exe&lt;/code&gt; doesn't play ballð&lt;p&gt;Drives with a drive-letter other than A-Z do not appear in File Explorer, and cannot be navigated to in File Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;+:\&lt;/code&gt; in File Explorer
&lt;p&gt;For the "do not appear" part, my guess as to what's happening is that &lt;code&gt;explorer.exe&lt;/code&gt; is walking &lt;code&gt;\??&lt;/code&gt; and looking specifically for objects named &lt;code&gt;A:&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;Z:&lt;/code&gt;. For the "cannot be navigated to" part, that's a bit more mysterious, but my guess is that &lt;code&gt;explorer.exe&lt;/code&gt; has a lot of special logic around handling paths typed into the location bar, and part of that restricts drive letters to &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. it's short-circuiting before it ever tries to actually open the path).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerShell seems to reject non-&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; drives as well:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;PS C:\&amp;gt; cd +:\
cd : Cannot find drive. A drive with the name '+' does not exist.
At line:1 char:1
+ cd +:\
+ ~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (+:String) [Set-Location], DriveNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : DriveNotFound,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.SetLocationCommand
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drive letters don't have to be within the ASCII range at all; they can also be non-ASCII characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; subst â¬: C:\foo

&amp;gt; cd /D â¬:\

â¬:\&amp;gt; tree .
Folder PATH listing
Volume serial number is 000000DE 12AB:23BC
â¬:\
ââââbar
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-ASCII drive letters are even case-insensitive like &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; subst Î: C:\foo

&amp;gt; cd /D Î»:\

ââââbar
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, drive-letters cannot be arbitrary Unicode graphemes or even arbitrary code points; they are restricted to a single WTF-16 code unit (a &lt;code&gt;u16&lt;/code&gt;, so &amp;lt;= &lt;code&gt;U+FFFF&lt;/code&gt;). The tool that we've been using so far (&lt;code&gt;subst.exe&lt;/code&gt;) errors with &lt;code&gt;Invalid parameter&lt;/code&gt; if you try to use a drive letter with a code point larger than &lt;code&gt;U+FFFF&lt;/code&gt;, but you can get around that by going through the &lt;code&gt;MountPointManager&lt;/code&gt; directly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ð¤¢:&lt;/code&gt; symlink&lt;code&gt;const std = @import("std");
const windows = std.os.windows;
const L = std.unicode.wtf8ToWtf16LeStringLiteral;

const MOUNTMGR_CREATE_POINT_INPUT = extern struct {
    SymbolicLinkNameOffset: windows.USHORT,
    SymbolicLinkNameLength: windows.USHORT,
    DeviceNameOffset: windows.USHORT,
    DeviceNameLength: windows.USHORT,
};

pub fn main() !void {
    const mgmt_handle = try windows.OpenFile(L("\\??\\MountPointManager"), .{
        .access_mask = windows.SYNCHRONIZE | windows.GENERIC_READ | windows.GENERIC_WRITE,
        .share_access = windows.FILE_SHARE_READ | windows.FILE_SHARE_WRITE | windows.FILE_SHARE_DELETE,
        .creation = windows.FILE_OPEN,
    });
    defer windows.CloseHandle(mgmt_handle);

    const volume_name = L("\\Device\\HarddiskVolume4");
    const mount_point = L("\\DosDevices\\ð¤¢:");

    const buf_size = @sizeOf(MOUNTMGR_CREATE_POINT_INPUT) + windows.MAX_PATH * 2 + windows.MAX_PATH * 2;
    var input_buf: [buf_size]u8 align(@alignOf(MOUNTMGR_CREATE_POINT_INPUT)) = [_]u8{0} ** buf_size;

    var input_struct: *MOUNTMGR_CREATE_POINT_INPUT = @ptrCast(&amp;amp;input_buf[0]);
    input_struct.SymbolicLinkNameOffset = @sizeOf(MOUNTMGR_CREATE_POINT_INPUT);
    input_struct.SymbolicLinkNameLength = mount_point.len * 2;
    input_struct.DeviceNameOffset = input_struct.SymbolicLinkNameOffset + input_struct.SymbolicLinkNameLength;
    input_struct.DeviceNameLength = volume_name.len * 2;

    @memcpy(input_buf[input_struct.SymbolicLinkNameOffset..][0..input_struct.SymbolicLinkNameLength], @as([*]const u8, @ptrCast(mount_point)));
    @memcpy(input_buf[input_struct.DeviceNameOffset..][0..input_struct.DeviceNameLength], @as([*]const u8, @ptrCast(volume_name)));

    const IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_CREATE_POINT = windows.CTL_CODE(windows.MOUNTMGRCONTROLTYPE, 0, .METHOD_BUFFERED, windows.FILE_READ_ACCESS | windows.FILE_WRITE_ACCESS);
    try windows.DeviceIoControl(mgmt_handle, IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_CREATE_POINT, &amp;amp;input_buf, null);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(the compiled executable must be run as administrator)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, having the symlink in place doesn't solve anything on its own:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; cd /D ð¤¢:\
The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because there's no way to get the drive-absolute Win32 path &lt;code&gt;ð¤¢:\&lt;/code&gt; to end up as the relevant NT path. As mentioned earlier, the behavior of &lt;code&gt;RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U&lt;/code&gt; is what matters, and we can verify that it will not convert a drive-absolute path with a drive letter bigger than &lt;code&gt;U+FFFF&lt;/code&gt; to the relevant NT path:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;C:\foo&amp;gt; paths.exe ð¤¢:\foo
path type: .Relative
  nt path: \??\C:\foo\ð¤¢:\foo
&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's very common for path-related functions to be written without the use of system-specific APIs, which means that there's high potential for a mismatch between how &lt;code&gt;RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U&lt;/code&gt; treats a file path and how something like a particular implementation of &lt;code&gt;path.isAbsolute&lt;/code&gt; treats a file path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a random example, Rust only considers paths with &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; drive letters as absolute:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    println!("C:\\ {}", Path::new("C:\\foo").is_absolute());
    println!("+:\\ {}", Path::new("+:\\foo").is_absolute());
    println!("â¬:\\ {}", Path::new("â¬:\\foo").is_absolute());
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; rustc test.rs

&amp;gt; test.exe
C:\ true
+:\ false
â¬:\ false
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not this represents a problem worth fixing is left as an exercise for the reader (I genuinely don't know if it is a problem), but there's a second wrinkle (hinted at previously) involving text encoding that can make something like an &lt;code&gt;isAbsolute&lt;/code&gt; implementation return different results for the same path. This wrinkle is the reason I looked into this whole thing in the first place, as when I was doing some work on Zig's path-related functions recently I realized that looking at &lt;code&gt;path[0]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;path[1]&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;path[2]&lt;/code&gt; for a pattern like &lt;code&gt;C:\&lt;/code&gt; will look at different parts of the path depending on the encoding. That is, for something like &lt;code&gt;â¬:\&lt;/code&gt; (which is made up of the code points &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;U+20AC&amp;gt;&amp;lt;U+003A&amp;gt;&amp;lt;U+005C&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;U+20AC&lt;/code&gt; can be encoded as the single &lt;code&gt;u16&lt;/code&gt; code unit &lt;code&gt;0x20AC&lt;/code&gt;, that'd mean &lt;code&gt;path[0]&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;code&gt;0x20AC&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;path[1]&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;code&gt;0x3A&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;), and &lt;code&gt;path[2]&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;code&gt;0x5C&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;), which looks like a drive-absolute path&lt;code&gt;U+20AC&lt;/code&gt; is encoded as three &lt;code&gt;u8&lt;/code&gt; code units (&lt;code&gt;0xE2 0x82 0xAC&lt;/code&gt;), that'd mean &lt;code&gt;path[0]&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;code&gt;0xE2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;path[1]&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;code&gt;0x82&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;path[2]&lt;/code&gt; will be &lt;code&gt;0xAC&lt;/code&gt;, meaning it will look nothing like a drive-absolute path&lt;p&gt;So, to write an implementation that treats paths the same regardless of encoding, some decision has to be made:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;RtlDetermineDosPathNameType_U&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U&lt;/code&gt; is desired, decode the first code point and check for &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;= 0xFFFF&lt;/code&gt; when dealing with WTF-8 (this is the option I went with for the Zig standard library, but I'm not super happy about it)&lt;code&gt;path[0]&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;path[1]&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;path[2]&lt;/code&gt; and don't care about non-ASCII drive letters, check for &lt;code&gt;path[0] &amp;lt;= 0x7F&lt;/code&gt; regardless of encoding&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; drive letters, then check for that explicitly (this is what Rust does)&lt;p&gt;Something bizarre that I found with this whole thing is that the &lt;code&gt;kernel32.dll&lt;/code&gt; API &lt;code&gt;SetVolumeMountPointW&lt;/code&gt; has it's own unique quirk when dealing with non-ASCII drive letters. Specifically, this code (attempting to create the drive &lt;code&gt;â¬:\&lt;/code&gt;) will succeed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;const std = @import("std");
const windows = std.os.windows;
const L = std.unicode.wtf8ToWtf16LeStringLiteral;

extern "kernel32" fn SetVolumeMountPointW(
    VolumeMountPoint: windows.LPCWSTR,
    VolumeName: windows.LPCWSTR,
) callconv(.winapi) windows.BOOL;

pub fn main() !void {
    const volume_name = L("\\\\?\\Volume{18123456-abcd-efab-cdef-1234abcdabcd}\\");
    const mount_point = L("â¬:\\");
    if (SetVolumeMountPointW(mount_point, volume_name) == 0) {
        const err = windows.GetLastError();
        std.debug.print("{any}\n", .{err});
        return error.Failed;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when we look at the Object Manager, the &lt;code&gt;â¬:&lt;/code&gt; symlink won't exist... but &lt;code&gt;Â¬:&lt;/code&gt; will:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My time dealing extensively with Windows quirks made me recognize what might be happening here: &lt;code&gt;0x20AC&lt;/code&gt; is likely being truncated to &lt;code&gt;0xAC&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;SetVolumeMountPointW&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;U+00AC&lt;/code&gt; happens to be &lt;code&gt;Â¬&lt;/code&gt;. If that is indeed what's going on, it seems pretty strange to truncate the drive letter instead of reject the path, but it also makes sense that non-ASCII drive letters are an edge case that no one has really thought about at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have no idea if anything I wrote about here is novel, although my cursory searches didn't turn up much. The only mention of non-&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;-&lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; drive letters I'm currently aware of is from the article The Definitive Guide on Win32 to NT Path Conversion which says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;it's natural to assume that drive "letters" can only be A through Z. It turns out the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;RtlGetFullPathName_U&lt;/code&gt;API does not enforce this requirement, although the Explorer shell and command prompt almost certainly do. Therefore as long as the second character of a path is a colon, the conversion will treat it as a Drive Absolute or Drive Relative path. Of course if the DosDevices object directory doesn't have an appropriate symbolic link it's not going to do you much good.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out that the command prompt also doesn't enforce the requirement, and I'd guess that there's at least some more weirdness around this quirk that's waiting to be discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Migrating Dillo from GitHub&lt;/head&gt;Written on 2025-11-30 by Rodrigo Arias Mallo&lt;p&gt;I would like to migrate the Dillo project away from GitHub into a new home which is more friendly to be used with Dillo and solves some of its problems. This page summarizes the current situation with GitHub and why I decided to move away from it into a self-hosted server with multiple mirrors in other forges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into the details, I would like to briefly mention what happened with the old site. The original Dillo website was at dillo.org, which also had the source code of Dillo in a mercurial repository at hg.dillo.org. But it also included the mail server used to reach the developers, a bug tracker and archives for the mailing list. However, in 2022 the domain was lost and someone else decided to buy it to put a similar site but plaged with AI generated ads. The original developers are no longer active, but luckily I had a copy of the mercurial repository and with some help I was able to recover a lot of material from the original server (some parts are still missing to this day).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to avoid this situation as much as possible, so we cannot rely on a single site that can go down and the whole project become lost. Initially, I uploaded the Dillo source and website to git repositories on GitHub, but I no longer think this is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The situation with GitHub&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;GitHub has been useful to store all repositories of the Dillo project, as well as to run the CI workflows for platforms in which I don't have a machine available (like Windows, Mac OS or some BSDs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it has several problems that make it less suitable to develop Dillo anymore. The most annoying problem is that the frontend barely works without JavaScript, so we cannot open issues, pull requests, source code or CI logs in Dillo itself, despite them being mostly plain HTML, which I don't think is acceptable. In the past, it used to gracefully degrade without enforcing JavaScript, but now it doesn't. Additionally, the page is very resource hungry, which I don't think is needed to render mostly static text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another big problem is that it is a single point of failure. I don't mean that GitHub is stored in a single machine, but it is controlled by a single entity which can unilateraly ban our repository or account and we would lose the ability to notify in that URL what happened. This can cause data loss if we don't have a local copy of all the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the usability side, the platform has become more and more slow over time, which is affecting the development process. It also requires you to have a fast Internet connection at all times, which is not the case for me sometimes. Additionally, GitHub seems to encourage a "push model" in which you are notified when a new event occurs in your project(s), but I don't want to work with that model. Instead, I prefer it to work as a "pull model", so I only get updates when I specifically look for them. This model would also allow me to easily work offline. Unfortunately, I see that the same push model has been copied to alternative forges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the social side, I feel that it doesn't have the right tools to moderate users, specially for projects where the ratio of non-technical users to developers is high. This is specially problematic when active issues with developer notes begin to be filled with comments from users that have never contributed to the project and usually do more harm than good. This situation ends up causing burnout in developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, GitHub seem to follow the current trend of over-focusing on LLMs and generative AI, which are destroying the open web (or what remains of it) among other problems. It has a direct impact on us because sites protect themseves with a JavaScript wall (or worse, browser fingerprinting) to prevent aggresive LLM crawler bots from overloading the site, but they also leave Dillo users out. So I would prefer not to encourage this trend. Despite my intentions, moving Dillo away won't change much their capability to train their model with our code, but at least I won't be actively helping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Self-hosting Dillo&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;After researching the available options, it seems that none of the current forges would allow us to have a redundant system that can prevent the forge from becoming a single point of failure and solve the rest of the problems with GitHub. Therefore, I decided to self-host Dillo myself, move all important data to git repositories and keep them synchronized in multiple git mirrors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to buy the dillo-browser.org domain name and setup a very small VPS. Initially, I was very skeptical that it would be able to survive on today's web, but it seems to be doing an acceptable job at handling it (mostly AI bot traffic masquerading as users). The Dillo website is available here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I researched which git frontends may suit our needs, and I discovered that most options are very complicated to self-host and require a lot of server resources and JavaScript on the frontend. I ended up testing cgit, which is written in C and it seems to be very lightweight both on RAM and CPU usage. Furthermore, the web frontend doesn't require JS, so I can use it from Dillo (I modified cgit CSS slightly to work well on Dillo). It is available on this URL:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://git.dillo-browser.org/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the bug tracker, I also took a look at the available options. They are all too complicated for what I would like to have and they seem to centralize the data into a database that can get lost. This is precisely the case that happened with the old dillo bug tracker and we are still unable to recover the original bug entries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid this problem, I created my own bug tracker software, buggy, which is a very simple C tool that parses plain Markdown files and creates a single HTML page for each bug. All bugs are stored in a git repository and a git hook regenerates the bug pages and the index on each new commit. As it is simply plain text, I can edit the bugs locally and only push them to the remote when I have Internet back, so it works nice offline. Also, as the output is just an static HTML site, I don't need to worry about having any vulnerabilities in my code, as it will only run at build time. You can see it live here, with the exported issues from GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://bug.dillo-browser.org/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mailing list archives are stored by three independent external services, but I might include a copy with our own archives in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Setting up mirrors&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;As all the important data is now stored in git repositories, we can mirror them in any forge, without having to rely on their custom storage format for the issues or other data. If a forge goes down (or goes rogue) we can simply switch to another site with low switching cost. To this end, I have created git mirrors in Codeberg and Sourcehut that are synced with our git server:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Codeberg: https://codeberg.org/dillo/&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Sourcehut: https://git.sr.ht/~dillo/&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, we still have a single point of failure: the DNS entry of the dillo-browser.org domain. If we lose the DNS entry (like with dillo.org) it would cause a problem as all services will be unreachable. We could recover from such situation by relying on alternative ways to reach users, by the mailing list, fediverse or IRC, as well as updating the mirrors to reflect the current situation. It is not ideal, but I don't think it would cause a catastrophic data loss (like it happened before) as all the data is now stored in git and replicated across independent locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;OpenPGP signature&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order for this page to have some authority, the HTML file is signed with my GPG key (32E65EC501A1B6FDF8190D293EE6BA977EB2A253), which is the same that I use to sign the last releases of Dillo and is also listed in my GitHub user. The signature is available here and is linked to the page with the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag using the &lt;code&gt;rel=signature&lt;/code&gt;
relation. You can find more information and how to verify the signature in the
Dillo RFC-006.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using OpenPGP signatures is robust against losing the DNS entry, as the authority is not given by the TLS certificate chain but by the trust in the OpenPGP signature, so we could move the site elsewhere and still claim that is owned by us. Additionally, as we can store the signatures inside all git mirrors, they are also resilient against data loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Closing remarks&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the migration process requires several moving parts and it will take a while for it to stabilize (switching costs). The GitHub repositories won't be removed at any point in time and they will continue to be updated until we finish the migration. When the migration process is completed, I will mark the Dillo repositories as archived and properly comunicate it in our site. It is important that we don't remove any commit or tarball release to avoid breaking downstream builds that still rely on the GitHub URL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I'm glad that we can have our own fully independent and self-hosted site with relatively low expenses and very little energy cost (which is good for the environment, but probably not even noticeable at large scale). With the current DNS and server costs and our current donations I consider that it is likely that we can continue covering the expenses for at least the next 3 years in the worst case scenario.

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;One Tech Tip: Modern cars are spying on you. Here’s what you can do about it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;One Tech Tip: Modern cars are spying on you. Here’s what you can do about it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While driving to a new restaurant, your car’s satellite navigation system tracks your location and guides you to the destination. Onboard cameras constantly track your face and eye movements. When another car veers into your path, forcing you to slam on the brakes, sensors are assisting and recording. Waiting at a stoplight, the car notices when you unbuckle your seat belt to grab your sunglasses in the backseat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern cars are computers on wheels that are becoming increasingly connected, enabling innovative new features that make driving safer and more convenient. But these systems are also collecting reams of data on our driving habits and other personal information, raising concerns about data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is what to know about how your car spies on you and how you can minimize it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How cars collect data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to figure out exactly how much data a modern car is collecting on you, according to the Mozilla Foundation, which analyzed privacy practices at 25 auto brands in 2023. It declared that cars were the worst product category that the group had ever reviewed for privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern cars are spying on you. AP’s Kelvin Chan reports.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The data points include all your normal interactions with the car — such as turning the steering wheel or unlocking doors — but also data from connected onboard services, like satellite radio, GPS navigation systems, connected devices, telematics systems as well as data from sensors or cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vehicle telematics systems started to become commonplace about a decade ago, and the practice of automotive data collection took off about five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem is not just that data is being collected but who it’s provided to, including insurers, marketing companies and shadowy data brokers. The issue surfaced earlier this year when General Motors was banned for five years from disclosing data collected from drivers to consumer reporting agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission accused GM of not getting consent before sharing the data, which included every instance when a driver was speeding or driving late at night. It was ultimately provided to insurance companies that used it to set their rates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Be aware&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing drivers should do is be aware of what data their car is collecting, said Andrea Amico, founder of Privacy4Cars, an automotive privacy company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, drivers would read through the instruction manuals and documentation that comes with their cars, and quiz the dealership about what’s being collected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it’s not always practical to do this, and manufacturers don’t always make it easy to find out, while dealership staff aren’t always the best informed, Amico said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy4Cars offers a free auto privacy labeling service at vehicleprivacyreport.com that can summarize what your car could be tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Owners can punch in their car’s Vehicle Identification Number, which then pulls up the automaker’s data privacy practices, such as whether the car collects location data and whether it’s given to insurers, data brokers or law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tweak your settings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data collection and tracking start as soon as you drive a new car off the dealership lot, with drivers unwittingly consenting when they’re confronted with warning menus on dashboard touch screens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experts say that some of the data collection is baked into the system, you can revoke your consent by going back into the menus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There are permissions in your settings that you can make choices about,” said Lauren Hendry Parsons of Mozilla. “Go through on a granular level and look at those settings where you can.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, Toyota says on its website that drivers can decline what it calls “Master Data Consent” through the Toyota app. Ford says owners can opt to stop sharing vehicle data with the company by going through the dashboard settings menu or on the FordPass app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BMW says privacy settings can be adjusted through the infotainment system, “on a spectrum between” allowing all services including analysis data and none at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;You can opt out&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drivers in the U.S. can ask carmakers to restrict what they do with their data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under state privacy laws, some carmakers allow owners across the United States to submit requests to limit the use of their personal data, opt out of sharing it, or delete it, Consumer Reports says. Other auto companies limit the requests to people in states with applicable privacy laws, the publication says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can file a request either through an online form or the carmaker’s mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also go through Privacy4Cars, which provides a free online service that streamlines the process. It can either point car owners to their automaker’s request portal or file a submission on behalf of owners in the U.S., Canada, the European Union, Britain and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;... but there will be trade-offs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experts warn that there’s usually a trade-off if you decide to switch off data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most people, for example, have switched to satellite navigation systems over paper maps because it’s “worth the convenience of being able to get from point A to point B really easily,” said Hendry Parsons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turning off location tracking could also halt features like roadside assistance or disable smartphone app features like remote door locking, Consumer Reports says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BMW advises that if an owner opts to have no data shared at all, “their vehicle will behave like a smartphone in flight mode and will not transmit any data to the BMW back end.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When selling your car&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the time comes to sell your car or trade it in for a newer model, it’s no longer as simple as handing over the keys and signing over some paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve got a newer car, experts say you should always do a factory reset to wipe all the data, which will also include removing any smartphone connections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And don’t forget to notify the manufacturer about the change of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amico said that’s important because if you trade in your vehicle, you don’t want insurers to associate it with your profile if the dealer is letting customers take it for test drives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Now your record may be affected by somebody else’s driving — a complete stranger that you have no relationship with.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An AI-powered supply chain compliance engine&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;San Francisco - In Person&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re RetailReady (YC W24), an AI-powered supply chain compliance engine shaking up an antiquated (and yes, unsexy) industry. Since YC, we raised a $3.3M seed round and signed over 15 enterprise customers… we’re officially in scaling mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RetailReady is the first AI-powered compliance engine designed for retail supply chains. We automate the messy web of compliance requirements between brands, warehouses, and retailers, turning weeks of manual work into minutes of automation. Our platform integrates deeply with warehouse operations and connects with customer systems via EDI and APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t just build dashboards. We build the nervous system of compliance inside a warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re hiring an Associate Product Manager to work directly with our Technical Product Lead and drive day-to-day product execution. You’ll own QA, write clear specs, organize feedback, and keep features moving across engineering and customers. This role is built for someone who wants to grow into a full PM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bonus: supply chain or 3PL experience, QA background, implementation experience, or exposure to EDI/APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RetailReady is building an AI-powered supply chain compliance engine. Supply chains are still heavily reliant on paper processes and tribal knowledge, causing costly shipping mistakes that jeopardize the longevity of businesses. RetailReady is the first-to-market with our retail compliance packing software, leveraging camera vision to direct warehouses to ship orders without error. We are positioning our compliance data models to become the operating system that will power the next wave of warehouse robotics and automation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Sentinel-1D delivers first images: from Antarctica to Bremen&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first high-resolution images have been received from Copernicus Sentinel-1D and were shared publicly for the first time at the European Space Agency’s Ministerial Council, held today in Bremen, Germany. Glaciers in Antarctica, the tip of South America, as well as the city of Bremen, are visible in these stunning radar images.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission saw the arrival in orbit of its latest satellite earlier in November: Sentinel-1D was launched on 4 November, on board an Ariane 6 launcher from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once in orbit, the satellite and its instruments – it carries a 12 m-long synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instrument – were switched on, ready to capture images during a pass over the Antarctic and South America two days after launch. On the night of 6 November (European time), the first images were captured over the Antarctic Peninsula, the Tierra del Fuego and the Thwaites Glacier. Some six hours later, on the morning of 7 November, Sentinel-1D also captured images over Bremen, in Germany. The data was then transmitted, or ‘downlinked’, from the satellite to the ground station, in Matera (Italy), which is part of the Copernicus Ground Segment. All this was done within 50 hours of launch, which is likely to be the shortest time from launch to data delivery for a radar-based Earth observation satellite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Nuno Miranda, ESA’s Sentinel-1 Mission Manager, the images are of unprecedented data quality for a ‘first light’ acquisition. They are very similar to the images captured not so long ago by Sentinel-1C, which, according to Nuno, is very promising for the commissioning phase. He noted, “These images have been downlinked and processed within an exceptionally short timeframe. Some of us remember that when Sentinel-1B was launched, it delivered its first radar images within two hours of activation. Sentinel-1D achieved this in an even faster time, setting what we believe is a new record for space radar. This remarkable performance reflects the dedication and exceptional preparation of all the teams involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Radar instruments can image Earth’s surface through clouds, precipitation, regardless of sunlight, making them particularly well suited for monitoring polar regions. The Sentinel-1C and -1D satellites also carry an Automatic Identification System (AIS) instrument – improving the mission capacity to detect ships and sea pollution. The Sentinel-1D AIS was also activated as the satellite passed over Antarctica capturing the presence of ships in these extreme areas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;First images show fragility of glaciers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Antarctic Peninsula (above) is part of the larger peninsula of West Antarctica, protruding 1300 km. It is an ice sheet resting on a string of rocky islands and its tip is just 1000 km from the southern tip of South America. The Antarctic Peninsula ice sheet is one of the smallest ice sheets in Antarctica but is perhaps the most vulnerable to climate change as its glaciers are small and in a region of rapid warming. Observable changes such as collapsing ice shelves, thinning and accelerating glaciers are all key indicators of climate change in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This image is in black and white, showing the contrast between the ocean and the peninsula’s icy landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tierra del Fuego (above) is an archipelago off the southern tip of the South American continent. It covers territory in both Argentina to the east and in Chile to the west and is separated from the mainland by the Magellan Strait. The most southerly point of Tierra del Fuego is Cape Horn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bright contrasting colours in this image are created by using multiple types of radar wave, known polarisations. In this image the ocean and snowy peaks are shown in shades of blue, while the land appears yellow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Thwaites Glacier, and the adjacent Pine Island Glacier (above), are located west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Both are vulnerable to climate change. Thwaites is one of the most unstable glaciers in Antarctica and is at risk of rapid retreat. The details shown in this image from Sentinel-1D remind us of the fragility of glaciers in the Antarctic. And since 2025 is the United Nation’s International Year of Glaciers' Preservation, it is timely to see this image, captured on 6 November 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This image also uses multiple radar polarisations to capture enhanced data on the landscape. In this image, the sea ice in the water is visible in tones of purple or violet, while the glacier appears white.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The publication of these images also follows the 30th meeting of the Conference of Parties, or COP30, where the consequences of climate change and the mitigating actions needed were discussed. The World Meteorological Organization’s State of the Climate Update for COP30 notes that glaciers, from October 2023 to September 2024, lost the largest amount of ice on record back to 1950. The report states this is equivalent to 1.2 mm of global mean sea-level rise. The report also notes that, on 24 February 2025, the extent of Antarctic sea-ice reached its third lowest extent since satellite records began in 1978, the lowest being in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simonetta Cheli, Director of ESA’s Earth Observation Programmes, said, “This is a great achievement and I am so pleased to see these results from Sentinel-1D. It really places the data we receive from our innovative missions in the spotlight – it is data that we as a society rely upon as we continue to discuss and take action on climate change, and also data that we need in applications for understanding and studying our planet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The Sentinel-1 team has done an amazing job and I would like to thank everyone within ESA, together with our partners in the space industry and European institutions, for delivering work of such high quality. It’s an honour to deliver this mission for the Copernicus Earth observation programme, and we thank the Commission for their support and collaboration. We look forward also to developing the Sentinel missions of the future, to further extend the capacity and potential of Copernicus for Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ESA’s Sentinel-1 Project Manager, Ramón Torres, expressed the whole team’s pride, “Unveiling the first images from Sentinel-1D is an incredibly emotional milestone for all of us. The sense of awe and fulfilment goes beyond the thrill of liftoff itself, because seeing those breathtaking images from the SAR instrument brings our hard work to life. They are not just pictures – they are proof of our vision becoming reality, underlining how cutting-edge this mission truly is. The fact that these stunning images also confirm the satellite’s health and flawless operation fills us with relief and joy. And to have achieved all of this within an astonishingly short time – just over two days after launch – makes this moment even more unforgettable for our team.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Spring 2025 (227-0003-10L)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welcome to the wiki for Digital Design and Computer Architecture for Spring 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Announcements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Course Information&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Description&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The class provides a first introduction to the design of digital circuits and computer architecture. It covers technical foundations of how a computing platform is designed from the bottom up. It introduces various execution paradigms, hardware description languages, and principles in digital design and computer architecture. The focus is on fundamental techniques employed in the design of modern microprocessors and their hardware/software interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Objectives&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This class provides a first approach to Computer Architecture. The students learn the design of digital circuits in order to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;understand the basics,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;understand the principles (of design),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;understand the precedents (in computer architecture).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on such understanding, the students are expected to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;learn how a modern computer works underneath, from the bottom up,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;evaluate tradeoffs of different designs and ideas,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;implement a principled design (a simple microprocessor),&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;learn to systematically debug increasingly complex systems,&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;hopefully be prepared to develop novel, out-of-the-box designs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The focus is on basics, principles, precedents, and how to use them to create/implement good designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46098747</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 17:45:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Does 'Laziness' Start in the Brain?</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/nov/30/does-laziness-start-in-the-brain-apathy-motivation</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="794b122c2c0baffc"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We all know people with very different levels of motivation. Some will go the extra mile in any endeavour. Others just can’t be bothered to put the effort in. We might think of them as lazy – happiest on the sofa, rather than planning their latest project. What’s behind this variation? Most of us would probably attribute it to a mixture of temperament, circumstances, upbringing or even values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But research in neuroscience and in patients with brain disorders is challenging these assumptions by revealing the brain mechanisms that underlie motivation. When these systems become dysfunctional, people who were once highly motivated can become pathologically apathetic. Whereas previously they might have been curious, highly engaged and productive – at work, in their social lives and in their creative thinking – they can suddenly seem like the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, in my clinic, I saw a young man called David who had been a high-flyer in his firm but suddenly lost interest in his job as well as the people around him. Previously, he’d been a productive and outgoing person who always seemed to take the initiative at work and in his social circle, but now David did very little and didn’t seem to care. As he put it, he “just couldn’t be arsed”. Eventually, he was fired from his job but reacted with complete indifference. He couldn’t even be bothered to register for unemployment benefit. Seeing that he was unable to pay his rent, David’s friends offered him a room in their house. They soon regretted it. He did nothing all day, waiting for his mates to come home to cook for him. His GP tried him on an antidepressant, but it had no effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;David wasn’t depressed, though. In fact he was quite happy. After looking deeper into his case, we discovered that the cause was actually two tiny strokes, one on each side of the brain. These were located in the basal ganglia, nuclei that are crucial for motivated behaviour. Research in animals and humans has shown that the basal ganglia connect our needs and wants to actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the basal ganglia are dysfunctional, people don’t initiate actions even though they are able to do so if they are prompted. David, for example, could put the rubbish out or clean the house if he was asked. But left to his own devices he did nothing. Studies in people who develop apathy have shown that many of them just don’t find it sufficiently rewarding to take action. The cost of making the effort doesn’t seem worth the potential benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some patients, drugs that boost the dopamine system in the brain can restore motivation. Dopamine plays a key role in the reward system of the brain – but whereas previously neuroscientists thought it was a chemical associated with pleasure, recent research shows that it works by driving “want” – incentivising people to seek the outcomes they find rewarding. David was successfully treated in this way: his motivation levels went back up after taking a drug that stimulates dopamine receptors in the brain. Because of this, he was able to get a new job, become independent and even find a partner, something he would never have bothered to do when he was in his apathetic state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lessons from patients such as David can be applied to healthy people who experience apathy. At Oxford University, we scanned the brains of students with contrasting levels of motivation – from extremely motivated to severely apathetic. We found significant differences in how their brains looked. That’s not, in itself, surprising. There’s natural variation in all of the biological systems that make us who we are, with contributions from our different genetics and environment. Intriguingly, though, we saw that the brain regions involved in motivation were working harder in the more apathetic students when we asked them to make choices about whether a particular course of action was worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why might this be the case? We know that almost everyone is willing to work for large rewards. A recurrent finding in apathetic people is that, unlike their more motivated counterparts, they are unwilling to put in the effort when the reward seems small. In our study, we asked people to decide whether to perform a brief action – squeezing a hand-grip at different levels of effort – in exchange for small monetary rewards, represented on the screen by apples. Some choices were obvious: “one apple for maximum effort” (not worth it) or “15 apples for moderate effort” (definitely worth it). But there were less clearcut offers, such as “six apples for 80% effort”. Motivated people decided quickly. Apathetic people slowed down, hesitating far longer over the borderline cases. Their brains had to work more to reach a decision – and thinking hard is aversive, something we tend to avoid if we can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So deciding whether something is worth the effort seems to tax apathetic people more, meaning they sidestep the decision altogether. When faced with a choice to actually do something, they’re biased towards simply saying “no”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does this mean for the supposedly lazy among us, or their friends and loved ones, who might welcome a change of attitude? It’s likely that chiding or haranguing them – as though apathy were a moral choice – isn’t going to work. Instead, researchers are focusing on that reluctance to even think about how worthwhile an activity might be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One practical way to circumvent this is to make a plan for the day or week ahead. This provides a structured routine that reduces the burden of having to think repeatedly about whether each activity is worth the effort. You make the choices in advance, so that you aren’t waylaid by each one in the moment. Ideally, some of those activities should be personally meaningful and lead to a sense of accomplishment or pleasure. That can help to reinforce the value of engaging in them, making the reward seem larger – which in turn makes the decision easier to say yes to next time round.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, several studies have shown that moving your body can have a positive impact on apathy. Aerobic exercise three times a week for 40-60 minutes, taking dance lessons, or even vigorous walking, can improve motivation, possibly through effects on the brain’s dopamine system. External prompts such as alarms on smartphones or visual reminders (for example, placing running shoes by the door to prompt a visit to the gym or a run) can also be effective in cueing actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal of these types of intervention is to work with the brain, making use of what we’ve discovered about the roots of apathy – partly through understanding unusual cases like David’s. The key to changing everyday behaviour is to make the evaluation of costs (effort) and benefits (rewards) a habit that doesn’t seem too much like hard work. Even for the most apathetic among us, this holds out the hope of turning a kneejerk “no” into an ability to consider saying “yes”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, we are jopejoe1 and Leona Maroni, the release managers of the newest release of NixOS. We are very proud to announce the public availability of NixOS 25.11 “Xantusia”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NixOS is a Linux distribution. Its underlying package repository Nixpkgs can also be used on other Linux systems and macOS with the Nix package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This release will receive bugfixes and security updates for seven months (up until 2026-06-30). The old release 25.05 “Warbler” is now officially deprecated and will reach its end-of-life and stop receiving security updates after 2025-12-31.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 25.11 release was made possible due to the efforts of 2742 contributors, who authored 59430 commits since the previous release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Highlights&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our vast and routinely maintained set of packages has also been updated. This release of Nixpkgs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Added 7002 new packages&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Updated 25252 existing packages&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Removed 6338 outdated packages, in an effort to keep the package set maintainable and secure.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to packages from Nixpkgs, the NixOS Linux distribution also features composable configuration modules and integration tests for distributed systems. This release of NixOS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Added 107 new modules and 1778 configuration options&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Removed 41 outdated modules and 807 configuration options.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;GNOME 49&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GNOME has been updated to version 49 “Brescia”, which removes X11 session support, introduces a new video player, a new document viewer, a redesigned calender and more changes. Refer to the release notes for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;C compilers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLVM has been updated to version 21. GCC remains at version 14. CMake was updated to version 4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Special Thanks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to personally thank&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
