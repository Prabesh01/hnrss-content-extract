  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grayskull is a minimalist, dependency-free computer vision library designed for microcontrollers and other resource-constrained devices. It focuses on grayscale images and provides modern, practical algorithms that fit in a few kilobytes of code. Single-header design, integer-based operations, pure C99.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Image operations: copy, crop, resize (bilinear), downsample&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Filtering: blur, Sobel edges, thresholding (global, Otsu, adaptive)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Morphology: erosion, dilation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Geometry: connected components, perspective warp&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Features: FAST/ORB keypoints and descriptors (object tracking)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Local binary patterns: LBP cascades to detect faces, vehicles etc&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Utilities: PGM read/write&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As usual, no dependencies, no dynamic memory allocation, no C++, no surprises. Just a single header file under 1KLOC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check out the examples folder for more!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For as long as I have published my books, one of my overarching goals was to give credit to those who actually invented the hardware and software that we use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have spent 10,000+ hours to create an accurate record of their work but I'm not complaining. The 'as-close-to-possible' truth of invention by individuals or teams meant identifying the work, educating myself, writing questions, and sending emails. And after that process, I set up a chat because it all gets down to talking to someone on the other side of the world, about something that happened 30 or 40 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the invention involves a team, I try to interview more than one person, so I can cross-check the facts. Not to call anyone out, it’s just that, given time, we all forget the facts. And everyone adds their personal take. It’s because of that, for example, that I know the English musician Peter Gabriel really did visit Apple's research labs as they tested the Apple Sound Chip, and gave the team his personal approval to use the song 'Red Rain' for the Macintosh II launch. Wil Oxford, Steve Perlman, Mike Potel, Mark Lentczner and Steve Milne told me so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I was wrapping up Version 2.3 of Inventing the Future, I spoke with Steve M and Mark about the AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format) audio standard that they built around the same time as their VIP visit. They did so as professional programmers, amateur musicians and electronic music experts. Milne and Lentczner knew users needed a standard file format to make their work lives easier and to fend off confusion in the nascent MIDI marketplace. But it didn't exist. So Steve and Mark consulted with users and manufacturers in the Apple cafeteria after hours. This work is interesting on its own but it also underpinned other research. The AIFF, Apple Sound Chip, and MIDI Manager work scaffolded QuickTime and its extensible video formats and programs in 1991. Senior engineer Toby Farrand told me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Audio drove the development of QuickTime more than anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So who or what drove the development of AIFF?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steve and Mark referred me to the IFF (Interchange File Format (IFF) and the TIFF (Tag Image File Format) that were built before AIFF, in 1985 and 1986 respectively. These file formats were the benchmark for open media standards. My search pivoted, as it always does, to understand those inventions. I expected to be able to find the engineer or engineers names, track them down and interview them. It has worked around 100 times before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jerry Morrison created IFF while working at Electronic Arts and then went to Apple, where he liaised with the AIFF team. I could easily background his work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I turned my attention to TIFF, built initially as an image standard for desktop publishing. TIFF was able to store monochrome, grayscale, and color images, alongside metadata such as size, compression algorithms, and color space information. In many ways, it was a lot like AIFF so I was keen to know more. But I couldn't find a TIFF creator. No matter how I enquired, Aldus created TIFF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear, while a search for AIFF will offer up a company (Apple) not a person, I was able to find Milne and Lentczner in part because of their unique names and because Apple publicised the AIFF work and those publications are archived.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All I had was Aldus, an American company that created desktop publishing with the help of Apple and Adobe. In fact, Paul Brainerd, the cofounder of Aldus coined the term 'desktop publishing' to quickly explain the technicality of what they were doing to potential investors. But Aldus and their seminal product, PageMaker, are long gone, and there were no breadcrumbs for TIFF's creation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, after a day-long trawl through MacWeek back issues, I found Steve Carlson. (below)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I ran a similar length search through the Computer History Museum’s amazing Oral Histories transcriptions. Brainerd mentioned Carlson's name in an interview. (below)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it was too brief an explanation so I kept looking. Then the trail went cold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that was because, folks had misspelt his name when quoting him and then that was copied into magazines, and reviews and so forth. Brainerd's CHM interview transcript was wrong. But I didn’t know that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just kept looking for Steve Carlson.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found other inventors because they had unique middle or last names or by random methods such as searching glider pilot licences in the Napa Valley after a tip from a former colleague that 'so and so' was a pilot in retirement. I had no tips, no links, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why couldn’t I find Steve Carlson?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the while, the answer was right under my nose. I had downloaded the final Aldus TIFF specifications document, hoping to find the author’s name. However, the name is seemingly written in white text on white paper - making it invisible. What?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See below where I have highlighted the region with a blue block over the text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a reason I can’t recall, I downloaded a plain text version and typed in Carlson to see if he was mentioned, but I must have paused at ‘Carls...' and the search functionality automatically filled in the rest. Suddenly I was staring at:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Author/Editor/Arbitrator: Steve Carlsen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘Carls-EN’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A quick trip to Google patents, and a search for Steve Carlsen, Stephen Carlsen. Bingo! Stephen E. Carlsen’s patents at Aldus (and Adobe) in Issaquah, WA.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I checked the geography, as most folks of a certain age do not stray far from the addresses filed in their patents, and typed Stephen’s correctly spelled surname into the online US White Pages for Washington State. There was ‘a’ Stephen Carlsen listed in a retirement village in WA. His age matched, but there were no public facing email addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I searched bulletin boards on the topic of TIFF, as I had found a former Apple engineer that way. Don had picked an abbreviation of his initials and numbers to post on BBS in his college days and then carried that same combination into adulthood. Many of us did. I took a punt pasting his unique prefix into hotmail, gmail etc. and found Don and interviewed him, but - Stephen Carlsen did not show up in a BBS. So, no email to try.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My ‘last straw' method for finding someone is a stamped envelope. I wrote, printed and mailed a one-page letter to Stephen's listed address, and crossed my fingers. Four months later he popped up in my email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a surprise and a relief. We swapped a few emails, and he confirmed the TIFF catalyst story. For Stephen it was 'no big deal'. Once he had built the initial TIFF, Aldus needed to convince 3rd party developers and scanner manufacturers to agree to TIFF as a standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We had to define and promote an industry standard for storing and processing scanned images, so that we wouldn't have to write import filters for every model of every scanner that would soon be entering the budding desktop scanner market."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stephen himself did much of the evangelizing as Paul Brainerd later pointed out:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“(Steve) developed the standard, and then we went out and promoted it in a series of meetings with specific companies - as well as some workshops we ran in Seattle and the Bay Area during the Seybold shows and the MacWorld shows.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I sent Stephen a draft of what I had written and he sent a prompt reply saying - ‘Looks good’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I followed up asking him how he ended up at a tiny startup in Seattle called Aldus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that time, I was interviewing for a graphics position at Boeing Computer Services in Seattle, and noticed a small wanted ad that sounded really interesting, and seemed to be an excellent match for my background and interests. I interviewed with Paul and the 5-person mostly-ex-Atex engineering team, and I was hired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of curiosity I put Stephen's email address, now that I knew it, into a Duck Duck search and found him helping people online with TIFF queries long after Aldus had been acquired by Adobe. He also contributed to a Google Group called tiffcentral.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having interviewed so many people across more than a decade, I’ve got pretty good at judging those who would like to talk or type, those who are verbose and those that are not. I knew Stephen had said what he was going to say. I added his pioneering work on TIFF to the AIFF story and moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two years had flown by when I received an email yesterday. His ex-wife Peggy found my paper letter and wrote to me. Stephen passed away earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your interest in and support of Stephen’s brilliant work creating TIFF. I’m not surprised Stephen didn’t finish corresponding with you, as he had begun to struggle with using his computer and phone. Some days were better than others for him, but he began to lose touch with people during those months you were reaching out to him. He was a humble man, and I guess never pushed to be recognized, although I believe those who worked with him knew the truth. His last week was in my home, where he was never left alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Peggy finished the email with, ‘I called him Mr TIFF up to his last moment.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 10,000+ hours of book research disappeared in an instant. As sad as it was, I could see clearly that all of my work was worth it. Every single second. Because of this email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mr TIFF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last night, as everyone in my house went to sleep, I took a deep breath and edited the Wikipedia page for TIFF, the Tag Image File Format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It no longer reads ‘created by Aldus’, it reads ‘…created by Stephen Carlsen, an engineer at Aldus'&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Microsoft Z-80 SoftCard was a plug-in expansion card for the Apple II that added the ability to run CP/M software. According to Wikipedia, it was Microsoft’s first hardware product and in 1980 was the single largest revenue source for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CP/M runs on an 8080 processor, but the Apple II has a 6502 processor. So how can you run CP/M on an Apple II? Answer: The card comes with its own 8080-compatible processor, the Zilog Z80, which was arguable better than the 8080 for a bunch of reasons given on its Wikipedia page.¹&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great, you now have a processor. But what happens to the old 6502 processor? Ideally, you would just shut it off, but you can’t go cold turkey because some things still had to be handled by the 6502.² Nicole Branagan digs deeper into the story of how the two processors coexist. The idea is that the SoftCard tells the 6502 that it’s doing DMA, so the 6502 pauses and waits for the DMA to complete. However, you can’t leave the 6502 paused for too long or its internal registers degrade and lose their values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution is to take advantage of the Z80’s REFRESH line, which the processor uses to signal that it’s not accessing memory right now (because it’s decoding an instruction). This tells external memory refresh circuitry that it can run and keep the RAM values refreshed so that they don’t degrade and lose their values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the Apple II, memory refreshing is done by the video circuitry, so there is need for a dedicated REFRESH signal. The SoftCard uses this signal to allow the 6502 to execute a tiny little bit. (Presumably it is sitting in a spin loop waiting to be woken.) This keeps the 6502’s registers refreshed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the SoftCard needs the 6502 to do actual work, it can update some memory to tell the 6502, “Break out of your spin loop and do something for me, then let me know the answer and go back to the spin loop.” The Z80 then goes to sleep until it gets an answer from the 6502.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another wrinkle in the way that the 6502 and Z80 shared memory is in the memory map. Both the Z80 and 6502 consider the first 256 bytes of memory to be special and want to use it for different things. Furthermore, CP/M programs expect to be loaded at $0100, but the 6502 hard-codes its CPU stack to live in the range $0100–$01FF. There are other obstacles in the low part of the Apple II memory map: The Apple II system monitor uses $0200–$02FF as its keyboard input buffer, the bytes in the range $03F0–$03FF are used to hold interrupt vectors, and the text video frame buffer goes from $0400–$07FF. (There is a second text video frame buffer from $0800–$0BFF, but almost nobody uses it.) Other big obstacles are the memory range from $C000–$CFFF, which is used by peripheral devices, and the memory range from $D000–$FFFF, which holds the Apple II monitor ROM, but can be replaced by RAM if you have the Language Card (a 16KB memory expansion card), except that the last few bytes $FFFA–$FFFF are used by the CPU as interrupt vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution is to remap the memory by putting address translation circuitry on the SoftCard, so that when the Z80 asks for memory address $0000, say, it actually gets physical memory $1000. The remapping is carefully arranged so that all of the Apple II’s special reserved addresses get shuffled to the end of the Z80 memory map, and all of the Apple II’s normal RAM occupies contiguous address space in the Z80 memory map starting at $0000.³&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;Special use&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SoftCard manual contained lots of details on how to write code for it. For example, it included instructions on how to call into a 6502 subroutine from Z80 and had a chart showing how the memory was remapped for the Z80. It even included the Z80 processor reference manual, listing all the instructions. This will come in handy in a future story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;¹ I don’t know where the hyphen in Z-80 came from.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;² In many places, I/O was handled by timing loops, so if you wanted to access, say, the game paddles, you had to let the 6502 do the I/O with its precise software timing loops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;³ There were also two high resolution graphics frame buffers, one at $2000–$3FFF, and another at $4000–$5FFF. These were right in the middle of the Z80 memory map, but in practice it wasn’t a problem because CP/M was a text-mode operating system, so the programs you were running didn’t try to do graphics anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;She is a mid-level employee in every finance department, in every business across this stupid nation and the Excel goddess herself descended from the heavens, kissed Brenda on her forehead and the sweat from Brenda's brow is what allows us to do capitalism. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;She's gonna birth that formula for a financial report and then she's gonna send that financial report to a higher up and he's gonna need to make a change to the report and normally he would have sent it back to Brenda but he's like oh I have AI and AI is probably like smarter than Brenda and then the AI is gonna fuck it up real bad and he won't be able to recognize it because he doesn't understand Excel because AI hallucinates.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You know who's not hallucinating?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;iOS 26.2 to Allow Third-Party App Stores in Japan Ahead of Regulatory Deadline&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Apple on Tuesday released the first beta of iOS 26.2 to developers, and it appears that the software will allow users in Japan to install alternative app marketplaces on their devices when it is released to the public in December.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;According to a post shared on X by @Tzzlala, iPhones running the beta in Japan are able to install alternative app stores like AltStore PAL and Epic Games, and download apps from them, though Fortnite in-app purchases are currently region-blocked by Epic. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Apple only lets iPhone and iPad users based in the EU to install apps using alternative app marketplaces in addition to the App Store. The ability was introduced in iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 18 in order to comply with the Digital Markets Act, and Apple does not currently allow it in any regions outside the 27-member bloc. However, that's set to change. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;In June 2024, the Japanese parliament approved and enacted legislation that requires Apple to allow third-party app stores and payment providers on the iPhone. The law seeks to curb the dominance of major tech firms like Apple in the smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;More recently, in August 2025, the Japan Fair Trade Commission established the Mobile Software Competition Act Guidelines. Under the new guidelines, platform operators like Apple and Google are banned from blocking or restricting the availability of alternative app stores and payment systems on their mobile operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The guidelines are set to come into effect by December 18, 2025, while Apple is expected to release iOS 26.2 in December, sometime between December 9 and December 16. Epic Games has already announced plans to bring Fortnite and its game store platform to iOS in Japan by late 2025. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Apple is planning to launch at least 15 new products in 2026, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Gurman outlined what to expect from Apple in 2026 in the latest edition of his "Power On" newsletter. He said the company is heading "into one of its most pivotal years in recent memory," with the rollout of major new Apple Intelligence features, intense regulatory pressure on the App Store,...&lt;/p&gt;

Apple is still planning to roll out its revamped version of Siri around March of next year. The release should be accompanied by the release of a new smart home display product with speaker-base and wall-mount options. A new Apple TV and HomePod...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These days, lunchtime at Benjamin N. Cardozo High School in Queens is a boisterous affair, a far cry from before the smartphone ban went into effect, when most students spent their spare time scrolling and teachers said you could hear a pin drop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This year's gotten way louder,” said Jimena Garcia, 15. “Sometimes I would take naps in the lunchroom, but now I can't because of the noise. But it's fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a recent fall afternoon, Garcia and her friends crowded around a lunch table in the large cafeteria playing Jenga, occasionally shrieking and gasping as the tower began to lean and fall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The faculty donated board games to help ease kids into the phone-free era. Student volunteers oversaw a table stacked with games: checkers, chess, Yahtzee, Scrabble, Clue, Life and Trivial Pursuit. For many of the kids, it was their first time playing the games, and they said they were enjoying it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“ I do like how this phone ban is allowing students to just connect with each other, make new friendships,” said 17-year-old Alyssa Ko, the school president. “Because some people use their phone to just hide away.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ban prohibits all internet-enabled devices throughout the school day, although there are exceptions for some students with disabilities, kids learning English who need translation apps, and in cases where a teacher says a device can be used for a lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Schools were given flexibility to choose their own storage plans, and Cardozo, which rolled out metal detectors this fall after a student was found with a gun, requires its 3,100 students to keep their phones in internet-blocking magnetic pouches. Other schools have installed storage lockers, or have kids keep their phones zipped up in backpacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As students adjust to lo-fi life, teachers seem pleased with the results. According to an October survey from the state teachers union, New York State United Teachers, 89% of school staff members said the new policies improved their schools' environments, and 76% said kids are more engaged in lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“When students put down their phones, they pick up books — and build friendships,” said NYSUT president Melinda Person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The initial feedback reflects national trends. New York is one of 31 states, plus Washington, D.C. that have banned smartphones in schools, according to an EdWeek tracker. In a national survey from the University of Pennsylvania, teachers said banning phones helps kids focus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Teachers seem really happy with the changes that they're seeing in the classroom with the electronic device ban,” Cardozo principal Meagan Colby said. “They're telling us that there's a lot more student interaction, a lot more discussion among students, a lot better focus. Overall productivity in the classroom and engagement is higher.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior Raya Osagie, 16, said she has to “think more in class” because she used to Google answers or use artificial intelligence. “Now when we get computers, I actually have to [do] deep research instead of going straight to AI,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Students said they’ve also seen their classmates reading physical books more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the cafeteria, Ryan Tripathi, 16, was paging through “Lord of the Flies,” which he said is slow-going. “I'm just not used to reading,” he said. “I’m usually on my phone.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tripathi said it’s good that people are reading more and classroom discussions have become more lively. But he said he’s “not the biggest fan” of the smartphone ban. ”Sometimes you just want to go on your phone and you don't have the ability to do that anymore,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enakshi Barua, 14, said she’s also opposed to the ban, on principle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“ Students are distracted by the phones, but I also don’t believe they should take away our privileges," Barua said. "I feel like the trust isn’t there between the students and teachers. So I feel like that should be built instead of banning the phones.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Cardozo, a few kids break the rules, teachers said. Some either put “burner” phones in their pouches or bang them open. Shanna Burrows, who oversees restorative justice at the school, said staff members are collecting around 30 contraband phones a day. There’s a strike system with escalating punishments that include keeping phones for days, weeks or months, and meetings with parents. Under the state law, schools are not allowed to suspend students solely for smartphone-ban infractions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Students said they have found other ways to push boundaries, like passing old-fashioned notes. “ Especially when you're trying to talk but not have the teacher notice … it would just be [that] we’d send a text message or write on our notes app,” Ko said. “Passing notes is more common now.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ko said other analog activities have also made a comeback, including cards, hangman, tic-tac-toe and Polaroid cameras. “There are just a lot of memories that we make throughout high school that we want to capture,” she said. “I actually have a lot of Polaroids on my wall.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tiana Millen, assistant principal of climate and culture, said she’d also like to see another analog technology make a comeback: the clock.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They don't know how to read the clocks," she said. "So I make jokes with them and say, ‘We're going to have classes just on how to read the clocks.’”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If they did, she said, they’d see they’re getting to class on time more than they used to; hallway traffic is moving better now that kids aren’t so focused on their phones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiant Computer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiant's purpose is to explore what personal computing could be when designed from first principles.&lt;/p&gt;We believe the current trajectory of personal computing is leading us to a less free world, and that only a new computing movement rooted in human dignity, creation and autonomy can change its course.&lt;p&gt;Radiant is a computer reimagined from the ground up, a clean-slate design free from the historical baggage that plagues modern systems, and free from Big Tech's influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a computer designed to help you learn, create, play, and explore. It's a space to focus, free from distractions. A return to the simple joy of computing: just you and your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computers today are designed around engagement and surveillance business models rather than user needs. App stores are filled with adware. Operating systems prioritize data collection over user agency. Social media algorithms optimize for addiction. Big Tech fundamentally reshaped computing from a tool for human empowerment into an attention extraction machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiant proposes an alternative vision for computing. It doesn't ship with a web browser; it has its own network reminiscent of the early Internet: no social media, no scripts, no trackers. It's a from-scratch system that doesn't retrace the footsteps of the contemporary OS. It's a new paradigm for personal computing that uses modern advances mindfully and deliberately. It's fully open, from hardware to software. It's an offline-first space, designed for focus and creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Code is computing's native medium; the material you shape to build your own tools, stories, and spaces. Radiant is designed to make that accessible to everyone. It's a tool for personal computing where every application and every surface, exists as code you can read, edit, and extend. It's a system you can truly own. One that is designed to bring the joy of computing to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing software doesn't have to be daunting, but the platforms and tools we're stuck with make it so. Radiant aims to change that and truly empower users to create. Furthermore, advances in generative A.I. will make coding accessible to a much broader audience. One of our goals is to explore how an A.I.-native computer system can enhance the creative process, all while keeping data private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiant belongs to a more humane future: a personal computer that welcomes curiosity, invites experimentation, and keeps the power in your hands. This is personal computing for the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find out more about the Radiant system, or read our design principles and tenets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiant is an ongoing research project in personal computing.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has admitted that it can't protect EU data from U.S. snooping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In sworn testimony before a French Senate inquiry into the role of public procurement in promoting digital sovereignty, Anton Carniaux, Microsoft France's director of public and legal affairs, was asked whether he could guarantee that French citizen data would never be transmitted to U.S. authorities without explicit French authorization. And, he replied, "No, I cannot guarantee it."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He said that the company resisted requests from the US authorities "when they are not well-founded", but that under the U.S. Cloud Act, U.S. companies can be forced to hand over data, regardless of where it is stored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Carniaux did say that the situation had never arisen. However, the admission raises serious concerns around European data sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Microsoft has openly admitted what many have long known: under laws like the Cloud Act, US authorities can compel access to data held by American cloud providers, regardless of where that data physically resides. UK or EU servers make no difference when jurisdiction lies elsewhere, and local subsidiaries or ‘trusted’ partnerships don’t change that reality," commented Mark Boost, CEO of cloud provider Civo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is more than a technicality. It is a real-world issue that can impact national security, personal privacy and business competitiveness."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The inquiry centers around Project Bleu - a partnership between Microsoft, Orange and Capgemini. There were concerns about the Health Data Hub medical research platform, which is hosted on Microsoft Azure. Senate members said they couldn't be sure that the two platforms were sufficiently separated, and that sensitive health data wouldn't be shared.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Carniaux's admission will increase concerns that the EU can't afford to be reliant on the big U.S. cloud providers such as Microsoft and AWS - even when they claim to be offering sovereign cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The French Senate has set a precedent by demanding answers, and the UK and Europe have an opportunity to do the same," said Boost. "We’re already seeing a shift towards building homegrown solutions that support true data sovereignty rather than data residency."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, a recent European Parliament report found that U.S. firms account for 69% of the cloud infrastructure market share in Europe, while EU suppliers hold only 13%.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A p2p Vision for QUIC&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article was co-authored by Christian Huitema. You can find his blog at privateoctopus.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the years, the IETF has standardized numerous protocols for establishing IP packet flows through NATs and firewalls, including STUN, ICE, and TURN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an inherently messy topic, and I can highly recommend reading Eric Rescorla’s blog post series about NATs (part 1, part 2, part 3). I won’t go into details about how exactly NATs work (again, read the ekr’s blog posts!), but in a nutshell, they rewrite the IP of packets passing through the NAT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(192.168.1.10) participant NAT as NAT&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(203.0.113.5) participant Server as Server&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(198.51.100.20) Client-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;NAT: Packet (Src: 192.168.1.10:1234) NAT-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Server: Packet (Src: 203.0.113.5:4321) Server--&amp;gt;&amp;gt;NAT: Response (Dst: 203.0.113.5:4321) NAT--&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Client: Response (Dst: 192.168.1.10:1234)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This allows multiple clients behind that NAT to share the same external IP address. Clients are able to reach any server on the internet, but it doesn’t allow nodes on the internet to reach the client, since the NAT won’t forward packets to the client, unless it determines that they belong to an existing flow. In that sense, the NAT acts as a firewall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although simple in theory, there are a lot of different ways to implement a NAT. For our purposes, the main difference lies in how the port numbers for the outgoing packets are allocated. Depending on the port allocation logic, it might or might not possible to establish a direct connection between two peers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem that p2p network engineers hope to solve is the following: How can two nodes that are both behind a NAT, respectively, connect to each other, no matter the kind of NAT?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post, we explore how QUIC can be leveraged to provide a comprehensive solution for NAT traversal, encompassing everything from address discovery to UDP proxying, potentially simplifying and improving upon traditional p2p networking approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Traditional Way&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Address Discovery using STUN&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depending on the deployment scenario, a new node joining the network might or might not know its (public) IP address. Traditionally, applications use STUN (RFC 8489) to discover their public IP address. In a nutshell, a STUN client sends a “Binding Request” to a STUN server. The “Binding Response” of the server encodes the IP source address and the source port that the server observed on the client’s request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The client can infer from the responses to the STUN requests if it is located behind a NAT. The client might even compare responses from different STUN servers and attempt to infer the type of NAT, although this is notoriously difficult to get right. The IETF has pretty much given up on this approach (see section 2 of RFC 5389).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The STUN protocol can run over UDP, TCP, DTLS (RFC 7350) or TLS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hole Punching Coordination using ICE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we’ve seen above, once the NAT has seen the first packet to a remote server pass through, the NAT opens up the return path, allowing packets from the outside world to reach the node. The idea behind hole punching is to have both peers send packets simultaneously, each of them “punching” a hole in their respective firewall, establishing a direct flow of packets between the two nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The traditional hole punching process is specified by ICE RFC 8445. ICE starts with an address gathering phase, in which the two peers separately contact STUN servers to obtain lists of candidate IP addresses and ports. They may add to that list a set of TURN addresses (see next section, “relaying”).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the endpoints creates a list of available addresses, ordered by priority, and sends it to its peer. The peer compares that to its own list, establishes a list of “candidate pairs”, and sends it back. At that point, both endpoints have the same list of candidate pairs, and start the “connectivity” check. Each host will try to send a STUN binding request from its selected address to the paired address, and respond to STUN requests that it might receive from the peer. If at least one of these trials succeeds, the peers have established a new connection over this address pair. If several succeed, they keep the preferred pair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Relaying using TURN&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, no matter how hard you try, there is a certain percentage of nodes for whom hole punching will never work. This is because their NAT behaves in an unpredictable way. While most NATs are well-behaved, some aren’t. This is one of the sad facts of life that network engineers have to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only solution for this problem is to employ the help of a third party, i.e. a server that is not located behind a NAT, and therefore can be reached by peers directly, without any hole punching. This server can then relay traffic between the two peers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, this comes at a cost. The path via the relay might be slower (in terms of latency and / or bandwidth) than a (hypothetical) direct path would have been. And relaying traffic is not for free for the operator of the relay: both processing resources as well as bandwidth cost money. However, we don’t really have a choice here, and despite these shortcomings, having a relayed connection might be preferable to having no connectivity at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The traditional solution relies on TURN servers, specified in RFC 5766 to provide these “last resort” connectivity. The node behind a NAT can ask the TURN server to open an UDP or TCP port. This “TURN Port” is usually specialized: the client specifies the address of the peer that will be able to send data to that port, or to which data will be sent. The corresponding IP address and port number will be sent to the peer, and will be the basis for some last resort “candidate pairs” used in the coordinated hole punching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The previous section mentioned that in some cases more than one tried address pair will succeed. This is particularly true for the pairs that include a TURN provided address. This is why the trials will try to collect all the working pairs and pick the higher priority one. If both a “hole punching” and a “TURN” pair succeed, they will typically only retain the “hole punching” pair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The QUIC Way&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;QUIC Connection Migration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RFC 9000 defines how clients can migrate an existing QUIC connection to a different IP:port tuple. When we designed this mechanism, the primary use case we envisioned was solving the “parking lot problem”. Imagine you have a mobile phone, and you walk from your office (where the phone has WiFi) to the parking lot (with no / bad WiFi coverage). In this case, the client could detect that the WiFi connection is worsening, and migrate the connection to its cellular interface. Crucially, this would keep all connection state (e.g. open streams, datagram flows, etc.) intact, and would therefore be transparent to the application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On detecting a network interface change, e.g. leaving the office, QUIC Path Migration works by first sending a so-called probing packet to the server. The purpose of this packet is to probe if the path actually works. The client includes a PATH_CHALLENGE frame in this packet, to which the server responds with a PATH_RESPONSE frame. This makes sure that the new path actually works (for example, that the path doesn’t block UDP packets), and supports QUIC (for example, allows packets that satisfy QUIC’s MTU requirements).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the wire, this path probing procedure looks pretty similar to a hole punch attempt. We just need a tiny modification to make this work in the p2p use case: If we could get the server to send probe packets as well, we could kill two birds with one stone: We’d punch a hole through the firewall, and at the same time verify connectivity on the path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course this is not the only thing needed to achieve hole punching. Before the nodes can even send probe packets, we need to learn about the peer’s reflexive address, and be able to coordinate the timing. We’ll come to this in a bit, but first we’ll describe how we can replace STUN to discover our reflexive addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;QUIC Address Discovery&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typically nodes use STUN to discover their reflexive addresses. In essence, STUN is a request-response protocol here, where the client requests the server to report the observed address of the request packet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In principle, we could achieve the same inside of a QUIC connection: The server could report the address of the client using, for example, a newly defined QUIC frame, and vice versa. This is exactly what the QUIC Address Discovery draft specifies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mechanism is really simple: every time a new path is established (incl. the path used for the handshake), endpoints inform each other of the observed address. This is a very efficient mechanism: Since the OBSERVED_ADDRESS frame is defined as a probing frame, it can be bundled with the PATH_CHALLENGE and PATH_RESPONSE frames used to probe a new path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Performing address discovery over QUIC comes with multiple advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;QUIC packets are encrypted. An observer is not able to observe the exchange of OBSERVED_ADDRESS frames, nor interfere with this exchange (e.g. by tampering with the frame contents).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It doesn’t require running any additional services (i.e. a STUN server / client). It’s sufficient to enable the Address Discovery extension on a large enough number of nodes.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, in either case the client has to trust that the server is sending honest responses. A misbehaving server could respond with spoofed addresses, causing the “hole punching” packets to later be sent to these addresses. This is not hard to defend against: Clients can obtain some protection against such attacks by contacting several servers and comparing their responses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hole Punching Coordination&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The node has now learned its reflexive addresses, and we know how to use QUIC’s connection migration mechanism to establish the NAT port mappings required to allow the establishment of a direct path. We now want to establish a connection to another node, behind its respective NAT.For the moment, we’ll assume that the two nodes are able to communicate via a (proxied) QUIC connection. We’ll see how this works in detail in the next section. The only thing that matters for now is that the nodes are able to communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NAT traversal draft defines how two nodes can negotiate hole punching attempts with each other. Out of convenience, the process is driven almost entirely by the client (i.e. the node that initiated the QUIC connection). This is not because the roles of the peers are fundamentally different (they are both peers in the same p2p network), but it leads to significant simplifications of the protocol. It also reduces the difference to RFC 9000, where connection migration can only be initiated by the client.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The server informs the clients about its reflexive address using ADD_ADDRESS frames. Multiple ADD_ADDRESS frames can be sent if the server has multiple reflexive addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ICE RFC goes into great detail on how to form candidate pairs from both nodes’ reflexive addresses, because both nodes need to agree on the ordering of the candidate pairs. Since the client is driving this process, we don’t need to specify any address matching logic that client and server would need to agree on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the client has formed address pairs (and once it feels like it’s the right time to start a hole punch attempt), it sends a PUNCH_ME_NOW frame to the server. The PUNCH_ME_NOW contains both the client’s and the server’s reflexive addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Immediately after sending the PUNCH_ME_NOW frame, the client starts path probing on the path formed by these two addresses. Equivalently, as soon as the server receives the PUNCH_ME_NOW frame, it starts path probing the path from its end. Timing is crucial here: As we’ve seen above, the path probing packets create the NAT binding required to allow the other side’s packets to make it through the NAT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both the client and the server will send PATH_CHALLENGE frames on a new path when sending or responding to &lt;code&gt;PUNCH_ME_NOW&lt;/code&gt;. They will need to allocate a yet unused Connection ID to the new path that they
are trying to establish. This implies that the number of parallel attempts is limited by the number of available Connection ID. This has both upsides and downside. On the one hand, having a limit reduces the amount of resource that a peer can be forced to consume, which makes the protocol more stable.
On the other hand, if the limits are reached, the next attempt will only be possible after one of the previous challenges has been abandoned, and the peer has provided a replacement Connection ID. This might be a slow process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether that process is too slow is debatable. Endpoints that plan to engage in p2p hole punching may be configured to provide a number of Connection IDs sufficient for most practical attempts. Also, the initial path will be available until the migration succeeds, which means the application endpoints do not need to wait the success of the negotiation to start exchanging data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding new QUIC frames like &lt;code&gt;ADD_ADDRESS&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;PUNCH_ME_NOW&lt;/code&gt; is somewhat controversial. Misbehaving peers could send spoofed addresses in these frames, causing the peer to send hole punching packets to third parties. This is similar to the request forgery attacks described in the security section of RFC 9000, and calls at least for the same kind of defenses. This is something we will keep in mind when evolving the NAT traversal draft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Relaying UDP packets over HTTP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RFC 9298 defines how UDP packets can be proxied in HTTP. The exchange starts a regular HTTP request: The client sends a so-called Extended CONNECT request to the proxy on a QUIC stream, instructing the proxy to open a UDP socket and proxy a flow of UDP packets to a target server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the proxy has accepted the proxying request, UDP packets are sent in HTTP Datagrams (RFC 9297), which themselves are a thin wrapper around QUIC DATAGRAM frames. QUIC Datagrams are a new QUIC frame defined in RFC 9221, which are sent in QUIC packets exchanged after completion of the QUIC handshake. They’re therefore encrypted the same way that any other data exchanged over the QUIC connection is. However, if a packet containing a DATAGRAM is lost, the DATAGRAM frame is not retransmitted. This makes DATAGRAMs suitable to proxy unreliable packets, such as UDP packets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple UDP flows to different target servers can be proxied in the same QUIC connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proxying UDP packets is almost what we need to make relaying work in the p2p scenario, but not quite: While the client can reach any IP via the proxy, it’s still not possible for other nodes to communicate with the client (unless contacted first by the client).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there’s already a draft describing how to Proxy UDP Listeners in HTTP. The primary use case for this draft is running WebRTC over CONNECT-UDP. This is a very similar problem to the one we’re trying to solve: WebRTC peers actually use the ICE protocol to establish a direct connection, and for that they need to know their reflexive transport addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mechanism is pretty straight-forward: The proxy allocates a new IP:port for the client, and forwards all UDP packets on this socket to the client. Of course, it also has to include the 2-tuple that the packet originated from.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simplificity of this approach is at the same time its biggest limitation: Since there are only 65535 port numbers (many of which are reserved), a proxy can only handle a limited number of clients at the same time. To be clear, this still allows tens of thousands of concurrent clients, and many deployment scenarios will never run into this limit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might be possible to work around this limit in the future by using a similar approach as the QUIC-aware proxying draft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Preparing for Multipath&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The QUIC Working Group is finalizing the Multipath Extensions for QUIC. As the name suggests, this extensions allow multiple paths to be used simultaneously. For the p2p use case, this means that endpoints could keep the initial path available, even after a direct path was created by NAT traversal. These paths could either be used for load sharing or as a backup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get these benefits, we will need minor adaptations of the mechanism described here – effectively, managing connection IDs and path IDs in a multipath version of the &lt;code&gt;PUNCH_ME_NOW&lt;/code&gt; frame. We should work on that once the Multipath Extension for QUIC has made more progress in the IETF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Putting All the Pieces Together&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve explored all the components, let’s put them together and build a small p2p application running on top of QUIC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the node boots up, it first connects to a few hard-coded boot nodes. The majority of these nodes support the QUIC Address Discovery extension, so the node is able to learn that it’s behind a NAT, and what the NAT’s public addresses are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It then connects to a relay and reserves an IP:port tuple with the relay. The node can now advertise this address to other peers in the network, for example by registering in some kind of peer directory, or by registering itself with the p2p network’s DHT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, other nodes can connect to the relay at this port, and have all their packets relayed. We’ve achieved the first goal: we have established connectivity. The relayed connections can immediately be used to exchange application data. Now the goal is to lighten the load on the relay server, and to obtain a direct (and potentially lower-latency, higher-throughput) to the peer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The nodes employ the mechanism described in the NAT traversal draft to punch holes through their respective NATs. This hole punching procedure might take a few attempts, depending on the number of candidate pairs (and if hole punching attempts are run in parallel), but should generally only take a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most importantly, this is entirely transparent to the application: The application can start to use the relayed connection, and use it all the while the QUIC stack tries to establish the direct path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where are we on this?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, there’s no implementation of this protocol in production, but a lot of the documents have made their way through the IETF process and have now become widely deployed RFCs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Specifically, the remaining pieces of the puzzle are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Proxy UDP Listeners in HTTP draft, which allows clients to reserve an IP:port tuple on a relay server.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The QUIC Address Discovery draft, which allows endpoints to learn about their public addresses. The current version of this draft is implemented by two different QUIC stacks: picoquic and a fork of quinn.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The NAT Traversal for QUIC draft, which defines how to coordinate hole punching attempts between peers.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The quic-go project and the QUIC Interop Runner are community-funded projects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For all the history of computational mathematical visualization, graphing equations has been done in binary mode - where graphs show only where an equation is EXACTLY equal. But when you only see in black-and-white, some things are invisible. For all this time, lurking beneath the error == 0 surface, mathematical shadows have been lurking in the equations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FuzzyGraph, on the other hand, visualizes equations in Non-Binary mode - showing not only where an equation are exactly equal, but also where the equation nearly equal and where the equation is far from equal (where the error is high). Sometimes, these high error areas form clear visual shadow-like features.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's look at some examples...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the "Slash Dot" Equation ( \( \frac{y}{x^2+y^2} = \frac{x+1}{x^2+y^2} \)) as both a conventional and fuzzy graph...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note the giant black hole that is present in the Fuzzy/Non-Binary graph, but invisible in conventional/Binary graphing. This "black hole" feature represents a region of high error in the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's look at another example: \(y = \frac{x}{x^2 + y^2} \) &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that the black hole eye-looking features are COMPLETELY INVISIBLE in the conventional/binary mode of graphing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get a better idea of what these black hole things are, let's look at a simpler example. First let's look at the opposite of a black hole - a simple star/particle example: \( x^2 + y^2 = 0 \). For this equation, there is only 1 solution: (0, 0). So if you graph this in a conventional graphing app, it will only show a single dot at (0, 0). But in FuzzyGraph, it looks like a fuzzy particle or something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But now, let's invert this to get the "Black Hole Equation": \( \frac{1}{x^2+y^2} = 0 \)...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case, there is absolutely nothing to show on a conventional graph, as there are actual solutions to this equations. However, there is still a mathematical topography which can be visualized (as can be seen in the fuzzy graph).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not all of the Shadows are like black holes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this example, let's start by combining 2 lines together: \(y=x\) and \(y=-x\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can visually add 2 equations together by refactoring them so they are both equal to 0, and then multiplying the two refactored equations together. \(y=x\) can be changed to \(y-x=0\), and \(y=-x\) can be refactored to \(y+x=0\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can then combine 2 into a single equation these like this: \( (y-x) \times (y+x) = 0 \)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now, let's invert one of the equations using division: \( \frac{x-y}{x+y} = 0 \)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So as you can see, the line that was inverted (under the division line) is now a Shadow Line. And this seems like a more "correct" way to visualize this than as the conventional graph shows it (which is indistinguishable from the simpler equation, \(y-x=0\)).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This equation works almost exactly as the previous. And like before, let's start with multiplication to combine 2 equations (in this case, a circle and a vertical line equation): \( x \times (x^2+y^2-1) = 0 \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But now, let's invert the circle by using division, which makes the equation: \( \frac{x}{x^2+y^2-1} = 0 \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that the Shadow Circle is invisible in the conventional graph. In fact, the conventional graph looks identical to a conventional graph of the \(x=0\) equation (as if the denominator was not there).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all of these previous examples, the "shadows" have represented areas of high error. But in this last example, we'll see some hidden details that represent areas of low error - areas that are nearly solutions to the equation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider the equation, \( y=4 sin(x)+ sin(2.7y) \), as both a conventional graph and a fuzzy graph:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note the floating dots in the fuzzy graph version that are not there in the conventional/binary graph. These are like underwater islands - underwater mountains that are just below the surface of the water (or in this case, the \( error == 0 \) surface). These hidden islands represent area that are near-solutions to the equation (which are only visible in FuzzyGraph).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their presense hints that we can tweak the equation slightly to cause them to burst above the surface of the water (which should also make them visible in conventional graphs).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let's change the equation from: &lt;lb/&gt; \( y=4 sin(x)+ sin(2.7y) \) to: &lt;lb/&gt; \( y=4 sin(x)+ sin(2.8y) \)...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And as you can see, those previously-hidden islands are now visible in the conventional graph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So Fuzzy/non-binary graphing can help us see features of the mathematical topography that are completely invisible with conventional/binary.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Computer Science &amp;gt; Artificial Intelligence&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; [Submitted on 4 Nov 2025]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Title:Kosmos: An AI Scientist for Autonomous Discovery&lt;/head&gt;View PDF HTML (experimental)&lt;quote&gt;Abstract:Data-driven scientific discovery requires iterative cycles of literature search, hypothesis generation, and data analysis. Substantial progress has been made towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such agents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing coherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos, an AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended objective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of parallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before synthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos uses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis agent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to coherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively executing an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run. Kosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature, ensuring its reasoning is traceable. Independent scientists found 79.4% of statements in Kosmos reports to be accurate, and collaborators reported that a single 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own research time on average. Furthermore, collaborators reported that the number of valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles (tested up to 20 cycles). We highlight seven discoveries made by Kosmos that span metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics. Three discoveries independently reproduce findings from preprinted or unpublished manuscripts that were not accessed by Kosmos at runtime, while four make novel contributions to the scientific literature.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
