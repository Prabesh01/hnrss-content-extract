    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Icons in Menus Everywhere — Send Help&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I complained about this on the socials, but I didn’t get it all out of my system. So now I write a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve never liked the philosophy of “put an icon in every menu item by default”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google Sheets, for example, does this. Go to “File” or “Edit” or “View” and you’ll see a menu with a list of options, every single one having an icon (same thing with the right-click context menu).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s extra noise to me. It’s not that I think menu items should never have icons. I think they can be incredibly useful (more on that below). It’s more that I don’t like the idea of “give each menu item an icon” being the default approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This posture lends itself to a practice where designers have an attitude of “I need an icon to fill up this space” instead of an attitude of “Does the addition of a icon here, and the cognitive load of parsing and understanding it, help or hurt how someone would use this menu system?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The former doesn’t require thinking. It’s just templating — they all have icons, so we need to put something there. The latter requires care and thoughtfulness for each use case and its context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To defend my point, one of the examples I always pointed to was macOS. For the longest time, Apple’s OS-level menus seemed to avoid this default approach of sticking icons in every menu item.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is, until macOS Tahoe shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Menus in macOS Tahoe&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tahoe now has icons in menus everywhere. For example, here’s the Apple menu:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s look at others. As I’m writing this I have Safari open. Let’s look at the “Safari” menu:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hmm. Interesting. Ok so we’ve got an icon for like half the menu items. I wonder why some get icons and others don’t?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the “Settings” menu item (third from the top) has an icon. But the other item in its grouping “Privacy Report” does not. I wonder why? Especially when Safari has an icon for Privacy report, like if you go to customize the toolbar you’ll see it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hmm. Who knows? Let’s keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the "File" menu in Safari:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some groupings have icons and get inset, while other groupings don’t have icons and don’t get inset. Interesting…again I wonder what the rationale is here? How do you choose? It’s not clear to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s keep going. Let’s go to the "View" menu:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh boy, now we’re really in it. Some of these menu items have the notion of a toggle (indicated by the checkmark) so now you’ve got all kinds of alignment things to deal with. The visual symbols are doubling-up when there’s a toggle and an icon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “View” menu in Mail is a similar mix of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Text&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Text + toggles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Text + icons&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Text + icons + toggles&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know what would be a fun game? Get a bunch of people in a room, show them menus where the textual labels are gone, and see who can get the most right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In so many of these cases, I honestly can’t intuit why some menus have icons and others do not. What are so many of these icons affording me at the cost of extra visual and cognitive parsing? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be fair, there are some menus where these visual symbols are incredibly useful. Take this menu from Finder:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The visual depiction of how those are going to align is actually incredibly useful because it’s way easier for my brain to parse the symbol and understand where the window is going to go than it is to read the text and imagine in my head what “Top Left” or “Bottom &amp;amp; Top” or “Quarters” will mean. But a visual symbol? I instantly get it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those are good icons in menus. I like those.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Apple Abandons Its Own Guidance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What I find really interesting about this change on Apple’s part is how it seemingly goes against their own previous human interface guidelines (as pointed out to me by Peter Gassner).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They have an entire section in their 2005 guidelines (and 1992 and 2020) titled “Using Symbols in Menus”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See what it says?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There are a few standard symbols you can use to indicate additional information in menus…Don’t use other, arbitrary symbols in menus, because they add visual clutter and may confuse people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confused people. That’s me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They even have an example of what not to do and guess what it looks like? A menu in macOS Tahoe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s pretty obvious how I feel. I’m tired of all this visual noise in my menus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now that Apple has seemingly thrown in with the “stick an icon in every menu by default” crowd, it’s harder than ever for me to convince people otherwise. To persuade, “Hey, unless you can articulate a really good reason to add this, maybe our default posture should be no icons in menus?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I guess this is the world I live in now. Icons in menus. Icons in menus everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Send help.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kroger’s announcement on Tuesday that it will shutter three of its robotic e-commerce fulfillment facilities represents a sharp turnabout for the grocery company, which until recently had expressed confidence in its ability to leverage automation to run a profitable online grocery business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Less than a year ago, Kroger said it planned to expand the fleet of high-tech fulfillment centers it has been developing in partnership with U.K.-based warehouse automation company Ocado. And in mid-2024, Kroger revealed that it would install new technology from Ocado to improve the efficiency of the warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Kroger launched its partnership with Ocado, the company “believed in the relentless drive to innovate way ahead of the market in order to delight our customers and advance our position as one of America’s leading e-commerce companies,” former Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said in a video about improvements to its equipment that the automation company announced last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Kroger’s projected confidence came even as it was questioning whether the Ocado network was living up to expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kroger revealed in September 2023 that it had decided to pause development of the Ocado project as it waited to see if sites it had already started operating would meet performance benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a further sign that its strategy was faltering, Kroger announced last March it would close three spoke facilities that worked in tandem with several of its robotic centers, with a spokesperson noting that the facilities “did not meet the benchmarks we set for success.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By September 2025, it was clear that depending on automation as the foundation of a money-making grocery delivery business was probably not going to pan out for Kroger. Speaking during an earnings call, interim Kroger CEO Ron Sargent — who took over in March after McMullen’s sudden departure following an ethics probe — said the company would conduct a “full site-by-site analysis” of the Ocado network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sargent also said Kroger would refocus its e-commerce efforts on its fleet of more than 2,700 grocery supermarkets because it believed that its stores gave it a way to “reach new customer segments and expand rapid delivery capabilities without significant capital investments.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kroger said on Tuesday that its decision to close the three robotic facilities, along with other adjustments to its e-commerce operations, would provide a $400 million boost as it looks to improve e-commerce profitability. But the course-correction will be expensive, forcing Kroger to incur charges of about $2.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ken Fenyo, a former Kroger executive who now advises retailers on technology as managing partner of Pine Street Advisors, said the changes Kroger is making reflect the broader reality that grocery e-commerce has not reached the levels the industry had predicted when the COVID-19 pandemic supercharged digital sales five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fenyo added that Kroger’s decision to locate the Ocado centers outside of cities turned out to be a key flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Ultimately those were hard places to make this model work,” said Fenyo. “You didn’t have enough people ordering, and you had a fair amount of distance to drive to get the orders to them. And so ultimately, these large centers were just not processing enough orders to pay for all that technology investment you had to make.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With its automated fulfillment network, Kroger bet that consumers would be willing to trade delivery speed for sensible prices on grocery orders. That model has been highly successful for Ocado in the U.K., but U.S. consumers have shown they value speed of delivery, with companies like Instacart and DoorDash expanding rapidly in recent years and rolling out services like 30-minute delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Acknowledging this reality, Kroger noted on Tuesday that it’s deepening partnerships with third-party delivery companies. The grocer also said it will pilot “capital-light, store-based automation in high-volume markets” — a seeming nod to the type of micro-fulfillment technology that grocers have tested in recent years, and that Amazon is currently piloting in a Whole Foods Market store in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fenyo pointed out that micro-fulfillment technology has also run into significant headwinds, adding that he thinks that outside of areas with large numbers of shoppers and high online ordering volume, putting automated order-assembly systems in stores probably doesn’t justify the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kroger’s decision to reduce its commitment to automation also poses a significant setback to Ocado, which has positioned its relationship with Kroger as a key endorsement of its warehouse automation technology. Shares in the U.K.-based robotics company have fallen dramatically and are now back to their level 15 years ago, when the company went public.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Space (whitespace) is a whole group of glyphs, one of the most important and frequently-used. Any computer user knows space as the widest key on their keyboard, however the notion itself is much bigger and comprises multiple important typographic terms and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Space in general is a blank unprinted area, a counterform that separates letters, words, lines etc. In typography, there are several types of spaces: sinkage (space on a page above a textblock), indent (space before the paragraph), leading (vertical space), word spacing, and letter spacing. In this article, we will primarily focus on word spacing, i.e. the space as a glyph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;European languages did not use word spacing for a long time, it was not until the 7th century that word spacing entered Latin script. In the age of metal type, the space was a material, tangible object — a piece of metal that left no print. In the pre-digital era, most text blocks were justified, which required several spaces of different width. Those types of spacing were defined by the notion of em (or point size), which is height of the piece of metal &lt;lb/&gt;Diagram of a cast metal sort, c is point size used for printing a character. For example, one em in a 12-point typeface is 12 points, whereas its en (half-em) spaces’ width is 6pt, third space (of an em) equals 4pt, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whitespace characters in Gauge. Widths and correlations between spaces differ depending on the typeface&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These types of spaces are still existent in the digital age, but they are mostly used by advanced typographers. Messengers, text editors, and other programs and applications most typically use only regular space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Word space&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standard space, word space, space per se, is the symbol typed using the widest key on the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In metal type, the size of standard space varied depending on the typographic tradition, in most cases the space was rather wide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a standard word space, metal composition used an en space, half the height of the point size, or em-square (in Cyrillic typography), while Latin space was equal to the third of the em space. Alexandra Korolkova Living Typography (2012)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the early digitised fonts one often sees excessively wide spaces; probably, it was an attempt to imitate en space, or three-per-em space, which were used as the main spacing material in metal type. Such a space width can affect the typesetting rhythm and would seem redundant in modern typography.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wide spacing is both physiologically unnecessary and makes the whole typeset structure reticulate, aesthetically ruining the page’s layout. If for some reason you can’t stick to en space size in this particular line, it’s better to scale down spacing using three-per-em spaces (that equal to the third of an em), or spaces of 3, or even 2 points. M. I. Schelkunov History, Technique, Art of Printing (1926)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A wide word spacing seems weird to an eye of the modern reader, and it is way too visible in texts&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, word space width is specified by the typeface’s designer themselves, and it is one of the defining moments in designing a typeface, along with spacing, — texture and rhythm of the typeset are heavily dependent on word space width.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many modern typographers are seeking to subject the space width to certain rules. For example, some type designers claim that the space should be equal to the bounding box of lowercase letter i. However, this rule can’t be universal: specifically, it definitely won’t work for typefaces where letter i is of unconventional design and proportions. In super large point sizes, spacing and word spaces are often intentionally reduced, as in such cases even the bounding box of the i can be too wide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It used to be a rule of thumb for headline settings to leave a space between words that is just wide enough to fit in a lowercase i. For comfortable reading of long lines, the space between words should be much wider. Erik Spiekermann Stop stealing sheep &amp;amp; find out how type works (1993)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depending on whether your typeface is serif or sans serif, it makes sense to take, or not to take, in consideration sidebearings of the glyph. It can be very different depending on style, too: with wide and light weights, there will be more unprinted area than with narrow and heavy weights, and this also applies to the space width.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no question but that wordspaces may not be too large, or that the line must appear to be an even, well-balanced whole. What applies to letterspaces also applies to wordspaces: they too are a function of the counters of the individual letters: the smaller these are, the smaller the wordspaces; the larger the counters, the larger the wordspaces. Jost Hochuli Detail in Typography (2008)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blank space between words should be such as to ensure that words are visibly separated from each other — if spacing is wider, there will be holes between words, if smaller, it will be difficult to tell one word from another. You can’t measure space with a ruler, as everything depends on specific design or typeface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Word spaces as set in Kazimir Text. The space width is good: words are separated from one another, the hierarchy of white space is maintained If you increase word spacing, word spaces would conflict with leading, which makes it hard to navigate through the text If you decrease the width of word space, it will affect legibility, as the words will blend together&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using double spaces is a technique inherited from the age of typewriters. It is strongly advisable to check a document for double spaces and replace those by single spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the recommendations learned by the educated typist are still now acquired habits wrongly used in digital documents; for instance, the use of three spaces after a period or two after the comma. There was just one space width available in the typewriter, so words and sentences were separated by the same distance. The double space was used to differentiate sentences and improve the readability of the text. María Ramos Silva Type design for typewriters: Olivetti (2015)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additional spacing after a period is a questionable method in terms of readability. It can be assumed that in the age of typewriters additional space could have better separated sentences from one another in the context of monowidth typeface, yet monowidth period and space already form a larger gap than any space within the sentence. Since typewriters, typesetting tools have significantly improved over time, and today nobody will typeset in a monowidth typeface, unless it is absolutely necessary. So, currently, the use of double spaces is considered mauvais ton, i.e. bad manners, regardless of typeface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;American lawyer Matthew Butterick wrote a book on typography for lawyers, writers, and anyone who works with text. In the US, it is still very common among the older generation to use double spaces, so Matthew dedicated two entire chapters of his Practical Typography to this issue. Butterick tried to convince his audience by imaginary dialogues:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If you approve of smaller word spaces in some situations, why do you insist on only one space between sentences, where a larger gap might be useful?” Because you’re already getting a larger gap. A sentence-ending word space typically appears next to a period. A period is mostly white space. So visually, the space at the end of a sentence already appears larger than a single word space. No need to add another. Matthew Butterick Butterick’s Practical Typography (2013)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Non-breaking Space&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Non-breaking space is a space character that prevents an automatic line break at its position. For instance, in Russian and a number of other Central and Eastern European languages, non-breaking space serves to stick together a preposition and a word next to it, numbers and units of measurements, name and surname, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Non-breaking space is supported by almost any text editing program, graphic design software, or browser, along with a standard space, so one shouldn’t forget to utilise it according to the typesetting rules of any given language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Russian language, non-breaking space shall connect the dash and its previous word (except for direct speech), prepositions with following words, initials with surname, abbreviations (such as i.e.), numero sign with numbers, numbers and units of measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In English it is considered good manners to stick together not prepositions, but pronouns and articles with the following word. However, this rule is often neglected, especially when it comes to newspapers and magazines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Professional typesetting software have spaces of non-standard widths. In InDesign, all additional spaces — em space, en space, thin space, etc. — are non-breaking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Additional spaces&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standard space is used everywhere; it is supported by any word, text, or code processing app. Non-breaking space is supported almost anywhere as well. However, computer typesetting still possesses a number of spaces dating back to metal type, allowing for finer adjustment of white space if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a font supports additional spaces, those can be fetched via glyphs palette or using clipboard. Most graphic software do not support those spaces; for example, Adobe Illustrator 2020 includes only four additional spaces: em space, en space, thin space, and hair space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And there is a reason for that: neither Illustrator, nor Photoshop were designed for advanced typesetting and laying out books. However, in InDesign you can easily set any kind of space, and a skilled typographer will use those.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Em Space&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A space equal to the height of the em square (point size.) In early serifs, the metal face of the capital М tended to be square — probably, thus the English name. Metal type often used em space as paragraph indent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;En Space&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Half of the width of an em. Russian-language metal type composition considered it the main type of space, even though in word spacing, especially if the text is aligned to the left or right, it is excessively wide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Three-per-em Space, Third Space&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One third of an em space. Historically considered as the main space in Western European typography.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first obligation of a good typesetter is to achieve a compact line image, something best accomplished by using three-to-em or three-space word spacing. In former times even roman was set much tighter than we do it today; the specimen sheet that contains the original of Garamond’s roman of 1592, printed in 14-point, shows a word spacing in all lines of 2 points only, which is one-seventh of an em! This means that we cannot call three-to-em word spacing particularly tight. Jan Tschichold The Form Of The Book (1975)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Quarter Space&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One fourth of an em space. Some authors believe quarter space to be the primary word space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a normal text face in a normal text size, a typical value for the word space is a quarter of an em, which can be written M/4. (A quarter of an em is typically about the same as, or slightly more than, the set-width of the letter t.) Robert Bringhurst The Elements of Typographic Style (1992)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thin Space&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;⅕ of an em space. It is common that thin space equals about half the standard one, which is why thin space is used where standard word space would be too wide. For example, thin space is often utilised for spacing a dash in cases where standard space is too wide. Thin space is also used for spacing initials, from each other and from the surname:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standard space in Spectral is too wide to be used for spacing initials and dashes Thin spaces look more neat, better connecting initials with a surname and two parts of a sentence with each other&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;French typographic tradition prescribes the use of either thin or hair spaces to space any two-part symbols: exclamation mark, question mark, semicolon, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regardless of the language, such glyphs as question mark and exclamation mark typically are very visible in lowercase, but they can get lost in an all-caps typeset — in this case, one should finely space them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sixth Space&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sixth space is used when the thin space is too large.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hair Space&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The narrowest of spaces. In metal type, it was equal to 1/10 of an em space, in the digital age it is mostly 1/ 24 of an em. It might be useful if a certain typeface’s punctuation marks have too tight sidebearings, but a thin space would be too wide. For example, you can use hair space to space dashes instead of thin one — everything depends on the sidebearings and the design of the particular typeface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You should keep in mind that after you change font, selected space glyphs will remain, but their width can change, — and this will affect the texture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Isn’t it ridiculous when a punctuation mark, relating to the entire preceding phrase, is tied to one last word of the said phrase? And, vice versa, how unfortunately it looks when there is a large gap between this mark and the previous word. As a matter of fact, it is about time type foundry workers started thinking about it and cast the punctuation mark with an extra sidebearing on its left. However, typefounders are not always, or rather rarely, that forethoughtful, and also they are used to cast all letters without generous sidebearings. During punching of matrices, the beauty of spacing punctuation marks is also barely remembered. Therefore, it is your burden and responsibility to fix this &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Spacing in justified texts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Full justification — that is, alignment of text to its both margins, — is still commonly used in books and magazines. When the text is justified, the width of word spaces is not constant, it is changing to distribute words to the entire width of the line. In this situation, the uniformity of spacing could be even more important than the very width of these spaces: evenly large spaces in the entire page are better than large spaces in only one line. That is why, no matter how optimised the typeface’s word spacing in terms of its width is, it will not be enough for typesetting a justified text. While in metal type all spaces were set manually, and a typesetter knew what space they should add for even typesetting, nowadays it’s a computer that defines the length of spaces for justified texts. The algorithm divides the remaining space into equal parts and adds them to regular spaces. In doing so, the algorithm ignores letters, syntax, and punctuation, which is why when typesetting justified texts one should always double-check and adjust spacing manually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Indesign, it is possible to set minimum and maximum word spacing width for fully justified text typesetting: the width of standard space is used as a basis 100 %, maximum is normally about 120 %, minimum is about 80 %.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the text is justified, a reasonable minimum word space is a fifth of an em (M/5), and M/4 is a good average to aim for. A reasonable maximum in justified text is M/2. If it can be held to M/3, so much the better. But for loosely fitted faces, or text set in a small size, M/3 is often a better average to aim for, and a better minimum is M/4. In a line of widely letterspaced capitals, a word space of M/2 or more may be required. Robert Bringhurst The Elements of Typographic Style (1992)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Robert Bringhurst recommends choosing appropriate spaces based on an em. However, space is a relative value, so in justified texts you should consider not the width of some abstract em, but rather the width of space in particular font.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The optimal word space width in justified texts is ephemeral and changes depending on typeface, point size, line width, line spacing, and many other factors. That is why in Indesign you can’t set maximum and minimum values once and for all cases — you will have to choose the best possible options manually.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In setting justified texts, standard word space width becomes a fluctuating value. The fixed width space and all additional spaces with constant width can help better control the setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The more even are the gaps between words, the better &amp;lt;…&amp;gt;. In no case shall you allow a considerable disparity in space widths, while an insignificant difference won’t ruin the beauty of typesetting. Pyotr Kolomnin A Concise Account of Typography (1899)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Figure Space&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure space, or numeric space, is used for typesetting tables and sheets. If a typeface is fitted with tabular figures, its figure space will be equal to the width of tabular figures. Figure space is a non-breaking one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normally, figure space is significantly wider than standard space, it will be helpful when you need to even a large amount of multi-digit numbers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Punctuation Space&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In most cases, the width of this space is equal to the glyph width of a period or a colon. May be of use in making up numbers in tables where digits are defined by a spacing element instead of period or colon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Narrow No-break Space&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A thin space that prevents an automatic line break. The name of this symbol in Unicode causes additional confusion: Narrow in this case is the same thing as Thin, and Narrow Space has the same width as Thin Space does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some applications, such as InDesign, the simple regular thin space is non-breaking by default and is called with Thin Space. In other cases it’s a separate symbol, for example, the Web uses Narrow No-break Space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Spaces in layout&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The distribution of white space in text setting is a highly important factor, responsible for the neat design and the content’s clear structure. Many designers keep in mind correlation between point size, line width, and margins, but some tend to forget that word spacing is an equivalent factor of these relations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Body text font, designed for smaller sizes, would require smaller spacing and word spaces if used to set a large headline. The point size gets more important in determining spacing and white unprinted area in general, than whether it is a text typeface or a display one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is also necessary to consider spacing when you’re dealing with particular elements of the text. For instance, small-caps or all-caps fragments quite often should be additionally spaced. Manual spacing is sometimes necessary in bold or italic styles, or even if no additional styles are applied at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Small-caps spacing in Charter is too tight by default, more white space is needed In William, small caps are taken care of, this generous spacing doesn’t require additional adjustment A text set in a quality typeface sometimes needs manual adjustment: standard word space in Guyot is clearly not enough for the of ‘i’ combination&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;White spaces in software&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most typically, in non-professional software and web services there are only standard and non-breaking spaces available. You might be able to set additional symbols using clipboard almost anywhere where Unicode is supported. That said, you have to check everytime: for example, at the time of writing this piece, Facebook allows for inserting additional symbols in its input field, but automatically replaces them while posting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of the Web, additional spaces are available as HTML special characters: if you use them, your source code might become a bit cluttered, but that would allow you to control the placing of each non-standard space. Please note that different browsers might render spacing differently, and not so long ago some of them even ignored additional spaces, replacing them by regular ones. You should check on the correct display of additional spaces where you use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two industry standards for text formatting and typesetting, InDesign and Quark Xpress, support all kinds of spaces. Today, type designers usually include at least thin and hair spaces. Their width might vary from one typeface to another — but the typographer, at least, has more control over the word spacing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In InDesign, an additional space not included in the typeface would still be visible, but its width would be defined by the software with no regard to what kind of typeface it is. For example, hair space in 24pt size will be 1pt — both in a display face with tight spacing and in a text face with loose spacing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spaces calculated this way are not always suitable for your task. Depending on the typeface, the additional space width suggested by InDesign can be insufficient or excessive. And if you export the text with such spaces from InDesign to Figma, their width will most likely change — every software may have its own algorithms for calculating these values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be vigilant and trust your eye: it is not mathematical values that matter, but a convincing, reasonable relationship between the black and the white.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These dashes are spaced by hair spaces provided by the typeface These dashes are spaced by hair spaces provided by the typeface The typefaces above have no hair space, therefore its width is set automatically With x-height and spacing that Arno Pro and RIA Text have, the InDesign’s hair space is good enough. Whereas in IBM Plex we perhaps should put thin space instead of a hair one&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whitespace characters are among the most important typographic elements. Alongside sidebearings, they define text rhythm and organise blocks of information. Disregard for white spaces can ruin relations between them: line and word spacing, word spacing and column-gap. In such case the reader wouldn’t be able to easily track the line and would have to put additional &lt;/p&gt;

We provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that demonstrates that neural networks systematically converge to shared spectral subspaces regardless of initialization, task, or domain. Through mode-wise spectral analysis of over 1100 models - including 500 Mistral-7B LoRAs, 500 Vision Transformers, and 50 LLaMA-8B models - we identify universal subspaces capturing majority variance in just a few principal directions. By applying spectral decomposition techniques to the weight matrices of various architectures trained on a wide range of tasks and datasets, we identify sparse, joint subspaces that are consistently exploited, within shared architectures across diverse tasks and datasets. Our findings offer new insights into the intrinsic organization of information within deep networks and raise important questions about the possibility of discovering these universal subspaces without the need for extensive data and computational resources. Furthermore, this inherent structure has significant implications for model reusability, multi-task learning, model merging, and the development of training and inference-efficient algorithms, potentially reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale neural models.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Submission history&lt;/head&gt;From: Prakhar Kaushik [view email]&lt;p&gt;[v1] Thu, 4 Dec 2025 18:59:58 UTC (14,316 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[v2] Sat, 6 Dec 2025 04:42:07 UTC (14,321 KB)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Current browse context: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cs.LG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has now been 30 years since WarCraft II: Tides of Darkness was released. After the great response to Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, released in November 1994, Blizzard began working on Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness. Development stared in the first months of 1995, and the game was released in North America and Australia on December 9, 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While WarCraft: Orcs and Humans had laid the foundations of the series — arguably even for the RTS genre at a whole — it was really WarCraft II that took things to new heights. More units could be selected at once, the player could right-click to issue commands, naval and aerial combat was introduced, and buildings and units could be upgraded. The graphics were more vivid and visually appealing, and features like the Fog of War was introduced, where you could only see in the vicinity of your own units — unlike in the first game, where you could indefinitely see any area you had previously visited, you now had to continuously scout the map.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many things still resembled the first game. The two factions — the Humans and the Orcs — were balanced through their similarites. For every unit and building of one faction, the other had one that was functionally equivalent, and so the sides largely mirrored each other. The only real differences lay in the spells available to their higher-level units. In that regard, the clear winners were the Orcs, who had a tremendous advantage thanks to the incredibly powerful and unbalanced Bloodlust spell of the Ogre-Magi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is quite impressive that Blizzard managed to release a title of such quality in such a short span of time, especially considering that the overall design and gameplay evolved during development. Originally, Blizzard’s concept blended modern and fantasy elements, such as fighter pilots being ambushed by a fire-breathing dragon. In the Alpha version (it is still probably floating around somewhere on the Internet) which was given to magazines for review shortly before the game's release, players could, for example mine rocks, which acted as an additional required resource.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several versions and bundles of WarCraft II were released over the years:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WarCraft II: Tides of Darkness, originally written for DOS, though it had a Windows launch screen and ran well under Windows 95. A Macintosh version was also released. The DOS version supported multiplayer games via null modem cable, modem, or IPX, while Mac players could also play via TCP/IP or AppleTalk.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WarCraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal, the expansion, released in April 1996.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WarCraft: Battle Chest, released in 1996, was a bundle which included WarCraft: Orcs and Humans, WarCraft II: Tides of Darkness, and WarCraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WarCraft II: The Dark Saga, released in 1997, was a port for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation consoles by Electronic Arts, including the campaigns from both Tides of Darkness and Beyond the Dark Portal.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WarCraft II: Battle.net Edition, released in 1999, ported the game's code to Microsoft Windows, fixed some minor bugs, and enabled multiplayer support via Blizzard's online service, Battle.net.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WarCraft II Battle Chest, released in 1999, included the Battle.net Edition and its official strategy guide.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WarCraft II: Remastered, released in November 2024, is modern remaster of Tides of Darkness and Beyond the Dark Portal, with improved graphics and updated controls.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WarCraft II: Tides of Darkness received enthusiastic reviews, elevating Blizzard to the top ranks alongside Westwood Studios, id Software, and LucasArts. The rivalry between Blizzard's series and Westwood Studios' Command and Conquer series helped fuel the RTS boom of the late 1990s. PC Gamer US named WarCraft II the best game of 1995, calling it an "easy" choice and writing that "Warcraft II stand[s] out — way out — as the most impressive, most entertaining, game of 1995". The editors also awarded it Best Multi-Player Game of 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WarCraft II was notable for the large number of third-party utilities created for it. Quickly, Daniel Lemberg reverse-engineered and published the map file (*.pud) format and wrote the first third-party map editor, War2xEd, which could do multiple things that the bundled map editor could not, such as editing unit attributes. Blizzard apparently began using War2xEd internally, and it influenced their decision to later ship a feature-rich map editor with StarCraft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, Alexander Cech and Daniel Lemberg reverse-engineered the game data format, the WAR archives. Alexander Cech went on to make a hugely important tool called Wardraft, which allowed users to browse and modify the contents of the WAR archives. This enabled extensive game modifications, known as "Total Conversions". Many such projects gained popularity and remained in development for a long time, notable examples being DeathCraft: Twilight of Demons, War of the Ring, Editor's Total Conversion, Funcraft and Rituals of Rebirth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of these utilities and conversions have long since faded into obscurity, but their legacy lives on. They impacted Blizzard's desicion to bundle ever more powerful editors and trigger systems into StarCraft and later WarCraft III, which in turn later spawned entire games such as Dota (which began as a WarCraft III map). Hopefully, someday (soon?) we can host some of the Total Conversions here at Jorvik Systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a personal anecdote, I vividly remember two defining moments related to the game. I was young when it came out, and my dad's friend had pirated it; somehow the game ended up on our computer. I was too young to speak English at the time, and the interface was confusing to me, so a relative helped me understand the basics — how to make peons construct buildings, how to control units, and how to navigate around the map. I hadn't played computer games much before then, but from that moment on, I was arguably obsessed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A second strong memory came a few months later, at my friend Erik's house, on his Intel 486 PC. He was experimenting with the WarCraft II map editor, which I hadn't known existed, and I was blown away. I simply could not believe that Blizzard would ship such a tool with the game; to me, it meant that people could essentially create their own games by designing entirely new scenarios. It is quite possible that my fascination with modding was born in that very moment. We probably went outside to play shortly afterward, which I found incredibly lame — we had at our disposal the most powerful tool I could imagine, so why were we not inside using it?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Renaissance Period&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are living through a Saturn renaissance. Buckets of titles previously locked away in Japan are seeing new audiences, thanks to the herculean efforts of small but dedicated teams of enthusiast translators, removing the veil of Japanese illiteracy from before our tired eyes. Interestingly, the majority of efforts are being directed at the games with the biggest scripts, and no other genre was as impacted by the language barrier as the text-heavy, story-driven RPG. Over a dozen quality titles are now playable in English. The Saturn is, once again, ascendant…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ain’t life Grand?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter Grandia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What hasn’t been said about Grandia? In the run-up to its late 1997 release, the game enjoyed significant worldwide coverage in the gaming press, not least because some positioned it as the anti-FF7 title. Hot on the heels of the remaster of Lunar: Silver Star Story and hailing from respected software house Game Arts, featuring state of the art fully 3D environments, a score by notable composer Noriyuki Iwadare, sound effects produced by Skywalker Sound… Grandia was indeed shaping up to be one of the premier JRPG experiences of the 5th generation. There was serious talk of bringing the game out West — Working Designs was touted as the favoured house to do the honors, owing to their strong partnership with Game Arts, but the game’s massive script would have meant a late 1998 release by even the speediest conversion standards of the time. By then, the Western Saturn retail market had collapsed, and despite a shrinking but fervently dedicated base of Saturn fans holding on to hope of seeing the title cross the ocean, the game wound up locked away in Japan, forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;NEVER say Forever&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Game Arts subsequently ported Grandia to the PlayStation, dropping it in Japan in the summer of 1999. Sony speedily localized the game for Western release later that same year… but we aren’t going to focus too much on the PlayStation version here because, at the time of writing, PlayStation discs don’t boot on your SEGA Saturn. It’s the Saturn game that we are concerned with. For us Saturn stalwarts, we had to wait to the mid-2020s for an intrepid team led by TrekkiesUnite113 to transplant the PlayStation’s English script into the Saturn code. By then, the game was decades old, not to mention re-released and ‘re-mastered’ on modern platforms. So, why translate Grandia for the Saturn, when multiple other English options exist?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Grandia is Best on Saturn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How do you do&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Set in an age of discovery at the dawn of the industrial revolution, Grandia initially tells the tale of young Justin — a 14-year-old fearless adolescent who can’t help but dream of adventure. When he isn’t playing at “hero” with his town friends, he’s dreaming of great expeditions to find the lost civilization of Angelou. He is joined by his friend Sue — an 8-year-old girl whose maturity belies her age, and who tries desperately to keep young Justin in line. Justin’s mom Lily runs the local Seagull Restaurant and does her best to raise Justin into a respectable young man… though in her youth, she was a scrappy pirate herself. In her heart, she knows her audacious spark has passed on to her son, and that Justin will one day take up the adventurer’s mantle and take off on a grand adventure of his own, so she does her best to prepare him for when the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She gives Justin a Spirit Stone — a remnant of the Angelou civilization and a memento of his long-lost father — and in doing so, helps kick off a fantastic voyage that sees young Justin explore, learn, overcome all manner of obstacles, and ultimately, grow and become the hero that he always imagined himself to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During his quest, Justin encounters fascinating characters, both friend and foe. From quiet folk in sleepy villages to rambunctious youngsters eager for their own slice of adventure; from military platoons led by the most beautiful — but hopelessly shallow — lady sergeants to cunning merchants, towering warriors, alluring mermaids and ferocious dragons… Justin encounters them all, and for good or ill, manages to change the course of their lives in ways both subtle and grand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Justin, Sue, and Feena are the first three playable characters in Grandia. Young Sue tries to keep Justin in line, while Feena searches for the true meaning of being an adventurer – with Justin slowly moving from admiring her to showing her the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game is clever in pulling the player in for a ride that for a very long while feels very lighthearted and innocent. Even as Justin’s adventure begins in earnest and the player is exposed to antagonists, mysteries, undercurrents and intrigues, Justin can’t help but distill it back to the very pure essence of boyhood adventure. Mysterious tower causing problems for a nearby village for years? No problem, Justin will fix it! A dragon from a nearby volcano terrorizing the locals? Justin’s got this. A ghost ship sailing in to harass a passenger steamer? Justin is the answer, in the same way that, as youngsters, we all knew – we knew! – that WE were the heroes, and that WE would save the day, armed only with our courage and our grand imaginations. It was our duty, after all. We had it in us to go forth boldly, and change the world (and naturally, all before being called home for dinner).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This point is driven home by Justin’s insatiable desire to uncover the mystery of his Spirit Stone, and the ancient Angelou civilization. After an unfortunate but entirely predictable mishap in the local museum, followed by a mysterious revelation in the nearby Sult Ruins, Justin’s curiosity is ignited, and his drive for real adventure becomes indomitable. Meanwhile, forces are at work that care not for Justin’s explorations, and inevitably, the lad finds himself pitted against the Garlyle Forces and some of its top commanders. Their aims are complex and their operations span the world, and this scope creates a wonderful juxtaposition with Justin’s innocent demeanor and singular focus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;On Screen!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fifth Generation of consoles marked the rise of 3D graphics, but some genres made the leap easier than others. This shift was a struggle for RPGs, with many excellent titles continuing to employ 2D visuals, albeit in richer color and more sophisticated detail than seen in previous generations. Early attempts at the 3D RPG (Virtual Hydlide) highlighted how difficult it was to run this style of game on the hardware of the time without wrecking the framerate or keeping textures from looking like a checkerboard mess. Dungeon crawlers (Shining the Holy Ark) were among the first titles to get the 3D right, though the player’s scope of movement was very restricted. Finally, some fantasized that “3D” meant pre-rendered backgrounds and copious FMV clips, with the only real 3D being battle scenes. Ahem!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grandia took the traditional overhead RPG view and transformed the landscapes into fully realized 3D polygonal playfields that can be rotated and zoomed at will. Character and enemy sprites are then overlain on the 3D world to make the scenes come to life. The addition of the third dimension affords the use of depth in the environments: hills, cliffs, and valleys; minecar rails that ran higher or lower relative to other tracks, and so on. In this way, the player initially feels right at home with a view that looks comfortably familiar, but must quickly learn to constantly rotate the viewpoint to catch enemies in hiding, spy treasures only visible from certain angles, judge heights, and evaluate other geometric details to plot their best course forward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grandia wastes no time in getting gamers used to this new visual paradigm. One of the game’s first quests sees local frenemy Gantz challenge Justin and Sue to locate the three Legendary Treasures: the fabled helmet (Iron Pot), the storied shield (Pot Lid), and of course, the legendary (Wooden) Sword. The player must traverse all of Parm, climbing down river walkways, checking in enclosed spaces, and chasing down Gantz’s little brother to prove they are up to Gantz’ task — and in the process, get used to the game’s then-new control scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 3D is very well put together, both technical and artistically. The level of detail is truly phenomenal, from the tiniest objects and details, especially in the ‘in-town’ game sections. Justin is able to interact with some of the innocuous scenery — for example he can knock brooms over, disturb piles of plates, or bump into bells and chimes — just as any real, overly excited 14-year-old might clumsily do as they ran along. Animations, from little weathervanes rotating to laundry fluttering on a clothesline, to puffs of smoke coming up from fires or chimneys, all accentuate the feeling that these are real, living, bustling places. The level of detail, and all of it in 3D, is really special.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The coders at Game Arts made excellent use of the Saturn’s unique hardware when realizing Grandia’s locales. Where appropriate, textured infinite planes are used to draw floors, and they not only look good but also dramatically cut down on the usage of polygons in drawing the scene, leaving that much more in the processing budget to spend on other visual details. In later sections, those infinite planes take on a distortion effect to create some very cool-looking water flows — look for them initially in Parm’s pier, and later in places like the snowy Laine Village or the mysterious Castle of Dreams. The water shimmers as the player rotates their view to create a truly stunning effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game’s characters and enemies are all represented by sprites that animate quite well and take viewpoints into account as the player rotates the camera. In yet more attention to detail, the sprites darken and then lighten again as the player moves in and out of shadowed areas — an impressive little detail that accentuates the visuals even further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The trio of General Baal, Colonel Mullen, and Leen is introduced in the game’s opening scene, and all three are more than they appear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The care that Game Arts took in crafting the visuals is commendable and Grandia comes off as one of the very best-looking 3D RPGs for the system, but Game Arts was perhaps a mite too ambitious. There are sections of the game where the framerate really chugs. Now, it must be acknowledged that low framerates were a hallmark of many 3D games in the 32-bit era, so some of this is to be expected, but the more detail Grandia is trying to show you, the more you will feel the Saturn huffing and puffing to get the job done. The game’s 3D framerate is not high at the best of times but it is passable, so it’s somewhat of a relief that the areas where it truly takes a dive aren’t too common.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pump up the Jam!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Game Arts’ attention to detail extends to the sound department. For Grandia, Game Arts commissioned Skywalker Sound to handle the game’s sound effects. The result is positional sound — effects like running water, crackling fire, etc. will fade in and out as Justin and co. move closer in or further away from the source. Often, if the effect is important, it will also somewhat dampen the volume of the BGM as it plays out. Additionally, the effects will pan left or right depending on the source, and especially as the player rotates the camera. These effects may be subtle, but they are very well implemented and add to the game’s overall polish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game’s soundtrack was composed by Noriyuki Iwadare and is both varied and excellent. Iwadare’s use of instruments appropriate to the on-screen action is uncanny — for example, running around Parm we are treated to an industrial sounding theme, perfect for the town’s motif. The varied use of strings, drums and winds is frankly excellent and lends to the atmosphere, imitating the clang of metal and steel which so permeates the city. Equally impressive is that the music somehow manages to be exciting or somber or poignant without ever sounding overly (excuse the wordplay) grandiose. This keeps the soundtrack in line with the game’s more lighthearted narrative. Of course, where appropriate, the soundtrack does take on that epic quality. The desperate tones that play when the Garlyle forces appear contrast so well with the carefree, upbeat “Off Runs Sue” tune. Mullen’s theme is at once wistful and ambitious, and even the theme from the Sult Ruins dungeon is perfectly mood-setting. Multiple Grandia soundtracks have been released since the game’s debut and the soundtrack is universally praised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How it Plays Out&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grandia’s gameplay, like so many RPGs before it, is split into two major gameplay slices: exposition-laden town sections and combat-focused dungeons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Players will spend a fair bit of time in the ‘in-town’ sections of the game. Here, you will wander around, take in the scenery, interact with the NPCs of the area, and almost always, find a quest that must be completed. A quick word about the NPCs — there are quite a number of them in each town, and everyone has something interesting to say… and almost always, each NCP has at least two separate conversation sequences to offer, making for a truly large amount of story to soak in. And it’s all entirely optional! It’s completely possible to make one’s way through Grandia with only minimal NCP interaction, but the option to enhance the adventure with these extensive NPC interactions is always there, as each character will present a unique view or focused response.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Predictably, the towns are filled with shops, though Grandia keeps things rather simple — there is but one general store which carries weapons, armor, accessories, and even magic all under the same roof. Buy, sell or trade up to the latest gear which gradually increases in the stat boosts it confers to your characters. Additionally, each town typically has one or more important locales, such as mayors’ offices or the chambers of village chiefs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is typically an inn or other house where the party can take rest, and at certain points in the game, resting triggers a shared meal scene that sees Justin break bread with his party mates. These meal scenes offer up critical dialogue, which the gamer can extend or keep short at their whim. When the critical conversation has been had, a bedtime icon will appear over Justin’s character sprite, and if the player is quite finished listening to the party chatter, they can select it to end the meal and get some rest. These mealtime conversations serve not only to flesh out what the party must tackle next, but also to offer a glimpse into the inner thoughts of the individual characters as they share their opinions, hopes and fears. Like so much in the game, Grandia implements this character exposition in a way that allows the player to decide how much of it to take in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The visuals in the town sections really stand out. The Saturn manages to shift not only impressive amounts of polygons for the various structures, but also vivid and complex textures. This technical prowess is coupled with lush and imaginative art direction, resulting in each locale feeling complete and distinct. The dense, humid and green surrounds of Luc Village, nestled deep within the Misty Forest and inhabited by humanoid creatures contrasts sharply with the seaside port town of Dight with its cerulean waves gently rolling in onto its sandy shores. Milda’s hometown village of Laine is covered in snow, and the ancient Zil Padon is an architectural wonder with a central fountain in the middle of the Savanna desert. Game Arts very clearly discarded their standard world building cookie cutters, and their efforts shine through.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once a locale has been explored, it will appear as a selectable destination on a gorgeous, hand-drawn high-resolution world map. Exiting an area often brings our party to this world map, and the next destination can be selected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the towns serve to heal the party, upgrade equipment, and advance the story, then the dungeons of the game offer treasure hunting, exploration, and of course, combat! Dungeons in Grandia range from literal underground labyrinths to above-ground forest mazes, to even large open plains that Justin et al. must traverse. Some of the more noteworthy settings include scaling a giant wall that keeps the world divided into two separate societies, negotiating the bowels of a ghost ship which appears out of nowhere to molest a transcontinental steamer, and even conquering the inside of an unstable volcano that’s inhabited by an ancient dragon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, the player really must use their L and R buttons to shift the 3D landscape around, to find all the nooks of treasure or paths forward. Some areas feature set pieces that Justin and party can activate — for example, knocking over a loose pillar to bridge a gap. These are usually indicated by an exclamation point icon when the party nears the set piece.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the while, treasure both great and small litters the landscape… but so do enemies! Enemies are visible in the dungeons and so can be avoided to an extent, but if Justin and party come in contact with an enemy, combat ensues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Grandia Grinder Alert!&lt;lb/&gt;Grind for Experience Points Using Environmental Damage!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are YOU a Grandia grinder?? Some sections of the game will deal damage to Justin and party outside of combat. First noticed in the Dom Ruins, rock faces painted into some of the dungeon walls will cause mild HP damage by springing out and poking the party when the party doesn’t want to be poked! The player can then use heal magic and spam this process to quickly increase Water magic levels. Although definitely a grind, it’s much faster than earning those experience points via combat. A few other areas in the game present similar opportunities — such as the basement in the Castle of Dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A New Kind of Kombat&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grandia introduced an all-new combat system to the RPG genre, though it could be said to be a variant of other similar RPG battle systems. Essentially, all battle participants have icons that continuously move along a universal IP Gauge, until they reach the Command point. Here, the player will enter from a selection of commands which includes attacking, using an item or a spell, guarding, or even retreating. They then wait to reach the very end of the gauge to execute their selected action, and the more experienced the character, the faster that point is reached. A ton of strategy is introduced here as during this waiting period between selecting an action and executing it, they are vulnerable to both Cancels and Counterattacks from their opponents. Unlike many contemporary RPGs where the instinct is to simply unleash physical and magical attacks in a turn-based order, the player can take advantage of these waiting periods to cancel out incoming enemy attacks and push them back on their IP gauge. The system will take some getting used to, but can be used to devastating effect, especially in the more drawn-out boss battles. It is entirely possible to strategically get in a half-dozen actions by each character and prevent a boss from retaliating during the entire sequence, by carefully timing attacks. This makes combat a lot more involved and exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also advantages to catching an enemy unawares — player characters start much further ahead on their IP Gauge, with the reverse being true if Justin’s party is ambushed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Players have a range of actions they can take when their IP Gauge is full, from the standard fare of using items, defending, running away, or even inspecting an enemy (is that slug-monster male or female, for example*).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nana, Saki, and Mio are Mullen’s three she-sergeants. Serving as comedic relief, they are nevertheless quite capable opponents in battle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;By Your Powers Combined… I Am Captain Planet!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earth. Fire. Wind. Water. These are the elemental forces that move the world, and most characters can master them! Learning magic in Grandia first requires that the party finds a Mana Egg. These rare items can then be exchanged in a shop for magic for a single character of your choice. That party member then learns the basics of your chosen magic element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inside of the four elements, magic spells are further split into levels, from one to three, to indicate their potency. Level 1 spells are your most basic spells and are what a character starts off with should they buy magic with their mana egg. Players that use magic in combat will gain skill points in that particular element, and those skill points are applied to all spells of that element, regardless of spell level — so, use a Level 1 Fire spell, and all levels of your Fire magic gain skill. Spell skill progression is represented by five red stars that fill up like a gauge, turning yellow as they gain experience. Greater experience shortens casting time (which, remember, is a vulnerable time as your spell can be cancelled by an opponent) and at higher levels, allows your character to learn combined element magic spells. All magic spells consume MP making them a limited resource, though a character’s overall MP capacity will grow with experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outside of magic, each character can also execute special attacks that are unique to them. These attacks are usually more devastating than standard attacks and sometimes require that the character is using a particular weapon class. These, too, gain skill points represented by five red stars that slowly build up to yellow, though special attacks consume SP (skill points). SP works much the same way as MP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Grandia Grinder Alert!&lt;lb/&gt;Rare Enemies Give High XP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Typically, the game’s monsters do a good job of seeking you out, but there are occasional difficult-to-catch enemies to be found as well. Notice, for instance, the Chameleon enemies in the Virgin Forest. These green creatures are shy and are hard to catch and engage. But persist, and finish them off for a huge load of experience points — well worth a grinding sesh or three.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Experience Required&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grandia has a complex (for the time) experience points system, which is cleverly segmented into several categories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To start, each playable character has a set of basic stats that slowly increase as they gain experience. Hit Points (HP) are your standard measure of health and these increase at level-ups. SP are your skill points, which increase the speed and potency of your special attacks, as well as unlock new special attacks as you accumulate experience. Finally, the same is true of the more traditional magic points (MP), with the difference between SP and MP being that special attacks are individualized whereas magic attacks are more common amongst party members and can be bought in exchange for Mana Eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As they adventure, Justin and company will occasionally find items that slightly boost a particular stat on a permanent basis. These items are rare indeed, but as with life, incremental gains tend to compound until the effects are undeniable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most traditionally, defeating enemies grants experience points and accumulating the required amount grants characters a level-up, which slightly increases basic stats. Experience gained and gold / treasure collected is displayed on an after-battle screen. It is this type of XP that most contemporary RPGs concerned themselves with. Grandia ups the complexity a bit by introducing leveling for magic and skills, and further mixes things up by employing different weapon classes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Justin and company are each capable of wielding a few different types of weapons, of which there are seven in total, ranging from swords to maces to staffs to bows. Each weapon class has its advantages and disadvantages, be it speed of use (from Command input to Execution on the IP gauge), to range, to overall damage dealt. As party members use their weapons, they gain experience in those weapon types, separately from their character experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In total, Grandia features basic character experience points which boosts common stats, magic experience which results in spells being cast faster and the learning of higher-level spells for various element types, skill experience for faster execution of special attacks, and weapon experience points which increase how well a character will handle that weapon type. Cleverly, these different experience categories are implemented in such a way as to make it entirely possible for gamers to completely ignore this aspect of the game should they so fancy. Because the system is automated, gamers can pay all of it little heed and still progress and have a great time with the game. Alternately, gamers can dive right into the finer points of the system to make those minor tweaks to get their characters to exactly the state they prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mysterious Liete awaits at Alent. The enigmatic Puffy accompanies Sue wherever she goes. Lastly, Darlin is one of the many non-human denizens of Grandia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Go with the Flow&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grandia allows up to four playable characters to form Justin’s party at any one time. As the story progresses, some of the main characters will permanently step away from the adventure, for reasons practical and dramatic alike. One such parting in particular tugs at the heartstrings — it is nothing quite as dramatic as the year’s earlier death of Aeris (Aerith) from that big RPG on Sony’s lesser 32-bit machine, but it somehow feels more relatable, and more impactful. Players ought not be surprised by the need for tissues to manage an unexpected tear or two. And here, too, Grandia innovates: a portion of a departing playable character’s magic and weapon experience points are stored in the stashing place, to be retrieved and applied to whatever character you see fit. This strengthens their legacy in your party, as well as provide a practical reason not to neglect building up a character just because they may eventually leave the party. A nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Is It Perfect?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grand as it sounds, the game isn’t without a few small flaws. Story-wise, players will be left wanting to know more about Justin’s father and how he came to be the keeper of his Spirit Stone. He is mentioned often in the early stages of the game, but as Justin’s adventure takes off, that arc never completes. Likewise for General Baal — we eventually learn his motivations, but not so much why he has become who he is today. A really well put together villain is one with whom we can empathise; someone whose circumstance we can understand. Both with Justin’s unnamed father and with Baal, there is a feeling that we are reading a book and that the answers lie just ahead, but despite some teasing, Grandia never lets us turn the page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technically, the game’s 3D is solid and varied, with plenty of minor details and meticulous textures, especially in the town sections. Blending VDP2-drawn planes with solid geometry and animated sprites means the world of Grandia is beautifully rendered, but that comes at the cost of an oft-stuttering framerate. The more of Grandia’s world we are allowed to see at once, the more the framerate suffers. Now, these were the formative years of 3D gaming, but at times, that framerate simply chugs, and it’s noticeable to the point of distraction. Thankfully, for most of the game, the framerate sits comfortably in the ‘acceptable’ space, but you won’t get through the game without feeling the Saturn sweat as it works to display all that Grandia’s artists wanted you to see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speaking of 3D, the game often requires the shifting of camera angles when exploring. When in long dungeons or any other large space, this can quickly become disorienting, and the player will lose their sense of direction. The game compensates somewhat for this with the addition of the compass, though its implementation is somewhat clumsy as rather than point north, it points to an exit or other objective. There is also lookout points called Dungeon Scopes, where the player is given a bird’s eye view of their current location from a default ‘north is up’ viewpoint. This helps orientating, but those lookout points are few and far between and using them tends to break up the game’s flow. Players may well find themselves keeping their camera shifting to a minimum as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, a technical note: Grandia sure gives the Saturn’s laser a workout, and there are some clever pre-loading techniques implemented to keep the game flowing as smoothly as possible. The cost here is that Grandia is very sensitive to disc quality. Those that have burnt their English-patched game onto CDs and are playing on real Saturn hardware may well find the game freeze, especially in battle when calling various spells. This is VERY annoying, especially as dungeon save points are sparse, and it is not uncommon to be in the heat of a battle only to have everyone freeze with the reset button being the only escape. This is remedied by using an ODE solution that omits discs entirely, but the game’s sensitivity to the quality of your CD-R burn needs to be called out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final Word&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grandia is great. The visuals are gorgeous, the music is appropriately evocative, the combat is frenetically strategic, and the story is well paced. Tough battles and surprise plot twists await intrepid gamers, and sub-plots occasionally weave their way into the adventure, too — especially in sections where we briefly leave Justin. On occasion, players will follow Colonel Mullen with Feena, explore the mysterious past of Mullen’s attaché Leen, or even soak in the comedic antics of the three beautiful Garlyle generals Mio, Nana, and Saki.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Grandia a delight to play. A total joy… but one that demands an intense time commitment. A player Justin’s age surely has the time, but what about those of us that are well into adulting? Some sections of the game, especially the longer dungeons, have few opportunities to save one’s game. In that sense, the game is a total hardcore, traditional JRPG. It is not easily digested in small play sessions, so playing Grandia is committing a huge slice of one’s discretionary time budget.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet, perhaps paradoxically, playing Grandia has a way of making one feel young again. Grandia is grand in the same way we ourselves felt grand as youngsters — that, armed with a stick we’ve just picked up and nothing more than our imagination, our wits, and our indomitable spirit, we could go forth boldly and change the world. That’s the beauty of a main character like Justin — he is not yet jaded; he has not yet borne the burden of grown-up problems on his shoulders. In many ways, we were all Justin (or Sue!) at one point, and the game shines a light on that part of us that is now long behind (most of) us. Perhaps the most memorable aspect of Grandia is that it allows us, for a moment all too brief, to once again be that young boy or girl full of optimism and energy, and in today’s complex and stressful world, that feels simply wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Three Optional Dungeons&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grandia is generally a well-balanced affair, with experience accumulating at the right rate for players to progress in the game. That said, the world of Grandia plays host to three completely optional dungeons meant solely for increasing character abilities and experience — and goes so far as to explicitly point out that these areas are not part of the game’s story and are entirely optional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first such dungeon can be found just west of the first section of the Zil Desert. It’s a large, very dark brown multi-leveled maze with the only save point being at the entrance. The enemies are tougher than one would expect at this point in the game, but nothing is impossible for Justin et al. The key here is to find the four Soldier’s Souls, which grants access to the treasures of the dungeon, at the very end, past the boss. The boss is a remix of a previous boss from Feena’s failed wedding to Pakon and packs quite a punch. The main prize here is the excellent Godspeed Knife, which adds a huge ACT boost, to massively speed up the user’s IP gauge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second optional dungeon is also found to the west but is accessible from the second part of the Zil Desert. This dungeon is very small but has perhaps the most charm. Justin and company are greeted by a mysterious Lady at the castle entrance, begging for help but also warning of a curse on the castle. Once inside, there are several rooms to visit and loot to collect. Really simplistic and set to lure the player to lower their guard, just in time to battle the formidable Lord’s Ghost boss. This guy’s TOUGH, with strong multi-character attacks and cancelling moves. Take him down to claim the awesome Lightning Sword, which gives a 50 ATK boost and, as an elemental sword, has the Zap! spell built in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final optional dungeon is the mother of all dungeons in Grandia. Found tucked away in the Savanna Wilderness and accessible via a secret passage, the Tower of Temptation consists of an outside area and 12 (!) floors of punishing combat. Of course, the only save point is at the very start of the outside area, though Justin can activate a couple of shortcuts through the tower as he makes progress, so that backtracking to heal and save is a bit easier. Interestingly, the starting area is surrounded by six Zero Weapons – one of each kind of weapons that grants a 0 ATK value — ideal for training weapons on weaker enemies, as these will do nearly no damage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grandia Grinder Mini-Alert: many enemies in the Tower drop stat-increasing items, making this an ideal place to pull it all out and go for that growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each floor of the Tower features maze sections, hidden doors, powerful enemies, and of course, switches to hit. Simply by making one’s way through the tower will increase the party’s levels, as there is so much battling to do. It is not uncommon to spend hours in the Tower, so it’s a welcome fact that the Tower is entirely optional. The final three floors are all boss — yes, there are three bosses to fight in a row. No saving, no healing. The final of the three bosses is tough as nails, but the reward is well worth it — NINE amazing items to pick up, including two items from the Grinder’s Gear™ premium collection: the Astral Miracle and the Ethereal Miracle, both accessories that double weapon or magic experience gained. VERY useful, but they better be, considering the pain just endured to complete the Tower of Temptation!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Universe is Grand…ia&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grandia went on to sell bucket-loads in Japan, especially during release week. It received a Digital Museum DLC-style disc, got a port on the mass-market PlayStation including a PS Greatest Hits re-release, and finally, a PlayStation English localization in 1999. The series continued in 2000 with the excellent Grandia 2 on Dreamcast, which itself was later poorly ported to Sony’s killer of dreams, the PlayStation 2. That system would also see the less-well received Grandia 3, which would spell the end of the main series’ run. The series also saw several spin-off games such as Grandia Xtreme and Grandia Online. Additionally, the first Grandia was recently remade for modern consoles with the release of the Grandia HD Collection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*Note: you cannot inspect monsters’ genders in battle. That was just a joke. Also there is no Grinder’s Gear in Grandia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;I’m Not Crying, You’re Crying!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A bit of a personal story… The above screenshot is my favorite scene in all of Grandia. See, the game does a brilliant job of bringing us back to the days of youthful adventures where nothing at all was impossible, and despite whatever danger beset us, we knew deep down that in the end, we would be all right. But in the most subtle of ways, Grandia also covers personal growth and the passage of time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At some point, deep into the adventure, 8-year-old Sue gets tired. At first, she temporarily leaves the party whilst recuperating at a local sick house, with everyone hoping (and the player confidently knowing) that she will get better. But… she doesn’t. She puts on a brave face and re-joins the party, going on one final quest. As the gamer, I kept looking for the herb or special item that I could find to cure her, but no such moment ever came. There never was any single wound or ailment that Sue suffered, it’s just that one day, she simply… got tired, and ultimately, had to leave the party. She was a trooper through the entire adventure; completely indispensable she was, but there was a sunset to her time on the grand adventure, and she ended up leaving far too soon for my liking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In real life, this sometimes happens, too. People in our orbit — strong, vibrant people, whom we believe will be with us forever — sometimes, unexpectedly, undeservedly… get tired, and have to quit the great adventure. Sometimes they are even younger than us, or in better health than us, or benefitting from any number of other factors that make their leaving seem senseless and cruelly unfair. It’s a reminder of the finite nature of life, and that sometimes we are living oh so naively and innocently through what we will later call the best times of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we get a chance to say our goodbyes before they depart us, and this is something Justin and Feena were able to share with Sue. With tears in her eyes, even as she bade farewell, she wished for Justin to follow his dreams and complete his long quest to find Angelou. It’s this that ties all of these sentiments together, for me. We all get older. We all leave our childhood behind us and begin to lead our adult lives in earnest. Our carefree days of questing and playing our days away, confident that in the end, everything will be all right, are replaced by planning, worrying, pressure, stress, failure, and other harsh realities of life. Here, Sue reminds us of the importance of not forgetting our dreams. We may not have the time or the energy that we did then, but whatever the obstacles, we must always go boldly in the direction of our dreams, hand-in-hand with those who love us, for we, too, will one day exit the adventure. In our final moments, what sweeter satisfaction could there be than to warmly smile at those who walked with us, and to look back on our journey with pride.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m enjoying my Xberry Pi ZX Spectrum Next, but I have to say the ‘simple’ upgrade of getting it onto Wifi via the cheap and cheerful ESP 8266 was not fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I had every intention of setting up my Speccy keyboard on the board’s matrix connector, I need to wait for a socket of the correct pitch. It turns out the Xberry Pi needs 0.2mm spacing and I have none in my parts box. Instead I figured do the other main upgrades, namely add a Pi Zero “accelerator” and the Wifi upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ZX Next Pi Zero Accelerator Upgrade&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fully expecting the Pi Zero to be the thing that caused me trouble, I was shocked that not only my soldering had gone perfectly but also the flashing of the SD card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So many community members had advised to use a highly specific Pi Zero, I thought my spare board would be wrong. But it worked first time!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My pin header made the soldering trickier than usual, maybe it soaked a lot of heat? Just remember the header needs to go on the ‘wrong’ side and take your time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi Zero upgrade is hardly used currently but the ZX Next team keep hinting at future utility, and at least one game is in development that uses it as a kind of math coprocessor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So after running a TZX file and some SID tunes, I moved on to the ESP figuring I would have everything done quick as a flash. Pardon the pun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Adding Wifi to the Next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Next can come with Wifi already installed apparently, and some Xberry bundles come with one as standard, but the chosen module is an ESP 01 / 8266 which is something I have on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s precious little documentation for this kind of thing out there, but I did find YouTube videos that made everything look very straightforward. That should have been the first red flag!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of them showed installing the correct ESP firmware, what baud rate the Next expects, or even attaching the ESP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I picked out a board I was confident was working fine, attached it, successfully ran the ESP Updater.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After it confirmed the update, I tried to connect to wifi using the built-in Next menu item …. and failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact the ESP Updater did its thing suggests also the board was fine therefore I tried and failed all the many ways to get the “driver” to install.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I quickly started to hate this “Installing Driver…” message. There is no indication if anything is happening when it gets stuck there for ages, but other times it quickly quits back to the menu, again with no feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: Even with everything now ‘working’, it often takes a lot more attempts than you would expect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To save anyone else the bother I went through, and potentially Future Chris, the key was to NOT update the ESP 01 firmware. Just use whatever your board came with by default. My working firmware is not even listed on the ESP Updater repo …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I rummaged around and found another ESP board that had never had its firmware flashed. Using a breadboard I confirmed it was working and responding to AT commands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;CircuitPython Code to Communicate with ESP01 via UART&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
import board,binascii
import adafruit_pio_uart
# Define the UART pins (example using GP16 for TX and GP17 for RX)
# The actual pins depend on your specific wiring/board configuration.
UART_TX = board.GP16
UART_RX = board.GP17
# Initialize the UART connection
# The baudrate for the ESP01 is typically 115200
uart = adafruit_pio_uart.UART(UART_TX, UART_RX, baudrate=115200)

def send(s):
    uart.write(s+'\r\n')
    print(uart.read(255).decode())
send('AT+RST')
send('AT')
send('AT+GMR')
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This code allows you to hook the ESP01 up to pins 16 and 17 for UART, and 3.3v and GND.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wifi on the ZX Spectrum Next … Finally!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again it didn’t work on the ZX Next right away, but I persisted and finally signs of life!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hope this helps someone else out there! I found it incredibly frustrating but now I am back to having fun with my ZX Next experience rather than regretting my choices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seems life might have been easier if a Pi Zero W was used instead of a Pi and an ESP8266, or even an ESP32, but perhaps there is a good reason they went with the little old ESP01.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Brent's Encapsulated C Programming Rules&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below are some rules that I have developed over a long period of time writing fully encapsulated C programs. C is my favorite language and I love the freedom and exploration it allows me. I also love that it is so close to Assembly and I love writing assembly for much of the same reasons!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE: You may see references to ‘perfect encapsulation’ throughout. I offer both a ‘performance’ and a ‘pure encapsulation’ approach to C here (first two headers). So feel free to interpret the rest of the rules based on the approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JMP&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pure encapsulation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No encapsulation performance&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory ownership&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Avoid void*&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don’t over-complicate strings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don’t over-complicate stdlib&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use utf8 strings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don’t use char for memory array, use uint8_t&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use standard bool&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don’t use static or global variables&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prefer inline over macro&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Test your functions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write functions to do one thing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don’t write systems, write modular pieces (think UNIX)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Warnings are errors&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If there is a standard, use it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use float epsilon for 0 checking&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zero set your structs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Big types first&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More to come&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pure encapsulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the great things about C is that it allows for “pure encapsulation”. What this means is that you can explain all the intent of your code through the header file and the developer who uses your lib/code never has to look at the actual implementations of the code. Now to take this a step further, well all know that C supports the &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; keyword to group data, and we can also make the members of a struct hidden completely from the developer using the library. For example, we could declare the following header and C files:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;vec3.h&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#ifndef VEC3_H
#define VEC3_H

struct Vec3;

#endif
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;vec3.c&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include "vec3.h"

struct Vec3 {
	float x;
	float y;
	float z;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see in the above code sample, if you were just to have the header file, you would not know that this vector is implemented using 3 &lt;code&gt;floats&lt;/code&gt;. This is very important for pure encapsulation. With this, you can completely control the behavior of the struct and it’s contents using readable functions and not worry about the developer using the code directly mutating the members of your &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;. Now that you’ve created pure encapsulation, you are able to feel safe knowing that developers can’t new up the struct or abuse it’s contents from anywhere other than through the code you’ve written in your &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;No encapsulation performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the flaws with pure encapsulation is that you can see a drop in performance. Having a bunch of functions to get inner members of a structure also blocks the compiler from optimizing it’s best. Member hiding is not usually because we don’t trust the end developer with the secrets of our structures, but is often so they don’t make mistakes by changing things they shouldn’t. Also member hiding helps so that we can easily update our code without changing the interface that developers rely on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That being said, if we are dealing with performance critical code, or just want extra optimization by our compiler (and/or to write less code); we can expose the members of our structure. However, let’s be smart about exposing these members so that developers don’t accidentally make mistakes with their new found power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;, our best friend in this scenario. We can not only mark our members as &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; before their type, but also after their type. The general rule of thumb to remember is, if it is a pointer, the &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; goes after the type, otherwise put it before the type. In the simple example below, you can see how pointers have the &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; after, and the rest have &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; before their type declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct Employer {
	char* const name;
	const int years;
};

struct Employee {
	struct Employer* const employer;
	char* const name;
	const int age;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this way we are able to expose the fields of the struct to the rest of the code for compiler optimizations, ease of access, etc; while also being able to prevent developers from directly assigning/changing the values of those fields. The obvious downside to this is that you will need to either create a macro, or manually cast assign the fields to change them in the implementation C file. I would recommend, if you are using C17, to use &lt;code&gt;_Generic&lt;/code&gt; and macros so you can create a single &lt;code&gt;#define OVERRIDE(field)&lt;/code&gt; type of macro and have the compiler throw if it finds an un-expected type. Of course, if you don’t want to use a macro, you can also create separate &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; functions to do the same (just might be harder to manage). Below is an example of how we can tell the compiler we want to explicitly change the value in the implementation c file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// employee.c file

void employee_set_age(struct Employee* employee, int newAge) {
	// Cast away the const and set it's value, the compiler should optimize this for you
	*(int*)&amp;amp;employee-&amp;gt;age = newAge;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Memory ownership&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With perfect encapsulation you are most of the way towards having good memory ownership. If you purely encapsulate your structs the only way for a developer to create a new instance of the struct would be through functions you create yourself. From this point you can create the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; functions to manage the memory of your struct. Below is an example building upon the previous code sample.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;vec3.h&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#ifndef VEC3_H
#define VEC3_H

struct Vec3;

struct Vec3* Vec3_new();
void Vec3_free(struct Vec3* vector);
void Vec3_print(struct Vec3* vector);

#endif
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;vec3.c&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include "vec3.h"
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;

struct Vec3 { /* ... */ };

struct Vec3* Vec3_new()
{
	struct Vec3* v = malloc(sizeof(struct Vec3));
	v-&amp;gt;x = 0.0F;
	v-&amp;gt;y = 0.0F;
	v-&amp;gt;z = 0.0F;
	return v;
}

void Vec3_free(struct Vec3* vector)
{
	free(vector);
}

void Vec3_print(struct Vec3* vector)
{
	printf("&amp;lt;%f, %f, %f&amp;gt;", vector-&amp;gt;x, vector-&amp;gt;y, vector-&amp;gt;z);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above you can see that we encapsulate the creation, usage, and freeing of our &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;. You would think, well with this, what else do we need to know about memory management? Well there is one more thing, more of a rule that you must follow more than anything else. The thing that declares the memory is the thing that should free the memory. We see this in action above, the &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; file that creates the memory in turn has a function for freeing the memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s look at another example using a &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt; to represent a string function. Here we have a function that takes a string and clones it (wrong way):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;char* strclone(const char* str)
{
	size_t len = strlen(s) + 1;
	char* clone = malloc(len);
	memcpy(clone, str, len);
	return clone;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now what is wrong with the memory management on this code? Answer, we are using &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; to create memory and then return the string. Let’s take a look at the developer using this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;char* str = "Hello Brent!\0";
char* cpy = strclone(str);
printf(cpy);
free(cpy);	// Allowed?
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How is the developer suppose to know that they are to free the &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt;? For all they know the &lt;code&gt;strclone&lt;/code&gt; uses some-sort of pooling functionality to re-use a pool of memory, we can’t free that otherwise you risk seg-faulting. What is a better version of this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void strclone(const char* str, char** outCpy)
{
	size_t len = strlen(s) + 1;
	*outCpy = malloc(len);
	memcpy(outCpy, str, len);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now with this version we make it explicit that the developer should manage their own object that they pass in. We use the hint name out as a prefix to the argument name to let them know memory will be allocated for this input variable. What does this look like to the developer?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;char* str = "Hello Brent!\0";
char* cpy;
strclone(str, &amp;amp;cpy);
printf(cpy);
free(cpy);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at this version, the developer knows they are in charge of freeing the &lt;code&gt;cpy&lt;/code&gt;, this is because they declare the variable in the first place, rather than being assigned from a function. If the developer follows our rule (The thing that declares the memory is the thing that should free the memory), they declared the variable/pointer so they should be the ones freeing it. Now I know you can argue all sorts of alternative setups for the return value, but the fact of the matter is that passing in a pointer to a pointer is much more clear of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Avoid void*&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One stigma people have against C is the use of &lt;code&gt;void*&lt;/code&gt;, some think it is necessary, some use it to solve problems quickly through the path of least resistance, I say that there are very few cases when &lt;code&gt;void*&lt;/code&gt; is acceptable and most of the time your current problem isn’t it. Like &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;void*&lt;/code&gt; is a lazy solution to a problem and causes all kinds of un-necessary runtime checking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In most cases you should create a &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; that explicitly defines what type is accepted or stored. The biggest advantage of this approach is that you put the compiler to work for you. There are all sorts of compile-time checks that will prevent you from doing something you shouldn’t do. Also your IDE will be much more helpful when trying to navigate code as the IDE, nor the compiler, have any idea where a void* comes from or what it points to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Don’t over-complicate strings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I want to live in the 2020 era of programming, that means I probably will wind up using more than one library to solve a problem. My new problem is that people think it is cute to typedef &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt; to some other name and only accept that name in their code. In the era of UTF8, that is completely un-necessary and makes me have to do a lot of senseless casting. If you want to encapsulate that you are using a string (so I don’t know it) then cool, do that, but &lt;code&gt;typedef unsigned char* string&lt;/code&gt; is not it. Please stick to the good ol’ &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt; for strings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Don’t over-complicate stdlib&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Use utf8 strings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Talking about strings, I’d like to point out that UTF-8 is fully compatible with ASCII, this means we don’t need special functions for special characters or non English characters. All of our usual suspects of functions work on UTF-8 such as &lt;code&gt;fopen&lt;/code&gt;! There are some helpful other things we can use thanks to compilers such as placing &lt;code&gt;u8&lt;/code&gt; in front of an in-line string:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;char* utf8 = u8"Hello World!";
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in closing on the UTF-8 topic, please stop using &lt;code&gt;wchar_t&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;char16_t&lt;/code&gt;, and all those other variants (except when you are forced to, due to 3rd party libraries). With that, I’ll leave you with this helper function to get you started:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;size_t utf8len(const char* const str) {
    size_t len = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; *str != 0; ++len) {
        int v0 = (*str &amp;amp; 0x80) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 7;
        int v1 = (*str &amp;amp; 0x40) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 6;
        int v2 = (*str &amp;amp; 0x20) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 5;
        int v3 = (*str &amp;amp; 0x10) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 4;
        str += 1 + v0 * v1 + v0 * v1 * v2 + v0 * v1 * v2 * v3;
    }
    return len;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE 1: A simplified version of this was proposed by Max Brauer on Stack Overflow to be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;size_t utf8len(const char* str) {
    size_t len = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; *str != 0; ++len) {
        int v01 = ((*str &amp;amp; 0x80) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 7) &amp;amp; ((*str &amp;amp; 0x40) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 6);
        int v2 = (*str &amp;amp; 0x20) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 5;
        int v3 = (*str &amp;amp; 0x10) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 4;
        str += 1 + ((v01 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; v2) | (v01 &amp;amp; v3));
    }
    return len;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE 2: This does not validate the utf8 string. I am not fond of making the length function also validate the string, for that we should create a separate method for validation. Using this table I found on Wikipedia we can construct a validation function (also this table was used for the length function).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bool utf8valid(const char* const str) {
    if (str == NULL)
        return false;
    const char* c = str;
    bool valid = true;
    for (size_t i = 0; c[0] != 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; valid;) {
        valid = (c[0] &amp;amp; 0x80) == 0
            || ((c[0] &amp;amp; 0xE0) == 0xC0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (c[1] &amp;amp; 0xC0) == 0x80)
            || ((c[0] &amp;amp; 0xF0) == 0xE0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (c[1] &amp;amp; 0xC0) == 0x80 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (c[2] &amp;amp; 0xC0) == 0x80)
            || ((c[0] &amp;amp; 0xF8) == 0xF0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (c[1] &amp;amp; 0xC0) == 0x80 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (c[2] &amp;amp; 0xC0) == 0x80 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (c[3] &amp;amp; 0xC0) == 0x80);
        int v0 = (c[0] &amp;amp; 0x80) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 7;
        int v1 = (c[0] &amp;amp; 0x40) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 6;
        int v2 = (c[0] &amp;amp; 0x20) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 5;
        int v3 = (c[0] &amp;amp; 0x10) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 4;
        i += 1 + v0 * v1 + v0 * v1 * v2 + v0 * v1 * v2 * v3;
        c = str + i;
    }
    return valid;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE 3: Based on the same simplification previously discussed, this would become:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bool utf8valid(const char* const str) {
    if (str == NULL)
        return false;
    const char* c = str;
    bool valid = true;
    for (size_t i = 0; c[0] != 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; valid;) {
        valid = (c[0] &amp;amp; 0x80) == 0
            || ((c[0] &amp;amp; 0xE0) == 0xC0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (c[1] &amp;amp; 0xC0) == 0x80)
            || ((c[0] &amp;amp; 0xF0) == 0xE0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (c[1] &amp;amp; 0xC0) == 0x80 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (c[2] &amp;amp; 0xC0) == 0x80)
            || ((c[0] &amp;amp; 0xF8) == 0xF0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (c[1] &amp;amp; 0xC0) == 0x80 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (c[2] &amp;amp; 0xC0) == 0x80 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (c[3] &amp;amp; 0xC0) == 0x80);
        int v01 = ((*str &amp;amp; 0x80) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 7) &amp;amp; ((*str &amp;amp; 0x40) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 6);
        int v2 = (c[0] &amp;amp; 0x20) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 5;
        int v3 = (c[0] &amp;amp; 0x10) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 4;
        i += 1 + ((v01 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; v2) | (v01 &amp;amp; v3));
        c = str + i;
    }
    return valid;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE 4: Something that developers trip on is the file encoding for their source file. Be sure you are using UTF-8 encoding for your source file when typing UTF-8 strings directly into your source code. If you use the wrong encoding, the compiler may compile the inline string with the incorrect encoding, even with the &lt;code&gt;u8&lt;/code&gt; prefix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Don’t use char for memory array, use uint8_t&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In making code readable, you should only use &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;unsigned char*&lt;/code&gt; for strings (character arrays). If you want a block of bytes/memory pointer, then you should use &lt;code&gt;uint8_t*&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;uint8_t&lt;/code&gt; is part of &lt;code&gt;stdint.h&lt;/code&gt;. This makes the code much more readable where memory is represented as an unsighned 8-bit array of numbers (byte array). Now you can trust when you see a &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt; that it is referring to a UTF-8 (or ASCII) character array (text).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Use standard bool&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is easy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdbool.h&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t make defines for &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt; and it’s true counterpart, please just use the standard library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Don’t use static or global variables&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; functions are fine, they are great for breaking up functions to be readable. However, &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; variables are bad and almost always not needed. Remember that we are living in a world where our CPUs are not getting faster, they are just coming in larger quantities. Always think about threadability and controlling mutation. Even with a variable that is static to a &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; file and not global, you never know if someone is using threads to call your functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Prefer inline over macro&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Functions that are &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; are much more readable, work better with your IDE code searching, and are much more readable when you get errors/warnings from the compiler. Some macros are great, don’t ban them altogether, but do consider if you can do what you need through an inline function first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Test your functions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C is beautiful in the fact that you don’t need unit test frameworks to fully test your code. It’s lack of objects and hidden state make it even better for testing. If you create a function, make a test for it and give it your known test case arguments. Did I mention that I love not having to have a big complicated mocking library to fully test my code? If your function takes in a complicated struct for some reason, feel free to &lt;code&gt;define&lt;/code&gt; out/in a test function for creating the struct you expect to be testing (do NOT comprimise perfect encapsulation for the sake of testing).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Write functions to do one thing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, this isn’t a C only thing, but make sure your functions are not creating large call stacks. Feel free to use &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;static inline&lt;/code&gt; local functions to break up the readability of large functions if you just can’t seem to make functions do a single thing (for performance for example).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Don’t write systems, write modular pieces (think UNIX)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t write big complicated systems to cover many problems, even if things are losely related in many ways. It is better to break up your code into useful functional pieces and cleverly put them together to have complex behavior. The beauty of Unix is that you can get many things done through many small programs pieced together. In the same way, you should develop useful functions that can be pieced together through data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Warnings are errors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is a bit short. The idea is simple, warnings are errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make sure ALL warnings are enabled (&lt;code&gt;/Wall&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make sure that you turn on warnings as errors&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: If you copied some source code from the internet that you need and it is producing warnings, turn it into a lib and use the lib, do not comprimise your code for other people’s un-checked code. You’d be surprised how many popular libraries fail warnings as errors test (often they develop assuming 32-bit code).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;If there is a standard, use it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was touched on before with &lt;code&gt;stdbool.h&lt;/code&gt;, but if there is a standard function or type, use it. Use things like &lt;code&gt;int32_t&lt;/code&gt; over just &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; hoping that &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; will be 32-bit. If there is a standard function for doing something, don’t re-invent the wheel. Wrapping standard functions such as &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; I would consider a necessary evil if you are creating tools to detect memory leaks and the like though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Use float epsilon for 0 checking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First of all, don’t check a floating point value against &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;0.0F&lt;/code&gt;. Instead check it against Epsilon like in the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;math.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;float.h&amp;gt;

int main(void)
{
	float x = 1.0F;
	x -= 1.0F;
	if (fabsf(x) &amp;lt;= FLT_EPSILON)
	{
		// ... The value is basically 0, do some stuff
	}
	return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively you can choose a fractionally small number like &lt;code&gt;0.0001F&lt;/code&gt; to check against if that is your cup of tea as well. The reason is floating point precision errors (which you probably know or have heard of by now). I enjoy &lt;code&gt;FLT_EPSILON&lt;/code&gt; because it is part of the &lt;code&gt;float.h&lt;/code&gt; lib and a standard for everyone to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Zero Set Your Structs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing that would get me when developing in C is pointers inside of objects not being set to &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;. Now I know I speak about hating that the idea of &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; exists, but when working with other people’s code it is impossible for you not to run into a situation where you need to set a pointer to &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, pass a &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; or check a pointer against &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;. So do yourself a favor and always use &lt;code&gt;calloc&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;memset(&amp;amp;thing, 0, sizeof(thing))&lt;/code&gt; if it isn’t a pointer or new memory). Of course this doesn’t ban the use of &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;, in fact you should continue to use it on buffers, but as programmers, we have a problem with not touching code that works and you think it is fine to just add in that extra field, but if it is a pointer and you don’t initialize it to &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; where needed, you’re in for a world of hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Big types first&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you create a structure, put the biggest types at the top of your struct and the smallest types at the bottom. Platforms like the x86 will magically help you with this (at a cost), but other platforms (like ARM) will generate SEGFALT if you don’t properly do this. This is because of padding in a struct. If you put a &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt; as the first field and a &lt;code&gt;int32_t&lt;/code&gt; as the second field in a struct, like the one below, you will have a problem where you pack 1 byte, then 4 bytes into the struct, effectively having a 5 byte struct. The problem here is that the CPU is optimized to read along memory boundaries. When you &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;, you won’t get an odd memory address for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct Bad {
	bool first;
	int32_t second;
};

struct Good {
	int32_t first;
	bool second;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;More to come&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are inevitably more things I’ve forgotten about, but I’ve written this all in one sitting so this is good enough for now until I can update!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

What Was the Cost?</title><link>https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/12/15/oliver-sacks-put-himself-into-his-case-studies-what-was-the-cost</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="b6d197fda2b78777"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Oliver Sacks arrived in New York City, in September, 1965, he wore a butter-colored suit that reminded him of the sun. He had just spent a romantic week in Europe travelling with a man named Jenö Vincze, and he found himself walking too fast, fizzing with happiness. “My blood is champagne,” he wrote. He kept a letter Vincze had written him in his pocket all day, feeling as if its pages were glowing. Sacks had moved to New York to work as a fellow in neuropathology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, in the Bronx, and a colleague observed that he was “walking on air.” Every morning, he carefully polished his shoes and shaved. He adored his bosses. “I smile like a lighthouse in all directions,” he wrote Vincze.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks was thirty-two, and he told Vincze that this was his first romantic relationship that was both physical and reciprocal. He felt he was part of a “two man universe,” seeing the world for the first time—“seeing it clear, and seeing it whole.” He wandered along the shipping piers on the Hudson River, where gay men cruised, with a notebook that he treated as a diary and as an endless letter to Vincze. “To watch life with the eyes of a homosexual is the greatest thing in the world,” Vincze had once told Sacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks’s mother, a surgeon in London, had suspected that her son was gay when he was a teen-ager. She declared that homosexuality was an “abomination,” using the phrase “filth of the bowel” and telling him that she wished he’d never been born. They didn’t speak of the subject again. Sacks had moved to America—first to California and then, after five years, to New York—because, he wrote in his journal, “I wanted a sexual and moral freedom I felt I could never have in England.” That fall, during Yom Kippur, he decided that, rather than going to synagogue to confess “to the total range of human sin,” a ritual he’d grown up with, he’d spend the night at a bar, enjoying a couple of beers. “What I suppose I am saying, Jenö, is that I now feel differently about myself, and therefore about homosexuality as a whole,” he wrote. “I am through with cringing, and apologies, and pious wishes that I might have been ‘normal.’ ” (The Oliver Sacks Foundation shared with me his correspondence and other records, as well as four decades’ worth of journals—many of which had not been read since he wrote them.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In early October, Sacks sent two letters to Vincze, but a week passed without a reply. Sacks asked his colleagues to search their mailboxes, in case the letter had been put in the wrong slot. Within a few days, however, he had given up on innocent explanations. He began dressing sloppily. He stopped coming to work on time. He had sex with a series of men who disgusted him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After two weeks, Vincze, who was living in Berlin, sent a letter apologizing for his delayed reply and reiterating his love. He explained that he was so preoccupied by thoughts of Sacks that he felt as if he were living in a “Klaudur,” a German word that Vincze defined as a “spiritual cell.” He seems to have misspelled Klausur, which refers to an enclosed area in a monastery, but Sacks kept using the misspelled word, becoming obsessed with it. “It ramifies in horrible associations,” he wrote Vincze. “The closing of a door. Klaudur, claustrophobia, the sense of being shut in.” Sacks had long felt as if he were living in a cell, incapable of human contact, and this word appeared to be all he needed to confirm that the condition was terminal. The meaning of the word began morphing from “spiritual cell” to “psychotic cage.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The intimacy Sacks had rejoiced in now seemed phony, a “folie à deux”—a two-person delusion. His doubts intensified for a month, then he cut off the relationship. “I must tear you out of my system, because I dare not be involved,” he told Vincze, explaining that he barely remembered how he looked, or the sound of his voice. “I hope I will not be taken in like this again, and that—conversely—I will have the strength and clarity of mind to perceive any future such relationships as morbid at their inception, and to abort the folly of their further growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two months later, Sacks felt himself “slipping down the greased path of withdrawal, discontent, inability to make friends, inability to have sex, etc. etc. towards suicide in a New York apartment at the age of 32.” He took enormous amounts of amphetamines, to the point of hallucinating. A family friend, a psychiatrist who worked with Anna Freud, urged him to find a psychoanalyst. She wrote him that his homosexuality was “a very ‘secondary phenomenon’ ”: he was attracted to men as “a substitute for veering uncertainties of what/whom you could love other than as ‘idealizations’ of yourself.” A few weeks later, he started therapy with Leonard Shengold, a young psychiatrist who was deeply immersed in Manhattan’s psychoanalytic culture. “I think he is very good, and he has at least a very considerable local reputation,” Sacks wrote his parents, who helped to pay for the sessions, three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks had elevated yet hazy ambitions at the time: he wanted to be a novelist, but he also wanted to become the “Galileo of the inward,” he told a mentor, and to write the neurological equivalent of Sigmund Freud’s “Interpretation of Dreams.” He worked in wards with chronically ill and elderly patients who had been warehoused and neglected, and his prospects within academic medicine looked dim. “Have you published anything lately?” his father wrote him, in 1968. “Or have you found yourself temperamentally incapacitated from doing so?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Sacks began therapy, “my initial and ultimate complaint was of fixity—a feeling of not-going,” he wrote in his journal. He regarded Shengold as “a sort of analytic machine.” But gradually Sacks came to feel that “I love him, and need him; that I need him—and love him.” He had planned to stay in New York City only for a few years, but he kept delaying his return to England so that he could reach “a terminable point in my analysis.” Shengold, who would eventually publish ten books about psychoanalysis, wrote that therapy requires a “long period of working through”—a term he defined as the “need to repeat emotional conflicts over and over in life” until the patient has the “freedom to own what is there to be felt.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks saw Shengold for half a century. In that time, Sacks became one of the world’s most prominent neurologists and a kind of founding father of medical humanities—a discipline that coalesced in the seventies, linking healing with storytelling. But the freedom that Shengold’s analysis promised was elusive. After Vincze, Sacks did not have another relationship for forty-four years. He seemed to be doing the “working through” at a remove—again and again, his psychic conflicts were displaced onto the lives of his patients. He gave them “some of my own powers, and some of my phantasies too,” he wrote in his journal. “I write out symbolic versions of myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During Sacks’s neurology internship, in San Francisco, his childhood friend Eric Korn warned him that the residents at his hospital could sense he was gay. “For God’s sake, exercise what seems to you immoderate caution,” Korn wrote, in 1961. “Compartmentalize your life. Cover your tracks. Don’t bring in the wrong sort of guests to the hospital, or sign your name and address to the wrong sort of register.” He encouraged Sacks to read “Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life?,” a best-selling book by Edmund Bergler, who argued that homosexuality was an “illness as painful, as unpleasant and as disabling as any other serious affliction,” but one that psychoanalysis could cure. “The book is full of interest,” Korn wrote. “He claims a potential 100% ‘cures’ (a term he chooses to employ because he knows it teases) which is worth investigating perhaps.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Freud characterized homosexuality as a relatively normal variant of human behavior, but when psychoanalysis came to the United States, in the postwar years, homophobia took on new life. The historian Dagmar Herzog has described how, in the U.S., “reinventing psychoanalysis and reinventing homophobia went hand in hand.” Faced with men who persisted in their love for other men, American analysts commonly proposed celibacy as a stopgap solution. In the historian Martin Duberman’s memoir “Cures,” he writes that his psychoanalyst instructed him to “take the veil”—live celibately—so that he could be cured of his desire for men. Duberman agreed to these terms. The best he could get, he thought, was sublimation: instead of enjoying an “affective life,” he would make “some contribution to the general culture from which I was effectively barred.” Sacks, who was closeted until he was eighty, also followed this course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shengold had portraits of Charles Dickens, William Shakespeare, and Sigmund Freud in his office, on the Upper East Side. Like Sacks, he came from a literary Jewish family. He seemed deeply attuned to Sacks’s creative life, which took the form of ecstatic surges of literary inspiration followed by months of sterility and depression. “Do your best to enjoy and to work—it is the power of your mind that is crucial,” Shengold wrote when Sacks was on a visit with his family in England. Sacks wrote in his journal that he’d dreamed he overheard Shengold telling someone, “Oliver is lacking in proper self-respect; he has never really appreciated himself, or appreciated others’ appreciation of him. And yet, in his way, he is not less gifted than Auden was.” Sacks woke up flushed with embarrassment and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike many of his contemporaries, Shengold was not a doctrinaire thinker, but he was still susceptible to psychoanalytic fashions. Reflecting on how he might have viewed living openly as a gay man at that time, Shengold’s daughter, Nina, told me, “I don’t know that was a door that Dad necessarily had wide open.” In several books and papers, Shengold, a prolific reader of Western literature, tried to understand the process by which troubled people sublimate their conflicts into art. In his 1988 book, “Halo in the Sky: Observations on Anality and Defense,” Shengold wrote about the importance of transforming “anal-sadistic drives”—he used the anus as a metaphor for primitive, dangerous impulses—into “adaptive and creative ‘making.’ ” When Sacks read the book, he wrote in his journal that it “made me feel I was ‘lost in anality’ (whatever this means).”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before Vincze, Sacks had been in love with a man named Mel Erpelding, who once told him, Sacks wrote, that he “oozed sexuality, that it poured out through every pore, that I was alive and vibrant with sexuality (a positive-admiring way of putting things), but also that I was reeking and toxic with it.” (Erpelding, who ended up marrying a woman, never allowed his relationship with Sacks to become sexual.) In his early years of therapy, in the late sixties, Sacks resolved that he would give up both drugs and sex. It’s doubtful that Shengold encouraged his celibacy, but he may have accepted that sexual abstinence could be productive, at least for a time. Richard Isay, the first openly gay member of the American Psychoanalytic Association, said that, in the seventies, he’d “rationalized that maturity and mental health demanded the sublimation of sexual excitement in work.” Sacks told a friend, “Shengold is fond of quoting Flaubert’s words ‘the mind has its erections too.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Sacks, writing seemed almost physiological, like sweating—an involuntary response to stimuli. He routinely filled a whole journal in two days. “Should I then put down my pen, my interminable Journal (for this is but a fragment of the journal I have kept all my life),” he asked, “and ‘start living’ instead?” The answer was almost always no. Sometimes Sacks, who would eventually publish sixteen books, wrote continuously in his journal for six hours. Even when he was driving his car, he was still writing—he set up a tape recorder so that he could keep developing his thoughts, which were regularly interrupted by traffic or a wrong turn. Driving through Manhattan one day in 1975, he reflected on the fact that his closets, stuffed with pages of writing, resembled a “grave bursting open.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the late sixties, Sacks had become, he wrote, “almost a monk in my asceticism and devotion to work.” He estimated that he produced a million and a half words a year. When he woke up in the middle of the night with an erection, he would cool his penis by putting it in orange jello. He told Erpelding, “I partly accept myself as a celibate and a cripple, but partly—and this is . . . the wonder of sublimation—am able to transform my erotic feelings into other sorts of love—love for my patients, my work, art, thought.” He explained, “I keep my distance from people, am always courteous, never close. For me (as perhaps for you) there is almost no room, no moral room.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I have some hard ‘confessing’ to do—if not in public, at least to Shengold—and myself,” Sacks wrote in his journal, in 1985. By then, he had published four books—“Migraine,” “Awakenings,” “A Leg to Stand On,” and “The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat”—establishing his reputation as “our modern master of the case study,” as the Times put it. He rejected what he called “pallid, abstract knowing,” and pushed medicine to engage more deeply with patients’ interiority and how it interacted with their diseases. Medical schools began creating programs in medical humanities and “narrative medicine,” and a new belief took hold: that an ill person has lost narrative coherence, and that doctors, if they attend to their patients’ private struggles, could help them reconstruct a new story of their lives. At Harvard Medical School, for a time, students were assigned to write a “book” about a patient. Stories of illness written by physicians (and by patients) began proliferating, to the point that the medical sociologist Arthur Frank noted, “ ‘Oliver Sacks’ now designates not only a specific physician author but also a . . . genre—a distinctively recognizable form of storytelling.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, in his journal, Sacks wrote that “a sense of hideous criminality remains (psychologically) attached” to his work: he had given his patients “powers (starting with powers of speech) which they do not have.” Some details, he recognized, were “pure fabrications.” He tried to reassure himself that the exaggerations did not come from a shallow place, such as a desire for fame or attention. “The impulse is both ‘purer’—and deeper,” he wrote. “It is not merely or wholly a projection—nor (as I have sometimes, ingeniously-disingenuously, maintained) a mere ‘sensitization’ of what I know so well in myself. But (if you will) a sort of autobiography.” He called it “symbolic ‘exo-graphy.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks had “misstepped in this regard, many many times, in ‘Awakenings,’ ” he wrote in another journal entry, describing it as a “source of severe, long-lasting, self-recrimination.” In the book, published in 1973, he startled readers with the depth of his compassion for some eighty patients at Beth Abraham Hospital, in the Bronx, who had survived an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica, a mysterious, often fatal virus that appeared around the time of the First World War. The patients had been institutionalized for decades, in nearly catatonic states. At the time, the book was met with silence or skepticism by other neurologists—Sacks had presented his findings in a form that could not be readily replicated, or extrapolated from—but, to nonspecialists, it was a masterpiece of medical witnessing. The Guardian would name it the twelfth-best nonfiction book of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks spent up to fifteen hours a day with his patients, one of the largest groups of post-encephalitic survivors in the world. They were “mummified,” like “living statues,” he observed. A medicine called L-dopa, which elevates the brain’s dopamine levels, was just starting to be used for Parkinson’s disease, on an experimental basis, and Sacks reasoned that his patients, whose symptoms resembled those of Parkinson’s, could benefit from the drug. In 1969, within days of giving his patients the medication, they suddenly “woke up,” their old personalities intact. Other doctors had dismissed these patients as hopeless, but Sacks had sensed that they still had life in them—a recognition that he understood was possible because he, too, felt as if he were “buried alive.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In “Awakenings,” Sacks writes about his encounters with a man he calls Leonard L. “What’s it like being the way you are?” Sacks asks him the first time they meet. “Caged,” Leonard replies, by pointing to letters of the alphabet on a board. “Deprived. Like Rilke’s ‘Panther’ ”—a reference to a poem by Rainer Maria Rilke about a panther pacing repetitively in cramped circles “around a center / in which a mighty will stands paralyzed.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Sacks was struggling to write his first book, “Migraine,” he told a friend that he felt like “Rilke’s image of the caged panther, stupefied, dying, behind bars.” In a letter to Shengold, he repeated this image. When Sacks met Leonard, he jotted down elegant observations in his chart (“Quick and darting eye movements are at odds with his general petrified immobility”), but there is no mention of Leonard invoking the Rilke poem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the preface to “Awakenings,” Sacks acknowledges that he changed circumstantial details to protect his patients’ privacy but preserved “what is important and essential—the real and full presence of the patients themselves.” Sacks characterizes Leonard as a solitary figure even before his illness: he was “continually buried in books, and had few or no friends, and indulged in none of the sexual, social, or other activities common to boys of his age.” But, in an autobiography that Leonard wrote after taking L-dopa, he never mentions reading or writing or being alone in those years. In fact, he notes that he spent all his time with his two best friends—“We were inseparable,” he writes. He also recalls raping several people. “We placed our cousin over a chair, pulled down her pants and inserted our penises into the crack,” he writes on the third page, in the tone of an aging man reminiscing on better days. By page 10, he is describing how, when he babysat two girls, he made one of them strip and then “leaped on her. I tossed her on her belly and pulled out my penis and placed it between her buttocks and started to screw her.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In “Awakenings,” Sacks has cleansed his patient’s history of sexuality. He depicts him as a man of “most unusual intelligence, cultivation, and sophistication”—the “ ‘ideal’ patient.” L-dopa may have made Leonard remember his childhood in a heightened sexual register—his niece and nephew, who visited him at the hospital until his death, in 1981, told me that the drug had made him very sexual. But they said that he had been a normal child and adolescent, not a recluse who renounced human entanglement for a life of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks finished writing “Awakenings” rapidly in the weeks after burying his mother, who’d died suddenly, at the age of seventy-seven. He felt “a great open torrent—and release,” he wrote in his journal. “It seems to be surely significant that ‘Awakenings’ finally came forth from me like a cry after the death of my own mother.” He referred to the writing of the book as his “Great Awakening,” the moment he “came out.” He doesn’t mention another event of significance: his patients had awakened during the summer of the Stonewall riots, the beginning of the gay-rights movement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shengold once told Sacks that he had “never met anyone less affected by gay liberation.” (Shengold supported his own son when he came out as gay, in the eighties.) Sacks agreed with the characterization. “I remain resolutely locked in my cell despite the dancing at the prison gates,” he said, in 1984.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In “Awakenings,” his patients are at first overjoyed by their freedom; then their new vitality becomes unbearable. As they continue taking L-dopa, many of them are consumed by insatiable desires. “L-DOPA is wanton, egotistical power,” Leonard says in the book. He injures his penis twice and tries to suffocate himself with a pillow. Another patient is so aroused and euphoric that she tells Sacks, “My blood is champagne”—the phrase Sacks used to describe himself when he was in love with Vincze. Sacks begins tapering his patients’ L-dopa, and taking some of them off of it completely. The book becomes a kind of drama about dosage: an examination of how much aliveness is tolerable, and at what cost. Some side effects of L-dopa, like involuntary movements and overactivity, have been well documented, but it’s hard not to wonder if “Awakenings” exaggerates the psychological fallout—Leonard becomes so unmanageable that the hospital moves him into a “punishment cell”—as if Sacks is reassuring himself that free rein of the libido cannot be sustained without grim consequence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After “Awakenings,” Sacks intended his next book to be about his work with young people in a psychiatric ward at Bronx State Hospital who had been institutionalized since they were children. The environment reminded Sacks of a boarding school where he had been sent, between the ages of six and nine, during the Second World War. He was one of four hundred thousand children evacuated from London without their parents, and he felt abandoned. He was beaten by the headmaster and bullied by the other boys. The ward at Bronx State “exerted a sort of spell on me,” Sacks wrote in his journal, in 1974. “I lost my footing of proper sympathy and got sucked, so to speak, into an improper ‘perilous condition’ of identification to the patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shengold wrote several papers and books about a concept he called “soul murder”—a category of childhood trauma that induces “a hypnotic living-deadness, a state of existing ‘as if’ one were there.” Sacks planned to turn his work at Bronx State into a book about “ ‘SOUL MURDER’ and ‘SOUL SURVIVAL,’ ” he wrote. He was especially invested in two young men on the ward whom he thought he was curing. “The miracle-of-recovery started to occur in and through their relation to me (our relation and feelings to each other, of course),” he wrote in his journal. “We had to meet in a passionate subjectivity, a sort of collaboration or communication which transcended the Socratic relation of teacher-and-pupil.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a spontaneous creative burst lasting three weeks, Sacks wrote twenty-four essays about his work at Bronx State which he believed had the “beauty, the intensity, of Revelation . . . as if I was coming to know, once again, what I knew as a child, that sense of Dearness and Trust I had lost for so long.” But in the ward he sensed a “dreadful silent tension.” His colleagues didn’t understand the attention he was lavishing on his patients—he got a piano and a Ping-Pong table for them and took one patient to the botanical garden. Their suspicion, he wrote in his journal, “centred on the unbearability of my uncategorizability.” As a middle-aged man living alone—he had a huge beard and dressed eccentrically, sometimes wearing a black leather shirt—Sacks was particularly vulnerable to baseless innuendo. In April, 1974, he was fired. There had been rumors that he was molesting some of the boys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That night, Sacks tore up his essays and then burned them. “Spite! Hate! Hateful spite!” he wrote in his journal shortly after. “And now I am empty—empty handed, empty hearted, desolate.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The series of events was so distressing that even writing about it in his journal made Sacks feel that he was about to die. He knew that he should shrug off the false accusations as “vile idle gossip thrown by tiddlers and piddlers,” he wrote. But he couldn’t, because of “the parental accusation which I have borne—a Kafka-esque cross, guilt without crime, since my earliest days.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The historian of medicine Henri Ellenberger observed that psychiatry owes its development to two intertwined dynamics: the neuroses of its founders—in trying to master their own conflicts, they came to new insights and forms of therapy—and the prolonged, ambiguous relationships they had with their patients. The case studies of these relationships, Ellenberger wrote, tended to have a distinct arc: psychiatrists had to unravel their patients’ “pathogenic secret,” a hidden source of hopelessness, in order to heal them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks’s early case studies also tended to revolve around secrets, but wonderful ones. Through his care, his patients realized that they had hidden gifts—for music, painting, writing—that could restore to them a sense of wholeness. The critic Anatole Broyard, recounting his cancer treatment in the Times Magazine in 1990, wrote that he longed for a charismatic, passionate physician, skilled in “empathetic witnessing.” In short, he wrote, a doctor who “would resemble Oliver Sacks.” He added, “He would see the genius of my illness.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It speaks to the power of the fantasy of the magical healer that readers and publishers accepted Sacks’s stories as literal truth. In a letter to one of his three brothers, Marcus, Sacks enclosed a copy of “The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,” which was published in 1985, calling it a book of “fairy tales.” He explained that “these odd Narratives—half-report, half-imagined, half-science, half-fable, but with a fidelity of their own—are what I do, basically, to keep MY demons of boredom and loneliness and despair away.” He added that Marcus would likely call them “confabulations”—a phenomenon Sacks explores in a chapter about a patient who could retain memories for only a few seconds and must “make meaning, in a desperate way, continually inventing, throwing bridges of meaning over abysses,” but the “bridges, the patches, for all their brilliance . . . cannot do service for reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks was startled by the success of the book, which he had dedicated to Shengold, “my own mentor and physician.” It became an international best-seller, routinely assigned in medical schools. Sacks wrote in his journal,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He pondered the phrase “art is the lie that tells the truth,” often attributed to Picasso, but he seemed unconvinced. “I think I have to thrash this out with Shengold—it is killing me, soul-killing me,” he wrote. “My ‘cast of characters’ (for this is what they become) take on an almost Dickensian quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks once told a reporter that he hoped to be remembered as someone who “bore witness”—a term often used within medicine to describe the act of accompanying patients in their most vulnerable moments, rather than turning away. To bear witness is to recognize and respond to suffering that would otherwise go unseen. But perhaps bearing witness is incompatible with writing a story about it. In his journal, after a session with a patient with Tourette’s syndrome, Sacks describes the miracle of being “enabled to ‘feel’—that is, to imagine, with all the powers of my head and heart—how it felt to be another human being.” Empathy tends to be held up as a moral end point, as if it exists as its own little island of good work. And yet it is part of a longer transaction, and it is, fundamentally, a projection. A writer who imagines what it’s like to exist as another person must then translate that into his own idiom—a process that Sacks makes particularly literal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’ll tell you what you are saying,” Sacks told a woman with an I.Q. of around 60 whose grandmother had just died. “You want to go down below and join your dead grandparents down in the Kingdom of Death.” In the conversation, which Sacks recorded, the patient becomes more expressive under the rare glow of her doctor’s sustained attention, and it’s clear that she is fond of him. But he is so excited about her words (“One feels that she is voicing universal symbols,” he says in a recording, “symbols which are infinite in meaning”) that he usurps her experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I know, in a way, you don’t feel like living,” Sacks tells her, in another recorded session. “Part of one feels dead inside, I know, I know that. . . . One feels that one wants to die, one wants to end it, and what’s the use of going on?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I don’t mean it in that way,” she responds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I know, but you do, partly,” Sacks tells her. “I know you have been lonely all your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The woman’s story is told, with details altered, in a chapter in “Hat” titled “Rebecca.” In the essay, Rebecca is transformed by grief for her grandmother. She reminds Sacks of Chekhov’s Nina, in “The Seagull,” who longs to be an actress. Though Nina’s life is painful and disappointing, at the end of the play her suffering gives her depth and strength. Rebecca, too, ends the story in full flower. “Rather suddenly, after her grandmother’s death,” Sacks writes, she becomes decisive, joining a theatre group and appearing to him as “a complete person, poised, fluent,” a “natural poet.” The case study is presented as an ode to the power of understanding a patient’s life as a narrative, not as a collection of symptoms. But in the transcripts of their conversations—at least the ones saved from the year that followed, as well as Sacks’s journals from that period—Rebecca never joins a theatre group or emerges from her despair. She complains that it’s “better that I shouldn’t have been born,” that she is “useless,” “good for nothing,” and Sacks vehemently tries to convince her that she’s not. Instead of bearing witness to her reality, he reshapes it so that she, too, awakens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the most prominent nonfiction writers of Sacks’s era (Joseph Mitchell, A. J. Liebling, Ryszard Kapuściński) also took liberties with the truth, believing that they had a higher purpose: to illuminate the human condition. Sacks was writing in that spirit, too, but in a discipline that depends on reproducible findings. The “most flagrant example” of his distortions, Sacks wrote in his journal, was in one of the last chapters of “Hat,” titled “The Twins,” about twenty-six-year-old twins with autism who had been institutionalized since they were seven. They spend their days reciting numbers, which they “savored, shared” while “closeted in their numerical communion.” Sacks lingers near them, jotting down the numbers, and eventually realizes that they are all prime. As a child, Sacks used to spend hours alone, trying to come up with a formula for prime numbers, but, he wrote, “I never found any Law or Pattern for them—and this gave me an intense feeling of Terror, Pleasure, and—Mystery.” Delighted by the twins’ pastime, Sacks comes to the ward with a book of prime numbers which he’d loved as a child. After offering his own prime number, “they drew apart slightly, making room for me, a new number playmate, a third in their world.” Having apparently uncovered the impossible algorithm that Sacks had once wished for, the twins continue sharing primes until they’re exchanging ones with twenty digits. The scene reads like a kind of dream: he has discovered that human intimacy has a decipherable structure, and identified a hidden pattern that will allow him to finally join in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before Sacks met them, the twins had been extensively studied because of their capacity to determine the day of the week on which any date in the calendar fell. In the sixties, two papers in the American Journal of Psychiatry provided detailed accounts of the extent of their abilities. Neither paper mentioned a gift for prime numbers or math. When Sacks wrote Alexander Luria, a Russian neuropsychologist, about his work with the twins, in 1973, he also did not mention any special mathematical skills. In 2007, a psychologist with a background in learning theory published a short article in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, challenging Sacks’s assertion that these twins could spontaneously generate large prime numbers. Because this is not something that humans can reliably do, Sacks’s finding had been widely cited, and was theoretically “important for not only psychologists but also for all scientists and mathematicians,” the psychologist wrote. (The psychologist had contacted Sacks to ask for the title of his childhood book of prime numbers, because he couldn’t find a book of that description, but Sacks said that it had been lost.) Without pointing to new evidence, another scientist wrote in Sacks’s defense, describing his case study as “the most compelling account of savant numerosity skills” and arguing, “This is an example of science at the frontier, requiring daring to advance new interpretations of partial data.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the publication of “Hat,” when Sacks was fifty-two years old, he wrote his friend Robert Rodman, a psychoanalyst, that “Shengold suggested, with some hesitancy, some months ago, that I should consider going deeper with him.” He added, “He also observes that I don’t complain, say, of sexual deprivation—though this is absolute.” At first, Sacks was worried that Shengold was preparing to dismiss him from treatment: “I’ve done all I can for you—now manage on your own!” Then he felt hopeful that he didn’t need to assume that “boredom-depression-loneliness-cutoffness” would define the rest of his life. He was also moved that, after twenty years, Shengold still considered him “worth extra work.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Sacks was shaken by the idea that they’d only been skimming the surface. He looked back through his notebooks and noticed “a perceptible decline in concern and passion,” which he felt had also dulled the quality of his thought. “Is the superficiality of my work, then, due to superficiality of relationships—to running away from whatever has deeper feeling and meaning?” he asked Rodman. “Is this perhaps spoken of, in a camouflaged way, when I describe the ‘superficialization’ of various patients?” As an example, he referenced an essay in “Hat” about a woman with a cerebral tumor. She was intelligent and amusing but seemed not to care about anyone. “Was this the ‘cover’ of some unbearable emotion?” he writes in the essay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks felt that Shengold was the reason he was still alive, and that he should go further with him. “What have I to lose?” he asked Rodman. But, he wrote, “what one has to lose, of course, may be just that quasi-stable if fragile ‘functioning’ . . . so there is reason to hesitate.” Going deeper would also mean more fully submitting to someone else’s interpretation, experiencing what he asked of his own patients; Rodman proposed that Sacks was “afraid of the enclosure of analysis, of being reduced and fixed with a formulated phrase.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the early eighties, Lawrence Weschler, then a writer for The New Yorker, began working on a biography of Sacks. Weschler came to feel that Sacks’s homosexuality was integral to his work, but Sacks didn’t want his sexuality mentioned at all, and eventually asked him to stop the project. “I have lived a life wrapped in concealment and wracked by inhibition, and I can’t see that changing now,” he told Weschler. In his journal, Sacks jotted down thoughts to share with Weschler on the subject: “My ‘sex life’ (or lack of it) is, in a sense irrelevant to the . . . sweep of my mind.” In another entry, he wrote that the Freudian term “sublimation” diminished the process he’d undergone. When he was still having sex, as a young man in California, he used to sheath his body in leather gear, so he was “totally encased, enclosed,” his real self sealed in a kind of “black box.” He wrote, “I have, in a sense, ‘outgrown’ these extraordinary, almost convulsive compulsions—but this detachment has been made possible by incorporating them into a vast and comprehending view of the world.” (Weschler became close friends with Sacks, and, after Sacks died, published a “biographical memoir” titled “And How Are You, Dr. Sacks?”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s unclear whether Sacks did “go deeper” with Shengold. In the late eighties, Sacks wrote in his journal that he was “scared, horrified (but, in an awful way, accepting or complaisant) about my non-life.” He likened himself to a “pithed and gutted creature.” Rather than living, he was managing a kind of “homeostasis.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1987, Sacks had an intense friendship with a psychiatrist named Jonathan Mueller, with whom he briefly fell in love. Mueller, who was married to a woman, told me that he did not realize Sacks had romantic feelings for him. Sacks eventually moved on. But he felt that the experience had altered him. “I can read ‘love stories’ with empathy and understanding—I can ‘enter into them’ in a way which was impossible before,” he wrote in his journal. He perceived, in a new light, what it meant for his patients in “Awakenings” to glimpse the possibility of “liberation”: like him, he wrote, they were seeking “not merely a cure but an indemnification for the loss of their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the nineties, Sacks seemed to ask less of himself, emotionally, in relation to his patients. He had started working with Kate Edgar, who’d begun as his assistant but eventually edited his writing, organized his daily life, and became a close friend. (Shengold had encouraged Sacks to find someone to assist with his work. “The secretary is certainly an important ‘ego-auxiliary,’ ” he wrote him in a letter.) Edgar was wary about the way Sacks quoted his patients—they were suspiciously literary, she thought—and she checked to make sure he wasn’t getting carried away. She spent hours with some of his patients, and, she told me, “I never caught him in anything like that, which actually surprises me.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weschler told me that Sacks used to express anxiety about whether he’d distorted the truth. Weschler would assure him that good writing is not a strict account of reality; there has to be space for the writer’s imagination. He said he told Sacks, “Come on, you’re extravagantly romanticizing how bad you are—just as much as you were extravagantly romanticizing what the patient said. Your mother’s accusing voice has taken over.” Weschler had gone to Beth Abraham Hospital to meet some of the patients from “Awakenings” and had been shaken by their condition. “There’s a lot of people shitting in their pants, drooling—the sedimentation of thirty years living in a warehouse,” he said. “His genius was to see past that, to the dignity of the person. He would talk to them for an hour, and maybe their eyes would brighten only once—the rest of the time their eyes were cloudy—but he would glom onto that and keep talking.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After “Hat,” Sacks’s relationship with his subjects became more mediated. Most of them were not his patients; many wrote to him after reading his work, recognizing themselves in his books. There was a different power dynamic, because these people already believed that they had stories to tell. Perhaps the guilt over liberties he had taken in “Hat” caused him to curb the impulse to exaggerate. His expressions of remorse over “making up, ‘enhancing,’ etc,” which had appeared in his journals throughout the seventies and eighties, stopped. In his case studies, he used fewer and shorter quotes. His patients were far more likely to say ordinary, banal things, and they rarely quoted literature. They still had secret gifts, but they weren’t redeemed by them; they were just trying to cope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In “An Anthropologist on Mars,” from 1992, a book of case studies about people compensating for, and adapting to, neurological conditions, some of the richest passages are the ones in which Sacks allows his incomprehension to become part of the portrait. In a chapter called “Prodigies,” he wants badly to connect with a thirteen-year-old boy named Stephen, who is autistic and has an extraordinary ability to draw, but Stephen resists Sacks’s attempts at intimacy. He will not allow himself to be romanticized, a refusal that Sacks ultimately accepts: “Is Stephen, or his autism, changed by his art? Here, I think, the answer is no.” In this new mode, Sacks is less inclined to replace Stephen’s unknowable experience with his own fantasy of it. He is open about the discomfort, and even embarrassment, of his multiple failures to reach him: “I had hoped, perhaps sentimentally, for some depth of feeling from him; my heart had leapt at the first ‘Hullo, Oliver!’ but there had been no follow-up.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mort Doran, a surgeon with Tourette’s syndrome whom Sacks profiled in “Anthropologist,” told me that he was happy with the way Sacks had rendered his life. He said that only one detail was inaccurate—Sacks had written that the brick wall of Doran’s kitchen was marked from Doran hitting it during Tourette’s episodes. “I thought, Why would he embellish that? And then I thought, Maybe that’s just what writers do.” Doran never mentioned the error to Sacks. He was grateful that Sacks “had the gravitas to put it out there to the rest of the world and say, ‘These people aren’t all nuts or deluded. They’re real people.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The wife in the title story of “Hat” had privately disagreed with Sacks about the portrayal of her husband, but for the most part Sacks appeared to have had remarkable relationships with his patients, corresponding with them for years. A patient called Ray, the subject of a 1981 piece about Tourette’s syndrome, told me that Sacks came to his son’s wedding years after his formal treatment had ended. Recalling Sacks’s death, he found himself suddenly crying. “Part of me left,” he said. “Part of my self was gone.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A year after “Awakenings” was published, Sacks broke his leg in Norway, and Leonard L. and his mother wrote him a get-well letter. Thirty-two patients added their names, their signatures wavering. “Everybody had been counting the days for your return, so you can imagine the turmoil when they heard the news,” Leonard’s mother wrote. She explained that “most of the patients are not doing so well without your help and interest.” She added that Leonard “isn’t doing too well either.” When Leonard learned that Sacks wouldn’t be back, she said, “he shed enough tears to fill a bucket.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks spoke of “animating” his patients, as if lending them some of his narrative energy. After living in the forgotten wards of hospitals, in a kind of narrative void, perhaps his patients felt that some inaccuracies were part of the exchange. Or maybe they thought, That’s just what writers do. Sacks established empathy as a quality every good doctor should possess, enshrining the ideal through his stories. But his case studies, and the genre they helped inspire, were never clear about what they exposed: the ease with which empathy can slide into something too creative, or invasive, or possessive. Therapists—and writers—inevitably see their subjects through the lens of their own lives, in ways that can be both generative and misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his journal, reflecting on his work with Tourette’s patients, Sacks described his desire to help their illness “reach fruition,” so that they would become floridly symptomatic. “With my help and almost my collusion, they can extract the maximum possible from their sickness—maximum of knowledge, insight, courage,” he wrote. “Thus I will FIRST help them to get ill, to experience their illness with maximum intensity; and then, only then, will I help them get well!” On the next line, he wrote, “IS THIS MONSTROUS?” The practice came from a sense of awe, not opportunism, but he recognized that it made him complicit, as if their illness had become a collaboration. “An impulse both neurotic and intellectual (artistic) makes me get the most out of suffering,” he wrote. His approach set the template for a branch of writing and thinking that made it seem as if the natural arc of illness involved insight and revelation, and even some poetry, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his journals, Sacks repeatedly complained that his life story was over. He had the “feeling that I have stopped doing, that doing has stopped, that life itself has stopped, that it is petering out in a sort of twilight of half-being,” he wrote, in 1987. His journals convey a sense of tangible boredom. He transcribed long passages from philosophers and theologists (Simone Weil, Søren Kierkegaard, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Dietrich Bonhoeffer) and embarked on disquisitions on the best definition of reality, the “metabolism of grace,” the “deep mystery of incubation.” His thoughts cast outward in many directions—notes for a thousand lectures—then tunnelled inward to the point of non-meaning. “Where Life is Free, Immaterial, full of Art,” he wrote, “the laws of life, of Grace, are those of Fitness.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks proposed various theories for why he had undergone what he called “psychic death.” He wondered if he had become too popular, merely a fuzzy symbol of compassionate care. “Good old Sacks—the House Humanist,” he wrote, mocking himself. He also considered the idea that his four decades of analysis were to blame. Was it possible, he wrote, that a “vivisection of inner life, however conceived, however subtle and delicate, may in fact destroy the very thing it examines?” His treatment with Shengold seemed to align with a life of “homeostasis”—intimacy managed through more and more language, in a contained, sterile setting, on Monday and Wednesday mornings, from 6:00 to 6:45 A.M. They still referred to each other as “Dr. Sacks” and “Dr. Shengold.” Once, they ran into each other at a chamber concert. They were a few rows apart, but they didn’t interact. Occasionally, Shengold told his children that he “heard from the couch” about a good movie or play, but he never shared what happened in his sessions. They inferred that Sacks was their father’s patient after reading the dedication to him in “Hat.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Sacks aged, he felt as if he were gazing at people from the outside. But he also noticed a new kind of affection for humans—“homo sap.” “They’re quite complex (little) creatures (I say to myself),” he wrote in his journal. “They suffer, authentically, a good deal. Gifted, too. Brave, resourceful, challenging.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps because love no longer appeared to be a realistic risk—he had now entered a “geriatric situation”—Sacks could finally confess that he craved it. “I keep being stabbed by love,” he wrote in his journal. “A look. A glance. An expression. A posture.” He guessed that he had at least five, possibly ten, more years to live. “I want to, I want to ••• I dare not say. At least not in writing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2008, Sacks had lunch with Bill Hayes, a forty-seven-year-old writer from San Francisco who was visiting New York. Hayes had never considered Sacks’s sexuality, but, as soon as they began talking, he thought, “Oh, my God, he’s gay,” he told me. They lingered at the table for much of the afternoon, connecting over their insomnia, among other subjects. After the meal, Sacks wrote Hayes a letter (which he never sent) explaining that relationships had been “a ‘forbidden’ area for me—although I am entirely sympathetic to &lt;del&gt;(indeed wistful and perhaps envious about)&lt;/del&gt; other people’s relationships.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A year later, Hayes, whose partner of seventeen years had died of a heart attack, moved to New York. He and Sacks began spending time together. At Sacks’s recommendation, Hayes started keeping a journal, too. He often wrote down his exchanges with Sacks, some of which he later published in a memoir, “Insomniac City.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s really a question of mutuality, isn’t it?” Sacks asked him, two weeks after they had declared their feelings for each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Love?” Hayes responded. “Are you talking about love?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Yes,” Sacks replied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks began taking Hayes to dinner parties, although he introduced him as “my friend Billy.” He did not allow physical affection in public. “Sometimes this issue of not being out became very difficult,” Hayes told me. “We’d have arguments, and I’d say things like ‘Do you and Shengold ever talk about why you can’t come out? Or is all you ever talk about your dreams?’ ” Sacks wrote down stray phrases from his dreams on a whiteboard in his kitchen so that he could report on them at his sessions, but he didn’t share what happened in therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kate Edgar, who worked for Sacks for three decades, had two brothers who were gay, and for years she had advocated for gay civil rights, organizing Pride marches for her son’s school. She intentionally found an office for Sacks in the West Village so that he would be surrounded by gay men living openly and could see how normal it had become. She tended to hire gay assistants for him, for the same reason. “So I was sort of plotting on that level for some years,” she told me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2013, after being in a relationship with Hayes for four years—they lived in separate apartments in the same building—Sacks began writing a memoir, “On the Move,” in which he divulged his sexuality for the first time. He recounts his mother’s curses upon learning that he was gay, and his decades of celibacy—a fact he mentions casually, without explanation. Edgar wondered why, after so many years of analysis, coming out took him so long, but, she said, “Oliver did not regard his relationship with Shengold as a failure of therapy.” She said that she’d guessed Shengold had thought, “This is something Oliver has to do in his own way, on his own time.” Shengold’s daughter, Nina, said that, “for my dad to have a patient he loved and respected finally find comfort in identifying who he’d been all his life—that’s growth for both of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few weeks after finishing the manuscript, Sacks, who’d had melanoma of the eye in 2005, learned that the cancer had come back, spreading to his liver, and that he had only months to live. He had tended toward hypochondria all his life, and Edgar thought that the diagnosis might induce a state of chronic panic. Since he was a child, Sacks had had a horror of losing things, even irrelevant objects. He would be overcome by the “feeling that there was a hole in the world,” he wrote in his journal, and the fear that “I might somehow fall through that hole-in-the-world, and be absolutely, inconceivably lost.” Edgar had dealt for decades with his distress over lost objects, but she noticed that now, when he misplaced things, he didn’t get upset. He had an uncharacteristic ease of being.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2015, before Shengold went on his annual summer break, Sacks said to Edgar, “If I’m alive in September when Shengold returns, I’m not sure I need to go back to my sessions.” They had been seeing each other for forty-nine years. Sacks was eighty-two; Shengold was eighty-nine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Sacks was struggling with his third book, “A Leg to Stand On,” which was about breaking his leg and his frustration that his doctors wouldn’t listen to him, he wrote in his journal that Shengold had suggested (while apologizing for the corniness of the phrase) that the book should be “a message of love”—a form of protest against the indifference that so many patients find in their doctors. Shengold may have been giving Sacks permission to see their own relationship—the one place in which Sacks felt an enduring sense of recognition and care—as a hidden subject of the book. Extending Shengold’s idea, Sacks wrote, of his book, “The ‘moral’ center has to do with . . . the irreducible ultimate in doctor-patient relations.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In August, two weeks before Sacks died, he and Shengold spoke on the phone. Shengold was with his family at a cottage in the Finger Lakes region of central New York, where he spent every summer. Nina told me, “We all gathered in the living room of that little cottage and put my father on speakerphone. Oliver Sacks was clearly on his deathbed—he was not able to articulate very well. Sometimes his diction was just gone. Dad kept shaking his head. He said, ‘I can’t understand you. I’m so sorry, I can’t understand you.’ ” At the end of the call, Shengold told Sacks, “It’s been the honor of my life to work with you,” and said, “Goodbye, Oliver.” Sacks responded, “Goodbye, Leonard.” It was the first time they had ever used each other’s first names. When they hung up, Shengold was crying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After Sacks died, Shengold started closing down his practice. “It was the beginning of the end for him,” his son David told me. “He had lost most of his colleagues. He was really the last of his generation.” Nina said, “I do think part of why my father lived so long and was able to work so long was because of that relationship. That feeling of affection and kindred spirit was lifesaving.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In “Awakenings,” when describing how Leonard L.—his “ ‘ideal’ patient”—initially responded to L-dopa, Sacks characterizes him as “a man released from entombment” whose “predominant feelings at this time were feelings of freedom, openness, and exchange with the world.” He quotes Leonard saying, “I have been hungry and yearning all my life . . . and now I am full.” He also says, “I feel saved. . . . I feel like a man in love. I have broken through the barriers which cut me off from love.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For years, Sacks had tested the possibility of awakenings in others, as if rehearsing, or outsourcing, the cure he had longed to achieve with Shengold. But at the end of his life, like an inside-out case study, he inhabited the story he’d imagined for his patients. “All of us entertain the idea of another sort of medicine . . . which will restore us to our lost health and wholeness,” he wrote, in “Awakenings.” “We spend our lives searching for what we have lost; and one day, perhaps, we will suddenly find it.” ♦&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;December 9th 2025 by Christoph Nakazawa&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm excited to announce the initial alpha release of fate, a modern data client for React &amp;amp; tRPC. fate combines view composition, normalized caching, data masking, Async React features, and tRPC's type safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A modern data client for React &amp;amp; tRPC&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;fate is designed to make data fetching and state management in React applications more composable, declarative, and predictable. The framework has a minimal API, no DSL, and no magic—it's just JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GraphQL and Relay introduced several novel ideas: fragments co‑located with components, a normalized cache keyed by global identifiers, and a compiler that hoists fragments into a single network request. These innovations made it possible to build large applications where data requirements are modular and self‑contained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nakazawa Tech builds apps and games primarily with GraphQL and Relay. We advocate for these technologies in talks and provide templates (server, client) to help developers get started quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, GraphQL comes with its own type system and query language. If you are already using tRPC or another type‑safe RPC framework, it's a significant investment to adopt and implement GraphQL on the backend. This investment often prevents teams from adopting Relay on the frontend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many React data frameworks lack Relay's ergonomics, especially fragment composition, co-located data requirements, predictable caching, and deep integration with modern React features. Optimistic updates usually require manually managing keys and imperative data updates, which is error-prone and tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;fate takes the great ideas from Relay and puts them on top of tRPC. You get the best of both worlds: type safety between the client and server, and GraphQL-like ergonomics for data fetching. Using fate usually looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export const PostView = view&amp;lt;Post&amp;gt;()({
  author: UserView,
  content: true,
  id: true,
  title: true,
});

export const PostCard = ({ post: postRef }: { post: ViewRef&amp;lt;'Post'&amp;gt; }) =&amp;gt; {
  const post = useView(PostView, postRef);

  return (
    &amp;lt;Card&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;{post.title}&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{post.content}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;UserCard user={post.author} /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/Card&amp;gt;
  );
};&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learn more about fate's core concepts or get started with a ready-made template.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Journey to fate&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was part of the original Relay and React teams at Facebook in 2013, but I didn't build Relay. While I worked on deploying the first server-side rendering engine for React and migrating Relay from React mixins to higher-order components through codemods, I honestly didn't fully grasp how far ahead everyone else on the Relay team was back then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the following years, Relay became the default data framework at Facebook. It was such an elegant way to handle client-side data that I had assumed it would gain widespread adoption. That didn't happen, and its backend companion GraphQL has become divisive in the web ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I spent several years rebuilding a stack similar to the frontend stack at Facebook, using GraphQL and Relay, and even forking and rewriting abandoned Facebook libraries such as fbtee. I built Athena Crisis, a video game, and many other apps using this stack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, in recent months I have been exposed to the reality of React data fetching. It tends to look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const { data: post, isLoading, isError } = useFetch(…)

if (isLoading) return &amp;lt;Loading /&amp;gt;;
if (isError) return &amp;lt;Error /&amp;gt;;
if (!post) return &amp;lt;NullState /&amp;gt;;

return &amp;lt;Post post={post} /&amp;gt;;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This boilerplate is repetitive and ok, but not great. The real problems start when data changes. Mutations tend to have complex logic with detailed patches to the local cache or for handling rollbacks. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;mutate({
  // Complex cache patching logic or detailed cache clearing calls.
  onSuccess: (list, newItem) =&amp;gt; {
    cache.remove('posts');
    cache.remove('post', newItem.id);
    return cache
      .get('root-posts-list')
      .map((item) =&amp;gt; (item.id === newItem.id ? newItem : item));
  },
  // Complex rollback logic.
  onError: () =&amp;gt; {
    cache.restore(previousCacheState);
    cache
      .get('root-posts-list')
      .map((item) =&amp;gt; (item.id === oldItem.id ? oldItem : item));
  },
});&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When your data client is an abstraction over &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt;, keeping client state consistent gets hard quickly. Correctly handling mutations often requires knowing every place in your application that might fetch the same data. That often leads to defensive refetching and waterfalls down the component tree. Component trees frequently look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be clear: These libraries are great at fetching data. I know better patterns are available in most of these libraries, and advanced developers can avoid many of the downsides. Sync engines address these problems, but they're challenging to adopt and also come with trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, it's too easy to get something wrong. Codebases become brittle and hard to maintain. Looking ahead to a world where AI increasingly writes more of our code and gravitates towards simple, idiomatic APIs, the problem is that request-centric fetch APIs exist at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building fate&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did not want to compromise on the key insights from Relay: a normalized cache, declarative data dependencies, and view co-location. At around the same time, I watched Ricky Hanlon's two-part React Conf talk about Async React and got excited to start building.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When fetch-based APIs cache data based on requests, people think about when to fetch data, and requests happen at every level of the component tree. This leads to boilerplate, complexity, and inconsistency. Instead, fate caches data by objects, shifts thinking to what data is required, and composes data requirements up to a single request at the root.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A typical component tree in a React application using fate might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Using fate&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;fate's API is minimal: It's just JavaScript, focused on answering: "Can we make development easier?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Views&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me show you a basic fate code example that declares its data requirements as a "view", co-located with a component. fate requires you to explicitly "select" each field that you plan to use in your components as a "view" into your data:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import type { Post } from '@org/server/views.ts';
import { UserView } from './UserCard.tsx';
import { useView, view, ViewRef } from 'react-fate';

export const PostView = view&amp;lt;Post&amp;gt;()({
  author: UserView,
  content: true,
  id: true,
  title: true,
});

export const PostCard = ({ post: postRef }: { post: ViewRef&amp;lt;'Post'&amp;gt; }) =&amp;gt; {
  const post = useView(PostView, postRef);

  return (
    &amp;lt;Card&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;{post.title}&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{post.content}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;UserCard user={post.author} /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/Card&amp;gt;
  );
};&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;ViewRef&lt;/code&gt; is a reference to a concrete object of a specific type, for example a &lt;code&gt;Post&lt;/code&gt; with id &lt;code&gt;7&lt;/code&gt;. It contains the unique ID of the object, the type name and some fate-specific metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;fate creates and manages these references for you, and you can pass them around your components as needed to resolve them against their views.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Requests&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pass the composed views to &lt;code&gt;useRequest&lt;/code&gt; at the root of your app, and it'll suspend and fetch data in a single request using tRPC's HTTP Batch Link.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { useRequest } from 'react-fate';
import { PostCard, PostView } from './PostCard.tsx';

export function App() {
  const { posts } = useRequest({ posts: { list: PostView } });
  return posts.map((post) =&amp;gt; &amp;lt;PostCard key={post.id} post={post} /&amp;gt;);
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Actions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;fate does not provide hooks for mutations like traditional data fetching libraries do. Instead, all tRPC mutations are exposed as actions for use with &lt;code&gt;useActionState&lt;/code&gt; and React Actions. They support optimistic updates out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;LikeButton&lt;/code&gt; component using fate Actions and an async component library might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const LikeButton = ({ post }) =&amp;gt; {
  const fate = useFateClient();
  const [result, like] = useActionState(fate.actions.post.like, null);

  return (
    &amp;lt;Button
      action={() =&amp;gt;
        like({ input: { id: post.id }, optimistic: { likes: post.likes + 1 } })
      }
    &amp;gt;
      {result?.error ? 'Oops!' : 'Like'}
    &amp;lt;/Button&amp;gt;
  );
};&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When this action is called, fate automatically updates all views that depend on the &lt;code&gt;likes&lt;/code&gt; field of the particular &lt;code&gt;Post&lt;/code&gt; object. It doesn't re-render components that didn't select that field. There's no need to manually patch or invalidate cache entries. If the action fails, fate rolls back the optimistic update automatically and re-renders all affected components.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the above works because fate has a normalized data cache under the hood, with objects stored by their ID and type name (&lt;code&gt;__typename&lt;/code&gt;, e.g. &lt;code&gt;Post&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;User&lt;/code&gt;), and a tRPC backend conforming to fate's requirements, exposing &lt;code&gt;byId&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; queries for each data type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can adopt fate incrementally in an existing tRPC codebase without changing your existing schema by adding these queries alongside your existing procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Clarity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With these three code examples we covered almost the entire client API surface of fate. As a result, the mental model of using fate is dramatically simpler compared to the status quo. fate's API is a joy to use and requires less code, boilerplate, and manual state management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's this clarity together with reducing the API surface that helps humans and AI write better code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Async&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, by using modern Async React, the latest React DevTools features for Suspense and Component Tracks, the React Compiler and even Hot Module Reloading (HMR) for data views work out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Get Started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get started with a ready-made template quickly&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npx giget@latest gh:nkzw-tech/fate-template&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pnpx giget@latest gh:nkzw-tech/fate-template&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;yarn dlx giget@latest gh:nkzw-tech/fate-template&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;fate-template&lt;/code&gt; comes with a simple tRPC backend and a React frontend using fate. It features modern tools to deliver an incredibly fast development experience. Follow its README.md to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read about the Core Concepts, or jump right in and learn about Views.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also try a runnable demo directly in your browser:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Future&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;fate is not complete yet. The library lacks core features such as garbage collection, a compiler to extract view definitions statically ahead of time, and there is too much backend boilerplate. The current implementation of fate is not tied to tRPC or Prisma, those are just the ones we are starting with. We welcome contributions and ideas to improve fate. Here are some features we'd like to add:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for Drizzle&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support backends other than tRPC&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Persistent storage for offline support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Implement garbage collection for the cache&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Better code generation and less type repetition&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Support for live views and real-time updates via &lt;code&gt;useLiveView&lt;/code&gt;and SSE&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;80% of fate's code was written by OpenAI's Codex – four versions per task, carefully curated by a human. The remaining 20% was written by @cnakazawa. You get to decide which parts are the good ones! The docs were 100% written by a human.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you contribute to fate, we require you to disclose your use of AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hope&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please try out fate and share your feedback. I'm excited to hear what you think and how it works for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If fate does not live up to its promise, I hope that Relay's and fate's ideas will impact future data libraries for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Today, we're releasing Devstral 2—our next-generation coding model family available in two sizes: Devstral 2 (123B) and Devstral Small 2 (24B). Devstral 2 ships under a modified MIT license, while Devstral Small 2 uses Apache 2.0. Both are open-source and permissively licensed to accelerate distributed intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devstral 2 is currently free to use via our API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are also introducing Mistral Vibe, a native CLI built for Devstral that enables end-to-end code automation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Highlights.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Devstral 2: SOTA open model for code agents with a fraction of the parameters of its competitors and achieving 72.2% on SWE-bench Verified.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Up to 7x more cost-efficient than Claude Sonnet at real-world tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mistral Vibe CLI: Native, open-source agent in your terminal solving software engineering tasks autonomously.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Devstral Small 2: 24B parameter model available via API or deployable locally on consumer hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Compatible with on-prem deployment and custom fine-tuning.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Devstral: the next generation of SOTA coding.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devstral 2 is a 123B-parameter dense transformer supporting a 256K context window. It reaches 72.2% on SWE-bench Verified—establishing it as one of the best open-weight models while remaining highly cost efficient. Released under a modified MIT license, Devstral sets the open state-of-the-art for code agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devstral Small 2 scores 68.0% on SWE-bench Verified, and places firmly among models up to five times its size while being capable of running locally on consumer hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devstral 2 (123B) and Devstral Small 2 (24B) are 5x and 28x smaller than DeepSeek V3.2, and 8x and 41x smaller than Kimi K2—proving that compact models can match or exceed the performance of much larger competitors. Their reduced size makes deployment practical on limited hardware, lowering barriers for developers, small businesses, and hobbyists.hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Built for production-grade workflows.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devstral 2 supports exploring codebases and orchestrating changes across multiple files while maintaining architecture-level context. It tracks framework dependencies, detects failures, and retries with corrections—solving challenges like bug fixing and modernizing legacy systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model can be fine-tuned to prioritize specific languages or optimize for large enterprise codebases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We evaluated Devstral 2 against DeepSeek V3.2 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 using human evaluations conducted by an independent annotation provider, with tasks scaffolded through Cline. Devstral 2 shows a clear advantage over DeepSeek V3.2, with a 42.8% win rate versus 28.6% loss rate. However, Claude Sonnet 4.5 remains significantly preferred, indicating a gap with closed-source models persists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Devstral 2 is at the frontier of open-source coding models. In Cline, it delivers a tool-calling success rate on par with the best closed models; it's a remarkably smooth driver. This is a massive contribution to the open-source ecosystem.” — Cline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Devstral 2 was one of our most successful stealth launches yet, surpassing 17B tokens in the first 24 hours. Mistral AI is moving at Kilo Speed with a cost-efficient model that truly works at scale.” — Kilo Code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devstral Small 2, a 24B-parameter model with the same 256K context window and released under Apache 2.0, brings these capabilities to a compact, locally deployable form. Its size enables fast inference, tight feedback loops, and easy customization—with fully private, on-device runtime. It also supports image inputs, and can power multimodal agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mistral Vibe CLI.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mistral Vibe CLI is an open-source command-line coding assistant powered by Devstral. It explores, modifies, and executes changes across your codebase using natural language—in your terminal or integrated into your preferred IDE via the Agent Communication Protocol. It is released under the Apache 2.0 license.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vibe CLI provides an interactive chat interface with tools for file manipulation, code searching, version control, and command execution. Key features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Project-aware context: Automatically scans your file structure and Git status to provide relevant context&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Smart references: Reference files with @ autocomplete, execute shell commands with !, and use slash commands for configuration changes&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Multi-file orchestration: Understands your entire codebase—not just the file you're editing—enabling architecture-level reasoning that can halve your PR cycle time&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Persistent history, autocompletion, and customizable themes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can run Vibe CLI programmatically for scripting, toggle auto-approval for tool execution, configure local models and providers through a simple config.toml, and control tool permissions to match your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Get started.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devstral 2 is currently offered free via our API. After the free period, the API pricing will be $0.40/$2.00 per million tokens (input/output) for Devstral 2 and $0.10/$0.30 for Devstral Small 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve partnered with leading, open agent tools Kilo Code and Cline to bring Devstral 2 to where you already build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mistral Vibe CLI is available as an extension in Zed, so you can use it directly inside your IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Recommended deployment for Devstral.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devstral 2 is optimized for data center GPUs and requires a minimum of 4 H100-class GPUs for deployment. You can try it today on build.nvidia.com. Devstral Small 2 is built for single-GPU operation and runs across a broad range of NVIDIA systems, including DGX Spark and GeForce RTX. NVIDIA NIM support will be available soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devstral Small runs on consumer-grade GPUs as well as CPU-only configurations with no dedicated GPU required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For optimal performance, we recommend a temperature of 0.2 and following the best practices defined for Mistral Vibe CLI.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;My favourite small hash table&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm the kind of person who thinks about the design and implementation of hash tables. One design which I find particularly cute, and I think deserves a bit more publicity, is Robin Hood open-addressing with linear probing and power-of-two table size. If you're not familiar with hash table terminology, that might look like a smorgasbord of random words, but it should become clearer as we look at some actual code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To keep the code simple to start with, I'm going to assume:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keys are randomly-distributed 32-bit integers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Values are also 32-bit integers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the key &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;is present, its value is not&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The table occupies at most 32 GiB of memory.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each slot in the table is either empty, or holds a key and a value. The combination of properties (1) and (2) allows a key/value pair to be stored as a 64-bit integer, and property (3) means that the 64-bit value &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; can be used to represent an empty slot (some hash table designs also need a special value for representing tombstones, but this design doesn't need tombstones). Combining a key and a value into 64 bits couldn't be easier: the low 32 bits hold the key, and the high 32 bits hold the value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The structure for the table itself needs a pointer to the array of slots, the length of said array, and the number of non-empty slots. As the length is always a power of two, it's more useful to store &lt;code&gt;length - 1&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt;, which leads to &lt;code&gt;mask&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt;, and property (4) means that &lt;code&gt;mask&lt;/code&gt; can be stored as 32 bits. As the load factor should be less than 100%, we can assume &lt;code&gt;count &amp;lt; length&lt;/code&gt;, and hence &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; can also be 32 bits. This leads to a mundane-looking:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct hash_table_t {
  uint64_t* slots;
  uint32_t mask;
  uint32_t count;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Property (1) means that we don't need to hash keys, as they're already randomly distributed. Every possible key &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt; has a "natural position" in the slots array, which is just &lt;code&gt;K &amp;amp; mask&lt;/code&gt;. If there are collisions, the slot in which a key actually ends up might be different to its natural position. The "linear probing" part of the design means that if &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt; cannot be in its natural position, the next slot to be considered is &lt;code&gt;(K + 1) &amp;amp; mask&lt;/code&gt;, and if not that slot then &lt;code&gt;(K + 2) &amp;amp; mask&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;(K + 3) &amp;amp; mask&lt;/code&gt;, and so on. This leads to the definition of a "chain": if &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt; is some key present in the table, &lt;code&gt;CK&lt;/code&gt; denotes the sequence of slots starting with &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt;'s natural position and ending with &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt;'s actual position. We have the usual property of open-addressing: none of the slots in &lt;code&gt;CK&lt;/code&gt; are empty slots. The "Robin Hood" part of the design then imposes an additional rather interesting property: for each slot &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;CK&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Score(S.Index, S.Key) â¥ Score(S.Index, K)&lt;/code&gt;, where:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;S.Index&lt;/code&gt;is the index of&lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;in the&lt;code&gt;slots&lt;/code&gt;array (not the index of it in&lt;code&gt;CK&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;S.Key&lt;/code&gt;is the key present in slot&lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;(i.e. the low 32 bits of&lt;code&gt;slots[S.Index]&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Score(Index, Key)&lt;/code&gt;is&lt;code&gt;(Index - Key) &amp;amp; mask&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These properties give us the termination conditions for the lookup algorithm: for a possible key &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt;, we look at each slot starting from &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt;'s natural position, and either we find &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt;, or we find an empty slot, or we find a slot with &lt;code&gt;Score(S.Index, S.Key) &amp;lt; Score(S.Index, K)&lt;/code&gt;. In either of the latter two cases, &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt; cannot have been present in the table. In the function below, &lt;code&gt;Score(S.Index, K)&lt;/code&gt; is tracked as &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;. In a language with a modern type system, the result of a lookup would be &lt;code&gt;Optional&amp;lt;Value&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, but if sticking to plain C, property (3) can be used to make something similar: the 64-bit result is zero if the key is absent, and otherwise the value is in the low 32 bits of the result (which may themselves be zero, but the full 64-bit result will be non-zero). The logic is thus:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint64_t table_lookup(hash_table_t* table, uint32_t key) {
  uint32_t mask = table-&amp;gt;mask;
  uint64_t* slots = table-&amp;gt;slots;
  for (uint32_t d = 0;; ++d) {
    uint32_t idx = (key + d) &amp;amp; mask;
    uint64_t slot = slots[idx];
    if (slot == 0) {
      return 0;
    } else if (key == (uint32_t)slot) {
      return (slot &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 32) | (slot &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 32);
    } else if (((idx - (uint32_t)slot) &amp;amp; mask) &amp;lt; d) {
      return 0;
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If using a rich 64-bit CPU architecture, many of the expressions in the above function are cheaper than they might initially seem:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;slots[idx]&lt;/code&gt;involves zero-extending&lt;code&gt;idx&lt;/code&gt;from 32 bits to 64, multiplying it by&lt;code&gt;sizeof(uint64_t)&lt;/code&gt;, adding it to&lt;code&gt;slots&lt;/code&gt;, and then loading from that address. All this is a single instruction on x86-64 or arm64.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;key == (uint32_t)slot&lt;/code&gt;involves a comparison using the low 32 bits of a 64-bit register, which is a completely standard operation on x86-64 or arm64.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;(slot &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 32) | (slot &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 32)&lt;/code&gt;is a rotation by 32 bits, which again is a single instruction on x86-64 or arm64.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if using riscv64, things are less good:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;Zba&lt;/code&gt;extension is present,&lt;code&gt;sh3add.uw&lt;/code&gt;is a single instruction for zero-extending&lt;code&gt;idx&lt;/code&gt;from 32 bits to 64, multiplying it by&lt;code&gt;sizeof(uint64_t)&lt;/code&gt;, and adding it to&lt;code&gt;slots&lt;/code&gt;. If not, each step is a separate instruction, though the zero-extension can be eliminated with a slight reformulation to encourage the compiler to fold the zero-extension onto the load of&lt;code&gt;table-&amp;gt;mask&lt;/code&gt;(as riscv64 usually defaults to making sign-extension free, in contrast to x86-64/arm64 which usually make zero-extension free). Regardless, the load is always its own instruction.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;key == (uint32_t)slot&lt;/code&gt;hits a gap in the riscv64 ISA: it doesn't have any 32-bit comparison instructions, so this either becomes a 32-bit subtraction followed by a 64-bit comparison against zero, or promotion of both operands from 32 bits to 64 bits followed by a 64-bit comparison.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;Zbb&lt;/code&gt;extension is present, rotations are a single instruction. If not, they're three instructions, and so it becomes almost worth reworking the slot layout to put the key in the high 32 bits and the value in the low 32 bits.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving on from lookup to insertion, there are various different options for what to do when the key being inserted is already present. I'm choosing to show a variant which returns the old value (in the same form as &lt;code&gt;table_lookup&lt;/code&gt; returns) and then overwrites with the new value, though other variants are obviously possible. The logic follows the same overall structure as seen in &lt;code&gt;table_lookup&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint64_t table_set(hash_table_t* table, uint32_t key, uint32_t val) {
  uint32_t mask = table-&amp;gt;mask;
  uint64_t* slots = table-&amp;gt;slots;
  uint64_t kv = key + ((uint64_t)val &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 32);
  for (uint32_t d = 0;; ++d) {
    uint32_t idx = ((uint32_t)kv + d) &amp;amp; mask;
    uint64_t slot = slots[idx];
    if (slot == 0) {
      // Inserting new value (and slot was previously empty)
      slots[idx] = kv;
      break;
    } else if ((uint32_t)kv == (uint32_t)slot) {
      // Overwriting existing value
      slots[idx] = kv;
      return (slot &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 32) | (slot &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 32);
    } else {
      uint32_t d2 = (idx - (uint32_t)slot) &amp;amp; mask;
      if (d2 &amp;lt; d) {
        // Inserting new value, and moving existing slot
        slots[idx] = kv;
        table_reinsert(slots, mask, slot, d2);
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  if (++table-&amp;gt;count * 4ull &amp;gt;= mask * 3ull) {
    // Expand table once we hit 75% load factor
    table_rehash(table);
  }
  return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To avoid the load factor becoming too high, the above function will sometimes grow the table by calling this helper function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void table_rehash(hash_table_t* table) {
  uint32_t old_mask = table-&amp;gt;mask;
  uint32_t new_mask = old_mask * 2u + 1u;
  uint64_t* new_slots = calloc(new_mask + 1ull, sizeof(uint64_t));
  uint64_t* old_slots = table-&amp;gt;slots;
  uint32_t idx = 0;
  do {
    uint64_t slot = old_slots[idx];
    if (slot != 0) {
      table_reinsert(new_slots, new_mask, slot, 0);
    }
  } while (idx++ != old_mask);
  table-&amp;gt;slots = new_slots;
  table-&amp;gt;mask = new_mask;
  free(old_slots);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both of &lt;code&gt;table_set&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;table_rehash&lt;/code&gt; make use of a helper function which is very similar to &lt;code&gt;table_set&lt;/code&gt;, but doesn't need to check for overwriting an existing key and also doesn't need to update &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void table_reinsert(uint64_t* slots, uint32_t mask, uint64_t kv, uint32_t d) {
  for (;; ++d) {
    uint32_t idx = ((uint32_t)kv + d) &amp;amp; mask;
    uint64_t slot = slots[idx];
    if (slot == 0) {
      slots[idx] = kv;
      break;
    } else {
      uint32_t d2 = (idx - (uint32_t)slot) &amp;amp; mask;
      if (d2 &amp;lt; d) {
        slots[idx] = kv;
        kv = slot;
        d = d2;
      }
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That covers lookup and insertion, so next up is key removal. As already hinted at, this hash table design doesn't need tombstones. Instead, removing a key involves finding the slot containing that key and then shifting slots left until finding an empty slot or a slot with &lt;code&gt;Score(S.Index, S.Key) == 0&lt;/code&gt;. This removal strategy works due to a neat pair of emergent properties:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If slot &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;has&lt;code&gt;Score(S.Index, S.Key) != 0&lt;/code&gt;, it is viable for&lt;code&gt;S.Key&lt;/code&gt;to instead be at&lt;code&gt;(S.Index - 1) &amp;amp; mask&lt;/code&gt;(possibly subject to additional re-arranging to fill the gap formed by moving&lt;code&gt;S.Key&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If slot &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;has&lt;code&gt;Score(S.Index, S.Key) == 0&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;is part of some chain&lt;code&gt;CK&lt;/code&gt;, then&lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;is at the very start of&lt;code&gt;CK&lt;/code&gt;. Hence it is viable to turn&lt;code&gt;(S.Index - 1) &amp;amp; mask&lt;/code&gt;into an empty slot without breaking any chains.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This leads to the tombstone-free removal function, which follows the established pattern of returning either the old value or zero:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint64_t table_remove(hash_table_t* table, uint32_t key) {
  uint32_t mask = table-&amp;gt;mask;
  uint64_t* slots = table-&amp;gt;slots;
  for (uint32_t d = 0;; ++d) {
    uint32_t idx = (key + d) &amp;amp; mask;
    uint64_t slot = slots[idx];
    if (slot == 0) {
      return 0;
    } else if (key == (uint32_t)slot) {
      uint32_t nxt = (idx + 1) &amp;amp; mask;
      --table-&amp;gt;count;
      while (slots[nxt] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ((slots[nxt] ^ nxt) &amp;amp; mask)) {
        slots[idx] = slots[nxt];
        idx = nxt;
        nxt = (idx + 1) &amp;amp; mask;
      }
      slots[idx] = 0;
      return (slot &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 32) | (slot &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 32);
    } else if (((idx - (uint32_t)slot) &amp;amp; mask) &amp;lt; d) {
      return 0;
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final interesting hash table operation is iterating over all keys and values, which is just an array iteration combined with filtering out zeroes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void table_iterate(hash_table_t* table, void(*visit)(uint32_t key, uint32_t val)) {
  uint64_t* slots = table-&amp;gt;slots;
  uint32_t mask = table-&amp;gt;mask;
  uint32_t idx = 0;
  do {
    uint64_t slot = slots[idx];
    if (slot != 0) {
      visit((uint32_t)slot, (uint32_t)(slot &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 32));
    }
  } while (idx++ != mask);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That wraps up the core concepts of this hash table, so now it is time to revisit some of the initial simplifications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If keys are 32-bit integers but are not randomly-distributed, then we just need an invertible hash function from 32 bits to 32 bits, the purpose of which is to take keys following ~any real-world pattern and emit a ~random pattern. The &lt;code&gt;table_lookup&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;table_set&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;table_remove&lt;/code&gt; functions gain &lt;code&gt;key = hash(key)&lt;/code&gt; at the very start but are otherwise unmodified (noting that if the hash function is invertible, hash equality implies key equality, hence no need to explicitly check key equality), and &lt;code&gt;table_iterate&lt;/code&gt; is modified to apply the inverse function before calling &lt;code&gt;visit&lt;/code&gt;. If hardware CRC32 / CRC32C instructions are present (as is the case on sufficiently modern x86-64 and arm64 chips), these can be used for the task, although their inverses are annoying to compute, so perhaps not ideal if iteration is an important operation. If CRC32 isn't viable, one option out of many is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If keys and values are larger than 32 bits, then the design can be augmented with a separate array of key/value pairs, with the design as shown containing a 32-bit hash of the key and the array index of the key/value pair. To meet property (3) in this case, either the hash function can be chosen to never be zero, or "array index plus one" can be stored rather than "array index". It is not possible to make the hash function invertible in this case, so &lt;code&gt;table_lookup&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;table_set&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;table_remove&lt;/code&gt; do need extending to check for key equality after confirming hash equality. Iteration involves walking the separate array of key/value pairs rather than the hash structure, which has the added benefit of iteration order being related to insertion order rather than hash order. As another twist on this, if keys and values are variably-sized, then the design can instead be augmented with a separate array of bytes, with key/value pairs serialised somewhere in that array, and the hash structure containing a 32-bit hash of the key and the byte offset (within the array) of the key/value pair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, a design can only stretch so far. If you're after a concurrent lock-free hash table, look elsewhere. If you can rely on 128-bit SIMD instructions being present, you might instead want to group together every 16 key/value pairs, keep an 8-bit hash of each key, and rely on SIMD to perform 16 hash comparisons in parallel. If you're building hardware rather than software, it can be appealing to have multiple hash functions, each one addressing its own SRAM bank. There is no one-size-fits-all hash table, but I've found the one shown here to be good for a lot of what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kaiju is a 2D/3D game engine written in Go (Golang) backed by Vulkan. The goal of the engine is to use a modern, easy, systems level programming language, with a focus on simplicity, to create a new kind of game engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;📄 2D / 🧊 3D Game Engine&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🪟 Windows&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🐧 Linux&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🤖 Android (NEW, support now functional)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🍎 Mac (support is currently WIP)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🤖👉⌨️ Local AI (LLM) interop&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;g-emoji&gt;⚠️&lt;/g-emoji&gt;🚧🏗️👷♂️ Work in progress, under heavy development&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🚚 Faster builds than other game engines&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;🔥 Better performance than other game engines (9x faster than Unity out of the box)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;💾 Less memory than other engines&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mailing list &amp;lt;- Recommended for detailed updates&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Discord server&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Brent Farris on X/Twitter&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current version of the base engine renders extremely fast, faster than most would think a garbage collected language could go. In my testing a release mode build of a game in Unity with nothing but a black background and a cube runs at about 1,600 FPS. In Kaiju, the same thing runs at around 5,400 FPS on the same machine. In fact, a complete game, with audio, custom cursors, real time PBR rendering with real time shadows, UI, and more runs at 2,712 FPS (in "debug" mode) screenshots or it didn't happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love C, and because I love C and found out that Ken Thompson played a part in designing Go, I gave Go a chance. It has been such a joy to use and work with I decided to port my C game engine to Go. Go is a modern system-level language that allows me to write code the way I want to write code and even have the opportunity to do some crazy things if I want to (no strings attached). Also the simplicity and "just works" of writing Assembly code was a great boost to my happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's more, it's a language that other developers can easily learn and jump right into extending the engine/editor. No need for developers to re-figure out some bespoke macros or crazy templating nonsense. It's flat, easy, straight forward, and the foot-gun is hidden behind some walls, but there if you want it. Furthermore, developers can write their games in Go directly, no need for some alternative language that is different from the engine code (but we'll include Lua for modding).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am creating this section because I get asked about it when I mention "Go", possibly not realizing that most public game engines use a garbage collector (GC).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The GC is actually a feature I'm happy with (shocker coming from a C guy). Well, the reason is simple, if you're going to make a game engine that the public will use and needs to be stable, you need a garbage collector. Unity has C# (and possibly an internal GC as well), Unreal has a GC (and it could use a tune up if you ask me), Godot has a GC albeit their scripting language or when you use C#. It is actually very important for public engines to have a GC because people are only human and make a lot of mistakes, mistakes they'll blame on you (the engine developer) before they blame themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, the overall design I have for the engine plays very well with the GC and last I measured, I have a net-0 heap allocation while running (may need a new review). If you don't abuse the GC, you shouldn't generally feel it, it runs concurrently as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll be the first to admit, I think the developers of Go can create a better GC than I can, and probably better than Unreal and Unity too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though the engine is production ready, the editor is not, feel free to join and contribute to its development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the latest updates, please join the Discord or check my Twitter/X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please review the Ad-Hoc editor readme&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please see the documentation on how to get started and compile the engine&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Catch your best ideas before they slip through your fingers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you ever have flashes of insight or an idea worth remembering? This happens to me 5-10 times every day. If I don’t write down the thought immediately, it slips out of my mind. Worst of all, I remember that I’ve forgotten something and spend the next 10 minutes trying to remember what it is. So I invented external memory for my brain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Introducing Pebble Index 01 - a small ring with a button and microphone. Hold the button, whisper your thought, and it’s sent to your phone. It’s added to your notes, set as a reminder, or saved for later review.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Index 01 is designed to become muscle memory, since it’s always with you. It’s private by design (no recording until you press the button) and requires no internet connection or paid subscription. It’s as small as a wedding band and comes in 3 colours. It’s made from durable stainless steel and is water-resistant. Like all Pebble products, it’s extremely customizable and built with open source software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the best part: the battery lasts for years. You never need to charge it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pre-order today for $75. After worldwide shipping begins in March 2026, the price will go up to $99.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#Design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve worn my Index 01 for several months, I can safely say that it has changed my life - just like with Pebble, I couldn’t go back to a world without this. There are so many situations each day where my hands are full (while biking or driving, washing dishes, wrangling my kids, etc) and I need to remember something. A random sampling of my recent recordings:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set a timer for 3pm to go pick up the kids&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Remind me to phone the pharmacy at 11am&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Peter is coming by tomorrow at 11:30am, add that to my calendar&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Jerry recommends reading Breakneck&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mark wants a Black/Red PT2&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before, I would take my phone out of my pocket to jot these down, but I couldn’t always do that (eg, while bicycling). I also wanted to start using my phone less, especially in front of my kids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially, we experimented by building this as an app on Pebble, since it has a mic and I’m always wearing one. But, I realized quickly that this was suboptimal - it required me to use my other hand to press the button to start recording (lift-to-wake gestures and wake-words are too unreliable). This was tough to use while bicycling or carrying stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then a genius electrical engineer friend of mine came up with an idea to fit everything into a tiny ring. It is the perfect form factor! Honestly, I’m still amazed that it all fits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design needed to satisfy several critical conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Must work reliably 100% of the time. If it didn’t work or failed to record a thought, I knew I would take it off and revert back to my old habit of just forgetting things.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It had to have a physical press-button, with a satisfying click-feel. I want to know for sure if the button is pressed and my thought is captured.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Long battery life - every time you take something off to charge, there’s a chance you’ll forget to put it back on.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Must be privacy-preserving. These are your inner thoughts. All recordings must be processed and stored on your phone. Only record when the button is pressed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It had to be as small as a wedding band. Since it’s worn on the index finger, if it were too large or bulky, it would hit your phone while you held it in your hand.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Water resistance - must be able to wash hands, shower, and get wet.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve been working on this for a while, testing new versions and making tweaks. We’re really excited to get this out into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are a few of my favourite things about Index 01:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It does one thing really well - it helps me remember things.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It’s discreet. It's not distracting. It doesn't take you out of the moment.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There’s no AI friend persona and it’s not always recording.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It’s inexpensive. We hope you try it and see if you like it as well!&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#Key Details&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Available in 3 colours and 8 sizes &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Colours: polished silver, polished gold, and matte black&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;US ring sizes: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;You can pre-order now and pick your size/colour later before your ring ships.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cost and availability: Pre-order price is $75, rises to $99 later. Ships worldwide, beginning in March.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Works with iPhone and Android: We overcame Apple’s best efforts to make life terrible for 3rd party accessory makers and have Index 01 working well on iOS and Android.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extremely private and secure: Your thoughts are processed by open source speech-to-text (STT) and AI models locally on your phone. You can read the code and see exactly how it works - our Pebble mobile app is open source. Higher-quality STT is available through an optional cloud service.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No charging: The battery lasts for up to years of average use. After the end of its life, send your ring back to us for recycling.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;On-ring storage: Recording works even if your phone is out of range. Up to 5 minutes of audio can be stored on-ring, then synced later.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No speaker or vibrating motor: This is an input device only. There is an RGB LED, but it’s rarely used (to save battery life and to reduce distraction).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Works great with Pebble or other smartwatches: After recording, the thought will appear on your watch, and you can check that it’s correct. You can ask questions like ‘What’s the weather today?’ and see the answer on your watch.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Raw audio playback: Very helpful if STT doesn’t work perfectly due to wind or loud background noises.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Actions: While the primary task is remembering things for you, you can also ask it to do things like ’Send a Beeper message to my wife - running late’ or answer simple questions that could be answered by searching the web. You can configure button clicks to control your music - I love using this to play/pause or skip tracks. You can also configure where to save your notes and reminders (I have it set to add to Notion).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Customizable and hackable: Configure single/double button clicks to control whatever you want (take a photo, turn on lights, Tasker, etc). Add your own voice actions via MCP. Or route the audio recordings directly to your own app or server!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;99+ languages: Speech to text and local LLM support over 99 languages! Naturally, the quality of each may vary.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;#Future Plans&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me be very clear - Index 01 is designed at its core to be a device that helps you remember things. We want it to be 100% reliable at its primary task. But we’re leaving the side door open for folks to customize, build new interactions and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how I’m thinking about it - a single click-hold + voice input will be routed to the primary memory processing path. Double-click-hold + voice input would be routed to a more general purpose voice agent (think ChatGPT with web search). Responses from the agent would be presented on Pebble (eg ‘What’s the weather tomorrow?’, ‘When’s the next northbound Caltrain?’) or other smartwatches (as a notification). Maybe this could even be an input for something like ChatGPT Voice Mode, enabling you to hear the AI response from your earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The built in actions, set reminder, create note, alarms, etc, are actually MCPs - basically mini apps that AI agents know how to operate. They run locally in WASM within the Pebble mobile app (no cloud MCP server required). Basically any MCP server can be used with the system, so intrepid folks may have fun adding various actions like Beeper, Google Calendar, weather, etc that already offer MCPs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not everything will be available at launch, but this is the direction we are working towards. There will be 3 ways to customize your Index 01:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trigger actions via button clicks - configure a single or double click to do things like take a photo, control your Home Assistant smart home, Tasker function, unlock your car. This will work better on Android since iOS Shortcuts doesn’t have an open API.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trigger actions via voice input - write an MCP to do….basically anything? This is pretty open ended.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Route your voice recordings and/or transcriptions to your own webhook - or skip our AI processing entirely and send every recording to your own app or webapp.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How does it work?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People usually wear it on the index finger. Inside the ring is a button, a microphone, a Bluetooth chip, memory, and a battery that lasts for years. Click the button with your thumb, talk into the mic, and it records to internal memory. When your phone is in range, the recording is streamed to the Pebble app. It’s converted to text on-device, then processed by an on-device large language model (LLM) which selects an action to take (create note, add to reminders, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When do I pick my size?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll be able to pick your ring size and color after placing a pre-order. If you have a 3D printer, you can print our CAD designs to try on. We’re also planning a sizing kit. You can view the measurements of the inner diameter of each ring size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How long does the battery last?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roughly 12 to 15 hours of recording. On average, I use it 10-20 times per day to record 3-6 second thoughts. That’s up to 2 years of usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it secure and private?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, extremely. The connection between ring and phone is encrypted. Recordings are processed locally on your phone in the open-source Pebble app. The app works offline (no internet connection) and does not require a cloud service. An optional cloud storage system for backing up recordings is available. Our plan is for this to be optionally encrypted, but we haven’t built it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is a paid subscription required?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What kind of battery is inside?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Index 01 uses silver-oxide batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why can’t it be recharged?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We considered this but decided not to for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You’d probably lose the charger before the battery runs out!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Adding charge circuitry and including a charger would make the product larger and more expensive.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You send it back to us to recycle.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait, it’s single use?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes. We know this sounds a bit odd, but in this particular circumstance we believe it’s the best solution to the given set of constraints. Other smart rings like Oura cost $250+ and need to be charged every few days. We didn’t want to build a device like that. Before the battery runs out, the Pebble app notifies and asks if you’d like to order another ring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it always listening?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. It only records while the button is pressed. It’s not designed to record your whole life, or meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if the speech-to-text processing misses a word or something?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can always listen to the each recording in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why no touchpad?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We experimented with a touchpad, but found it too easy to accidentally swipe and press. Also, nothing beats the feedback of a real gosh darn pressable button.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is there a speaker or vibrating motor?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. The button has a great click-feel to indicate when you are pressing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does it do health tracking like Oura?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nope&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How durable and water-resistant is it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s primarily made from stainless steel 316, with a liquid silicone rubber (LSR) button. It’s water-resistant to 1 meter. You can wash your hands, do dishes, and shower with it on, but we don’t recommend swimming with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does it work with iPhone and Android?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love customizing and hacking on my devices. What could I do with Index 01?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lots of stuff! Control things with the buttons. Route raw audio or transcribed text directly to your own app via webhook. Use MCPs (also run locally on-device! No cloud server required) to add more actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this an AI friend thingy or always-recording device?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How far along is development?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve been working on this in the background to watch development. It helps that our Pebble Time 2 partner factory is also building Index 01! We’re currently in the DVT stage, testing pre-production samples. We’ll start a wider alpha test in January with a lot more people. Here’s some shots from the pre-production assembly line:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Thank you for visiting my portfolio! &lt;lb/&gt;If you are curious about the stack and how I built it, hereâs everything you need to know. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Three.js is the library Iâm using to render this 3D world. &lt;lb/&gt;It was created by mr.doob (X, GitHub), followed by hundreds of awesome developers, one of which being Sunag (X, GitHub) who added TSL, enabling the use of both WebGL and WebGPU, making this portfolio possible. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; If you want to learn Three.js, I got you covered with this huge course. &lt;lb/&gt;It contains everything you need to start building awesome stuff with Three.js (and much more). &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Iâve been making devlogs since the very start of this portfolio and you can find them on my Youtube channel. &lt;lb/&gt;Even though the portfolio is out, Iâm still working on the last videos so that the series is complete. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The code is available on GitHub under MIT license. Even the Blender files are there, so have fun! &lt;lb/&gt;For security reasons, Iâm not sharing the server code, but the portfolio works without it. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The music you hear was made especially for this portfolio by the awesome Kounine (Linktree). &lt;lb/&gt;They are now under CC0 license, meaning you can do whatever you want with them! &lt;lb/&gt;Download them here. &lt;/p&gt;

They're a Sign of Collapse</title><link>https://newrepublic.com/article/204051/firewood-banks-heating-bill-winter</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="2f8411508da116d9"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rural America knows the truth long before the rest of the country feels it. Nothing collapses all at once. It just stops working in small places first while everyone else calls it local hardship. That’s why wood banks—like a food bank but for fuel—are important. They’re the clearest sign that basic systems in this country have already failed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A wood bank is exactly what it sounds like. People in rural and Indigenous areas still heavily rely on wood heat as the primary fuel source for their homes. Volunteers cut and split firewood, stack it somewhere public, and give it away for free to those who can’t afford it. No paperwork. No means tests. No government forms. Just a pile of hardwood that shows up because someone else’s house would be cold without it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most articles about wood banks wrap them in the same tired language. Community spirit. Rural generosity. Neighbors helping neighbors. It’s the kind of coverage you get when journalists focus on the people stacking the wood instead of the conditions that made it necessary. They never mention the underlying reality. Wood banks exist because without them, people would freeze. It’s the same everywhere: Local news crews film volunteers splitting logs while pretending it’s heartwarming, reporting on senior citizens splitting 150 cords a year for neighbors in need as if the story is about kindness instead of the failure that created the need in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wood banks now operate in hundreds of towns across the country, some run by churches, some by fire departments, and some by volunteers who buy or haul low-grade timber when families have no other heat source. Demand has grown fast enough that the Agriculture Department has issued multiple rounds of grants to help communities process more wood because so many households can’t afford the heat they used to rely on. Almost one in four households couldn’t pay their energy bills in 2024, according to census data. The federally funded Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which offers grants to help people pay their bills, routinely runs out of money in some locations partway through the season. And this year, funds have been delayed due to the government shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t start a wood bank in a country with functioning institutions. You start one when heating assistance programs can’t keep up, when the grid flickers every time the wind shifts, when propane and heating oil costs swing so hard that families can’t budget more than a week out. You start a wood bank when seniors stop turning on their heat because they’re scared of the bill. You also start one when the country pretends energy insecurity doesn’t exist because acknowledging it would mean admitting that entire regions were left behind on purpose. Federal data shows that families are using less fuel than they did five years ago but spending more for it. Heating oil and propane have seen some of the steepest price swings, especially in rural states, and those increases hit households that already live on tight margins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s collapse. Not the cinematic kind. Not the dramatic scenes everyone imagines when they talk about a country falling apart. Collapse is boring. It’s ordinary. It looks like people standing next to a log splitter on a Saturday morning because the safety net dissolved and no one replaced it. Collapse isn’t a single moment. It’s what happens when the systems people rely on keep existing on paper but stop functioning in practice. Heating programs remain funded but reach only a fraction of eligible households. The grid stays interconnected, but the outages keep stacking up and repairs keep getting delayed. Fuel is available, but the costs vary so widely that families can’t budget for it or afford it. These are small failures that accumulate until ordinary people are left to solve problems that institutions were supposed to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rural families don’t get to pretend. They know exactly what it means when the power goes out for the third time in a month and the utility company shrugs because the profit isn’t there to fix it. And they’ve lived long enough inside these systems to know that plenty of companies don’t fix it when the profit is there, either. They also know what it means when everything gets privatized except the consequences. This winter, federal grid monitors warned that large parts of the country face elevated outage risks because demand is climbing faster than utilities can keep up. The spread of data centers has pushed peak winter load sharply higher, and storms are hitting harder and more often. Rural households feel those failures long before any report is written.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wood is the last fallback because it’s the only thing that hasn’t been captured by markets or politics. It’s honest. It’s physical. It keeps you warm whether the rest of the country works or not. And that’s exactly why wood banks reveal so much. When a society is functioning, wood isn’t the fallback and families aren’t relying on volunteers with chainsaws. Firewood is now doing the work that was supposed to be guaranteed. That shift is why wood banks have multiplied in places like Maine, where leaders report record demand and new laws now support their expansion because so many families have no other reliable heat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People like to say rural communities are resilient. What they mean is rural communities absorb the damage so others don’t have to think about it. The volunteers running wood banks aren’t performing resilience. They’re plugging holes in a sinking ship and doing the work the state stopped doing. They are the thin line between a cold snap and another obituary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The danger is how invisible it all is. You can drive through a town and never notice that the shed behind the church isn’t storing holiday decorations but several cords of oak that’ll decide whether someone wakes up warm tomorrow. You won’t see the short text messages that go out when temperatures drop, or the pride swallowed by the person who finally calls asking for help. No one will ever see the quiet math families do when the fuel bill comes in and something else has to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collapse doesn’t announce itself. It piles up. It accumulates in places people don’t look. And right now it’s sitting in stacks behind rural churches and volunteer fire departments. It’s measured in cords, not policy briefs. Every log is evidence of a system that stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
