  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m enjoying my Xberry Pi ZX Spectrum Next, but I have to say the ‘simple’ upgrade of getting it onto Wifi via the cheap and cheerful ESP 8266 was not fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I had every intention of setting up my Speccy keyboard on the board’s matrix connector, I need to wait for a socket of the correct pitch. It turns out the Xberry Pi needs 0.2mm spacing and I have none in my parts box. Instead I figured do the other main upgrades, namely add a Pi Zero “accelerator” and the Wifi upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ZX Next Pi Zero Accelerator Upgrade&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fully expecting the Pi Zero to be the thing that caused me trouble, I was shocked that not only my soldering had gone perfectly but also the flashing of the SD card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So many community members had advised to use a highly specific Pi Zero, I thought my spare board would be wrong. But it worked first time!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My pin header made the soldering trickier than usual, maybe it soaked a lot of heat? Just remember the header needs to go on the ‘wrong’ side and take your time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pi Zero upgrade is hardly used currently but the ZX Next team keep hinting at future utility, and at least one game is in development that uses it as a kind of math coprocessor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So after running a TZX file and some SID tunes, I moved on to the ESP figuring I would have everything done quick as a flash. Pardon the pun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Adding Wifi to the Next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Next can come with Wifi already installed apparently, and some Xberry bundles come with one as standard, but the chosen module is an ESP 01 / 8266 which is something I have on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s precious little documentation for this kind of thing out there, but I did find YouTube videos that made everything look very straightforward. That should have been the first red flag!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of them showed installing the correct ESP firmware, what baud rate the Next expects, or even attaching the ESP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I picked out a board I was confident was working fine, attached it, successfully ran the ESP Updater.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After it confirmed the update, I tried to connect to wifi using the built-in Next menu item …. and failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact the ESP Updater did its thing suggests also the board was fine therefore I tried and failed all the many ways to get the “driver” to install.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I quickly started to hate this “Installing Driver…” message. There is no indication if anything is happening when it gets stuck there for ages, but other times it quickly quits back to the menu, again with no feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: Even with everything now ‘working’, it often takes a lot more attempts than you would expect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To save anyone else the bother I went through, and potentially Future Chris, the key was to NOT update the ESP 01 firmware. Just use whatever your board came with by default. My working firmware is not even listed on the ESP Updater repo …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I rummaged around and found another ESP board that had never had its firmware flashed. Using a breadboard I confirmed it was working and responding to AT commands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;CircuitPython Code to Communicate with ESP01 via UART&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
import board,binascii
import adafruit_pio_uart
# Define the UART pins (example using GP16 for TX and GP17 for RX)
# The actual pins depend on your specific wiring/board configuration.
UART_TX = board.GP16
UART_RX = board.GP17
# Initialize the UART connection
# The baudrate for the ESP01 is typically 115200
uart = adafruit_pio_uart.UART(UART_TX, UART_RX, baudrate=115200)

def send(s):
    uart.write(s+'\r\n')
    print(uart.read(255).decode())
send('AT+RST')
send('AT')
send('AT+GMR')
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This code allows you to hook the ESP01 up to pins 16 and 17 for UART, and 3.3v and GND.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wifi on the ZX Spectrum Next … Finally!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Again it didn’t work on the ZX Next right away, but I persisted and finally signs of life!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hope this helps someone else out there! I found it incredibly frustrating but now I am back to having fun with my ZX Next experience rather than regretting my choices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seems life might have been easier if a Pi Zero W was used instead of a Pi and an ESP8266, or even an ESP32, but perhaps there is a good reason they went with the little old ESP01.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Brent's Encapsulated C Programming Rules&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below are some rules that I have developed over a long period of time writing fully encapsulated C programs. C is my favorite language and I love the freedom and exploration it allows me. I also love that it is so close to Assembly and I love writing assembly for much of the same reasons!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE: You may see references to ‘perfect encapsulation’ throughout. I offer both a ‘performance’ and a ‘pure encapsulation’ approach to C here (first two headers). So feel free to interpret the rest of the rules based on the approach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JMP&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pure encapsulation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No encapsulation performance&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory ownership&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Avoid void*&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don’t over-complicate strings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don’t over-complicate stdlib&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use utf8 strings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don’t use char for memory array, use uint8_t&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use standard bool&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don’t use static or global variables&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prefer inline over macro&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Test your functions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write functions to do one thing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Don’t write systems, write modular pieces (think UNIX)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Warnings are errors&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If there is a standard, use it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use float epsilon for 0 checking&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zero set your structs&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Big types first&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;More to come&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pure encapsulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the great things about C is that it allows for “pure encapsulation”. What this means is that you can explain all the intent of your code through the header file and the developer who uses your lib/code never has to look at the actual implementations of the code. Now to take this a step further, well all know that C supports the &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; keyword to group data, and we can also make the members of a struct hidden completely from the developer using the library. For example, we could declare the following header and C files:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;vec3.h&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#ifndef VEC3_H
#define VEC3_H

struct Vec3;

#endif
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;vec3.c&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include "vec3.h"

struct Vec3 {
	float x;
	float y;
	float z;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see in the above code sample, if you were just to have the header file, you would not know that this vector is implemented using 3 &lt;code&gt;floats&lt;/code&gt;. This is very important for pure encapsulation. With this, you can completely control the behavior of the struct and it’s contents using readable functions and not worry about the developer using the code directly mutating the members of your &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;. Now that you’ve created pure encapsulation, you are able to feel safe knowing that developers can’t new up the struct or abuse it’s contents from anywhere other than through the code you’ve written in your &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;No encapsulation performance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the flaws with pure encapsulation is that you can see a drop in performance. Having a bunch of functions to get inner members of a structure also blocks the compiler from optimizing it’s best. Member hiding is not usually because we don’t trust the end developer with the secrets of our structures, but is often so they don’t make mistakes by changing things they shouldn’t. Also member hiding helps so that we can easily update our code without changing the interface that developers rely on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That being said, if we are dealing with performance critical code, or just want extra optimization by our compiler (and/or to write less code); we can expose the members of our structure. However, let’s be smart about exposing these members so that developers don’t accidentally make mistakes with their new found power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt;, our best friend in this scenario. We can not only mark our members as &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; before their type, but also after their type. The general rule of thumb to remember is, if it is a pointer, the &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; goes after the type, otherwise put it before the type. In the simple example below, you can see how pointers have the &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; after, and the rest have &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; before their type declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct Employer {
	char* const name;
	const int years;
};

struct Employee {
	struct Employer* const employer;
	char* const name;
	const int age;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this way we are able to expose the fields of the struct to the rest of the code for compiler optimizations, ease of access, etc; while also being able to prevent developers from directly assigning/changing the values of those fields. The obvious downside to this is that you will need to either create a macro, or manually cast assign the fields to change them in the implementation C file. I would recommend, if you are using C17, to use &lt;code&gt;_Generic&lt;/code&gt; and macros so you can create a single &lt;code&gt;#define OVERRIDE(field)&lt;/code&gt; type of macro and have the compiler throw if it finds an un-expected type. Of course, if you don’t want to use a macro, you can also create separate &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; functions to do the same (just might be harder to manage). Below is an example of how we can tell the compiler we want to explicitly change the value in the implementation c file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// employee.c file

void employee_set_age(struct Employee* employee, int newAge) {
	// Cast away the const and set it's value, the compiler should optimize this for you
	*(int*)&amp;amp;employee-&amp;gt;age = newAge;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Memory ownership&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With perfect encapsulation you are most of the way towards having good memory ownership. If you purely encapsulate your structs the only way for a developer to create a new instance of the struct would be through functions you create yourself. From this point you can create the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; functions to manage the memory of your struct. Below is an example building upon the previous code sample.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;vec3.h&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#ifndef VEC3_H
#define VEC3_H

struct Vec3;

struct Vec3* Vec3_new();
void Vec3_free(struct Vec3* vector);
void Vec3_print(struct Vec3* vector);

#endif
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;vec3.c&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include "vec3.h"
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;

struct Vec3 { /* ... */ };

struct Vec3* Vec3_new()
{
	struct Vec3* v = malloc(sizeof(struct Vec3));
	v-&amp;gt;x = 0.0F;
	v-&amp;gt;y = 0.0F;
	v-&amp;gt;z = 0.0F;
	return v;
}

void Vec3_free(struct Vec3* vector)
{
	free(vector);
}

void Vec3_print(struct Vec3* vector)
{
	printf("&amp;lt;%f, %f, %f&amp;gt;", vector-&amp;gt;x, vector-&amp;gt;y, vector-&amp;gt;z);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above you can see that we encapsulate the creation, usage, and freeing of our &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;. You would think, well with this, what else do we need to know about memory management? Well there is one more thing, more of a rule that you must follow more than anything else. The thing that declares the memory is the thing that should free the memory. We see this in action above, the &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; file that creates the memory in turn has a function for freeing the memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s look at another example using a &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt; to represent a string function. Here we have a function that takes a string and clones it (wrong way):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;char* strclone(const char* str)
{
	size_t len = strlen(s) + 1;
	char* clone = malloc(len);
	memcpy(clone, str, len);
	return clone;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now what is wrong with the memory management on this code? Answer, we are using &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; to create memory and then return the string. Let’s take a look at the developer using this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;char* str = "Hello Brent!\0";
char* cpy = strclone(str);
printf(cpy);
free(cpy);	// Allowed?
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How is the developer suppose to know that they are to free the &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt;? For all they know the &lt;code&gt;strclone&lt;/code&gt; uses some-sort of pooling functionality to re-use a pool of memory, we can’t free that otherwise you risk seg-faulting. What is a better version of this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void strclone(const char* str, char** outCpy)
{
	size_t len = strlen(s) + 1;
	*outCpy = malloc(len);
	memcpy(outCpy, str, len);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now with this version we make it explicit that the developer should manage their own object that they pass in. We use the hint name out as a prefix to the argument name to let them know memory will be allocated for this input variable. What does this look like to the developer?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;char* str = "Hello Brent!\0";
char* cpy;
strclone(str, &amp;amp;cpy);
printf(cpy);
free(cpy);
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at this version, the developer knows they are in charge of freeing the &lt;code&gt;cpy&lt;/code&gt;, this is because they declare the variable in the first place, rather than being assigned from a function. If the developer follows our rule (The thing that declares the memory is the thing that should free the memory), they declared the variable/pointer so they should be the ones freeing it. Now I know you can argue all sorts of alternative setups for the return value, but the fact of the matter is that passing in a pointer to a pointer is much more clear of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Avoid void*&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One stigma people have against C is the use of &lt;code&gt;void*&lt;/code&gt;, some think it is necessary, some use it to solve problems quickly through the path of least resistance, I say that there are very few cases when &lt;code&gt;void*&lt;/code&gt; is acceptable and most of the time your current problem isn’t it. Like &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;void*&lt;/code&gt; is a lazy solution to a problem and causes all kinds of un-necessary runtime checking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In most cases you should create a &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; that explicitly defines what type is accepted or stored. The biggest advantage of this approach is that you put the compiler to work for you. There are all sorts of compile-time checks that will prevent you from doing something you shouldn’t do. Also your IDE will be much more helpful when trying to navigate code as the IDE, nor the compiler, have any idea where a void* comes from or what it points to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Don’t over-complicate strings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I want to live in the 2020 era of programming, that means I probably will wind up using more than one library to solve a problem. My new problem is that people think it is cute to typedef &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt; to some other name and only accept that name in their code. In the era of UTF8, that is completely un-necessary and makes me have to do a lot of senseless casting. If you want to encapsulate that you are using a string (so I don’t know it) then cool, do that, but &lt;code&gt;typedef unsigned char* string&lt;/code&gt; is not it. Please stick to the good ol’ &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt; for strings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Don’t over-complicate stdlib&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Use utf8 strings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Talking about strings, I’d like to point out that UTF-8 is fully compatible with ASCII, this means we don’t need special functions for special characters or non English characters. All of our usual suspects of functions work on UTF-8 such as &lt;code&gt;fopen&lt;/code&gt;! There are some helpful other things we can use thanks to compilers such as placing &lt;code&gt;u8&lt;/code&gt; in front of an in-line string:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;char* utf8 = u8"Hello World!";
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in closing on the UTF-8 topic, please stop using &lt;code&gt;wchar_t&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;char16_t&lt;/code&gt;, and all those other variants (except when you are forced to, due to 3rd party libraries). With that, I’ll leave you with this helper function to get you started:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;size_t utf8len(const char* const str) {
    size_t len = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; *str != 0; ++len) {
        int v0 = (*str &amp;amp; 0x80) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 7;
        int v1 = (*str &amp;amp; 0x40) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 6;
        int v2 = (*str &amp;amp; 0x20) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 5;
        int v3 = (*str &amp;amp; 0x10) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 4;
        str += 1 + v0 * v1 + v0 * v1 * v2 + v0 * v1 * v2 * v3;
    }
    return len;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE 1: A simplified version of this was proposed by Max Brauer on Stack Overflow to be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;size_t utf8len(const char* str) {
    size_t len = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; *str != 0; ++len) {
        int v01 = ((*str &amp;amp; 0x80) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 7) &amp;amp; ((*str &amp;amp; 0x40) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 6);
        int v2 = (*str &amp;amp; 0x20) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 5;
        int v3 = (*str &amp;amp; 0x10) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 4;
        str += 1 + ((v01 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; v2) | (v01 &amp;amp; v3));
    }
    return len;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE 2: This does not validate the utf8 string. I am not fond of making the length function also validate the string, for that we should create a separate method for validation. Using this table I found on Wikipedia we can construct a validation function (also this table was used for the length function).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bool utf8valid(const char* const str) {
    if (str == NULL)
        return false;
    const char* c = str;
    bool valid = true;
    for (size_t i = 0; c[0] != 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; valid;) {
        valid = (c[0] &amp;amp; 0x80) == 0
            || ((c[0] &amp;amp; 0xE0) == 0xC0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (c[1] &amp;amp; 0xC0) == 0x80)
            || ((c[0] &amp;amp; 0xF0) == 0xE0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (c[1] &amp;amp; 0xC0) == 0x80 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (c[2] &amp;amp; 0xC0) == 0x80)
            || ((c[0] &amp;amp; 0xF8) == 0xF0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (c[1] &amp;amp; 0xC0) == 0x80 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (c[2] &amp;amp; 0xC0) == 0x80 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (c[3] &amp;amp; 0xC0) == 0x80);
        int v0 = (c[0] &amp;amp; 0x80) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 7;
        int v1 = (c[0] &amp;amp; 0x40) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 6;
        int v2 = (c[0] &amp;amp; 0x20) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 5;
        int v3 = (c[0] &amp;amp; 0x10) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 4;
        i += 1 + v0 * v1 + v0 * v1 * v2 + v0 * v1 * v2 * v3;
        c = str + i;
    }
    return valid;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE 3: Based on the same simplification previously discussed, this would become:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bool utf8valid(const char* const str) {
    if (str == NULL)
        return false;
    const char* c = str;
    bool valid = true;
    for (size_t i = 0; c[0] != 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; valid;) {
        valid = (c[0] &amp;amp; 0x80) == 0
            || ((c[0] &amp;amp; 0xE0) == 0xC0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (c[1] &amp;amp; 0xC0) == 0x80)

        c = str + i;
    }
    return valid;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOTE 4: Something that developers trip on is the file encoding for their source file. Be sure you are using UTF-8 encoding for your source file when typing UTF-8 strings directly into your source code. If you use the wrong encoding, the compiler may compile the inline string with the incorrect encoding, even with the &lt;code&gt;u8&lt;/code&gt; prefix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Don’t use char for memory array, use uint8_t&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In making code readable, you should only use &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;unsigned char*&lt;/code&gt; for strings (character arrays). If you want a block of bytes/memory pointer, then you should use &lt;code&gt;uint8_t*&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;uint8_t&lt;/code&gt; is part of &lt;code&gt;stdint.h&lt;/code&gt;. This makes the code much more readable where memory is represented as an unsighned 8-bit array of numbers (byte array). Now you can trust when you see a &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt; that it is referring to a UTF-8 (or ASCII) character array (text).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Use standard bool&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is easy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdbool.h&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t make defines for &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt; and it’s true counterpart, please just use the standard library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Don’t use static or global variables&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; functions are fine, they are great for breaking up functions to be readable. However, &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; variables are bad and almost always not needed. Remember that we are living in a world where our CPUs are not getting faster, they are just coming in larger quantities. Always think about threadability and controlling mutation. Even with a variable that is static to a &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; file and not global, you never know if someone is using threads to call your functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Prefer inline over macro&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Functions that are &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; are much more readable, work better with your IDE code searching, and are much more readable when you get errors/warnings from the compiler. Some macros are great, don’t ban them altogether, but do consider if you can do what you need through an inline function first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Test your functions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C is beautiful in the fact that you don’t need unit test frameworks to fully test your code. It’s lack of objects and hidden state make it even better for testing. If you create a function, make a test for it and give it your known test case arguments. Did I mention that I love not having to have a big complicated mocking library to fully test my code? If your function takes in a complicated struct for some reason, feel free to &lt;code&gt;define&lt;/code&gt; out/in a test function for creating the struct you expect to be testing (do NOT comprimise perfect encapsulation for the sake of testing).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Write functions to do one thing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, this isn’t a C only thing, but make sure your functions are not creating large call stacks. Feel free to use &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;static inline&lt;/code&gt; local functions to break up the readability of large functions if you just can’t seem to make functions do a single thing (for performance for example).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Don’t write systems, write modular pieces (think UNIX)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t write big complicated systems to cover many problems, even if things are losely related in many ways. It is better to break up your code into useful functional pieces and cleverly put them together to have complex behavior. The beauty of Unix is that you can get many things done through many small programs pieced together. In the same way, you should develop useful functions that can be pieced together through data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Warnings are errors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is a bit short. The idea is simple, warnings are errors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make sure ALL warnings are enabled (&lt;code&gt;/Wall&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Make sure that you turn on warnings as errors&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: If you copied some source code from the internet that you need and it is producing warnings, turn it into a lib and use the lib, do not comprimise your code for other people’s un-checked code. You’d be surprised how many popular libraries fail warnings as errors test (often they develop assuming 32-bit code).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;If there is a standard, use it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was touched on before with &lt;code&gt;stdbool.h&lt;/code&gt;, but if there is a standard function or type, use it. Use things like &lt;code&gt;int32_t&lt;/code&gt; over just &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; hoping that &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; will be 32-bit. If there is a standard function for doing something, don’t re-invent the wheel. Wrapping standard functions such as &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; I would consider a necessary evil if you are creating tools to detect memory leaks and the like though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Use float epsilon for 0 checking&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First of all, don’t check a floating point value against &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;0.0F&lt;/code&gt;. Instead check it against Epsilon like in the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;math.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;float.h&amp;gt;

int main(void)
{
	float x = 1.0F;
	x -= 1.0F;
	if (fabsf(x) &amp;lt;= FLT_EPSILON)
	{
		// ... The value is basically 0, do some stuff
	}
	return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alternatively you can choose a fractionally small number like &lt;code&gt;0.0001F&lt;/code&gt; to check against if that is your cup of tea as well. The reason is floating point precision errors (which you probably know or have heard of by now). I enjoy &lt;code&gt;FLT_EPSILON&lt;/code&gt; because it is part of the &lt;code&gt;float.h&lt;/code&gt; lib and a standard for everyone to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Zero Set Your Structs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing that would get me when developing in C is pointers inside of objects not being set to &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;. Now I know I speak about hating that the idea of &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; exists, but when working with other people’s code it is impossible for you not to run into a situation where you need to set a pointer to &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, pass a &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; or check a pointer against &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;. So do yourself a favor and always use &lt;code&gt;calloc&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;memset(&amp;amp;thing, 0, sizeof(thing))&lt;/code&gt; if it isn’t a pointer or new memory). Of course this doesn’t ban the use of &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;, in fact you should continue to use it on buffers, but as programmers, we have a problem with not touching code that works and you think it is fine to just add in that extra field, but if it is a pointer and you don’t initialize it to &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; where needed, you’re in for a world of hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Big types first&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you create a structure, put the biggest types at the top of your struct and the smallest types at the bottom. Platforms like the x86 will magically help you with this (at a cost), but other platforms (like ARM) will generate SEGFALT if you don’t properly do this. This is because of padding in a struct. If you put a &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt; as the first field and a &lt;code&gt;int32_t&lt;/code&gt; as the second field in a struct, like the one below, you will have a problem where you pack 1 byte, then 4 bytes into the struct, effectively having a 5 byte struct. The problem here is that the CPU is optimized to read along memory boundaries. When you &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;, you won’t get an odd memory address for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct Bad {
	bool first;
	int32_t second;
};

struct Good {
	int32_t first;
	bool second;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;More to come&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are inevitably more things I’ve forgotten about, but I’ve written this all in one sitting so this is good enough for now until I can update!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The GenAI bubble is going to pop. Everyone knows that. To me, the urgent and interesting questions are how widespread the damage will be and what the hangover will feel like. On that basis, I was going to post a link on Mastodon to Paul Krugman’s Talking With Paul Kedrosky. It’s great, but while I was reading it I thought “This is going to be Greek to people who haven’t been watching the bubble details.” So consider this a preface to the Krugman-Kedrosky piece. If you already know about the GPU-fragility and SPV-voodoo issues, just skip this and go read that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depreciation · When companies buy expensive stuff, for accounting purposes they pretend they haven’t spent the money; instead they “depreciate” it over a few years. That is to say, if you spent a million bucks on a piece of gear and decided to depreciate it over four years, your annual financials would show four annual charges of $250K. Management gets to pick your depreciation period, which provides a major opening for creative accounting when the boss wants to make things look better or worse than they are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even when you’re perfectly honest it can be hard to choose a fair figure. I can remember one of the big cloud vendors announcing they were going to change their fleet depreciation from three to four years and that having an impact on their share price.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depreciation is orderly whether or not it matches reality: anyone who runs a data center can tell you about racks with 20 systems in them that have been running fine since 2012. Still, orderly is good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the world of LLMs, depreciation is different. When you’re doing huge model-building tasks, you’re running those expensive GPUs flat out and red hot for days on end. Apparently they don’t like that, and flame out way more often than conventional computer equipment. Nobody who is doing this is willing to come clean with hard numbers but there are data points, for example from Meta and (very unofficially) Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So GPUs are apparently fragile. And they are expensive to run because they require huge amounts of electricity. More, in fact, than we currently have, which is why electrical bills are spiking here and there around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why does this matter? Because when the 19th-century railway bubble burst, we were left with railways. When the early-electrification bubble built, we were left with the grid. And when the dot-com bubble burst, we were left with a lot of valuable infrastructure whose cost was sunk, in particular dark fibre. The AI bubble? Not so much; What with GPU burnout and power charges, the infrastructure is going to be expensive to keep running, not something that new classes of application can pick up and use on the cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which suggests that the post-bubble hangover will have few bright spots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SPVs · This is a set of purely financial issues but I think they’re at the center of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s like this. The Big-Tech giants are insanely profitable but they don’t have enough money lying around to build the hundreds of billions of dollars worth of data centers the AI prophets say we’re going to need. Which shouldn’t be a problem; investors would line up to lend them as much as they want, because they’re pretty sure they’re going to get it back, plus interest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But apparently they don’t want to borrow the money and have the debts on their balance sheet. So they’re setting up “Special Purpose Vehicles”, synthetic companies that are going to build and own the data centers; the Big Techs promise to pay to use them, whether or not genAI pans out and whether or not the data centers become operational. Somehow, this doesn’t count as “debt”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The financial voodoo runs deep here. I recommend Matt Levine’s Coffee pod financing and the Financial Times’ A closer look at the record-smashing ‘Hyperion’ corporate bond sale. Levine’s explanation has less jargon and is hilarious; the FT is more technical but still likely to provoke horrified eye-rolls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think there’s a distinct odor of 2008 around all this, you’d be right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the genAI fanpholks are right, all the debt-only-don’t-call-it-that will be covered by profits and everyone can sleep sound. Only it won’t. Thus, either the debts will apply a meat-axe to Big Tech profits, or (like 2008) somehow they won’t be paid back. If whoever’s going to bite the dust is “too big to fail”, the money has to come from… somewhere? Taxpayers? Pension funds? Insurance companies?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paul K and Paul K · I think I’ve set that piece up enough now. It points out a few other issues that I think people should care about. I have one criticism: They argue that genAI won’t produce sufficient revenue from consumers to pay back the current investment frenzy. I mean, they’re right, it won’t, but that’s not what the investors are buying. They’re buying the promise, not of more revenue, but of higher profits that happen when tens of millions of knowledge workers are replaced by (presumably-cheaper) genAI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wonder who, after the loss of those tens of millions of high-paid jobs, are going to be the consumers who’ll buy the goods that’ll drive the profits that’ll pay back the investors. But that problem is kind of intrinsic to Late-stage Capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyhow, there will be a crash and a hangover. I think the people telling us that genAI is the future and we must pay it fealty richly deserve their impending financial wipe-out. But still, I hope the hangover is less terrible than I think it will be.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

What Was the Cost?</title><link>https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/12/15/oliver-sacks-put-himself-into-his-case-studies-what-was-the-cost</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="b6d197fda2b78777"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Oliver Sacks arrived in New York City, in September, 1965, he wore a butter-colored suit that reminded him of the sun. He had just spent a romantic week in Europe travelling with a man named Jenö Vincze, and he found himself walking too fast, fizzing with happiness. “My blood is champagne,” he wrote. He kept a letter Vincze had written him in his pocket all day, feeling as if its pages were glowing. Sacks had moved to New York to work as a fellow in neuropathology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, in the Bronx, and a colleague observed that he was “walking on air.” Every morning, he carefully polished his shoes and shaved. He adored his bosses. “I smile like a lighthouse in all directions,” he wrote Vincze.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks was thirty-two, and he told Vincze that this was his first romantic relationship that was both physical and reciprocal. He felt he was part of a “two man universe,” seeing the world for the first time—“seeing it clear, and seeing it whole.” He wandered along the shipping piers on the Hudson River, where gay men cruised, with a notebook that he treated as a diary and as an endless letter to Vincze. “To watch life with the eyes of a homosexual is the greatest thing in the world,” Vincze had once told Sacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks’s mother, a surgeon in London, had suspected that her son was gay when he was a teen-ager. She declared that homosexuality was an “abomination,” using the phrase “filth of the bowel” and telling him that she wished he’d never been born. They didn’t speak of the subject again. Sacks had moved to America—first to California and then, after five years, to New York—because, he wrote in his journal, “I wanted a sexual and moral freedom I felt I could never have in England.” That fall, during Yom Kippur, he decided that, rather than going to synagogue to confess “to the total range of human sin,” a ritual he’d grown up with, he’d spend the night at a bar, enjoying a couple of beers. “What I suppose I am saying, Jenö, is that I now feel differently about myself, and therefore about homosexuality as a whole,” he wrote. “I am through with cringing, and apologies, and pious wishes that I might have been ‘normal.’ ” (The Oliver Sacks Foundation shared with me his correspondence and other records, as well as four decades’ worth of journals—many of which had not been read since he wrote them.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In early October, Sacks sent two letters to Vincze, but a week passed without a reply. Sacks asked his colleagues to search their mailboxes, in case the letter had been put in the wrong slot. Within a few days, however, he had given up on innocent explanations. He began dressing sloppily. He stopped coming to work on time. He had sex with a series of men who disgusted him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After two weeks, Vincze, who was living in Berlin, sent a letter apologizing for his delayed reply and reiterating his love. He explained that he was so preoccupied by thoughts of Sacks that he felt as if he were living in a “Klaudur,” a German word that Vincze defined as a “spiritual cell.” He seems to have misspelled Klausur, which refers to an enclosed area in a monastery, but Sacks kept using the misspelled word, becoming obsessed with it. “It ramifies in horrible associations,” he wrote Vincze. “The closing of a door. Klaudur, claustrophobia, the sense of being shut in.” Sacks had long felt as if he were living in a cell, incapable of human contact, and this word appeared to be all he needed to confirm that the condition was terminal. The meaning of the word began morphing from “spiritual cell” to “psychotic cage.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The intimacy Sacks had rejoiced in now seemed phony, a “folie à deux”—a two-person delusion. His doubts intensified for a month, then he cut off the relationship. “I must tear you out of my system, because I dare not be involved,” he told Vincze, explaining that he barely remembered how he looked, or the sound of his voice. “I hope I will not be taken in like this again, and that—conversely—I will have the strength and clarity of mind to perceive any future such relationships as morbid at their inception, and to abort the folly of their further growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two months later, Sacks felt himself “slipping down the greased path of withdrawal, discontent, inability to make friends, inability to have sex, etc. etc. towards suicide in a New York apartment at the age of 32.” He took enormous amounts of amphetamines, to the point of hallucinating. A family friend, a psychiatrist who worked with Anna Freud, urged him to find a psychoanalyst. She wrote him that his homosexuality was “a very ‘secondary phenomenon’ ”: he was attracted to men as “a substitute for veering uncertainties of what/whom you could love other than as ‘idealizations’ of yourself.” A few weeks later, he started therapy with Leonard Shengold, a young psychiatrist who was deeply immersed in Manhattan’s psychoanalytic culture. “I think he is very good, and he has at least a very considerable local reputation,” Sacks wrote his parents, who helped to pay for the sessions, three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks had elevated yet hazy ambitions at the time: he wanted to be a novelist, but he also wanted to become the “Galileo of the inward,” he told a mentor, and to write the neurological equivalent of Sigmund Freud’s “Interpretation of Dreams.” He worked in wards with chronically ill and elderly patients who had been warehoused and neglected, and his prospects within academic medicine looked dim. “Have you published anything lately?” his father wrote him, in 1968. “Or have you found yourself temperamentally incapacitated from doing so?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Sacks began therapy, “my initial and ultimate complaint was of fixity—a feeling of not-going,” he wrote in his journal. He regarded Shengold as “a sort of analytic machine.” But gradually Sacks came to feel that “I love him, and need him; that I need him—and love him.” He had planned to stay in New York City only for a few years, but he kept delaying his return to England so that he could reach “a terminable point in my analysis.” Shengold, who would eventually publish ten books about psychoanalysis, wrote that therapy requires a “long period of working through”—a term he defined as the “need to repeat emotional conflicts over and over in life” until the patient has the “freedom to own what is there to be felt.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks saw Shengold for half a century. In that time, Sacks became one of the world’s most prominent neurologists and a kind of founding father of medical humanities—a discipline that coalesced in the seventies, linking healing with storytelling. But the freedom that Shengold’s analysis promised was elusive. After Vincze, Sacks did not have another relationship for forty-four years. He seemed to be doing the “working through” at a remove—again and again, his psychic conflicts were displaced onto the lives of his patients. He gave them “some of my own powers, and some of my phantasies too,” he wrote in his journal. “I write out symbolic versions of myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During Sacks’s neurology internship, in San Francisco, his childhood friend Eric Korn warned him that the residents at his hospital could sense he was gay. “For God’s sake, exercise what seems to you immoderate caution,” Korn wrote, in 1961. “Compartmentalize your life. Cover your tracks. Don’t bring in the wrong sort of guests to the hospital, or sign your name and address to the wrong sort of register.” He encouraged Sacks to read “Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life?,” a best-selling book by Edmund Bergler, who argued that homosexuality was an “illness as painful, as unpleasant and as disabling as any other serious affliction,” but one that psychoanalysis could cure. “The book is full of interest,” Korn wrote. “He claims a potential 100% ‘cures’ (a term he chooses to employ because he knows it teases) which is worth investigating perhaps.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Freud characterized homosexuality as a relatively normal variant of human behavior, but when psychoanalysis came to the United States, in the postwar years, homophobia took on new life. The historian Dagmar Herzog has described how, in the U.S., “reinventing psychoanalysis and reinventing homophobia went hand in hand.” Faced with men who persisted in their love for other men, American analysts commonly proposed celibacy as a stopgap solution. In the historian Martin Duberman’s memoir “Cures,” he writes that his psychoanalyst instructed him to “take the veil”—live celibately—so that he could be cured of his desire for men. Duberman agreed to these terms. The best he could get, he thought, was sublimation: instead of enjoying an “affective life,” he would make “some contribution to the general culture from which I was effectively barred.” Sacks, who was closeted until he was eighty, also followed this course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shengold had portraits of Charles Dickens, William Shakespeare, and Sigmund Freud in his office, on the Upper East Side. Like Sacks, he came from a literary Jewish family. He seemed deeply attuned to Sacks’s creative life, which took the form of ecstatic surges of literary inspiration followed by months of sterility and depression. “Do your best to enjoy and to work—it is the power of your mind that is crucial,” Shengold wrote when Sacks was on a visit with his family in England. Sacks wrote in his journal that he’d dreamed he overheard Shengold telling someone, “Oliver is lacking in proper self-respect; he has never really appreciated himself, or appreciated others’ appreciation of him. And yet, in his way, he is not less gifted than Auden was.” Sacks woke up flushed with embarrassment and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike many of his contemporaries, Shengold was not a doctrinaire thinker, but he was still susceptible to psychoanalytic fashions. Reflecting on how he might have viewed living openly as a gay man at that time, Shengold’s daughter, Nina, told me, “I don’t know that was a door that Dad necessarily had wide open.” In several books and papers, Shengold, a prolific reader of Western literature, tried to understand the process by which troubled people sublimate their conflicts into art. In his 1988 book, “Halo in the Sky: Observations on Anality and Defense,” Shengold wrote about the importance of transforming “anal-sadistic drives”—he used the anus as a metaphor for primitive, dangerous impulses—into “adaptive and creative ‘making.’ ” When Sacks read the book, he wrote in his journal that it “made me feel I was ‘lost in anality’ (whatever this means).”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before Vincze, Sacks had been in love with a man named Mel Erpelding, who once told him, Sacks wrote, that he “oozed sexuality, that it poured out through every pore, that I was alive and vibrant with sexuality (a positive-admiring way of putting things), but also that I was reeking and toxic with it.” (Erpelding, who ended up marrying a woman, never allowed his relationship with Sacks to become sexual.) In his early years of therapy, in the late sixties, Sacks resolved that he would give up both drugs and sex. It’s doubtful that Shengold encouraged his celibacy, but he may have accepted that sexual abstinence could be productive, at least for a time. Richard Isay, the first openly gay member of the American Psychoanalytic Association, said that, in the seventies, he’d “rationalized that maturity and mental health demanded the sublimation of sexual excitement in work.” Sacks told a friend, “Shengold is fond of quoting Flaubert’s words ‘the mind has its erections too.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Sacks, writing seemed almost physiological, like sweating—an involuntary response to stimuli. He routinely filled a whole journal in two days. “Should I then put down my pen, my interminable Journal (for this is but a fragment of the journal I have kept all my life),” he asked, “and ‘start living’ instead?” The answer was almost always no. Sometimes Sacks, who would eventually publish sixteen books, wrote continuously in his journal for six hours. Even when he was driving his car, he was still writing—he set up a tape recorder so that he could keep developing his thoughts, which were regularly interrupted by traffic or a wrong turn. Driving through Manhattan one day in 1975, he reflected on the fact that his closets, stuffed with pages of writing, resembled a “grave bursting open.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the late sixties, Sacks had become, he wrote, “almost a monk in my asceticism and devotion to work.” He estimated that he produced a million and a half words a year. When he woke up in the middle of the night with an erection, he would cool his penis by putting it in orange jello. He told Erpelding, “I partly accept myself as a celibate and a cripple, but partly—and this is . . . the wonder of sublimation—am able to transform my erotic feelings into other sorts of love—love for my patients, my work, art, thought.” He explained, “I keep my distance from people, am always courteous, never close. For me (as perhaps for you) there is almost no room, no moral room.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I have some hard ‘confessing’ to do—if not in public, at least to Shengold—and myself,” Sacks wrote in his journal, in 1985. By then, he had published four books—“Migraine,” “Awakenings,” “A Leg to Stand On,” and “The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat”—establishing his reputation as “our modern master of the case study,” as the Times put it. He rejected what he called “pallid, abstract knowing,” and pushed medicine to engage more deeply with patients’ interiority and how it interacted with their diseases. Medical schools began creating programs in medical humanities and “narrative medicine,” and a new belief took hold: that an ill person has lost narrative coherence, and that doctors, if they attend to their patients’ private struggles, could help them reconstruct a new story of their lives. At Harvard Medical School, for a time, students were assigned to write a “book” about a patient. Stories of illness written by physicians (and by patients) began proliferating, to the point that the medical sociologist Arthur Frank noted, “ ‘Oliver Sacks’ now designates not only a specific physician author but also a . . . genre—a distinctively recognizable form of storytelling.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, in his journal, Sacks wrote that “a sense of hideous criminality remains (psychologically) attached” to his work: he had given his patients “powers (starting with powers of speech) which they do not have.” Some details, he recognized, were “pure fabrications.” He tried to reassure himself that the exaggerations did not come from a shallow place, such as a desire for fame or attention. “The impulse is both ‘purer’—and deeper,” he wrote. “It is not merely or wholly a projection—nor (as I have sometimes, ingeniously-disingenuously, maintained) a mere ‘sensitization’ of what I know so well in myself. But (if you will) a sort of autobiography.” He called it “symbolic ‘exo-graphy.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks had “misstepped in this regard, many many times, in ‘Awakenings,’ ” he wrote in another journal entry, describing it as a “source of severe, long-lasting, self-recrimination.” In the book, published in 1973, he startled readers with the depth of his compassion for some eighty patients at Beth Abraham Hospital, in the Bronx, who had survived an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica, a mysterious, often fatal virus that appeared around the time of the First World War. The patients had been institutionalized for decades, in nearly catatonic states. At the time, the book was met with silence or skepticism by other neurologists—Sacks had presented his findings in a form that could not be readily replicated, or extrapolated from—but, to nonspecialists, it was a masterpiece of medical witnessing. The Guardian would name it the twelfth-best nonfiction book of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks spent up to fifteen hours a day with his patients, one of the largest groups of post-encephalitic survivors in the world. They were “mummified,” like “living statues,” he observed. A medicine called L-dopa, which elevates the brain’s dopamine levels, was just starting to be used for Parkinson’s disease, on an experimental basis, and Sacks reasoned that his patients, whose symptoms resembled those of Parkinson’s, could benefit from the drug. In 1969, within days of giving his patients the medication, they suddenly “woke up,” their old personalities intact. Other doctors had dismissed these patients as hopeless, but Sacks had sensed that they still had life in them—a recognition that he understood was possible because he, too, felt as if he were “buried alive.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In “Awakenings,” Sacks writes about his encounters with a man he calls Leonard L. “What’s it like being the way you are?” Sacks asks him the first time they meet. “Caged,” Leonard replies, by pointing to letters of the alphabet on a board. “Deprived. Like Rilke’s ‘Panther’ ”—a reference to a poem by Rainer Maria Rilke about a panther pacing repetitively in cramped circles “around a center / in which a mighty will stands paralyzed.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Sacks was struggling to write his first book, “Migraine,” he told a friend that he felt like “Rilke’s image of the caged panther, stupefied, dying, behind bars.” In a letter to Shengold, he repeated this image. When Sacks met Leonard, he jotted down elegant observations in his chart (“Quick and darting eye movements are at odds with his general petrified immobility”), but there is no mention of Leonard invoking the Rilke poem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the preface to “Awakenings,” Sacks acknowledges that he changed circumstantial details to protect his patients’ privacy but preserved “what is important and essential—the real and full presence of the patients themselves.” Sacks characterizes Leonard as a solitary figure even before his illness: he was “continually buried in books, and had few or no friends, and indulged in none of the sexual, social, or other activities common to boys of his age.” But, in an autobiography that Leonard wrote after taking L-dopa, he never mentions reading or writing or being alone in those years. In fact, he notes that he spent all his time with his two best friends—“We were inseparable,” he writes. He also recalls raping several people. “We placed our cousin over a chair, pulled down her pants and inserted our penises into the crack,” he writes on the third page, in the tone of an aging man reminiscing on better days. By page 10, he is describing how, when he babysat two girls, he made one of them strip and then “leaped on her. I tossed her on her belly and pulled out my penis and placed it between her buttocks and started to screw her.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In “Awakenings,” Sacks has cleansed his patient’s history of sexuality. He depicts him as a man of “most unusual intelligence, cultivation, and sophistication”—the “ ‘ideal’ patient.” L-dopa may have made Leonard remember his childhood in a heightened sexual register—his niece and nephew, who visited him at the hospital until his death, in 1981, told me that the drug had made him very sexual. But they said that he had been a normal child and adolescent, not a recluse who renounced human entanglement for a life of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks finished writing “Awakenings” rapidly in the weeks after burying his mother, who’d died suddenly, at the age of seventy-seven. He felt “a great open torrent—and release,” he wrote in his journal. “It seems to be surely significant that ‘Awakenings’ finally came forth from me like a cry after the death of my own mother.” He referred to the writing of the book as his “Great Awakening,” the moment he “came out.” He doesn’t mention another event of significance: his patients had awakened during the summer of the Stonewall riots, the beginning of the gay-rights movement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shengold once told Sacks that he had “never met anyone less affected by gay liberation.” (Shengold supported his own son when he came out as gay, in the eighties.) Sacks agreed with the characterization. “I remain resolutely locked in my cell despite the dancing at the prison gates,” he said, in 1984.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In “Awakenings,” his patients are at first overjoyed by their freedom; then their new vitality becomes unbearable. As they continue taking L-dopa, many of them are consumed by insatiable desires. “L-DOPA is wanton, egotistical power,” Leonard says in the book. He injures his penis twice and tries to suffocate himself with a pillow. Another patient is so aroused and euphoric that she tells Sacks, “My blood is champagne”—the phrase Sacks used to describe himself when he was in love with Vincze. Sacks begins tapering his patients’ L-dopa, and taking some of them off of it completely. The book becomes a kind of drama about dosage: an examination of how much aliveness is tolerable, and at what cost. Some side effects of L-dopa, like involuntary movements and overactivity, have been well documented, but it’s hard not to wonder if “Awakenings” exaggerates the psychological fallout—Leonard becomes so unmanageable that the hospital moves him into a “punishment cell”—as if Sacks is reassuring himself that free rein of the libido cannot be sustained without grim consequence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After “Awakenings,” Sacks intended his next book to be about his work with young people in a psychiatric ward at Bronx State Hospital who had been institutionalized since they were children. The environment reminded Sacks of a boarding school where he had been sent, between the ages of six and nine, during the Second World War. He was one of four hundred thousand children evacuated from London without their parents, and he felt abandoned. He was beaten by the headmaster and bullied by the other boys. The ward at Bronx State “exerted a sort of spell on me,” Sacks wrote in his journal, in 1974. “I lost my footing of proper sympathy and got sucked, so to speak, into an improper ‘perilous condition’ of identification to the patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shengold wrote several papers and books about a concept he called “soul murder”—a category of childhood trauma that induces “a hypnotic living-deadness, a state of existing ‘as if’ one were there.” Sacks planned to turn his work at Bronx State into a book about “ ‘SOUL MURDER’ and ‘SOUL SURVIVAL,’ ” he wrote. He was especially invested in two young men on the ward whom he thought he was curing. “The miracle-of-recovery started to occur in and through their relation to me (our relation and feelings to each other, of course),” he wrote in his journal. “We had to meet in a passionate subjectivity, a sort of collaboration or communication which transcended the Socratic relation of teacher-and-pupil.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a spontaneous creative burst lasting three weeks, Sacks wrote twenty-four essays about his work at Bronx State which he believed had the “beauty, the intensity, of Revelation . . . as if I was coming to know, once again, what I knew as a child, that sense of Dearness and Trust I had lost for so long.” But in the ward he sensed a “dreadful silent tension.” His colleagues didn’t understand the attention he was lavishing on his patients—he got a piano and a Ping-Pong table for them and took one patient to the botanical garden. Their suspicion, he wrote in his journal, “centred on the unbearability of my uncategorizability.” As a middle-aged man living alone—he had a huge beard and dressed eccentrically, sometimes wearing a black leather shirt—Sacks was particularly vulnerable to baseless innuendo. In April, 1974, he was fired. There had been rumors that he was molesting some of the boys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That night, Sacks tore up his essays and then burned them. “Spite! Hate! Hateful spite!” he wrote in his journal shortly after. “And now I am empty—empty handed, empty hearted, desolate.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The series of events was so distressing that even writing about it in his journal made Sacks feel that he was about to die. He knew that he should shrug off the false accusations as “vile idle gossip thrown by tiddlers and piddlers,” he wrote. But he couldn’t, because of “the parental accusation which I have borne—a Kafka-esque cross, guilt without crime, since my earliest days.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The historian of medicine Henri Ellenberger observed that psychiatry owes its development to two intertwined dynamics: the neuroses of its founders—in trying to master their own conflicts, they came to new insights and forms of therapy—and the prolonged, ambiguous relationships they had with their patients. The case studies of these relationships, Ellenberger wrote, tended to have a distinct arc: psychiatrists had to unravel their patients’ “pathogenic secret,” a hidden source of hopelessness, in order to heal them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks’s early case studies also tended to revolve around secrets, but wonderful ones. Through his care, his patients realized that they had hidden gifts—for music, painting, writing—that could restore to them a sense of wholeness. The critic Anatole Broyard, recounting his cancer treatment in the Times Magazine in 1990, wrote that he longed for a charismatic, passionate physician, skilled in “empathetic witnessing.” In short, he wrote, a doctor who “would resemble Oliver Sacks.” He added, “He would see the genius of my illness.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It speaks to the power of the fantasy of the magical healer that readers and publishers accepted Sacks’s stories as literal truth. In a letter to one of his three brothers, Marcus, Sacks enclosed a copy of “The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,” which was published in 1985, calling it a book of “fairy tales.” He explained that “these odd Narratives—half-report, half-imagined, half-science, half-fable, but with a fidelity of their own—are what I do, basically, to keep MY demons of boredom and loneliness and despair away.” He added that Marcus would likely call them “confabulations”—a phenomenon Sacks explores in a chapter about a patient who could retain memories for only a few seconds and must “make meaning, in a desperate way, continually inventing, throwing bridges of meaning over abysses,” but the “bridges, the patches, for all their brilliance . . . cannot do service for reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks was startled by the success of the book, which he had dedicated to Shengold, “my own mentor and physician.” It became an international best-seller, routinely assigned in medical schools. Sacks wrote in his journal,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He pondered the phrase “art is the lie that tells the truth,” often attributed to Picasso, but he seemed unconvinced. “I think I have to thrash this out with Shengold—it is killing me, soul-killing me,” he wrote. “My ‘cast of characters’ (for this is what they become) take on an almost Dickensian quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks once told a reporter that he hoped to be remembered as someone who “bore witness”—a term often used within medicine to describe the act of accompanying patients in their most vulnerable moments, rather than turning away. To bear witness is to recognize and respond to suffering that would otherwise go unseen. But perhaps bearing witness is incompatible with writing a story about it. In his journal, after a session with a patient with Tourette’s syndrome, Sacks describes the miracle of being “enabled to ‘feel’—that is, to imagine, with all the powers of my head and heart—how it felt to be another human being.” Empathy tends to be held up as a moral end point, as if it exists as its own little island of good work. And yet it is part of a longer transaction, and it is, fundamentally, a projection. A writer who imagines what it’s like to exist as another person must then translate that into his own idiom—a process that Sacks makes particularly literal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’ll tell you what you are saying,” Sacks told a woman with an I.Q. of around 60 whose grandmother had just died. “You want to go down below and join your dead grandparents down in the Kingdom of Death.” In the conversation, which Sacks recorded, the patient becomes more expressive under the rare glow of her doctor’s sustained attention, and it’s clear that she is fond of him. But he is so excited about her words (“One feels that she is voicing universal symbols,” he says in a recording, “symbols which are infinite in meaning”) that he usurps her experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I know, in a way, you don’t feel like living,” Sacks tells her, in another recorded session. “Part of one feels dead inside, I know, I know that. . . . One feels that one wants to die, one wants to end it, and what’s the use of going on?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I don’t mean it in that way,” she responds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I know, but you do, partly,” Sacks tells her. “I know you have been lonely all your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The woman’s story is told, with details altered, in a chapter in “Hat” titled “Rebecca.” In the essay, Rebecca is transformed by grief for her grandmother. She reminds Sacks of Chekhov’s Nina, in “The Seagull,” who longs to be an actress. Though Nina’s life is painful and disappointing, at the end of the play her suffering gives her depth and strength. Rebecca, too, ends the story in full flower. “Rather suddenly, after her grandmother’s death,” Sacks writes, she becomes decisive, joining a theatre group and appearing to him as “a complete person, poised, fluent,” a “natural poet.” The case study is presented as an ode to the power of understanding a patient’s life as a narrative, not as a collection of symptoms. But in the transcripts of their conversations—at least the ones saved from the year that followed, as well as Sacks’s journals from that period—Rebecca never joins a theatre group or emerges from her despair. She complains that it’s “better that I shouldn’t have been born,” that she is “useless,” “good for nothing,” and Sacks vehemently tries to convince her that she’s not. Instead of bearing witness to her reality, he reshapes it so that she, too, awakens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of the most prominent nonfiction writers of Sacks’s era (Joseph Mitchell, A. J. Liebling, Ryszard Kapuściński) also took liberties with the truth, believing that they had a higher purpose: to illuminate the human condition. Sacks was writing in that spirit, too, but in a discipline that depends on reproducible findings. The “most flagrant example” of his distortions, Sacks wrote in his journal, was in one of the last chapters of “Hat,” titled “The Twins,” about twenty-six-year-old twins with autism who had been institutionalized since they were seven. They spend their days reciting numbers, which they “savored, shared” while “closeted in their numerical communion.” Sacks lingers near them, jotting down the numbers, and eventually realizes that they are all prime. As a child, Sacks used to spend hours alone, trying to come up with a formula for prime numbers, but, he wrote, “I never found any Law or Pattern for them—and this gave me an intense feeling of Terror, Pleasure, and—Mystery.” Delighted by the twins’ pastime, Sacks comes to the ward with a book of prime numbers which he’d loved as a child. After offering his own prime number, “they drew apart slightly, making room for me, a new number playmate, a third in their world.” Having apparently uncovered the impossible algorithm that Sacks had once wished for, the twins continue sharing primes until they’re exchanging ones with twenty digits. The scene reads like a kind of dream: he has discovered that human intimacy has a decipherable structure, and identified a hidden pattern that will allow him to finally join in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before Sacks met them, the twins had been extensively studied because of their capacity to determine the day of the week on which any date in the calendar fell. In the sixties, two papers in the American Journal of Psychiatry provided detailed accounts of the extent of their abilities. Neither paper mentioned a gift for prime numbers or math. When Sacks wrote Alexander Luria, a Russian neuropsychologist, about his work with the twins, in 1973, he also did not mention any special mathematical skills. In 2007, a psychologist with a background in learning theory published a short article in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, challenging Sacks’s assertion that these twins could spontaneously generate large prime numbers. Because this is not something that humans can reliably do, Sacks’s finding had been widely cited, and was theoretically “important for not only psychologists but also for all scientists and mathematicians,” the psychologist wrote. (The psychologist had contacted Sacks to ask for the title of his childhood book of prime numbers, because he couldn’t find a book of that description, but Sacks said that it had been lost.) Without pointing to new evidence, another scientist wrote in Sacks’s defense, describing his case study as “the most compelling account of savant numerosity skills” and arguing, “This is an example of science at the frontier, requiring daring to advance new interpretations of partial data.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the publication of “Hat,” when Sacks was fifty-two years old, he wrote his friend Robert Rodman, a psychoanalyst, that “Shengold suggested, with some hesitancy, some months ago, that I should consider going deeper with him.” He added, “He also observes that I don’t complain, say, of sexual deprivation—though this is absolute.” At first, Sacks was worried that Shengold was preparing to dismiss him from treatment: “I’ve done all I can for you—now manage on your own!” Then he felt hopeful that he didn’t need to assume that “boredom-depression-loneliness-cutoffness” would define the rest of his life. He was also moved that, after twenty years, Shengold still considered him “worth extra work.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Sacks was shaken by the idea that they’d only been skimming the surface. He looked back through his notebooks and noticed “a perceptible decline in concern and passion,” which he felt had also dulled the quality of his thought. “Is the superficiality of my work, then, due to superficiality of relationships—to running away from whatever has deeper feeling and meaning?” he asked Rodman. “Is this perhaps spoken of, in a camouflaged way, when I describe the ‘superficialization’ of various patients?” As an example, he referenced an essay in “Hat” about a woman with a cerebral tumor. She was intelligent and amusing but seemed not to care about anyone. “Was this the ‘cover’ of some unbearable emotion?” he writes in the essay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks felt that Shengold was the reason he was still alive, and that he should go further with him. “What have I to lose?” he asked Rodman. But, he wrote, “what one has to lose, of course, may be just that quasi-stable if fragile ‘functioning’ . . . so there is reason to hesitate.” Going deeper would also mean more fully submitting to someone else’s interpretation, experiencing what he asked of his own patients; Rodman proposed that Sacks was “afraid of the enclosure of analysis, of being reduced and fixed with a formulated phrase.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the early eighties, Lawrence Weschler, then a writer for The New Yorker, began working on a biography of Sacks. Weschler came to feel that Sacks’s homosexuality was integral to his work, but Sacks didn’t want his sexuality mentioned at all, and eventually asked him to stop the project. “I have lived a life wrapped in concealment and wracked by inhibition, and I can’t see that changing now,” he told Weschler. In his journal, Sacks jotted down thoughts to share with Weschler on the subject: “My ‘sex life’ (or lack of it) is, in a sense irrelevant to the . . . sweep of my mind.” In another entry, he wrote that the Freudian term “sublimation” diminished the process he’d undergone. When he was still having sex, as a young man in California, he used to sheath his body in leather gear, so he was “totally encased, enclosed,” his real self sealed in a kind of “black box.” He wrote, “I have, in a sense, ‘outgrown’ these extraordinary, almost convulsive compulsions—but this detachment has been made possible by incorporating them into a vast and comprehending view of the world.” (Weschler became close friends with Sacks, and, after Sacks died, published a “biographical memoir” titled “And How Are You, Dr. Sacks?”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s unclear whether Sacks did “go deeper” with Shengold. In the late eighties, Sacks wrote in his journal that he was “scared, horrified (but, in an awful way, accepting or complaisant) about my non-life.” He likened himself to a “pithed and gutted creature.” Rather than living, he was managing a kind of “homeostasis.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1987, Sacks had an intense friendship with a psychiatrist named Jonathan Mueller, with whom he briefly fell in love. Mueller, who was married to a woman, told me that he did not realize Sacks had romantic feelings for him. Sacks eventually moved on. But he felt that the experience had altered him. “I can read ‘love stories’ with empathy and understanding—I can ‘enter into them’ in a way which was impossible before,” he wrote in his journal. He perceived, in a new light, what it meant for his patients in “Awakenings” to glimpse the possibility of “liberation”: like him, he wrote, they were seeking “not merely a cure but an indemnification for the loss of their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the nineties, Sacks seemed to ask less of himself, emotionally, in relation to his patients. He had started working with Kate Edgar, who’d begun as his assistant but eventually edited his writing, organized his daily life, and became a close friend. (Shengold had encouraged Sacks to find someone to assist with his work. “The secretary is certainly an important ‘ego-auxiliary,’ ” he wrote him in a letter.) Edgar was wary about the way Sacks quoted his patients—they were suspiciously literary, she thought—and she checked to make sure he wasn’t getting carried away. She spent hours with some of his patients, and, she told me, “I never caught him in anything like that, which actually surprises me.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weschler told me that Sacks used to express anxiety about whether he’d distorted the truth. Weschler would assure him that good writing is not a strict account of reality; there has to be space for the writer’s imagination. He said he told Sacks, “Come on, you’re extravagantly romanticizing how bad you are—just as much as you were extravagantly romanticizing what the patient said. Your mother’s accusing voice has taken over.” Weschler had gone to Beth Abraham Hospital to meet some of the patients from “Awakenings” and had been shaken by their condition. “There’s a lot of people shitting in their pants, drooling—the sedimentation of thirty years living in a warehouse,” he said. “His genius was to see past that, to the dignity of the person. He would talk to them for an hour, and maybe their eyes would brighten only once—the rest of the time their eyes were cloudy—but he would glom onto that and keep talking.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After “Hat,” Sacks’s relationship with his subjects became more mediated. Most of them were not his patients; many wrote to him after reading his work, recognizing themselves in his books. There was a different power dynamic, because these people already believed that they had stories to tell. Perhaps the guilt over liberties he had taken in “Hat” caused him to curb the impulse to exaggerate. His expressions of remorse over “making up, ‘enhancing,’ etc,” which had appeared in his journals throughout the seventies and eighties, stopped. In his case studies, he used fewer and shorter quotes. His patients were far more likely to say ordinary, banal things, and they rarely quoted literature. They still had secret gifts, but they weren’t redeemed by them; they were just trying to cope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In “An Anthropologist on Mars,” from 1992, a book of case studies about people compensating for, and adapting to, neurological conditions, some of the richest passages are the ones in which Sacks allows his incomprehension to become part of the portrait. In a chapter called “Prodigies,” he wants badly to connect with a thirteen-year-old boy named Stephen, who is autistic and has an extraordinary ability to draw, but Stephen resists Sacks’s attempts at intimacy. He will not allow himself to be romanticized, a refusal that Sacks ultimately accepts: “Is Stephen, or his autism, changed by his art? Here, I think, the answer is no.” In this new mode, Sacks is less inclined to replace Stephen’s unknowable experience with his own fantasy of it. He is open about the discomfort, and even embarrassment, of his multiple failures to reach him: “I had hoped, perhaps sentimentally, for some depth of feeling from him; my heart had leapt at the first ‘Hullo, Oliver!’ but there had been no follow-up.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mort Doran, a surgeon with Tourette’s syndrome whom Sacks profiled in “Anthropologist,” told me that he was happy with the way Sacks had rendered his life. He said that only one detail was inaccurate—Sacks had written that the brick wall of Doran’s kitchen was marked from Doran hitting it during Tourette’s episodes. “I thought, Why would he embellish that? And then I thought, Maybe that’s just what writers do.” Doran never mentioned the error to Sacks. He was grateful that Sacks “had the gravitas to put it out there to the rest of the world and say, ‘These people aren’t all nuts or deluded. They’re real people.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The wife in the title story of “Hat” had privately disagreed with Sacks about the portrayal of her husband, but for the most part Sacks appeared to have had remarkable relationships with his patients, corresponding with them for years. A patient called Ray, the subject of a 1981 piece about Tourette’s syndrome, told me that Sacks came to his son’s wedding years after his formal treatment had ended. Recalling Sacks’s death, he found himself suddenly crying. “Part of me left,” he said. “Part of my self was gone.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A year after “Awakenings” was published, Sacks broke his leg in Norway, and Leonard L. and his mother wrote him a get-well letter. Thirty-two patients added their names, their signatures wavering. “Everybody had been counting the days for your return, so you can imagine the turmoil when they heard the news,” Leonard’s mother wrote. She explained that “most of the patients are not doing so well without your help and interest.” She added that Leonard “isn’t doing too well either.” When Leonard learned that Sacks wouldn’t be back, she said, “he shed enough tears to fill a bucket.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks spoke of “animating” his patients, as if lending them some of his narrative energy. After living in the forgotten wards of hospitals, in a kind of narrative void, perhaps his patients felt that some inaccuracies were part of the exchange. Or maybe they thought, That’s just what writers do. Sacks established empathy as a quality every good doctor should possess, enshrining the ideal through his stories. But his case studies, and the genre they helped inspire, were never clear about what they exposed: the ease with which empathy can slide into something too creative, or invasive, or possessive. Therapists—and writers—inevitably see their subjects through the lens of their own lives, in ways that can be both generative and misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his journal, reflecting on his work with Tourette’s patients, Sacks described his desire to help their illness “reach fruition,” so that they would become floridly symptomatic. “With my help and almost my collusion, they can extract the maximum possible from their sickness—maximum of knowledge, insight, courage,” he wrote. “Thus I will FIRST help them to get ill, to experience their illness with maximum intensity; and then, only then, will I help them get well!” On the next line, he wrote, “IS THIS MONSTROUS?” The practice came from a sense of awe, not opportunism, but he recognized that it made him complicit, as if their illness had become a collaboration. “An impulse both neurotic and intellectual (artistic) makes me get the most out of suffering,” he wrote. His approach set the template for a branch of writing and thinking that made it seem as if the natural arc of illness involved insight and revelation, and even some poetry, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his journals, Sacks repeatedly complained that his life story was over. He had the “feeling that I have stopped doing, that doing has stopped, that life itself has stopped, that it is petering out in a sort of twilight of half-being,” he wrote, in 1987. His journals convey a sense of tangible boredom. He transcribed long passages from philosophers and theologists (Simone Weil, Søren Kierkegaard, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Dietrich Bonhoeffer) and embarked on disquisitions on the best definition of reality, the “metabolism of grace,” the “deep mystery of incubation.” His thoughts cast outward in many directions—notes for a thousand lectures—then tunnelled inward to the point of non-meaning. “Where Life is Free, Immaterial, full of Art,” he wrote, “the laws of life, of Grace, are those of Fitness.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks proposed various theories for why he had undergone what he called “psychic death.” He wondered if he had become too popular, merely a fuzzy symbol of compassionate care. “Good old Sacks—the House Humanist,” he wrote, mocking himself. He also considered the idea that his four decades of analysis were to blame. Was it possible, he wrote, that a “vivisection of inner life, however conceived, however subtle and delicate, may in fact destroy the very thing it examines?” His treatment with Shengold seemed to align with a life of “homeostasis”—intimacy managed through more and more language, in a contained, sterile setting, on Monday and Wednesday mornings, from 6:00 to 6:45 A.M. They still referred to each other as “Dr. Sacks” and “Dr. Shengold.” Once, they ran into each other at a chamber concert. They were a few rows apart, but they didn’t interact. Occasionally, Shengold told his children that he “heard from the couch” about a good movie or play, but he never shared what happened in his sessions. They inferred that Sacks was their father’s patient after reading the dedication to him in “Hat.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Sacks aged, he felt as if he were gazing at people from the outside. But he also noticed a new kind of affection for humans—“homo sap.” “They’re quite complex (little) creatures (I say to myself),” he wrote in his journal. “They suffer, authentically, a good deal. Gifted, too. Brave, resourceful, challenging.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perhaps because love no longer appeared to be a realistic risk—he had now entered a “geriatric situation”—Sacks could finally confess that he craved it. “I keep being stabbed by love,” he wrote in his journal. “A look. A glance. An expression. A posture.” He guessed that he had at least five, possibly ten, more years to live. “I want to, I want to ••• I dare not say. At least not in writing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2008, Sacks had lunch with Bill Hayes, a forty-seven-year-old writer from San Francisco who was visiting New York. Hayes had never considered Sacks’s sexuality, but, as soon as they began talking, he thought, “Oh, my God, he’s gay,” he told me. They lingered at the table for much of the afternoon, connecting over their insomnia, among other subjects. After the meal, Sacks wrote Hayes a letter (which he never sent) explaining that relationships had been “a ‘forbidden’ area for me—although I am entirely sympathetic to &lt;del&gt;(indeed wistful and perhaps envious about)&lt;/del&gt; other people’s relationships.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A year later, Hayes, whose partner of seventeen years had died of a heart attack, moved to New York. He and Sacks began spending time together. At Sacks’s recommendation, Hayes started keeping a journal, too. He often wrote down his exchanges with Sacks, some of which he later published in a memoir, “Insomniac City.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s really a question of mutuality, isn’t it?” Sacks asked him, two weeks after they had declared their feelings for each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Love?” Hayes responded. “Are you talking about love?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Yes,” Sacks replied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sacks began taking Hayes to dinner parties, although he introduced him as “my friend Billy.” He did not allow physical affection in public. “Sometimes this issue of not being out became very difficult,” Hayes told me. “We’d have arguments, and I’d say things like ‘Do you and Shengold ever talk about why you can’t come out? Or is all you ever talk about your dreams?’ ” Sacks wrote down stray phrases from his dreams on a whiteboard in his kitchen so that he could report on them at his sessions, but he didn’t share what happened in therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kate Edgar, who worked for Sacks for three decades, had two brothers who were gay, and for years she had advocated for gay civil rights, organizing Pride marches for her son’s school. She intentionally found an office for Sacks in the West Village so that he would be surrounded by gay men living openly and could see how normal it had become. She tended to hire gay assistants for him, for the same reason. “So I was sort of plotting on that level for some years,” she told me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2013, after being in a relationship with Hayes for four years—they lived in separate apartments in the same building—Sacks began writing a memoir, “On the Move,” in which he divulged his sexuality for the first time. He recounts his mother’s curses upon learning that he was gay, and his decades of celibacy—a fact he mentions casually, without explanation. Edgar wondered why, after so many years of analysis, coming out took him so long, but, she said, “Oliver did not regard his relationship with Shengold as a failure of therapy.” She said that she’d guessed Shengold had thought, “This is something Oliver has to do in his own way, on his own time.” Shengold’s daughter, Nina, said that, “for my dad to have a patient he loved and respected finally find comfort in identifying who he’d been all his life—that’s growth for both of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few weeks after finishing the manuscript, Sacks, who’d had melanoma of the eye in 2005, learned that the cancer had come back, spreading to his liver, and that he had only months to live. He had tended toward hypochondria all his life, and Edgar thought that the diagnosis might induce a state of chronic panic. Since he was a child, Sacks had had a horror of losing things, even irrelevant objects. He would be overcome by the “feeling that there was a hole in the world,” he wrote in his journal, and the fear that “I might somehow fall through that hole-in-the-world, and be absolutely, inconceivably lost.” Edgar had dealt for decades with his distress over lost objects, but she noticed that now, when he misplaced things, he didn’t get upset. He had an uncharacteristic ease of being.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2015, before Shengold went on his annual summer break, Sacks said to Edgar, “If I’m alive in September when Shengold returns, I’m not sure I need to go back to my sessions.” They had been seeing each other for forty-nine years. Sacks was eighty-two; Shengold was eighty-nine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Sacks was struggling with his third book, “A Leg to Stand On,” which was about breaking his leg and his frustration that his doctors wouldn’t listen to him, he wrote in his journal that Shengold had suggested (while apologizing for the corniness of the phrase) that the book should be “a message of love”—a form of protest against the indifference that so many patients find in their doctors. Shengold may have been giving Sacks permission to see their own relationship—the one place in which Sacks felt an enduring sense of recognition and care—as a hidden subject of the book. Extending Shengold’s idea, Sacks wrote, of his book, “The ‘moral’ center has to do with . . . the irreducible ultimate in doctor-patient relations.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In August, two weeks before Sacks died, he and Shengold spoke on the phone. Shengold was with his family at a cottage in the Finger Lakes region of central New York, where he spent every summer. Nina told me, “We all gathered in the living room of that little cottage and put my father on speakerphone. Oliver Sacks was clearly on his deathbed—he was not able to articulate very well. Sometimes his diction was just gone. Dad kept shaking his head. He said, ‘I can’t understand you. I’m so sorry, I can’t understand you.’ ” At the end of the call, Shengold told Sacks, “It’s been the honor of my life to work with you,” and said, “Goodbye, Oliver.” Sacks responded, “Goodbye, Leonard.” It was the first time they had ever used each other’s first names. When they hung up, Shengold was crying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After Sacks died, Shengold started closing down his practice. “It was the beginning of the end for him,” his son David told me. “He had lost most of his colleagues. He was really the last of his generation.” Nina said, “I do think part of why my father lived so long and was able to work so long was because of that relationship. That feeling of affection and kindred spirit was lifesaving.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In “Awakenings,” when describing how Leonard L.—his “ ‘ideal’ patient”—initially responded to L-dopa, Sacks characterizes him as “a man released from entombment” whose “predominant feelings at this time were feelings of freedom, openness, and exchange with the world.” He quotes Leonard saying, “I have been hungry and yearning all my life . . . and now I am full.” He also says, “I feel saved. . . . I feel like a man in love. I have broken through the barriers which cut me off from love.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For years, Sacks had tested the possibility of awakenings in others, as if rehearsing, or outsourcing, the cure he had longed to achieve with Shengold. But at the end of his life, like an inside-out case study, he inhabited the story he’d imagined for his patients. “All of us entertain the idea of another sort of medicine . . . which will restore us to our lost health and wholeness,” he wrote, in “Awakenings.” “We spend our lives searching for what we have lost; and one day, perhaps, we will suddenly find it.” ♦&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;State-of-the-art, open-source agentic coding models and CLI agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;█░ Date: Dec 9, 2025&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Content&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we're releasing Devstral 2—our next-generation coding model family available in two sizes: Devstral 2 (123B) and Devstral Small 2 (24B). Devstral 2 ships under a modified MIT license, while Devstral Small 2 uses Apache 2.0. Both are open-source and permissively licensed to accelerate distributed intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devstral 2 is currently free to use via our API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are also introducing Mistral Vibe, a native CLI built for Devstral that enables end-to-end code automation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Highlights.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Devstral 2: SOTA open model for code agents with a fraction of the parameters of its competitors and achieving 72.2% on SWE-bench Verified.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Up to 7x more cost-efficient than Claude Sonnet at real-world tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mistral Vibe CLI: Native, open-source agent in your terminal solving software engineering tasks autonomously.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Devstral Small 2: 24B parameter model available via API or deployable locally on consumer hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Compatible with on-prem deployment and custom fine-tuning.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Devstral: the next generation of SOTA coding.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devstral 2 is a 123B-parameter dense transformer supporting a 256K context window. It reaches 72.2% on SWE-bench Verified—establishing it as one of the best open-weight models while remaining highly cost efficient. Released under a modified MIT license, Devstral sets the open state-of-the-art for code agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devstral Small 2 scores 68.0% on SWE-bench Verified, and places firmly among models up to five times its size while being capable of running locally on consumer hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devstral 2 (123B) and Devstral Small 2 (24B) are 5x and 28x smaller than DeepSeek V3.2, and 8x and 41x smaller than Kimi K2—proving that compact models can match or exceed the performance of much larger competitors. Their reduced size makes deployment practical on limited hardware, lowering barriers for developers, small businesses, and hobbyists.hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Built for production-grade workflows.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devstral 2 supports exploring codebases and orchestrating changes across multiple files while maintaining architecture-level context. It tracks framework dependencies, detects failures, and retries with corrections—solving challenges like bug fixing and modernizing legacy systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model can be fine-tuned to prioritize specific languages or optimize for large enterprise codebases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We evaluated Devstral 2 against DeepSeek V3.2 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 using human evaluations conducted by an independent annotation provider, with tasks scaffolded through Cline. Devstral 2 shows a clear advantage over DeepSeek V3.2, with a 42.8% win rate versus 28.6% loss rate. However, Claude Sonnet 4.5 remains significantly preferred, indicating a gap with closed-source models persists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Devstral 2 is at the frontier of open-source coding models. In Cline, it delivers a tool-calling success rate on par with the best closed models; it's a remarkably smooth driver. This is a massive contribution to the open-source ecosystem.” — Cline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Devstral 2 was one of our most successful stealth launches yet, surpassing 17B tokens in the first 24 hours. Mistral AI is moving at Kilo Speed with a cost-efficient model that truly works at scale.” — Kilo Code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devstral Small 2, a 24B-parameter model with the same 256K context window and released under Apache 2.0, brings these capabilities to a compact, locally deployable form. Its size enables fast inference, tight feedback loops, and easy customization—with fully private, on-device runtime. It also supports image inputs, and can power multimodal agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mistral Vibe CLI.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mistral Vibe CLI is an open-source command-line coding assistant powered by Devstral. It explores, modifies, and executes changes across your codebase using natural language—in your terminal or integrated into your preferred IDE via the Agent Communication Protocol. It is released under the Apache 2.0 license.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vibe CLI provides an interactive chat interface with tools for file manipulation, code searching, version control, and command execution. Key features:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Project-aware context: Automatically scans your file structure and Git status to provide relevant context&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Smart references: Reference files with @ autocomplete, execute shell commands with !, and use slash commands for configuration changes&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Multi-file orchestration: Understands your entire codebase—not just the file you're editing—enabling architecture-level reasoning that can halve your PR cycle time&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Persistent history, autocompletion, and customizable themes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can run Vibe CLI programmatically for scripting, toggle auto-approval for tool execution, configure local models and providers through a simple config.toml, and control tool permissions to match your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Get started.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devstral 2 is currently offered free via our API. After the free period, the API pricing will be $0.40/$2.00 per million tokens (input/output) for Devstral 2 and $0.10/$0.30 for Devstral Small 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve partnered with leading, open agent tools Kilo Code and Cline to bring Devstral 2 to where you already build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mistral Vibe CLI is available as an extension in Zed, so you can use it directly inside your IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Recommended deployment for Devstral.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devstral 2 is optimized for data center GPUs and requires a minimum of 4 H100-class GPUs for deployment. You can try it today on build.nvidia.com. Devstral Small 2 is built for single-GPU operation and runs across a broad range of NVIDIA systems, including DGX Spark and GeForce RTX. NVIDIA NIM support will be available soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devstral Small runs on consumer-grade GPUs as well as CPU-only configurations with no dedicated GPU required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46205437</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 14:45:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>My favourite small hash table</title><link>https://www.corsix.org/content/my-favourite-small-hash-table</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="ead9f4510877030b"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;My favourite small hash table&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm the kind of person who thinks about the design and implementation of hash tables. One design which I find particularly cute, and I think deserves a bit more publicity, is Robin Hood open-addressing with linear probing and power-of-two table size. If you're not familiar with hash table terminology, that might look like a smorgasbord of random words, but it should become clearer as we look at some actual code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To keep the code simple to start with, I'm going to assume:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keys are randomly-distributed 32-bit integers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Values are also 32-bit integers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the key &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;is present, its value is not&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The table occupies at most 32 GiB of memory.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each slot in the table is either empty, or holds a key and a value. The combination of properties (1) and (2) allows a key/value pair to be stored as a 64-bit integer, and property (3) means that the 64-bit value &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; can be used to represent an empty slot (some hash table designs also need a special value for representing tombstones, but this design doesn't need tombstones). Combining a key and a value into 64 bits couldn't be easier: the low 32 bits hold the key, and the high 32 bits hold the value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The structure for the table itself needs a pointer to the array of slots, the length of said array, and the number of non-empty slots. As the length is always a power of two, it's more useful to store &lt;code&gt;length - 1&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt;, which leads to &lt;code&gt;mask&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt;, and property (4) means that &lt;code&gt;mask&lt;/code&gt; can be stored as 32 bits. As the load factor should be less than 100%, we can assume &lt;code&gt;count &amp;lt; length&lt;/code&gt;, and hence &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; can also be 32 bits. This leads to a mundane-looking:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;struct hash_table_t {
  uint64_t* slots;
  uint32_t mask;
  uint32_t count;
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Property (1) means that we don't need to hash keys, as they're already randomly distributed. Every possible key &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt; has a "natural position" in the slots array, which is just &lt;code&gt;K &amp;amp; mask&lt;/code&gt;. If there are collisions, the slot in which a key actually ends up might be different to its natural position. The "linear probing" part of the design means that if &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt; cannot be in its natural position, the next slot to be considered is &lt;code&gt;(K + 1) &amp;amp; mask&lt;/code&gt;, and if not that slot then &lt;code&gt;(K + 2) &amp;amp; mask&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;(K + 3) &amp;amp; mask&lt;/code&gt;, and so on. This leads to the definition of a "chain": if &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt; is some key present in the table, &lt;code&gt;CK&lt;/code&gt; denotes the sequence of slots starting with &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt;'s natural position and ending with &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt;'s actual position. We have the usual property of open-addressing: none of the slots in &lt;code&gt;CK&lt;/code&gt; are empty slots. The "Robin Hood" part of the design then imposes an additional rather interesting property: for each slot &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;CK&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Score(S.Index, S.Key) â¥ Score(S.Index, K)&lt;/code&gt;, where:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;S.Index&lt;/code&gt;is the index of&lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;in the&lt;code&gt;slots&lt;/code&gt;array (not the index of it in&lt;code&gt;CK&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;S.Key&lt;/code&gt;is the key present in slot&lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;(i.e. the low 32 bits of&lt;code&gt;slots[S.Index]&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Score(Index, Key)&lt;/code&gt;is&lt;code&gt;(Index - Key) &amp;amp; mask&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These properties give us the termination conditions for the lookup algorithm: for a possible key &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt;, we look at each slot starting from &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt;'s natural position, and either we find &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt;, or we find an empty slot, or we find a slot with &lt;code&gt;Score(S.Index, S.Key) &amp;lt; Score(S.Index, K)&lt;/code&gt;. In either of the latter two cases, &lt;code&gt;K&lt;/code&gt; cannot have been present in the table. In the function below, &lt;code&gt;Score(S.Index, K)&lt;/code&gt; is tracked as &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;. In a language with a modern type system, the result of a lookup would be &lt;code&gt;Optional&amp;lt;Value&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, but if sticking to plain C, property (3) can be used to make something similar: the 64-bit result is zero if the key is absent, and otherwise the value is in the low 32 bits of the result (which may themselves be zero, but the full 64-bit result will be non-zero). The logic is thus:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint64_t table_lookup(hash_table_t* table, uint32_t key) {
  uint32_t mask = table-&amp;gt;mask;
  uint64_t* slots = table-&amp;gt;slots;
  for (uint32_t d = 0;; ++d) {
    uint32_t idx = (key + d) &amp;amp; mask;
    uint64_t slot = slots[idx];
    if (slot == 0) {
      return 0;
    } else if (key == (uint32_t)slot) {
      return (slot &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 32) | (slot &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 32);
    } else if (((idx - (uint32_t)slot) &amp;amp; mask) &amp;lt; d) {
      return 0;
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If using a rich 64-bit CPU architecture, many of the expressions in the above function are cheaper than they might initially seem:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;slots[idx]&lt;/code&gt;involves zero-extending&lt;code&gt;idx&lt;/code&gt;from 32 bits to 64, multiplying it by&lt;code&gt;sizeof(uint64_t)&lt;/code&gt;, adding it to&lt;code&gt;slots&lt;/code&gt;, and then loading from that address. All this is a single instruction on x86-64 or arm64.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;key == (uint32_t)slot&lt;/code&gt;involves a comparison using the low 32 bits of a 64-bit register, which is a completely standard operation on x86-64 or arm64.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;(slot &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 32) | (slot &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 32)&lt;/code&gt;is a rotation by 32 bits, which again is a single instruction on x86-64 or arm64.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if using riscv64, things are less good:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;Zba&lt;/code&gt;extension is present,&lt;code&gt;sh3add.uw&lt;/code&gt;is a single instruction for zero-extending&lt;code&gt;idx&lt;/code&gt;from 32 bits to 64, multiplying it by&lt;code&gt;sizeof(uint64_t)&lt;/code&gt;, and adding it to&lt;code&gt;slots&lt;/code&gt;. If not, each step is a separate instruction, though the zero-extension can be eliminated with a slight reformulation to encourage the compiler to fold the zero-extension onto the load of&lt;code&gt;table-&amp;gt;mask&lt;/code&gt;(as riscv64 usually defaults to making sign-extension free, in contrast to x86-64/arm64 which usually make zero-extension free). Regardless, the load is always its own instruction.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;key == (uint32_t)slot&lt;/code&gt;hits a gap in the riscv64 ISA: it doesn't have any 32-bit comparison instructions, so this either becomes a 32-bit subtraction followed by a 64-bit comparison against zero, or promotion of both operands from 32 bits to 64 bits followed by a 64-bit comparison.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;Zbb&lt;/code&gt;extension is present, rotations are a single instruction. If not, they're three instructions, and so it becomes almost worth reworking the slot layout to put the key in the high 32 bits and the value in the low 32 bits.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving on from lookup to insertion, there are various different options for what to do when the key being inserted is already present. I'm choosing to show a variant which returns the old value (in the same form as &lt;code&gt;table_lookup&lt;/code&gt; returns) and then overwrites with the new value, though other variants are obviously possible. The logic follows the same overall structure as seen in &lt;code&gt;table_lookup&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint64_t table_set(hash_table_t* table, uint32_t key, uint32_t val) {
  uint32_t mask = table-&amp;gt;mask;
  uint64_t* slots = table-&amp;gt;slots;
  uint64_t kv = key + ((uint64_t)val &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 32);
  for (uint32_t d = 0;; ++d) {
    uint32_t idx = ((uint32_t)kv + d) &amp;amp; mask;
    uint64_t slot = slots[idx];
    if (slot == 0) {
      // Inserting new value (and slot was previously empty)
      slots[idx] = kv;
      break;
    } else if ((uint32_t)kv == (uint32_t)slot) {
      // Overwriting existing value
      slots[idx] = kv;
      return (slot &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 32) | (slot &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 32);
    } else {
      uint32_t d2 = (idx - (uint32_t)slot) &amp;amp; mask;
      if (d2 &amp;lt; d) {
        // Inserting new value, and moving existing slot
        slots[idx] = kv;
        table_reinsert(slots, mask, slot, d2);
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  if (++table-&amp;gt;count * 4ull &amp;gt;= mask * 3ull) {
    // Expand table once we hit 75% load factor
    table_rehash(table);
  }
  return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To avoid the load factor becoming too high, the above function will sometimes grow the table by calling this helper function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void table_rehash(hash_table_t* table) {
  uint32_t old_mask = table-&amp;gt;mask;
  uint32_t new_mask = old_mask * 2u + 1u;
  uint64_t* new_slots = calloc(new_mask + 1ull, sizeof(uint64_t));
  uint64_t* old_slots = table-&amp;gt;slots;
  uint32_t idx = 0;
  do {
    uint64_t slot = old_slots[idx];
    if (slot != 0) {
      table_reinsert(new_slots, new_mask, slot, 0);
    }
  } while (idx++ != old_mask);
  table-&amp;gt;slots = new_slots;
  table-&amp;gt;mask = new_mask;
  free(old_slots);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both of &lt;code&gt;table_set&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;table_rehash&lt;/code&gt; make use of a helper function which is very similar to &lt;code&gt;table_set&lt;/code&gt;, but doesn't need to check for overwriting an existing key and also doesn't need to update &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void table_reinsert(uint64_t* slots, uint32_t mask, uint64_t kv, uint32_t d) {
  for (;; ++d) {
    uint32_t idx = ((uint32_t)kv + d) &amp;amp; mask;
    uint64_t slot = slots[idx];
    if (slot == 0) {
      slots[idx] = kv;
      break;
    } else {
      uint32_t d2 = (idx - (uint32_t)slot) &amp;amp; mask;
      if (d2 &amp;lt; d) {
        slots[idx] = kv;
        kv = slot;
        d = d2;
      }
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That covers lookup and insertion, so next up is key removal. As already hinted at, this hash table design doesn't need tombstones. Instead, removing a key involves finding the slot containing that key and then shifting slots left until finding an empty slot or a slot with &lt;code&gt;Score(S.Index, S.Key) == 0&lt;/code&gt;. This removal strategy works due to a neat pair of emergent properties:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If slot &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;has&lt;code&gt;Score(S.Index, S.Key) != 0&lt;/code&gt;, it is viable for&lt;code&gt;S.Key&lt;/code&gt;to instead be at&lt;code&gt;(S.Index - 1) &amp;amp; mask&lt;/code&gt;(possibly subject to additional re-arranging to fill the gap formed by moving&lt;code&gt;S.Key&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If slot &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;has&lt;code&gt;Score(S.Index, S.Key) == 0&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;is part of some chain&lt;code&gt;CK&lt;/code&gt;, then&lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;is at the very start of&lt;code&gt;CK&lt;/code&gt;. Hence it is viable to turn&lt;code&gt;(S.Index - 1) &amp;amp; mask&lt;/code&gt;into an empty slot without breaking any chains.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This leads to the tombstone-free removal function, which follows the established pattern of returning either the old value or zero:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;uint64_t table_remove(hash_table_t* table, uint32_t key) {
  uint32_t mask = table-&amp;gt;mask;
  uint64_t* slots = table-&amp;gt;slots;
  for (uint32_t d = 0;; ++d) {
    uint32_t idx = (key + d) &amp;amp; mask;
    uint64_t slot = slots[idx];
    if (slot == 0) {
      return 0;
    } else if (key == (uint32_t)slot) {
      uint32_t nxt = (idx + 1) &amp;amp; mask;
      --table-&amp;gt;count;
      while (slots[nxt] &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ((slots[nxt] ^ nxt) &amp;amp; mask)) {
        slots[idx] = slots[nxt];
        idx = nxt;
        nxt = (idx + 1) &amp;amp; mask;
      }
      slots[idx] = 0;
      return (slot &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 32) | (slot &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 32);
    } else if (((idx - (uint32_t)slot) &amp;amp; mask) &amp;lt; d) {
      return 0;
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final interesting hash table operation is iterating over all keys and values, which is just an array iteration combined with filtering out zeroes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void table_iterate(hash_table_t* table, void(*visit)(uint32_t key, uint32_t val)) {
  uint64_t* slots = table-&amp;gt;slots;
  uint32_t mask = table-&amp;gt;mask;
  uint32_t idx = 0;
  do {
    uint64_t slot = slots[idx];
    if (slot != 0) {
      visit((uint32_t)slot, (uint32_t)(slot &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 32));
    }
  } while (idx++ != mask);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That wraps up the core concepts of this hash table, so now it is time to revisit some of the initial simplifications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If keys are 32-bit integers but are not randomly-distributed, then we just need an invertible hash function from 32 bits to 32 bits, the purpose of which is to take keys following ~any real-world pattern and emit a ~random pattern. The &lt;code&gt;table_lookup&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;table_set&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;table_remove&lt;/code&gt; functions gain &lt;code&gt;key = hash(key)&lt;/code&gt; at the very start but are otherwise unmodified (noting that if the hash function is invertible, hash equality implies key equality, hence no need to explicitly check key equality), and &lt;code&gt;table_iterate&lt;/code&gt; is modified to apply the inverse function before calling &lt;code&gt;visit&lt;/code&gt;. If hardware CRC32 / CRC32C instructions are present (as is the case on sufficiently modern x86-64 and arm64 chips), these can be used for the task, although their inverses are annoying to compute, so perhaps not ideal if iteration is an important operation. If CRC32 isn't viable, one option out of many is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If keys and values are larger than 32 bits, then the design can be augmented with a separate array of key/value pairs, with the design as shown containing a 32-bit hash of the key and the array index of the key/value pair. To meet property (3) in this case, either the hash function can be chosen to never be zero, or "array index plus one" can be stored rather than "array index". It is not possible to make the hash function invertible in this case, so &lt;code&gt;table_lookup&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;table_set&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;table_remove&lt;/code&gt; do need extending to check for key equality after confirming hash equality. Iteration involves walking the separate array of key/value pairs rather than the hash structure, which has the added benefit of iteration order being related to insertion order rather than hash order. As another twist on this, if keys and values are variably-sized, then the design can instead be augmented with a separate array of bytes, with key/value pairs serialised somewhere in that array, and the hash structure containing a 32-bit hash of the key and the byte offset (within the array) of the key/value pair.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, a design can only stretch so far. If you're after a concurrent lock-free hash table, look elsewhere. If you can rely on 128-bit SIMD instructions being present, you might instead want to group together every 16 key/value pairs, keep an 8-bit hash of each key, and rely on SIMD to perform 16 hash comparisons in parallel. If you're building hardware rather than software, it can be appealing to have multiple hash functions, each one addressing its own SRAM bank. There is no one-size-fits-all hash table, but I've found the one shown here to be good for a lot of what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kaiju is a 2D/3D game engine written in Go (Golang) backed by Vulkan. The goal of the engine is to use a modern, easy, systems level programming language, with a focus on simplicity, to create a new kind of game engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current version of the base engine renders extremely fast, faster than most would think a garbage collected language could go. In my testing a release mode build of a game in Unity with nothing but a black background and a cube runs at about 1,600 FPS. In Kaiju, the same thing runs at around 5,400 FPS on the same machine. In fact, a complete game, with audio, custom cursors, real time PBR rendering with real time shadows, UI, and more runs at 2,712 FPS (in "debug" mode) screenshots or it didn't happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love C, and because I love C and found out that Ken Thompson played a part in designing Go, I gave Go a chance. It has been such a joy to use and work with I decided to port my C game engine to Go. Go is a modern system-level language that allows me to write code the way I want to write code and even have the opportunity to do some crazy things if I want to (no strings attached). Also the simplicity and "just works" of writing Assembly code was a great boost to my happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's more, it's a language that other developers can easily learn and jump right into extending the engine/editor. No need for developers to re-figure out some bespoke macros or crazy templating nonsense. It's flat, easy, straight forward, and the foot-gun is hidden behind some walls, but there if you want it. Furthermore, developers can write their games in Go directly, no need for some alternative language that is different from the engine code (but we'll include Lua for modding).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am creating this section because I get asked about it when I mention "Go", possibly not realizing that most public game engines use a garbage collector (GC).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The GC is actually a feature I'm happy with (shocker coming from a C guy). Well, the reason is simple, if you're going to make a game engine that the public will use and needs to be stable, you need a garbage collector. Unity has C# (and possibly an internal GC as well), Unreal has a GC (and it could use a tune up if you ask me), Godot has a GC albeit their scripting language or when you use C#. It is actually very important for public engines to have a GC because people are only human and make a lot of mistakes, mistakes they'll blame on you (the engine developer) before they blame themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, the overall design I have for the engine plays very well with the GC and last I measured, I have a net-0 heap allocation while running (may need a new review). If you don't abuse the GC, you shouldn't generally feel it, it runs concurrently as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll be the first to admit, I think the developers of Go can create a better GC than I can, and probably better than Unreal and Unity too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though the engine is production ready, the editor is not, feel free to join and contribute to its development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the latest updates, please join the Discord or check my Twitter/X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please review the Ad-Hoc editor readme&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please see the documentation on how to get started and compile the engine&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By: Blake Scholl, Founder &amp;amp; CEO, Boom Supersonic&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It started, as many things do these days, by scrolling on X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was reading post after post about the power crisis hitting AI data centers—GPU racks sitting idle, waiting not on chips, but on electricity. I texted with Sam Altman—who confirmed power was indeed a major constraint. I pinged our engineering team—and found that they already had the outline of a plan to build a power turbine based on our Symphony supersonic engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a few conversations, it became clear: AI didn’t just need more turbines—it needed a new and fundamentally better turbine. Symphony was the perfect new engine to accelerate AI in America. About three months later, we had a signed deal for 1.21 gigawatts and had started manufacturing the first turbine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re announcing Superpower, our new 42‑megawatt natural gas turbine, along with a $300M funding round and Crusoe as our launch customer. And most importantly: this marks a turning point. Boom is now on a self-funded path to both Superpower and the Overture supersonic airliner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to share the real story of how this happened—and why supersonic technology is exactly what America’s energy crisis demands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;America Doesn’t Have 10–15 Years to Solve Its Power Problem the Old Way&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve been paying attention, you know the U.S. is in a genuine energy crunch. GPU racks are idling because they can’t get power. Data centers are fighting over substations and interconnection queues. Meanwhile China is adding power capacity at a wartime pace—coal, gas, nuclear, everything—while America struggles to get a single transmission line permitted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI won’t wait for us to fix the grid. And the United States simply doesn’t have 10–15 years to build out power infrastructure the old way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hyperscalers have already moved to their own Plan B: behind‑the‑meter power plants. You’ve seen XAI’s Colossus I and II in Memphis. OpenAI’s Stargate I in Abilene. These projects are powered by arrays of aeroderivative natural-gas turbines—which are, fundamentally, modified jet engines from the 1970s. There’s something brilliant in this approach: the transition from gigantic “frame” turbines to arrays of mid-size “aeroderivative” turbines mirrors the computing industry’s shift from mainframes to blade servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problem? The “blade servers” of the energy world are old tech and they’re sold out. Because the most popular “aeroderivative” turbines are based on subsonic jet engines, they’re happiest when the outside air temperature is -50°F—like it is when going Mach 0.8 at 30,000 feet. As outside temperatures rise, there is no option but to throttle back the engines—or else the turbine blades literally melt down. These turbines begin losing power at about 50°F and by the time it’s 110°—as often happens in popular data center locations like Texas—30% of generation capacity is lost. Nonetheless, major manufacturers all have backlogs through the rest of the decade and none is building a new-generation advanced-technology turbine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;A Supersonic Engine Core Makes the Perfect Power Turbine&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we designed the Symphony engine for Overture, we built something no one else has built this century: a brand-new large engine core optimized for continuous, high‑temperature operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A subsonic engine is built for short bursts of power at takeoff. A supersonic engine is built to run hard, continuously, at extreme thermal loads. Symphony was designed for Mach 1.7 at 60,000 feet, where effective temperatures reach 160°F—not the frigid -50°F conditions where legacy subsonic engines operate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gives Superpower several critical advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Full power even with high ambient heat – Where legacy turbines lose 20–30% at 110°F, Superpower maintains its full 42MW output without derate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Waterless operation – Legacy turbines need huge quantities of water for cooling to avoid thermal derate in hot environments. Superpower doesn’t. It stays at full output, water‑free.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cloud‑native control and monitoring. Superpower inherits the telemetry and operations stack we built for XB‑1. Every turbine streams real‑time performance data, supports remote control, and flags anomalies before customers ever notice.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superpower and Symphony are based on virtually identical turbine engines. Both share the identical core (HPC and HPT) and a slightly tuned low spool. In the place of Symphony’s hollow-core titanium fan, Superpower adds two additional compressor stages plus a three-stage free power turbine connected to a high-efficiency generator on its own shaft. Additionally, the engines use slightly different fuel nozzles, Symphony’s optimized for Jet A vs. Superpower’s for natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Scaling Production the Supersonic Way: Vertical Integration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The legacy aerospace supply chain is congested. When the mission is urgent and the supply chain congested, you build the supply chain. The new Superpower Superfactory starts with a simple vision: raw materials in one side of the building, gigawatts of completed power turbine packages out the other side. We’ve already started making the first parts—and much of the production equipment to support 2GW/yr is on order. With this new financing we’re ready to accelerate further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If America wants to build at the speed AI requires, vertical integration isn’t optional. We’re standing up our own foundry and our own large scale CNC machining capability. We’ll have more to share on the Superpower Superfactory in early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Scaling Production the Supersonic Way: Vertical Integration&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superpower is sort of like our Starlink moment, the strongest accelerant we’ve ever had toward our core mission of making Earth dramatically more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fastest way to a certified, passenger-carrying Symphony engine is to run its core for hundreds of thousands of hours in the real world, powering Earth’s most demanding AI data centers. Every hour a Superpower turbine spins is an hour of validation for Symphony. Every gigawatt we deliver strengthens our vertical integration and manufacturing capability. And with Superpower profitability funding the remainder of the aircraft program, we’ve done something rare in aerospace: created a self-sustaining path to a new airliner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superpower also reminds me of what Boom is at our core: a team willing to take on what others say is impossible, to do with a small team what big companies might not even attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;As various LLMs become more and more popular, so does comments with "I asked Gemini, and Gemini said ....".&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;While the guidelines were written (and iterated on) during a different time, it seems like it might be time to have a discussion about if those sort of comments should be welcomed on HN or not.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46164360&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46200460&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46080064&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Personally, I'm on HN for the human conversation, and large LLM-generated texts just get in the way of reading real text from real humans (assumed, at least).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;What do you think? Should responses that basically boil down to "I asked $LLM about $X, and here is what $LLM said:" be allowed on HN, and the guidelines updated to state that people shouldn't critique it (similar to other guidelines currently), or should a new guideline be added to ask people from refrain from copy-pasting large LLM responses into the comments, or something else completely?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Thank you for visiting my portfolio! &lt;lb/&gt;If you are curious about the stack and how I built it, hereâs everything you need to know. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Three.js is the library Iâm using to render this 3D world. &lt;lb/&gt;It was created by mr.doob (X, GitHub), followed by hundreds of awesome developers, one of which being Sunag (X, GitHub) who added TSL, enabling the use of both WebGL and WebGPU, making this portfolio possible. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; If you want to learn Three.js, I got you covered with this huge course. &lt;lb/&gt;It contains everything you need to start building awesome stuff with Three.js (and much more). &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Iâve been making devlogs since the very start of this portfolio and you can find them on my Youtube channel. &lt;lb/&gt;Even though the portfolio is out, Iâm still working on the last videos so that the series is complete. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The code is available on GitHub under MIT license. Even the Blender files are there, so have fun! &lt;lb/&gt;For security reasons, Iâm not sharing the server code, but the portfolio works without it. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The music you hear was made especially for this portfolio by the awesome Kounine (Linktree). &lt;lb/&gt;They are now under CC0 license, meaning you can do whatever you want with them! &lt;lb/&gt;Download them here. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Eliminate compulsive phone usage&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About Clearspace&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clearspace is building the intentionality layer of the internet. Our mission is to build technology as effective at protecting human attention as social media is at exploiting it (infinite scrolling, short-form feeds, manipulative notifications, etc). Our category defining mobile app has been featured on Huberman Lab, New York Times Wirecutter, NPR Marketplace, Forbes, TBPN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People that want a better relationship with their devices have nowhere to turn except for willpower. We are building an agent that achieves this on all devices by processing and filtering network traffic based on natural language rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About The Role&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are looking for a lead designer with strong aesthetic intuition and an obsession with designing through every inch of the user journey. You will be asked to bring pixel perfect designs to life across several different platforms, if you don’t love the process of designing this is not the role for you. You will be talking to users often and asked to speak to the overall brand direction at Clearspace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qualifications&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nice to Have&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Clearspace we help people reduce compulsive phone usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We exist to protect people's attention from the exploits of modern technology platforms and make space for the things that matter to them most.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe the technology to protect someones attention should be just as sophisticated and effective as the tech that is exploiting it and are building a world-class engineering team to arm the world with a comprehensive attention protection stack.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Donating the Model Context Protocol and establishing the Agentic AI Foundation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re donating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF), a directed fund under the Linux Foundation, co-founded by Anthropic, Block and OpenAI, with support from Google, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cloudflare, and Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Model Context Protocol&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One year ago, we introduced MCP as a universal, open standard for connecting AI applications to external systems. Since then, MCP has achieved incredible adoption:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Across the ecosystem: There are now more than 10,000 active public MCP servers, covering everything from developer tools to Fortune 500 deployments;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Across platforms: MCP has been adopted by ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Visual Studio Code, and other popular AI products;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Across infrastructure: Enterprise-grade infrastructure now exists with deployment support for MCP from providers including AWS, Cloudflare, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;We’re continuing to invest in MCP’s growth. Claude now has a directory with over 75 connectors (powered by MCP), and we recently launched Tool Search and Programmatic Tool Calling capabilities in our API to help optimize production-scale MCP deployments, handling thousands of tools efficiently and reducing latency in complex agent workflows.&lt;lb/&gt;MCP now has an official, community-driven Registry for discovering available MCP servers, and the November 25th spec release introduced many new features, including asynchronous operations, statelessness, server identity, and official extensions. There are also official SDKs (Software Development Kits) for MCP in all major programming languages with 97M+ monthly SDK downloads across Python and TypeScript. &lt;lb/&gt;Since its inception, we’ve been committed to ensuring MCP remains open-source, community-driven and vendor-neutral. Today, we further that commitment by donating MCP to the Linux Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Linux Foundation and the Agentic AI Foundation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Linux Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering the growth of sustainable, open-source ecosystems through neutral stewardship, community building, and shared infrastructure. It has decades of experience stewarding the most critical and globally-significant open-source projects, including The Linux Kernel, Kubernetes, Node.js, and PyTorch. Importantly, the Linux Foundation has a proven track record in facilitating open collaboration and maintaining vendor neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) is a directed fund under the Linux Foundation co-founded by Anthropic, Block and OpenAI, with support from Google, Microsoft, AWS, Cloudflare and Bloomberg. The AAIF aims to ensure agentic AI evolves transparently, collaboratively, and in the public interest through strategic investment, community building, and shared development of open standards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Donating the Model Context Protocol&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anthropic is donating the Model Context Protocol to the Linux Foundation's new Agentic AI Foundation, where it will join goose by Block and AGENTS.md by OpenAI as founding projects. Bringing these and future projects under the AAIF will foster innovation across the agentic AI ecosystem and ensure these foundational technologies remain neutral, open, and community-driven. &lt;lb/&gt;The Model Context Protocol’s governance model will remain unchanged: the project’s maintainers will continue to prioritize community input and transparent decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The future of MCP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open-source software is essential for building a secure and innovative ecosystem for agentic AI. Today’s donation to the Linux Foundation demonstrates our commitment to ensuring MCP remains a neutral, open standard. We’re excited to continue contributing to MCP and other agentic AI projects through the AAIF.&lt;lb/&gt;Learn more about MCP at modelcontextprotocol.io and get involved with the AAIF here.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;If You’re Going to Vibe Code, Why Not Do It in C?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stephen Ramsay&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or hell, why not do it in x86 assembly?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s get a few things out of the way before I go any further with this seemingly impertinent thought, because it’s nowhere near as snarky as it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, I don’t particularly like vibe coding. I love programming, and I have loved it since I made my first tentative steps with it sometime back in the mid-to-late 90s. I love programming so much, it always feels like I’m having too much fun for it to count as real work. I’ve done it professionally, but I also do it as a hobby. Someone apparently once said, “Do what you love and you’ll never work a day in your life.” That’s how I feel about writing code. I’ve also been teaching the subject for twenty-five years, and I can honestly say I am as excited about the first day of the semester now as I was when I first started. I realize it’s a bit precious to say so, but I’ll say it anyway: Turning non-programmers into programmers is my life’s work. It is the thing of which I am most proud as a college professor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vibe coding makes me feel dirty in ways that I struggle to articulate precisely. It’s not just that it feels like “cheating” (though it does). I also think it takes a lot of the fun out of the whole thing. I sometimes tell people (like the aforementioned students) that programming is like doing the best crossword puzzle in the world, except that when you solve it, it actually dances and sings. Vibe coding robs me of that moment, because I don’t feel like I really did it at all. And even though to be a programmer is to live with a more-or-less permanent set of aporias (you don’t really understand what the compiler is doing, really—and even if you do, you probably don’t really understand how the virtual memory subsystem works, really), it’s satisfying to understand every inch of my code and frustrating—all the way to the borderlands of active anxiety—not quite understanding what Claude just wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this leads me to my second point, which I must make as clearly and forcefully as I can. Vibe coding actually works. It creates robust, complex systems that work. You can tell yourself (as I did) that it can’t possibly do that, but you are wrong. You can then tell yourself (as I did) that it’s good as a kind of alternative search engine for coding problems, but not much else. You are also wrong about that. Because when you start giving it little programming problems that you can’t be arsed to work out yourself (as I did), you discover (as I did) that it’s awfully good at those. And then one day you muse out loud (as I did) to an AI model something like, “I have an idea for a program…” And you are astounded. If you aren’t astounded, you either haven’t actually done it or you are at some stage of grief prior to acceptance. Perfect? Hardly. But then neither are human coders. The future? I think the questions answers itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But to get to my impertinent question…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early on in my love affair with programming, I read Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, which I now consider one of the great pedagogical masterpieces of the twentieth century. I learned a great deal about programming from that book, but among the most memorable lessons was one that appears in the second paragraph of the original preface. There, Hal Abelson and Gerald Sussman make a point that hits with the force of the obvious, and yet is very often forgotten:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[W]e want to establish the idea that a computer language is not just a way of getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been repeating some version of this to my students ever since. Computers, I remind them, do not need the code to be “readable” or “ergonomic” for humans; they only need it to be readable and ergonomic for a computer, which is a considerably lower bar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every programming language—including assembly language—was and is intended for the convenience of humans who need to read it and write it. If a language is innovative, it is usually not because it has allowed for automatic memory management, or concurrency, or safety, or robust error checking, but because it has made it easier for humans to express and reason about these matters. When we extol the virtues of this or that language—Rust’s safety guarantees, C++’s “no-cost abstractions,” or Go’s approach to concurrency—we are not talking about an affordance that the computer has gained, but about an affordance that we have gained as programmers of said computer. From our standpoint as programmers, object-oriented languages offer certain ways to organize our code—and, I think Abelson and Sussman would say, our thinking—that are potentially conducive to the noble treasures of maintainability, extensibility, error checking, and any number of other condign matters. From the standpoint of the computer, this little OO kink of ours seems mostly to indicate a strange affinity for heap memory. “Whatevs!” (says the computer). And pick your poison here, folks: functional programming, algebraic data types, dependent types, homoiconicity, immutable data structures, brace styles… We can debate the utility of these things, but we must understand that we are primarily talking about human problems. The set of “machine problems” to which these matters correspond is considerably smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So my question is this: Why vibe code with a language that has human convenience and ergonomics in view? Or to put that another way: Wouldn’t a language designed for vibe coding naturally dispense with much of what is convenient and ergonomic for humans in favor of what is convenient and ergonomic for machines? Why not have it just write C? Or hell, why not x86 assembly?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, at this point, you will want to say that the need for human understanding isn’t erased entirely thereby. Some version of this argument has merit, but I would remind you that if you are really vibe coding for real you already don’t understand a great deal of what it is producing. But if you look carefully, you will notice that it doesn’t struggle with undefined behavior in C. Or with making sure that all memory is properly freed. Or with off-by-one errors. It sometimes struggles to understand what it is that you actually want, but it rarely struggles with the actual execution of the code. It’s better than you are at keeping track of those things in the same way that a compiler is better at optimizing code than you are. Perfect? No. But as I said before…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is C the ideal language for vibe coding? I think I could mount an argument for why it is not, but surely Rust is even less ideal. To say nothing of Haskell, or OCaml, or even Python. All of these languages, after all, are for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. They are practically adorable in their concern for problems that AI models do not have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I suppose what I’m getting at, here, is that if vibe coding is the future of software development (and it is), then why bother with languages that were designed for people who are not vibe coding? Shouldn’t there be such a thing as a “vibe-oriented programming language?” VOP. You read it here first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One possibility is that such a language truly would be executable pseudocode beyond even the most extravagant fever dreams of the most earnest Pythonistas; it shows you what it’s doing in truly pseudo code, but all the while it’s writing assembly. Or perhaps it’s something like the apotheosis of literate programming. You write a literary document “expressing ideas about methodology,” and the AI produces machine code (and a kind of literary critical practice evolves around this activity, eventually ordering itself into structuralist and post-structuralist camps. But I’m getting ahead of myself). Perhaps your job as a programmer is mostly running tests that verify this machine code (tests which have also been produced by AI). Or maybe a VOPL is really a certain kind of language that comes closer to natural language than any existing programming language, but which has a certain (easily learned) set of idioms and expressions that guide the AI more reliably and more quickly toward particular solutions. It doesn’t have goroutines. It has a “concurrency slang.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now obviously, the reason a large language model focused on coding is good at Javascript and C++ is precisely because it has been trained on billions of lines of code in those languages along with countless forum posts, StackOverflow debates, and so on. Bootstrapping a VOPL presents a certain kind of difficulty, but then one also suspects that LLMs are already being trained in some future version of this language, because so many programmers are already groping their way toward a system like this by virtue of the fact that so many of them are already vibe coding production-level systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t know how I feel about all of this (see my first and second points above). It saddens me to think of “coding by hand” becoming a kind of quaint Montessori-school stage in the education of a vibe coder—something like the contour drawings we demand from future photoshopers or the balanced equations we insist serve as a rite of passage for people who will never be without a calculator to the end of their days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, there is something exciting about the birth of a computational paradigm. It wasn’t that long ago, in the grand scheme of things, that someone realized that rewiring the entire machine every time you wanted to do a calculation (think ENIAC, circa 1945) was a rather suboptimal way to do things. And it is worth recalling that people complained when the stored-program computer rolled around (think EDVAC, circa 1951). Why? Well, the answer should be obvious. It was less reliable. It was slower. It removed the operator from the loop. It threatened specialized labor. It was conceptually impure. I’m not kidding about any of this. No less an authority than Grace Hopper had to argue against the quite popular idea that there was no way anyone could ever trust a machine to write instructions for another machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same vibe, as the kids say.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How Private Equity Is Changing Housing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some communities, corporations control more than 20 percent of properties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Listen to more stories on the Noa app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a housing crisis, as you probably, painfully, know. Wouldn’t you like to have someone to blame for it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States is short 4 million housing units, with a particular dearth of starter homes, moderately priced apartments in low-rises, and family-friendly dwellings. Interest rates are high, which has stifled construction and pushed up the cost of mortgages. As a result, more Americans are renting, and roughly half of those households are spending more than a third of their income on shelter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This crisis has many causes: restrictive zoning codes, arcane permitting processes, excessive community input, declining construction productivity, expensive labor, and expensive lumber. And, some say, the aggressive entry of private equity into the housing market. Institutional investors have bought up hundreds of thousands of American homes since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, outbidding families and pushing up rents—a trend lamented by everyone from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to J. D. Vance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Casting private equity as a central villain in the country’s real-estate tragedy makes intuitive sense. Who’s going to win in a bidding war for a three-bedroom in a suburb of Cincinnati: a single-income family with a scrabbled-together 10 percent down payment or a Wall Street LLC offering cash? Still, housing economists and policy analysts have argued that institutional investors have played at most a bit part. Supply constraints began cropping up on the coasts a generation ago, if not earlier, whereas Wall Street started buying up significant numbers of homes only after the Great Recession and especially after the pandemic. Moreover, even if big investors are purchasing thousands of homes, they don’t own significant numbers of homes compared with small-scale landlords and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet in some markets, the balance has shifted. Last month, the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy and the Center for Geospatial Solutions published a report showing that corporations now own a remarkable one in 11 residential real-estate parcels in the 500 urban counties with data robust enough to analyze. In some communities, they control more than 20 percent of properties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I figured that big investors might be picking up vacation rentals in Colorado and expensive apartment buildings in the Bay Area and the Acela Corridor. They are, the report’s authors told me. But these investors are pouring the most money into “buy low, rent high” neighborhoods: communities, many of them in the South and the Rust Belt, where large shares of families can’t afford a mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They’re pulling all the starter homes off of the market in low-income, high-minority-density neighborhoods,” George McCarthy, the president of the Lincoln Institute, told me—a trend that is intensifying the country’s yawning racial wealth and homeownership gaps. In Cleveland, corporations own 17.5 percent of residential real-estate parcels. In the city’s East Side, which contains many predominantly Black neighborhoods, just one in five homebuyers in 2021 took out a mortgage. The rest—many investors, presumably—paid in cash or took out a loan from a non-traditional financier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Baltimore’s majority-Black McElderry Park and Ellwood Park/Monument neighborhoods, owner-occupants made just 13 percent of purchases in 2022. In a majority-white neighborhood not far away, owner-occupants bought more than 80 percent of homes that same year, and out-of-state corporations owned less than 1 percent of residential parcels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The report made me see the country’s real-estate crisis in a different light. Private-equity firms and other deep-pocketed investors aren’t why Seattle and Boston are unaffordable. Those cities have had shortage-driven housing crises that have intensified over decades. The firms aren’t why many towns in the Mountain West have seen jumps in home values and a corresponding increase in homelessness, displacement, and eviction. In those communities, white-collar emigrants from big cities have arrived and outbid locals. But investor money is distorting the housing market in communities with low wages and decent-enough housing supply, pushing thousands of Black and Latino families off the property ladder. Tens of thousands of workers who would like to invest in a home are instead stuck paying rent, and putting up with the associated uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While not all corporate landlords are bad landlords, some are bad landlords. Corporations are more likely to threaten to evict and to actually evict their tenants. They are also prone to skimping on maintenance and upkeep. “At the neighborhood level, when more than half of the properties are owned by outside investors—when you’ve now flipped that neighborhood from being primarily homeowner driven to investor driven—that matters, because homeowners behave very differently, politically and otherwise,” McCarthy said. An out-of-state investment firm might be less likely than a longtime resident or a local property manager to plant shade trees and demand safe sidewalks, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In response to the rising corporate ownership of homes, a variety of politicians have pushed for policy fixes. In New York, Governor Kathy Hochul has proposed legislation barring firms from bidding on single-family or two-family homes for the first 75 days they are on the market. Washington State is contemplating capping the number of units that corporations can own. Other legislators have suggested revoking tax benefits from large-scale owners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;McCarthy said that caps probably would not work well: Corporations might simply set up multiple entities to get around the rules and keep purchasing properties, for instance. “It’s just not going to fly,” he said. But he supports treating firms that own more than 10 properties in a given jurisdiction as commercial owners rather than residential owners, subjecting them to higher property-tax rates and higher taxes on their capital gains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If nothing is done, what’s happening to majority-Black communities in Ohio and Virginia and Georgia and Michigan might start happening in communities around the country. Private equity might not be causing the housing crisis, but corporate owners could end up making it a lot worse for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
