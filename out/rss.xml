    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Stories From 25 Years of Software Development&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last year, I completed 20 years in professional software development. I wanted to write a post to mark the occasion back then, but couldn't find the time. This post is my attempt to make up for that omission. In fact, I have been involved in software development for a little longer than 20 years. Although I had my first taste of computer programming as a child, it was only when I entered university about 25 years ago that I seriously got into software development. So I'll start my stories from there. These stories are less about software and more about people. Unlike many posts of this kind, this one offers no wisdom or lessons. It only offers a collection of stories. I hope you'll like at least a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Contents&lt;/head&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Good Blessings&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The CTF Scoreboard&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Viewing the Source&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The first story takes place in 2001, shortly after I joined university. One evening, I went to the university computer laboratory to browse the Web. Out of curiosity, I typed &lt;code&gt;susam.com&lt;/code&gt; into the address bar and landed on
  its
  home page.  I remember the text and banner looking much larger
  back then.  Display resolutions were lower, so they covered almost
  half the screen.  I knew very little about the Internet then and I
  was just trying to make sense of it.  I remember wondering what it
  would take to create my own website, perhaps at
  &lt;code&gt;susam.com&lt;/code&gt;.  That's when an older student who had been
  watching me browse over my shoulder approached and asked if I had
  created the website.  I told him I hadn't and that I had no idea how
  websites were made.  He asked me to move aside, took my seat and
  clicked View &amp;gt; Source in Internet Explorer.  He then explained
  how websites are made of HTML pages and how those pages are simply
  text instructions.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, he opened Notepad and wrote a simple HTML page that looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;BODY&amp;gt;&amp;lt;FONT COLOR="RED"&amp;gt;HELLO&amp;lt;/FONT&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/BODY&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Yes, we had a &lt;code&gt;FONT&lt;/code&gt; tag back then and it was common
  practice to write HTML tags in uppercase.  He then opened the page
  in a web browser and showed how it rendered.  After that, he
  demonstrated a few more features such as changing the font face and
  size, centring the text and altering the page's background colour.
  Although the tutorial lasted only about ten minutes, it made the
  World Wide Web feel far less mysterious and much more fascinating.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; That person had an ulterior motive though. After the tutorial, he never returned the seat to me. He just continued browsing the Web and waited for me to leave. I was too timid to ask for my seat back. Seats were limited, so I returned to my dorm room both disappointed that I couldn't continue browsing that day and excited about all the websites I might create with this newfound knowledge. I could never register &lt;code&gt;susam.com&lt;/code&gt; for myself though.
  That domain was always used by some business selling Turkish
  cuisines.  Eventually, I managed to get the next best thing:
  a &lt;code&gt;.net&lt;/code&gt; domain of my own.  That brief encounter in the
  university laboratory set me on a lifelong path of creating and
  maintaining personal websites.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Reset Vector&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; The second story also comes from my university days. One afternoon, I was hanging out with my mates in the computer laboratory. In front of me was an MS-DOS machine powered by an Intel 8086 microprocessor, on which I was writing a lift control program in assembly. In those days, it was considered important to deliberately practise solving made-up problems as a way of honing our programming skills. As I worked on my program, my mind drifted to a small detail about the 8086 microprocessor that we had recently learnt in a lecture. Our professor had explained that, when the 8086 microprocessor is reset, execution begins with CS:IP set to FFFF:0000. So I murmured to anyone who cared to listen, 'I wonder if the system will reboot if I jump to FFFF:0000.' I then opened &lt;code&gt;DEBUG.EXE&lt;/code&gt; and jumped to that address.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;C:\&amp;gt;DEBUG -G =FFFF:0000&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The machine rebooted instantly. One of my friends, who topped the class every semester, had been watching over my shoulder. As soon as the machine restarted, he exclaimed, 'How did you do that?' I explained that the reset vector is located at physical address FFFF0 and that the CS:IP value FFFF:0000 maps to that address in real mode. After that, I went back to working on my lift control program and didn't think much more about the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About a week later, the same friend came to my dorm room. He sat down with a grave look on his face and asked, 'How did you know to do that? How did it occur to you to jump to the reset vector?' I must have said something like, 'It just occurred to me. I remembered that detail from the lecture and wanted to try it out.' He then said, 'I want to be able to think like that. I come top of the class every semester, but I don't think the way you do. I would never have thought of taking a small detail like that and testing it myself.' I replied that I was just curious to see whether what we had learnt actually worked in practice. He responded, 'And that's exactly it. It would never occur to me to try something like that. I feel disappointed that I keep coming top of the class, yet I am not curious in the same way you are. I've decided I don't want to top the class anymore. I just want to explore and experiment with what we learn, the way you do.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was all he said before getting up and heading back to his dorm room. I didn't take it very seriously at the time. I couldn't imagine why someone would willingly give up the accomplishment of coming first every year. But he kept his word. He never topped the class again. He still ranked highly, often within the top ten, but he kept his promise of never finishing first again. To this day, I feel a mix of embarrassment and pride whenever I recall that incident. With a single jump to the processor's reset entry point, I had somehow inspired someone to step back from academic competition in order to have more fun with learning. Of course, there is no reason one cannot do both. But in the end, that was his decision, not mine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Man in the Middle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my first job after university, I was assigned to a technical support team where part of my work involved running an installer to deploy a specific component of an e-banking product for customers, usually large banks. As I learnt to use the installer, I realised how fragile it was. The installer, written in Python, often failed because of incorrect assumptions about the target environment and almost always required some manual intervention to complete successfully. During my first week on the project, I spent much of my time stabilising the installer and writing a step-by-step user guide explaining how to use it. The result was well received by both my seniors and management. To my surprise, the user guide received more praise than the improvements I made to the installer itself. While the first few weeks were productive, I soon realised I would not find the work fulfilling for long. I wrote to management a few times to ask whether I could transfer to a team where I could work on something more substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My emails were initially met with resistance. After several rounds of discussion, however, someone who had heard about my situation reached out and suggested a team whose manager might be interested in interviewing me. The team was based in a different city. I was young and willing to relocate wherever I could find good work, so I immediately agreed to the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was in 2006, when video conferencing was not yet common. On the day of the interview, the hiring manager called me on my office desk phone. He began by introducing the team, which was called Archie, short for architecture. The team developed and maintained the web framework and core architectural components on which the entire e-banking product was built. The product had existed long before open source frameworks such as Spring or Django came into existence, so features such as API routing, authentication and authorisation layers, cookie management, etc. were all implemented in-house as Java Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP). Since the software was used in banking environments, it also had to pass strict security testing and regular audits to minimise the risk of serious flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The interview began well. He asked several questions related to software security, such as what SQL injection is and how it can be prevented or how one might design a web framework that mitigates cross-site scripting attacks. He also asked programming questions, most of which I answered pretty well. Towards the end, however, he asked how we could prevent MITM attacks. I had never heard the term, so I admitted that I did not know what MITM meant. He then asked, 'Man in the middle?' but I still had no idea what that meant or whether it was even a software engineering concept. He replied, 'Learn everything you can about PKI and MITM. We need to build a digital signatures feature for one of our corporate banking products. That's the first thing we'll work on.'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks, I studied RFCs and documentation related to public key infrastructure, public key cryptography standards and related topics. At first, the material felt intimidating, but after spending time each evening reading whatever relevant literature I could find, things gradually began to make sense. Concepts that initially seemed complex and overwhelming eventually felt intuitive and elegant. I relocated to the new city a few weeks later and delivered the digital signatures feature about a month after joining the team. We used the open source Bouncy Castle library to implement the feature. After that project, I worked on other parts of the product too. The most rewarding part was knowing that the code I was writing became part of a mature product used by hundreds of banks and millions of users. It was especially satisfying to see the work pass security testing and audits and be considered ready for release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was my first real engineering job. My manager also turned out to be an excellent mentor. Working with him helped me develop new skills and his encouragement gave me confidence that stayed with me for years. Nearly two decades have passed since then, yet the product is still in service and continues to be actively developed. In fact, in my current phase of life I sometimes encounter it as a customer. Occasionally, I open the browser's developer tools to view the page source where I can still see traces of the HTML generated by code I wrote almost twenty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sphagetti Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around 2007 or 2008, I began working on a proof of concept for developing widgets for an OpenTV set-top box. The work involved writing code in a heavily trimmed-down version of C. One afternoon, while making good progress on a few widgets, I noticed that they would occasionally crash at random. I tried tracking down the bugs, but I was finding it surprisingly difficult to understand my own code. I had managed to produce some truly spaghetti code full of dubious pointer operations that were almost certainly responsible for the crashes, yet I could not pinpoint where exactly things were going wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ours was a small team of four people, each working on an independent proof of concept. The most senior person on the team acted as our lead and architect. Later that afternoon, I showed him my progress and explained that I was still trying to hunt down the bugs causing the widgets to crash. He asked whether he could look at the code. After going through it briefly and probably realising that it was a bit of a mess, he asked me to send him the code as a tarball, which I promptly did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He then went back to his desk to study the code. I remember thinking that there was no way he was going to find the problem anytime soon. I had been debugging it for hours and barely understood what I had written myself; it was the worst spaghetti code I had ever produced. With little hope of a quick solution, I went back to debugging on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barely five minutes later, he came back to my desk and asked me to open a specific file. He then showed me exactly where the pointer bug was. It had taken him only a few minutes not only to read my tangled code but also to understand it well enough to identify the fault and point it out. As soon as I fixed that line, the crashes disappeared. I was genuinely in awe of his skill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have always loved computing and programming, so I had assumed I was already fairly good at it. That incident, however, made me realise how much further I still had to go before I could consider myself a good software developer. I did improve significantly in the years that followed and today I am far better at managing software complexity than I was back then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Animated Television Widgets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In another project from that period, we worked on another set-top box platform that supported Java Micro Edition (Java ME) for widget development. One day, the same architect from the previous story asked whether I could add animations to the widgets. I told him that I believed it should be possible, though I'd need to test it to be sure. Before continuing with the story, I need to explain how the different stakeholders in the project were organised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our small team effectively played the role of the software vendor. The final product going to market would carry the brand of a major telecom carrier, offering direct-to-home (DTH) television services, with the set-top box being one of the products sold to customers. The set-top box was manufactured by another company. So the project was a partnership between three parties: our company as the software vendor, the telecom carrier and the set-top box manufacturer. The telecom carrier wanted to know whether widgets could be animated on screen with smooth slide-in and slide-out effects. That was why the architect approached me to ask whether it could be done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I began working on animating the widgets. Meanwhile, the architect and a few senior colleagues attended a business meeting with all the partners present. During the meeting, he explained that we were evaluating whether widget animations could be supported. The set-top box manufacturer immediately dismissed the idea, saying, 'That's impossible. Our set-top box does not support animation.' When the architect returned and shared this with us, I replied, 'I do not understand. If I can draw a widget, I can animate it too. All it takes is clearing the widget and redrawing it at slightly different positions repeatedly. In fact, I already have a working version.' I then showed a demo of the animated widgets running on the emulator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following week, the architect attended another partners' meeting where he shared updates about our animated widgets. I was not personally present, so what follows is second-hand information passed on by those who were there. I learnt that the set-top box company reacted angrily. For some reason, they were unhappy that we had managed to achieve results using their set-top box and APIs that they had officially described as impossible. They demanded that we stop work on animation immediately, arguing that our work could not be allowed to contradict their official position. At that point, the telecom carrier's representative intervened and bluntly told the set-top box representative to just shut up. If the set-top box guy was furious, the telecom guy was even more so, 'You guys told us animation was not possible and these people are showing that it is! You manufacture the set-top box. How can you not know what it is capable of?'&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I continued working on the proof of concept. It worked very well in the emulator, but I did not yet have access to the actual hardware. The device was still in the process of being shipped to us, so all my early proof-of-concepts ran on the emulator. The following week, the architect planned to travel to the set-top box company's office to test my widgets on the real hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time, I was quite proud of demonstrating results that even the hardware maker believed were impossible. When the architect eventually travelled to test the widgets on the actual device, a problem emerged. What looked like buttery smooth animation on the emulator appeared noticeably choppy on a real television. Over the next few weeks, I experimented with frame rates, buffering strategies and optimising the computation done in the the rendering loop. Each week, the architect travelled for testing and returned with the same report: the animation had improved somewhat, but it still remained choppy. The modest embedded hardware simply could not keep up with the required computation and rendering. In the end, the telecom carrier decided that no animation was better than poor animation and dropped the idea altogether. So in the end, the set-top box developers turned out to be correct after all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Good Blessings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in 2009, after completing about a year at RSA Security, I began looking for work that felt more intellectually stimulating, especially projects involving mathematics and algorithms. I spoke with a few senior leaders about this, but nothing materialised for some time. Then one day, Dr Burt Kaliski, Chief Scientist at RSA Laboratories, asked to meet me to discuss my career aspirations. I have written about this in more detail in another post here: Good Blessings. I will summarise what followed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr Kaliski met me and offered a few suggestions about the kinds of teams I might approach to find more interesting work. I followed his advice and eventually joined a team that turned out to be an excellent fit. I remained with that team for the next six years. During that time, I worked on parser generators, formal language specification and implementation, as well as indexing and querying engines of a petabyte-scale database. I learnt something new almost every day during those six years. It remains one of the most enjoyable periods of my career. I have especially fond memories of working on parser generators alongside remarkably skilled engineers from whom I learnt a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Years later, I reflected on how that brief meeting with Dr Kaliski had altered the trajectory of my career. I realised I was not sure whether I had properly expressed my gratitude to him for the role he had played in shaping my path. So I wrote to thank him and explain how much that single conversation had influenced my life. A few days later, Dr Kaliski replied, saying he was glad to know that the steps I took afterwards had worked out well. Before ending his message, he wrote this heart-warming note:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;‘One of my goals is to be able to provide encouragement to others who are developing their careers, just as others have invested in mine, passing good blessings from one generation to another.’&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The CTF Scoreboard&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This story comes from 2019. By then, I was no longer a twenty-something engineer just starting out. I was now a middle-aged staff engineer with years of experience building both low-level networking systems and database systems. Most of my work up to that point had been in C and C++. I was now entering a new phase of my career where I would be leading the development of microservices written in Go and Python. Like many people in this profession, computing has long been one of my favourite hobbies. So although my professional work for the previous decade had focused on C and C++, I had plenty of hobby projects in other languages, including Python and Go. As a result, switching gears from systems programming to application development was a smooth transition for me. I cannot even say that I missed working in C and C++. After all, who wants to spend their days occasionally chasing memory bugs in core dumps when you could be building features and delivering real value to customers?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In October 2019, during Cybersecurity Awareness Month, a Capture the Flag (CTF) event was organised at our office. The contest featured all kinds of technical puzzles, ranging from SQL injection challenges to insecure cryptography problems. Some challenges also involved reversing binaries and exploiting stack overflow issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am usually rather intimidated by such contests. The whole idea of competitive problem-solving under time pressure tends to make me nervous. But one of my colleagues persuaded me to participate in the CTF. And, somewhat to my surprise, I turned out to be rather good at it. Within about eight hours, I had solved roughly 90% of the puzzles. I finished at the top of the scoreboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my younger days, I was generally known to be a good problem solver. I was often consulted when thorny problems needed solving and I usually managed to deliver results. I also enjoyed solving puzzles. I had a knack for them and happily spent hours, sometimes days, working through obscure mathematical or technical puzzles and sharing detailed write-ups with friends of the nerd variety. Seen in that light, my performance at the CTF probably should not have surprised me. Still, I was very pleased. It was reassuring to know that I could still rely on my systems programming experience to solve obscure challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the course of the contest, my performance became something of a talking point in the office. Colleagues occasionally stopped by my desk to appreciate my progress in the CTF. Two much younger colleagues, both engineers I admired for their skill and professionalism, were discussing the results nearby. They were speaking softly, but I could still overhear parts of their conversation. Curious, I leaned slightly and listened a bit more carefully. I wanted to know what these two people, whom I admired a lot, thought about my performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of them remarked on how well I was doing in the contest. The other replied, 'Of course he is doing well. He has more than ten years of experience in C.' At that moment, I realised that no matter how well I solved those puzzles, the result would naturally be credited to experience. In my younger days, when I solved tricky problems like these, people would sometimes call me smart. Now people simply saw it as a consequence of my experience. Not that I particularly care for labels such as 'smart' anyway, but it did make me realise how things had changed. I was now simply the person with many years of experience. Solving technical puzzles that involved disassembling binaries, tracing execution paths and reconstructing program logic was expected rather than remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I continue to sharpen my technical skills to this day. While my technical results may now simply be attributed to experience, I hope I can continue to make a good impression through my professionalism, ethics and kindness towards the people I work with. If those leave a lasting impression, that is good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Software Factories And The Agentic Moment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We built a Software Factory: non-interactive development where specs + scenarios drive agents that write code, run harnesses, and converge without human review.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The narrative form is included below. If you'd prefer to work from first principles, I offer a few constraints &amp;amp; guidelines that, applied iteratively, will accelerate any team toward the same intuitions, convictions1, and ultimately a factory2 of your own. In kōan or mantra form:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Why am I doing this? (implied: the model should be doing this instead)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In rule form:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code must not be written by humans&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code must not be reviewed by humans&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, in practical form:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you haven't spent at least $1,000 on tokens today per human engineer, your software factory has room for improvement&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The StrongDM AI Story&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On July 14th, 2025, Jay Taylor and Navan Chauhan joined me (Justin McCarthy, co-founder, CTO) in founding the StrongDM AI team.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The catalyst was a transition observed in late 2024: with the second revision of Claude 3.5 (October 2024), long-horizon agentic coding workflows began to compound correctness rather than error.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By December of 2024, the model's long-horizon coding performance was unmistakable via Cursor's YOLO mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to this model improvement, iterative application of LLMs to coding tasks would accumulate errors of all imaginable varieties (misunderstandings, hallucinations, syntax, version DRY violations, library incompatibility, etc). The app or product would decay and ultimately "collapse": death by a thousand cuts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Together with YOLO mode, the updated model from Anthropic provided the first glimmer of what we now refer to internally as non-interactive development or grown software.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Find Knobs, Turn To Eleven&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the first hour of the first day of our AI team, we established a charter which set us on a path toward a series of findings (which we refer to as our "unlocks"). In retrospect, the most important line in the charter document was the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initially it was just a hunch. An experiment. How far could we get, without writing any code by hand?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not very far! At least: not very far, until we added tests. However, the agent, obsessed with the immediate task, soon began to take shortcuts: return true is a great way to pass narrowly written tests, but probably won't generalize to the software you want.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tests were not enough. How about integration tests? Regression tests? End-to-end tests? Behavior tests?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;From Tests to Scenarios and Satisfaction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One recurring theme of the agentic moment: we need new language. For example, the word "test" has proven insufficient and ambiguous. A test, stored in the codebase, can be lazily rewritten to match the code. The code could be rewritten to trivially pass the test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We repurposed the word scenario to represent an end-to-end "user story", often stored outside the codebase (similar to a "holdout" set in model training), which could be intuitively understood and flexibly validated by an LLM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because much of the software we grow itself has an agentic component, we transitioned from boolean definitions of success ("the test suite is green") to a probabilistic and empirical one. We use the term satisfaction to quantify this validation: of all the observed trajectories through all the scenarios, what fraction of them likely satisfy the user?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Validating Scenarios in the Digital Twin Universe&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In previous regimes, a team might rely on integration tests, regression tests, UI automation to answer "is it working?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We noticed two limitations of previously reliable techniques:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tests are too rigid - we were coding with agents, but we're also building with LLMs and agent loops as design primitives; evaluating success often required LLM-as-judge&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tests can be reward hacked - we needed validation that was less vulnerable to the model cheating&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Digital Twin Universe is our answer: behavioral clones of the third-party services our software depends on. We built twins of Okta, Jira, Slack, Google Docs, Google Drive, and Google Sheets, replicating their APIs, edge cases, and observable behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the DTU, we can validate at volumes and rates far exceeding production limits. We can test failure modes that would be dangerous or impossible against live services. We can run thousands of scenarios per hour without hitting rate limits, triggering abuse detection, or accumulating API costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Unconventional Economics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our success with DTU illustrates one of the many ways in which the Agentic Moment has profoundly changed the economics of software. Creating a high fidelity clone of a significant SaaS application was always possible, but never economically feasible. Generations of engineers may have wanted a full in-memory replica of their CRM to test against, but self-censored the proposal to build it. They didn't even bring it to their manager, because they knew the answer would be no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those of us building software factories must practice a deliberate naivete: finding and removing the habits, conventions, and constraints of Software 1.0. The DTU is our proof that what was unthinkable six months ago is now routine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Read Next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Principles: what we believe is true about building software with agents&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Techniques: repeated patterns for applying those principles&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Products: tools we use daily and believe others will benefit from&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know he did other things than Larry, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We talked with Al Lowe about Leisure Suit Larry, but mostly other stuff. This was Roar’s first interview and he ran out of time before he could dive into what Al is mostly known for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al Lowe is an American software developer who started making games in the early eighties. His is mostly known for the Leisure Suit Larry games, created with Sierra, but he is also a musical man who loves playing his sax and still plays with his model trains. He has also created lots of other games for Sierra, not only the Larry series.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think Al is great, but you already know all you need to know about Larry, then this is the article for you. And it is pretty long. Get your coffee now, before continuing…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Have you ever been to Norway?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Oh yeah, sure. I have this eyeball right here. It works because I spent a week recuperating in the Department of Ophthalmology at Oslo University Hospital. I had a detached retina when we were flying into Oslo, and went to an ophthalmologist, and she said to get to the hospital right now. The next morning a bunch of Norwegian women started poking around in my eye and fixed it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, I was blind in that eye for the next week, and I was already blind in the other eye, so I wandered around in the dark while my wife went sightseeing. I went with her, but I didn’t see any sights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: So you have felt and smelt the beautiful fjords, but never seen them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, on an earlier trip, we did take the railroad to Bergen. Over the mountain plateau [Hardangervidda]. So we spent some time there, and that was fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I’ve never actually taken that trip myself, but I heard it’s wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: It was not for us. We got to the top, up in the top of the mountains. And the electricity went off. And so, we parked in the middle of this beautiful snowy scene for three hours, before they finally got the power back on. Then we went on our journey but we had already missed the connecting rides. We had booked a trip on a boat through the fjords, and a trip on the cog railway. We missed all of them. So be sure you go when there is electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah, we like to joke about that in Norway, the richest country in the world and the lousiest trains. I guess that is a good segue, because you do like trains, don’t you? At least model trains?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yes, I do. I’ve been a model railroader for most of my life. I got my first model train when I was 2 years old, and my dad wouldn’t let me play with it. So he ran it around the Christmas tree and I had to watch. But eventually, when I was 9 or 10, I got interested in HO size trains, and built a layout in our basement. Completely by myself, I had no idea what I was doing or anything, but I just learned as I went, piddled around and figured it out. I went to the hobby shop sometime and would say stuff like: How do you glue this stuff to this stuff? And they’d give me some special glue and and teach me how.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, it was fun. I learned a lot, and I proved that I could do things with my hands. I ended up learning a lot about wiring and electricity. And scenery, I did stuff with papier-mâché. I took old tomato sticks from our garden, cut them in different heights. I wrapped old screen door wire over the top of them and coated that with plaster to make mountains and stuff. So I did a lot of stuff, mostly things I’d read about in magazines, but I think it helped me understand that I could learn something if I didn’t already know it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Did you add any miniature figures or models and stuff like that in the scenery as well?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Sure, yeah, lots of stuff. In fact, I built buildings out of balsa wood. And I read an article in a magazine that said if you hold your X-Acto knife at just the right angle and drag it across the balsa wood, you can make clapboard siding, you know, where the siding overlaps. I also built doors from scraps of wood.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, it was fun. It’s a fun hobby, and it served me for ten years at first. Then I went to college and started playing music, and I forgot about it. But then when my son was 10 years old I thought: I liked doing this when I was 10, maybe he will. So we went to the hobby shop and bought a bunch of trains. Of course he wasn’t interested at all, but I got hooked again! So for the last 35 years I’ve been doing N-scale trains, where the locomotive is about five inches long.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: So your son is 45, then?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yes!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yes, then you could have been my dad, because I’m 46.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, you’re the right age, then, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Model trains are not what they used to be&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I was sent a link to the National Model Railroad Association where you are mentioned as a member of the board of directors of the 4th Division of the Pacific Northwest region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: The Pacific Northwest Region of the NMRA, yeah. I did that for 10 years at least. Then I was assistant director for another 10 years so I worked at that organization for about 20 years. But recently I said: That’s enough, let some new blood come in. So we got new people now, and they’re much better, so I’m happy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: But you didn’t get any money for it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: No, no, it’s a volunteer organization. At first we did a paper newsletter every month. We would print and fold and staple and stamp and address-label hundreds of newsletters. I did that for a couple years until I finally convinced everybody that we’ve got to go online. So then I made a PDF, posted it, and we sent out an email. That was much better, but we still had a few die-hard people that would download it and print it out every time. I was part of this for 24 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Are there any physical magazines about model trains today?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yes. Well, the man who ran one of the biggest ones just passed away and so his magazine’s gone now, but there’s still a magazine called N Scale, and it’s housed right here in the suburb of Seattle. It is distributed all over the world. And then there’s the National Model Railroad Association, which publishes a magazine every month, all over the world. And then there’s Model Railroader and Railroad Model Craftsman. I know there’s one for each of the scales, for HO and S and O and G for garden railroads.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: It’s an old hobby. A weird hobby, in that it follows my path. Most people get interested in trains when they’re little kids. And then they grow out of it in high school. Then later in life, they realize: I got time and money now. I could get back in it, this is a good hobby. And it really is. It’s great socially, because the group that I’m in have a layout that’s portable and we can bring it to shows. So 6-8 times a year we pack everything up into a trailer, move it to a place, and set it up. And we run trains all weekend, we talk with the public and hundreds of people come by and see my work. Then we pack it up and put it back in the trailer and then wait for the next show. So it doesn’t get old because it’s so long between shows. It’s really fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I guess there’s not that much development in the field, so even though you haven’t done it for 20 years, it’s not that hard to just continue where you left off?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Actually, it has changed completely with computers. So you couldn’t be more wrong! Actually, you were correct for 40 years at least. But in the 90s people started developing computerized means of running the trains. And in the mid-90s, the National Model Railroad Association set up standards and said: If you follow all these rules then your stuff can run on anybody’s system. And that’s when it really changed over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About 2001 or 2002, we went from the old system, which was a rheostat that controlled the amount of voltage applied to the rails, just like a volume control. So we went from a potentiometer that changed the amount of power to the tracks to constantly powered tracks, with a computer chip inside each locomotive. It has a number address that you can set. Then on your remote control you can type in the number of the locomotive you want to drive, turn a knob, and it sends a radio signal through the air to a computer that’s permanently affixed to the layout. And that computer multiplexes a serial signal on top of the power, just kind of like your old phone modems where they overlaid a signal on top of the regular phone lines. It then tells the locomotive to go this fast, back up, or sound the whistle and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I guess for you this was not a bad thing at all, because you love that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Oh, no, right? It was right up my the alley there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I have some experience painting Warhammer miniature figures. Did you paint miniatures yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah. The trouble with N Scale is that the people are very small. It’s a challenge to paint. We always tell everybody that the hard part is getting the eyelashes right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: And that’s at least one thing that does not get easier with age.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: No, no, that’s true. But I have lots of special tools for that. I have an optimizer that has LED lights built around it, so I can zoom right in on things and paint the tiny little stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Pretending to be a cyborg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, well … getting the help I need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Al Lowe and music&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Music is very important to you. And people wouldn’t think about music when they hear your name. But for me, I got this mp3-file in the late 90s with the title: «Al Lowe – For Your Thighs Only». And that played the music from Leisure Suit Larry. So then I learned the name. And of course, I had played these games earlier, but never picked up on the name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I hope you paid me a royalty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah, of course! So for me you were a musician before I found out that you had also created these games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, I was involved with a lot of Sierra products in one way or another. I worked on their spelling program when they had a word processor. I worked on their assembler for Apple II. I worked on … God, just a lot of different stuff. 26 products in 16 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh, yeah, I should plug my website. Tell people, if they have gotten this far, they should visit my website. There’s lots more stuff there. If you enjoy this, you’ll enjoy that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah, I believe I will. Your kids, did they go for music, game developing, or anything else in their father’s footsteps?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Of course not. They’re my kids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Since you’re a saxophone player, I would guess that you can play a lot of other instruments as well?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, I was a high school band director, so I had to learn to play every instrument somewhat. So, I can pick up a viola and play badly, and I can play a trombone or French horn, but my real instrument is the saxophone and also flute and clarinet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: So, what kind of music do you like?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Big Band Jazz. But I play as much as I listen. I tend to watch films and read books, but I play music. I’m in two big bands, where I play lead alto sax. And they meet every week for a couple hours in the evening. And I’m in two saxophone quartets that meet a little less regularly, but we play classical saxophone music, and also some pop songs and things, but it’s just four saxophones, and so we get a lot of interesting work. That’s real fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I’ve been looking at this YouTube video, where you played in a band called The David Hasselhoff Big Band.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yes, the group is ironically named.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Metallica had been covered by a band of four cello players. Would it be possible to do something like that with saxophones?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: It would absolutely be possible, but the question is, why would you do that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: That is the better question. I guess being Norwegian, I don’t really feel like any music should be without some kind of growling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Al Lowe and television&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Do you watch any modern series on television?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: We watch a lot of Scandinavian noir shows. A lot of Danish and a couple of Norwegian shows. And we watch them in Norwegian with subtitles. We don’t want to use the English voiceover, because they are usually not very good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: No, I would guess not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: It is easier and better just to listen to the Norwegian and not know what you’re saying, but be able to read the subtitles and get the gist. I can’t think of a title right now, but we’ve got a long list on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah. Today it’s very easy to consume whatever you want to consume. Even though you don’t necessarily own the stuff you watch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: From very early on I didn’t want to own any movies or TV shows. We never bought anything. I always felt like I would rather just rent and see something new – see more stuff, instead of looking at the same thing over and over. And so, I didn’t build up a collection of VHS or DVDs. I was «streaming» when that was still analog. We got discs in the mail, you know. That was pretty advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah like Netflix, the original Netflix?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Al Lowe and humor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: What about humor? The modern humor scene versus the old humor scene. Some things that were acceptable to say back in the eighties are not any more, and so on, and we even rewrite old things to make them more «modern». Do you have any views about this issue, being an old humorist yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, I said and did things in the eighties’ games that I would never dream of doing now. Let’s put it that way. On the other hand, violence seems to be quite popular. I don’t understand it. We get scared of humor, but yet, you just can’t blow a person up any more than we do now. It is an odd situation isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yep. There has also been so much nudity in the last 10 years in all kinds of movies, and very explicit nudity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, which I enjoy. I have no problem with that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah, yeah, I won’t complain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, all in all, I guess my opinion is that things have gotten better. How long has it been since I wrote Larry 1? 35 years? No, 38 years. So in the 38 years since I wrote Larry 1, I think all of that stuff has gotten better, with the exception of violence. I’m not happy with that. I think we show too much, too often, and too strongly and too dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: It’s very brutal now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: But, you know, I think all these things are a pendulum, right? You know, it’s gonna swing over here, and then eventually it’s gonna swing back. Typical human behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yes, that’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: We’ll see what happens. Well, I won’t see what happens. You can see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Old Sierra games&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yes. Um, I guess I also have to talk to you about the old Sierra games. And these might not be the most original questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, I only want original questions…..&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: You had, among other things, been working on the Dark Crystal Game: Gelfling Adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, I did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: And growing up when I did, I loved watching that old Dark Crystal movie. It was pretty scary when I was eight or nine, but man, what a wonderful movie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: It was. Yeah, it sure was. And Roberta [Williams] was delighted when Jim Henson asked her to do a computer game based on Dark Crystal. And I was delighted, because after the artists had done all the backgrounds and things for Dark Crystal, Sierra asked me to spin off an educational version of it. We called it the Gelfling Adventure, and it wasn’t a big hit, but it was sure fun to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I would guess if you could get it today, in a big box, it would be worth a fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I used to have a copy, but I think I sold it on eBay when I cleaned out my attic. I had an attic full of games, and finally I just put them on eBay and sold them off one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: You did? Was it that collection Metal Jesus Rocks bought?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Ah, no, that was not a game, that was stuff from Sierra. We should tell people what we’re referring to – there’s a YouTube channel called Metal Jesus Rocks. And he came over and did an interview one day at my house.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah, I saw that, you showed him all your cool stuff. And that is gone now?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: He convinced me that I should put it up on eBay, and somebody would buy it. And I said, no, nobody would do that. Who would want such a silly thing?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, it turned out that the current owner of Sierra, Activision [now owned my Microsoft] got mad and sent me a cease and desist letter: If you sell this, there might be something on those disks that we own. We don’t know what it is, you may not know what it is, and you may doubt that it’s there, but if there’s anything we’ll sue you. So I was like: oh, shit, what? Whatever I would get from selling it wouldn’t be nearly enough to pay a lawyer to defend me. So, I pulled it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: So, it’s still up there, if you look. Let’s see if I can adjust the camera a little. *Shows boxes of stuff in the background* Right there, those black boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Did you ever get to meet Jim Henson?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I did not, no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: He was big back then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, my wife and I never missed an episode of The Muppet Show. It was one of the most creative and funny things. Just warm-hearted, good, kind spirited, and funny as hell. Just a great show. And the first movie was also great. Then the second Muppet movie was maybe a little less, and the third one was a little less, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I did like the movies too. More than I liked The Muppet Show, because I was too young to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: The Muppet Show had a lot humor that went over kids’ heads, you know?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: And also, all those guests, I had no idea who they were.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I knew every one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: That does help. But I have seen the episodes as an adult, and now I enjoy them, because now I know who these people are.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, I highly recommended it. Still funny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Leisure Suit Larry&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: That brings me to the first Leisure Suit Larry game. It had all these questions at the start that was usually based on American pop culture or politics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end you just ended up writing down every question you could get. Then the answer you tried and whether it was correct or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: That’s how you did it? You know, all you had to do was press Alt-X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yes, we found that out after a while. But it was a very good way of learning English before that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: And now you know who Spiro Agnew was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah, but that’s also because of the Futurama series. He was a recurring character there being Nixon’s vice president and helper. But knowing that was not normal as a 10-year-old kid in Norway in the late 80s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Who was not Vice-President of the United States in 1973-74?&lt;p&gt;a. Gerald Ford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b. Nelson Rockefeller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c. Thomas Hayden&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d. Spiro Agnew&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Spiro Agnew is&lt;p&gt;a. a form of social disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b. a jazz-fusion rock band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c. a former Vice President.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d. the first woman in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;The germ that transmits syphilis is&lt;p&gt;a. Spiro Agnew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b. Spirochete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c. Spirograph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;d. Barbarella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who or what was Spiro Agnew? More of these on Als homepage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Disney games&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: My first real computer was a Commodore 64. So my first love with your stuff, without even knowing it was you, was Donald Ducks Playground.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Oh, yeah! I was very proud of that game. That won a bunch of educational awards over here, and was a successful product for Disney. Not as successful for Sierra and Al Lowe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: It was probably a cheap licence to get?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: They had no idea what any of the games or computers was about. They had a couple of women who worked for them, and did educational film strips, movie slideshows and, you know, educational workbooks and stuff like that they sold to schools. And so they told these two women: You take charge of this computer thing because it’s kind of like a movie projector or a slot film strips, and I think it’s got a screen, so you’re in charge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, I quickly realised that I knew much more, and I knew Sierra knew much more than they did. A couple of the other products we did were Mickey’s Space Adventure and Goofy’s Word Factory (never released). Those guys consulted with them often about how to create their product. But I took the approach: I’m too busy to talk to you until I get it done, and when I get it done, I’ll show it to you. And they bought off on that for a while. They didn’t know what I was doing. Then finally I said: Okay, it’s done, take a look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, then they had a big, long list of changes that we should make, because for them to be important, they had to put some mark on the product. They said; Well, I think that the leaf should be red instead of green, or I think his pants should be this instead of that, or this should be over in that corner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I said: Well, you know, I could make all those changes, or we could ship the product and make some money. What do you want to do? And Ken Williams said: Well, ship it, you know, let’s get it out. And so, I pretty much did that entire product without any input from Disney. And it was the same with Donald Duck. They had changes they wanted to make, but they weren’t improvements. If they had come up with something better, then yeah, I would have done it. Because I wanted to make it better, but just to make this color a little different, or move that thing over one pixel, you know, that made no difference whatsoever. Anyway, that’s my Disney story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: It’s such a nice-looking game. And I learned about quarters and dollars and cents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I haven’t seen it in 40 years, probably.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: In other games, like Winnie the Pooh or Mickey’s Space Adventure, you improved on the Zork formula. You added graphics. And you didn’t have to type in what you wanted to do, but instead clicked buttons with text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Did you ever play the Black Cauldron?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: No, but I did look at a YouTube video, and I thought: Maybe this is a Sierra game where you cannot die. But ah, I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Oh, no, you can. I didn’t know it at the time, but I feel like I invented the point-and-click adventure. Because that whole game could be played with a mouse or a joystick. It could be played just by pointing and moving to where you wanted to go. And then using the function keys – I’m doing it the old-fashioned way, using the keys on the right side of the keyboard where God intended them to be instead of up here, where nobody can hit them. But anyway, I used the function keys instead of clicking icons and stuff. Roberta added the icons with King’s Quest V, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Working for, but not being employed by Sierra&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: How was it working with the Williamses?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, I have no complaints, they bought me a nice house, bought me some nice cars, let me retire at 52, so I will say I was pretty happy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah, because you stayed there your whole career. At least your whole gaming career?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I resigned from my teaching gig and started working for Ken full-time. After six months, he hit hard times. There was one Friday the company started the morning with 120 employees. And in the afternoon it had been cut to 40 employees. So they fired two-thirds of the company that day, including me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He then called me into the office and said: I want you to keep working. I don’t want you to quit and leave. I want you to work on this product. And, I’ll give you advances against future royalties instead of a salary. I said, whoa, how much are we talking here? What kind of advances? Well, I can do this much for that. I asked: What about this other game you wanted? Because I was going to work on that. Oh, yeah, yeah, we’ll add that on, too. So I can do that one, and we’ll give you so much for that one. And I said, okay, well, what about the translation to Atari and Commodore for, you know, Winnie the Pooh or something? Oh, yeah, you would do that too. So I added up all the advances he was talking about and it was double the salary he had been paying me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Ah! Haha, nice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I figured I could get it done in a year so I said: Okay, that sounds good. Have I just been fired? Yep. Great, thanks! And I shook his hand, and for the next 15 and a half years I was an outside contractor who only worked on a contract basis. I got royalties instead of salary, and ended up having a great relationship with Sierra until Ken left the company. And when Ken got bought out by this … well, I don’t know how much depth you want to go into that, but there was a really ugly end for Sierra, where they were bought out in a hostile takeover by one of their board members, who were then convicted and sent to prison for fifteen years for fraud. So it was an ugly end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: When Ken left, the writing was on the wall. It was pretty obvious that they didn’t have anybody who could replace him, and there was nobody to replace Roberta. Sierra’s new method of product development was: Listen to a pitch, fund that pitch, let them do a lot of work on it, and then look at the product when it’s half done and not fun with nothing to see. Then they’d get cold feet and say: Oh, gosh, I don’t know if we should spend the rest of the money. Then cancel it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They just went through this endless churn of, you know, we’ll start a new product, oh no, oh, uh, no, we’ll cancel that. Now let’s do another one. Oh, yeah, yeah, that sounds good. Oh, wait, it doesn’t look very good… Well, it’s not done, dumbass. So the company quickly went into this….. Did you ever see the old World War II movies when they would shoot a plane and it would spiral out?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Oh yeah!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, that’s what Sierra felt like for about a year there. You could just see all the good people jumping ship and going to better companies. And all the bad people were staying around and making products that were even worse. And so, maybe two years after Ken left the company, they decided to move what little work was left to Los Angeles and merge with Blizzard. Then they turned off the lights and sent all the employees home. They locked the doors, and that was the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Including the end of all the historic materials that we used to create the games, which were carefully… well, I shouldn’t say that. That’s a lie. They were uncarefully stored. They were thrown in a box, put in a cabinet, and then when they needed cabinet space, they rented a storage unit and threw them in there. Then at the end somebody said: Why are we paying money for a storage unit for all this old crap? Then they burned it all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Oh, they burned it?!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Oh, yeah, it was just the dumbest thing. That was the end of the company. I had a few cells of animation that survived, but there’s very little of that stuff left anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: But at least you did have a copy of the source code for your games?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, for the early games I made. Once you got to Larry 6, the games were too big and you couldn’t back them up anymore. I think it was like 5 or 6 CDs, and at some point along there I just gave up. I have the source material for Larry 7, but I have no way to compile it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: If you put it online, someone will create a compiler, I’m pretty sure of it. People are nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: It’s too bad they didn’t let me sell the source code, because one of the things I loved doing was writing comments in the code. And more often than not, the comments were funnier than the game. It was a shame to let that all go to waste.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: When you say the later games, you talk about games like Torin’s Passage and Freddy Pharkas, yeah?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, I have the source material for that somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: There are some projects that emulate these old games. ScummVM, I think, now supports a lot of non-Scumm games as well. So it might be that someone is thinking about Freddy Pharkas and Torin’s Passage for that engine [this is actually true for both these titles].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yeah, maybe. I’m not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: It’s not impossible and I guess that’s also a point with these old games. They are fun to play, but usually because you did play them as a kid. If I gave Leisure Suit Larry to my kids today, I’m not sure if they would like them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, they would have to think. Sierra games were about thinking, they weren’t about shooting or killing, or building things. They were about figuring out things in your brain, and that’s something that we seem to be losing as a species.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: That’s true. It’s also very popular to look at other people playing games today, on Twitch and Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: That I don’t understand at all. And I think part of it is because the games that people watch don’t require thinking, or the same kind of puzzle solving. They’re certainly thinking in shooter games, but it’s not the same, you know? You don’t sit and ponder something. You don’t wait around, figure out what to do. Can I do this? How would I do that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah. Did you ever play that Softporn Adventure game without any hints?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Uh, only with the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Because I think you have a sound argument that people don’t like to think today, but there are a lot strange solutions that are not that obvious in the old games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sierra and stairs:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Why did all the old Sierra games always have these difficult stairs everywhere?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: I can’t tell you other than you had to get to a different level. I actually spoofed that in, uh, Larry 2, I think? We had a cliff face and you had to walk this narrow path alongside a cliff. If you slipped, you went over the side, but you grabbed with this long arm that extended out and then brought you back up like a rubber band, so you couldn’t die on those stairs or on that cliff. That was my joke on those stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But you’re right, it was a definite feature of Sierra games. Also, the deaths were because we often didn’t know what people would try. And when they would try something, we had no code in there to handle that. What were we gonna do? You couldn’t ignore it. I think somewhere, Larry 3, maybe, I added the feature that said: When you die you can go back to a game you saved, or you can just go back to life. And that seemed much more friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Yeah? And you also had these very funny comments about you dying when you died.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Oh, sure. Yeah, it was always fun for me to make fun of the player. And there was something else that I want to bring to you that I don’t know that people have noticed. My games always referred to Larry as you. So when I talk to the player, I would say: You did this, you fell off a cliff, that was a dumb thing you did. Whereas a lot of other games referred to the main character in the third person. It was: Larry has fallen off, you know? But I always felt it like it was more meaningful to me as a player if the game referred to me as a person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: I agree. And you can only blame yourself for trying to pet that cat or something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Yep. Yep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Someone created a game: Stair Quest. It’s a game where you move like you do in the old Sierra games, and there are these very thin diagonal stairs that you have to traverse, and you fall off all the time and die.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Well, the trick with the stairs usually was to use the keys on the numeric keyboard. You’d have to use all of the keypad, including the diagonals. But I guess people didn’t always have keypads. So when the layout changed it made it pretty difficult to move.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roar: Hmm, that’s a very good point. And with that I will let you get on with the day. It was wonderful meeting you, Al Lowe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Al: Nice to meet you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’d like to thank Al Lowe for talking with us!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;SectorC: A C Compiler in 512 bytes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SectorC (github) is a C compiler written in x86-16 assembly that fits within the 512 byte boot sector of an x86 machine. It supports a subset of C that is large enough to write real and interesting programs. It is quite likely the smallest C compiler ever written.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a base64 encoding, it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Supported language&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fairly large subset is supported: global variables, functions, if statements, while statements, lots of operators, pointer dereference, inline machine-code, comments, etc. All of these features make it quite capable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the following program animates a moving sine-wave:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int y;
int x;
int x_0;
void sin_positive_approx()
{
  y = ( x_0 * ( 157 - x_0 ) ) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 7;
}
void sin()
{
  x_0 = x;
  while( x_0 &amp;gt; 314 ){
    x_0 = x_0 - 314;
  }
  if( x_0 &amp;lt;= 157 ){
    sin_positive_approx();
  }
  if( x_0 &amp;gt; 157 ){
    x_0 = x_0 - 157;
    sin_positive_approx();
    y = 0 - y;
  }
  y = 100 + y;
}


int offset;
int x_end;
void draw_sine_wave()
{
  x = offset;
  x_end = x + 314;
  while( x &amp;lt;= x_end ){
    sin();
    pixel_x = x - offset;
    pixel_y = y;
    vga_set_pixel();
    x = x + 1;
  }
}

int v_1;
int v_2;
void delay()
{
  v_1 = 0;
  while( v_1 &amp;lt; 50 ){
    v_2 = 0;
    while( v_2 &amp;lt; 10000 ){
      v_2 = v_2 + 1;
    }
    v_1 = v_1 + 1;
  }
}

void main()
{
  vga_init();

  offset = 0;
  while( 1 ){
    vga_clear();
    draw_sine_wave();

    delay();
    offset = offset + 1;
    if( offset &amp;gt;= 314 ){ // mod the value to avoid 2^16 integer overflow
      offset = offset - 314;
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Screenshot&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;But, how?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I started thinking about SectorC, I had just finished Deobfuscating OTCC with a lot of its ideas freshly loaded into my head. I also just had some healthy doses of justine.lol and Tom7 to inspire the absurdity of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did I think I would succeed? I suspected NO. Fit an entire C compiler in 510 bytes of instruction memory? Good luck (sarcasm).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tokenizing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first problem came quickly. In C, the tokenizer/lexer alone seems larger than one 512 byte sector! We need to consume an arbitrary stream of bytes and produce “tokens”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int main()
{
  if( a &amp;lt; 5 ){
    func();
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would be consumed and converted into:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;'int'  TOKEN_KEYWORD_INT
'main' TOKEN_IDENTIFIER
'('    TOKEN_LPAREN
')'    TOKEN_RPAREN
'{'    TOKEN_LBRACE
'if'   TOKEN_KEYWORD_IF
'('    TOKEN_LPAREN
'a'    TOKEN_IDENTIFIER
'&amp;lt;'    TOKEN_OPERATOR
'5'    TOKEN_NUMBER
')'    TOKEN_RPAREN
'{'    TOKEN_LBRACE
'func' TOKEN_IDENTIFIER
'('    TOKEN_LPAREN
')'    TOKEN_RPAREN
';'    TOKEN_SEMI
'}'    TOKEN_RBRACE
'}'    TOKEN_RBRACE
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need to specifically recognize &lt;code&gt;keywords&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;identifiers&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;operators&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;numbers&lt;/code&gt;. And then we need to convert numbers from string to integer with something like &lt;code&gt;atoi()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int atoi(const char *s)
{
  int n = 0;
  while (1) {
    char c = *s++;
    if (!c) break;
    n = 10 * n + (c - '0');
  }
  return n;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote a fairly straight-forward and minimalist lexer and it took &amp;gt;150 lines of C code. A crude estimate of the same code in x86-16 would require 300-450 bytes minimum (e.g. a simple &lt;code&gt;add ax,bx&lt;/code&gt; instruction encodes as 2 bytes). And this doesn’t include any symbol table, recursive-descent parser, code-generator, branch-patching, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No Chance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, naturally … I continued. Always pick the losers. The lolz are more fun that way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Big Insight #1&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Big Insight #1 came while thinking about other languages such as Forth. The tokenizer in Forth is nearly trivial. Every token is simply space-delimited. Every token is just called a &lt;code&gt;WORD&lt;/code&gt; and nothing is special (slight lie). Hmm, how about a C that does that? So dreamed up a C that is technically still a C, is probably turing-complete, and will definitely make every code maintainer terrified. 😏&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will call it the Barely C Programming Language:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;int done , a , b , c , p , cond ;
int(main)(){while(!done){
     a = b - c ;
     *(int*) p = b - c ;
     a = *(int*) p ;
     if(cond) a = b - 45 ;
}}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here we have spacing strategically placed to create “mega-tokens”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example: &lt;code&gt;int(main)(){while(!done){&lt;/code&gt; is one such "mega-token".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a sense, we actually have a language more like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;VAR_BEGIN done AND a AND b AND c AND p AND cond END
MAIN_BEGIN
  a = b - c END
  DEREF p = b - c END
  a = DEREF p END
  COND a = b - 45 END
MAIN_END
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, a normal C compiler will also recognize it as C!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even after using space-delimiters, we still have a lot of tokens and need to find more ways to minimize the tokenizer. What is essential? Well it’s quite hard to avoid the &lt;code&gt;atoi()&lt;/code&gt; if we want to actually have integer literals. What else do we need? How about nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Big Insight #2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Big Insight #2 is that &lt;code&gt;atoi()&lt;/code&gt; behaves as a (bad) hash function on ordinary text. It consumes characters and updates a 16-bit integer. Hashes are perhaps the holy-grail of computer-science.
With a good hash, we can just side-step all the hard problems by trading them for an even harder problem (hash collisions), and then we just ignore that harder problem. Brilliant. (sticks fingers in ears) 🤪&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we have this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Token Type&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Meaning of atoi()&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Integer Literal&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;uint16 number&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Keyword&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;token ”enum” value&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Identifier&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;hash value into a 64K array&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Implementing Barely C&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first implementation of Barely C fit in 468 bytes. It was a simple recursive-descent parser over the &lt;code&gt;atoi&lt;/code&gt; tokens. There was no symbol table of any kind. Variables simply access a 64K segment using the hash value. Codegen is emitted somewhat similar to OTCC, using &lt;code&gt;ax&lt;/code&gt; as the result register and shuffling values to the stack and then to &lt;code&gt;cx&lt;/code&gt; for binary operators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Minimizing with Byte-Threaded Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an attempt to steal every good idea Forth ever had, I then dreamed up what I will call “byte-threaded-code”. Since a sector is 512 bytes, if we simply align address on a 2-byte boundary, we can do addressing with a single byte! We can have a series of “gadgets” and do forth-style threading:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bits 16
  cpu 386

  jmp 0x07c0:entry

entry:
  push cs
  pop  ds

  lea si,operations
next:
  xor ax,ax
  lodsb
  add ax,ax
  push next
  jmp ax

putch:
  mov ah,0x01
  mov al,bl
  mov dx,0
  int 0x14
  ret

  align 2
hang:
  jmp hang

  align 2
print_F:
  mov bx,'F'
  jmp putch

  align 2
print_G:
  mov bx,'G'
  jmp putch

operations:
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 20  ; print_G
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 20  ; print_G
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 17  ; print_F
  db 20  ; print_G
  db 16  ; hang
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Annoyingly, &lt;code&gt;nasm&lt;/code&gt; won’t let you do something like &lt;code&gt;db print_F/2&lt;/code&gt; so I had to write a custom little assembler to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alas, this idea didn’t work out. In 512 bytes, the overhead of this Forth-style computation model doesn’t pay for itself. There are a lot of little overheads: 2 byte alignment, extra &lt;code&gt;ret&lt;/code&gt; instructions, calling other “threads”, the &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; function, etc. The byte-threaded version of Barely C ended up at the same size as the straight-forward version&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the idea is fun and I decided to document it anyways in the event that someone else finds utility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Minimizing the Straight-Forward version&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, I returned to the straight-forward version and minimized it as much as possible. From 468 bytes ⇒ 303 bytes (165 bytes saving): 510 - 303 ⇒ 207 spare bytes to use for new features!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some tricks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reorganize code to allow “fall-through” instead of &lt;code&gt;jmp&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Use tail-calls via &lt;code&gt;jmp&lt;/code&gt;wherever possible&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Perform call-fusion (e.g. &lt;code&gt;call tok_next2&lt;/code&gt;instead of&lt;code&gt;call tok_next; call tok_next&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Utilize &lt;code&gt;stosw&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;lodsw&lt;/code&gt;extensively&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Eliminate machine code tables for cheaper inline &lt;code&gt;stosw&lt;/code&gt;versions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prefer &lt;code&gt;cmp ax,imm&lt;/code&gt;over&lt;code&gt;cmp bx,imm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Keep jump offsets within 8-bits to encode more efficiently&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Look Ma, A Real C!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As it turns out, a lot can be accomplished in 200 bytes if you already have a tokenizer, parser, and code-generator in 300 bytes. With these 200 bytes, Barely C became a proper C:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Arbitrarily nested &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;statement block with an arbitrary expression condition&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Arbitrarily nested &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;statement block with an arbitrary expression condition&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Lots of operators: &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Grouping expressions: &lt;code&gt;( expression )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Function definitions and recursive function calls (using &lt;code&gt;func()&lt;/code&gt;as a hash value into a symbol table at segment 0x3000)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A special &lt;code&gt;asm&lt;/code&gt;statement for inline machine-code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single-line &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt;comments&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-line &lt;code&gt;/*&lt;/code&gt;comments&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A trick to do “space-injection” before semicolons to make code look more normal&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The biggest enabler here is the &lt;code&gt;binary_oper_tbl&lt;/code&gt; which allows for a very cheap way to add lots of operations. Each operator is simply a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;16-bit token-value&amp;gt; &amp;lt;16-bit-machine-code&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; pair, costing just 4 bytes.The above 14 operators cost just 56 bytes plus a little overhead to scan the table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Grammar&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the full grammer specification:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;program     = (var_decl | func_decl)+
var_decl    = "int" identifier ";"
func_decl   = "void" func_name "{" statement* "}"
func_name   = &amp;lt;identifier that ends in "()" with no space&amp;gt;
statement   = "if(" expr "){" statement* "}"
            | "while(" expr "){" statement* "}"
            | "asm" integer ";"
            | func_name ";"
            | assign_expr ";"
assign_expr = deref? identifier "=" expr
deref       = "*(int*)"
expr        = unary (op unary)?
unary       = deref identifier
            | "&amp;amp;" identifier
            | "(" expr ")"
            | indentifier
            | integer
op          = "+" | "-" | "&amp;amp;" | "|" | "^" | "&amp;lt;&amp;lt;" | "&amp;gt;&amp;gt;"
            | "==" | "!=" | "&amp;lt;" | "&amp;gt;" | "&amp;lt;=" | "&amp;gt;="
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, both &lt;code&gt;// comment&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/* multi-line comment */&lt;/code&gt; styles are supported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(NOTE: This grammar is 704 bytes in ascii, 38% larger than it's implementation!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Inline Machine-Code&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A programming language without I/O is useless. And, as the C language is defined in an I/O agnostic way, we need some way out. Thus, an &lt;code&gt;asm&lt;/code&gt; extension is supported. This allows programs to generate raw x86-16 machine code literals inline. Using &lt;code&gt;asm&lt;/code&gt;, programs can access any low-level detail of the machine. This is used extensively in the example code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Error-Handling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is “error-handling”? 🤣&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In traditional C style, we trust the programmer to write correct and well-formed programs. We are certain they are all minor gods and goddesses with the ability of perfection. Obviously, spending bytes on error-checking would be foolish. Surely all will agree that this is a very reasonable standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the less divine among us, a &lt;code&gt;lint&lt;/code&gt; was also written (that doesn’t fit in a sector) to detect errors. The author certainly didn’t require this tool for development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Runtime&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If C compiler writers were a secret shadow organization like the Free Masons, Illuminati, Lizard Peoples, or Pizzagaters our inner-secret would be “C actually has a runtime”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SectorC has a runtime under &lt;code&gt;rt/&lt;/code&gt; consisting of two files implemented in C itself:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rt/lib.c:&lt;/code&gt;A collection of library routines, often coded in inline&lt;code&gt;asm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rt/_start.c:&lt;/code&gt;The actual entry-point&lt;code&gt;_start()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The runtime code is concatenated with program source to construct the full source to compile and run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Examples&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few examples are provided that leverage the unique hardware aspects of the x86-16 IBM PC:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;examples/hello.c:&lt;/code&gt;Print a text greeting on the screen writing to memory at&lt;code&gt;0xB8000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;examples/sinwave.c:&lt;/code&gt;Draw a moving sine wave animation with VGA Mode 0x13 using an appropriately bad approximation of&lt;code&gt;sin(x)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;examples/twinkle.c:&lt;/code&gt;Play “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” through the PC Speaker (Warning: LOUD)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems fitting to end an article with “takeaways” or “what did we learn”. So.. umm.. what did we learn? Honestly, I’m not sure. But in the interest of fun, here’s a Choice Your Own Adventure version of What Did We Learn:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a simple code exploration, inspired by (and stollen from) https://iventions.com/, saw it on X here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this example, I'm trying to implement a menu that is revealed when the user clicks on a button. With HTML+CSS only. No JS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two clip-paths:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The menu is revealed by a circle that grows from the top-left corner of the screen to the bottom-right corner. A fun clip-path calculation that I used here (clip-path: circle(calc(1.42 * 100vmax) at 0 0);) is based on the vmax, which is the larger of the viewport width or height. Then multiplied it by 1.42, because 1.42 is the square root of 2, which is the ratio of the width to the height of the viewport.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second clip-path is a polygon that is used to simulate the "ray". The polygon is hardcoded now, but it can be calculated with js, for dynamic dimension that respect the navigation dimensions for responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for stopping by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/doc&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46925811</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 17:45:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Speed up responses with fast mode</title><link>https://code.claude.com/docs/en/fast-mode</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="bc5356da75338b48"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast mode is in research preview. The feature, pricing, and availability may change based on feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/fast&lt;/code&gt; when you need speed for interactive work like rapid iteration or live debugging, and toggle it off when cost matters more than latency.
Fast mode is not a different model. It uses the same Opus 4.6 with a different API configuration that prioritizes speed over cost efficiency. You get identical quality and capabilities, just faster responses.
What to know:
&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;/fast&lt;/code&gt;to toggle on fast mode in Claude Code CLI. Also available via&lt;code&gt;/fast&lt;/code&gt;in Claude Code VS Code Extension.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fast mode for Opus 4.6 pricing starts at $30/150 MTok. Fast mode is available at a 50% discount for all plans until 11:59pm PT on February 16.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Available to all Claude Code users on subscription plans (Pro/Max/Team/Enterprise) and Claude Console.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;For Claude Code users on subscription plans (Pro/Max/Team/Enterprise), fast mode is available via extra usage only and not included in the subscription rate limits.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Toggle fast mode&lt;/head&gt;Toggle fast mode in either of these ways:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Type &lt;code&gt;/fast&lt;/code&gt;and press Tab to toggle on or off&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;"fastMode": true&lt;/code&gt;in your user settings file&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;If you’re on a different model, Claude Code automatically switches to Opus 4.6&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;You’ll see a confirmation message: “Fast mode ON”&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;A small &lt;code&gt;↯&lt;/code&gt;icon appears next to the prompt while fast mode is active&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;/fast&lt;/code&gt;again at any time to check whether fast mode is on or off&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;code&gt;/fast&lt;/code&gt; again, you remain on Opus 4.6. The model does not revert to your previous model. To switch to a different model, use &lt;code&gt;/model&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Understand the cost tradeoff&lt;/head&gt;Fast mode has higher per-token pricing than standard Opus 4.6:&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Mode&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Input (MTok)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Output (MTok)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="3"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Fast mode on Opus 4.6 (&amp;lt;200K)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;$30&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;$150&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Fast mode on Opus 4.6 (&amp;gt;200K)&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;$60&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;$225&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Decide when to use fast mode&lt;/head&gt;Fast mode is best for interactive work where response latency matters more than cost:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Rapid iteration on code changes&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Live debugging sessions&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Time-sensitive work with tight deadlines&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Long autonomous tasks where speed matters less&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Batch processing or CI/CD pipelines&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Cost-sensitive workloads&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fast mode vs effort level&lt;/head&gt;Fast mode and effort level both affect response speed, but differently:&lt;table&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Setting&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Effect&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row span="2"&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Fast mode&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Same model quality, lower latency, higher cost&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Lower effort level&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Less thinking time, faster responses, potentially lower quality on complex tasks&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Requirements&lt;/head&gt;Fast mode requires all of the following:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Not available on third-party cloud providers: fast mode is not available on Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Azure Foundry. Fast mode is available through the Anthropic Console API and for Claude subscription plans using extra usage.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Extra usage enabled: your account must have extra usage enabled, which allows billing beyond your plan’s included usage. For individual accounts, enable this in your Console billing settings. For Teams and Enterprise, an admin must enable extra usage for the organization.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast mode usage is billed directly to extra usage, even if you have remaining usage on your plan. This means fast mode tokens do not count against your plan’s included usage and are charged at the fast mode rate from the first token.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Admin enablement for Teams and Enterprise: fast mode is disabled by default for Teams and Enterprise organizations. An admin must explicitly enable fast mode before users can access it.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your admin has not enabled fast mode for your organization, the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/fast&lt;/code&gt; command will show “Fast mode has been disabled by your organization.”&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Enable fast mode for your organization&lt;/head&gt;Admins can enable fast mode in:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Console (API customers): Claude Code preferences&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Claude AI (Teams and Enterprise): Admin Settings &amp;gt; Claude Code&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Handle rate limits&lt;/head&gt;Fast mode has separate rate limits from standard Opus 4.6.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A local device focused AI assistant built in Rust — persistent memory, autonomous tasks, ~27MB binary. Inspired by and compatible with OpenClaw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;cargo install localgpt&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Single binary — no Node.js, Docker, or Python required&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Local device focused — runs entirely on your machine, your memory data stays yours&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Persistent memory — markdown-based knowledge store with full-text and semantic search&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Autonomous heartbeat — delegate tasks and let it work in the background&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiple interfaces — CLI, web UI, desktop GUI&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiple LLM providers — Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI, Ollama&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OpenClaw compatible — works with SOUL, MEMORY, HEARTBEAT markdown files and skills format&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Full install (includes desktop GUI)
cargo install localgpt

# Headless (no desktop GUI — for servers, Docker, CI)

# Ask a single question
localgpt ask "What is the meaning of life?"

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm generally pretty pro-AI with one major exception: agentic coding. My consistent impression is that agentic coding does not actually improve productivity and deteriorates the user's comfort and familiarity with the codebase. I formed that impression from:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Every time I use agentic coding tools I'm consistently unimpressed with the quality of the results.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;my experiences interviewing candidates&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I allow interview candidates to use agentic coding tools and candidates who do so consistently performed worse than other candidates, failing to complete the challenge or producing incorrect results1. This was a huge surprise to me at first because I expected agentic coding to confer an unfair advantage but â¦ nope!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;research studies&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Studies like the Becker study and Shen study show that users of agentic coding perform no better and sometimes worse when you measure productivity in terms of fixed outcomes rather than code velocity/volume.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't believe agentic coding is a lost cause, but I do believe agentic coding in its present incarnation is doing more harm than good to software development. I also believe it is still worthwhile to push on the inadequacies of agentic coding so that it empowers developers and improves code quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, in this post I'm taking a different tack: I want to present other ways to leverage AI for software development. I believe that agentic coding has so captured the cultural imagination that people are sleeping on other good and underexplored solutions to AI-assisted software development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The master cue&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like to design tools and interfaces from first principles rather than reacting to industry trends/hype and I've accrued quite a few general design principles from over a decade of working in DevProd and also an even longer history of open source projects and contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of those design principles is my personal "master cue", which is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A good tool or interface should keep the user in a flow state as long as possible&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This principle isn't even specific to AI-assisted software development, and yet still highlights why agentic coding sometimes misses the mark. Both studies and developer testimonials show that agentic coding breaks flow and keeps developers in an idle/interruptible holding pattern more than ordinary coding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, the Becker study took screen recordings and saw that idle time approximately doubled:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe we can improve AI-assisted coding tools (agentic or not) if we set our north star to âpreserve flow stateâ.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Calm technology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calm technology is a design discipline that promotes flow state in tools that we build. The design principles most relevant to coding are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;tools should minimize demands on our attention&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Interruptions and intrusions on our attention break us out of flow state.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;tools should be built to be âpass-throughâ&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A tool is not meant to be the object of our attention; rather the tool should reveal the true object of our attention (the thing the tool acts upon), rather than obscuring it. The more we use the tool the more the tool fades into the background of our awareness while still supporting our work.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;tools should create and enhance calm (thus the name: calm technology)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A state of calm helps users enter and maintain flow state.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Non-LLM examples of calm technology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engineers already use âcalmâ tools and interfaces as part of our work and here are a couple of examples you're probably already familiar with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Inlay hints&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IDEs (like VSCode) can support inlay hints that sprinkle the code with useful annotations for the reader, such as inferred type annotations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These types of inlay hints embody calm design principles because:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they minimize demands on our attention&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They exist on the periphery of our attention, available for us if we're interested but unobtrusive if we're not interested.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they are built to be âpass-throughâ&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They don't replace or substitute the code that we are editing. They enhance the code editing experience but the user is still in direct contact with the edited code. The more we use type hints the more they fade into the background of our awareness and the more the code remains the focus of our attention.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they create and enhance calm&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They promote a sense of calm by informing our understanding of the code passively. As one of the Calm Technology principles puts it: âTechnology can communicate, but doesn't need to speakâ.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;File tree previews&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tools like VSCode or GitHub's pull request viewer let you preview at a glance changes to the file tree, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might think to yourself âthis is a very uninteresting thing to use as an exampleâ but that's exactly the point. The best tools (designed with the principles of calm technology) are pervasive and boring things that we take for granted (like light switches) and that have faded so strongly into the background of our attention that we forget they even exist as a part of our daily workflow (also like light switches).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;File tree previews:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;minimize demands on our attention&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They're there if we need the information, but easy to ignore (or even forget they exist) if we don't use them.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;are built to be âpass-throughâ&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When we interact with the file tree viewer we are interacting directly with the filesystem and the interaction between the representation (the viewer) and the reality (the filesystem) feels direct, snappy, and precise. The more we use the viewer the more the representation becomes indistinguishable from the reality in our minds.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;create and enhance calm&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We do not need to constantly interact with the file tree to gather up-to-date information about our project structure. It passively updates in the background as we make changes to the project and those updates are unobtrusive and not attention-grabbing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chat-based coding agents are not calm&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can think about the limitations of chat-based agentic coding tools through this same lens:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they place high demands on our attention&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The user has to either sit and wait for the agent to report back or do something else and run the LLM in a semi-autonomous manner. However, even semi-autonomous sessions prevent the user from entering flow state because they have to remain interruptible.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they are not built to be âpass-throughâ&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Chat agents are a highly mediated interface to the code which is indirect (we interact more with the agent than the code), slow (we spend a lot of time waiting), and imprecise (English is a dull interface).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they undermine calm&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The user needs to constantly stimulate the chat to gather new information or update their understanding of the code (the chat agent doesn't inform the user's understanding passively or quietly). Chat agents are also fine-tuned to maximize engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Prior art for calm design&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Inline suggestions from GitHub Copilot&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the earliest examples of an AI coding assistant that begins to model calm design principles is the OG AI-assistant: GitHub Copilot's support for inline suggestions, with some caveats I'll go into.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This does one thing really well:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;it's built to be âpass-throughâ&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The user is still interacting directly with the code and the suggestions are reasonably snappy. The user can also ignore or type through the suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, by default these inline suggestions violate other calm technology principles:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they demand our attention&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By default Copilot presents the suggestions quite frequently and the user has to pause what they're doing to examine the output of the suggestion. After enough times the user begins to condition themselves into regularly pausing and waiting for a suggestion which breaks them out of a flow state. Now instead of being proactive the user's been conditioned by the tool to be reactive.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they undermine calm&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;GitHub Copilot's inline suggestion interface is visually busy and intrusive. Even if the user ignores every suggestion the effect is still disruptive: suggestions appear on the user's screen in the center of their visual focus and the user has to decide on the spot whether to accept or ignore them before proceeding further. The user also can't easily passively absorb information presented in this way: understanding each suggestion requires the user's focused attention.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â¦ buuuuut these issues are partially fixable by disabling the automatic suggestions and requiring them to be explicitly triggered by &lt;code&gt;Alt&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;.  However, unfortunately that also disables the next feature, which I like even more:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Next edit suggestions (also from GitHub Copilot)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next edit suggestions are a related GitHub Copilot feature that display related follow-up edits throughout the file/project and let the user cycle between them and possibly accept each suggested change. They behave like a âsuper-charged find and replaceâ:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These suggestions do an amazing job of keeping the user in a flow state:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they minimize demand on the user's attention&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The cognitive load on the user is smaller than inline suggestions because the suggestions are more likely to be bite-sized (and therefore easier for a human to review and accept).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they're built to be âpass-throughâ&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just like inline suggestions, next edit suggestions still keep the user in close contact with the code they are modifying.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;they create and enhance calm&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Suggestions are presented in an unobtrusive way: they aren't dumped in the dead center of the user's attention and they don't demand immediate review. They exist on the periphery of the user's attention as code suggestions that the user can ignore or focus on at their leisure.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AI-assisted calm technology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe there is a lot of untapped potential in AI-assisted coding tools and in this section I'll sketch a few small examples of how we can embody calm technology design principles in building the next generation of coding tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Facet-based project navigation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could browse a project by a tree of semantic facets. For example, if you were editing the Haskell implementation of Dhall the tree viewer might look like this prototype I hacked up2:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal here is to not only provide a quick way to explore the project by intent, but to also improve the user's understanding of the project the more they use the feature. "String interpolation regression" is so much more informative than &lt;code&gt;dhall/tests/format/issue2078A.dhall&lt;/code&gt;3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, the above video is based on a real tool and not just a mock. You can find the code I used to generate that tree of semantics facets here and I'll write up another post soon walking through how that code works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Automated commit refactor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could take an editor session, a diff, or a pull request and automatically split it into a series of more focused commits that are easier for people to review. This is one of the cases where the AI can reduce human review labor (most agentic coding tools create more human review labor).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is some prior art here but this is still a nascent area of development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;File lens&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You could add two new tools to the user's toolbar or context menu: âFocus onâ¦â and âEdit asâ¦â.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;âFocus onâ¦â would allow the user to specify what they're interested in changing and present only files and lines of code related to their specified interest. For example, if they want to focus on âcommand line optionsâ then only related files and lines of code would be shown in the editor and other lines of code would be hidden/collapsed/folded. This would basically be like âZen modeâ but for editing a feature domain of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Getting the correct output wasn't even supposed to be the hard part of the coding challenge. The standard interview challenge provided the candidate with a golden output that their program needed to match and despite that agentic coders would not only fail to match the golden output but sometimes not even realize their program didn't match the golden output because they hadn't even run their agentically coded solution to check if it was correct. The actual hard part of the coding challenge was supposed to be follow-up questions about the journey to production, which vibe coders also performed worse on. â©&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terminals, however, are in many cases based on general purpose architectures, just lashed to restrictive firmware — a good example would be the DEC VT220 which is controlled by our old friend the Intel 8051 — and game consoles likewise fall naturally in this category. Plus, there's a third group of computer-adjacent devices that qualify as well: the video titlers.&lt;/p&gt;Video titlers (also known as character generators) are exactly what they sound like: devices that stamp bitmap data, usually text, on top of a video signal, like this typical example from a 1992 demo video for the consumer-oriented Videonics Video Titler. Distinct from what you might do as part of an editing system, many of these machines operate in real-time and over live video input such as the classic Chyron systems. Today's titlers are usually add-on boards controlled by a standard desktop computer, but for much of their existence they came as standalone devices with their own CPUs and video hardware, and that means they can be potentially hardware-hacked like anything else.&lt;p&gt;Well, Canada, you have your own indigenous video titlers as well, and here's one designed and manufactured in beautiful Montréal: the Scriptovision Super Micro Script, circa 1985.&lt;/p&gt;The Super Micro Script was one of several such machines this company made over its lifetime, a stylish self-contained box capable of emitting a 32x16 small or 10x4 large character layer with 64x32 block graphics in eight colours. It could even directly overlay its output over a composite video signal using a built-in genlock, one of the earliest such consumer units to do so. Crack this unit open, however, and you'll find the show controlled by an off-the-shelf Motorola 6800-family microcontroller and a Motorola 6847 VDG video chip, making it a relative of contemporary 1980s home computers that sometimes used nearly exactly the same architecture.&lt;p&gt;More important than that, though, it has socketed EPROMs we can theoretically pull and substitute with our own — though we'll have to figure out why the ROMs look like nonsense, and there's also the small matter of this unit failing to generate a picture. Nevertheless, when we're done, another homegrown Canadian computer will rise and shine. We'll even add a bitbanged serial port and write a MAME emulation driver for it so we can develop software quickly ... after we fix it first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding filmed art and transparencies, early static television titles were generated by monoscopes, modified cathode ray tubes that fired their electron guns at embedded plates marked with a metallized image. These units then assimilated the reflected particles into a sharp monochrome video signal. Related devices like the 1953 Hughes Typotron or 1954 Convair Charactron used a double-deflection system where an electron beam was first used to illuminate selected glyphs in a perforated stencil anode and then onto the desired position on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;The union of the monoscope with these techniques yielded hybrids like the 1966 Raytheon CK1414 and 1969 RCA 4560, which could produce a display character by character by having a monoscope repeatedly scan subsections of a plate "font" under computer control. The resulting signal was then used to generate each display frame on a second CRT. Although crude and sometimes flickery, these methods yielded sharp clean characters that were clearly more flexible than fixed monoscope images or labouriously creating superimposable high-contrast art with stencils and Letraset sheets. Simultaneously, solid state systems equipped with what we would now call bitmap images, stored in core memory, could string them together on the fly to generate simple fixed-width font displays. In 1970 CBS Laboratories expanded on this technology with the Vidifont, the first video title generator capable of proportional characters. It was sold openly until CBS shuttered the CBS Laboratories division and the Vidifont was further internally refined into a colour-capable version exclusively used for CBS News broadcasts. (CBS later won an Emmy in 1992 for the Vidifont's development.) Meanwhile, Systems Research Corporation, a contractor who provided the Vidifont's "Vidiloop" tape storage system used for creating text off-line before running it on-air, spied an opportunity and got into the market themselves. Their first product in 1971, the Chiron [sic], used the competing 1967 AB Dick Videograph 990 with an improved monospace font and colourized text, supporting creation of full-frame and lower-thirds displays that could be recorded and retrieved. The name was later changed to Chyron due to an existing trade name in California, and renaming themselves after their flagship product, the Chyron Corporation became virtually synonymous with broadcast TV graphics. One of SRC's original founders was Francis Mechner, a research psychologist who had recently sold his company to Xerox and was SRC/Chyron's initial investor, and whose eldest son Jordan Mechner went on to develop games like Karateka and Prince of Persia. Such devices generally produced their output using large and complex assemblies made from discrete components, which also made them prohibitively expensive outside of the studio. Although multi-chip assemblies could generate bit patterns using early types of MOS ROM, the first complete character generator "on a chip" wasn't introduced until 1969, the TMS2400JC series from Texas Instruments. (The earlier Fairchild 3250 character generator could only emit numbers.) Presented with an input — which could come directly from the data bus — these chips would emit a 5x7 character from an internal mask array selectable by row, suitable for conversion to a video signal, with its simultaneous sibling TMS4100JC and TMS4880JC series offering alternative character matrix sizes. This chip family became one of a long series of TI character generators and was used in devices like the Alphacom Terminal Computer, though their output was not sufficiently high quality for general broadcast use. An evolved version of the concept appeared in the 1972 Signetics 2513, best known as the character generator in the original Apple I.&lt;p&gt;By 1980 a number of relatively inexpensive video display chips were available on the open market, all capable of basic text output and even some simple graphics, including the Signetics 2637 Universal Video Interface (UVI), the Texas Instruments TMS9918 Video Display Processor (VDP) and the Motorola 6847 Video Display Generator (VDG). Videotape recording had also gotten less expensive in the meantime, putting it within reach of a sufficiently determined (or financially irresponsible) enthusiast, and these were certainly the very same people who wanted to do their own character work just like the TV studios. It's not exactly clear what would qualify as the first home video titler, and many early home computers were likely used for such a task, but one Canadian company in particular surely has a strong claim.&lt;/p&gt;Scriptovision was founded in Montréal, Québec by Michel and Robert Champagne in 1981. Their inagural product was developed that same year and a strong contender to be our landmark first: the Micro Script, a handheld character generator with a blister keypad that could produce 32x16 text simultaneously with simple 64x32 colour block graphics over composite video. I can find no obvious references to a similar prosumer product prior to theirs, so I proffer it as the winner. The Champagnes produced both fully assembled units and kit parts, with a complete ready-to-go unit available for US$169 [in 2026 dollars about $580] "plus 4.7% import duty" if shipped to the United States. Michel Champagne wrote a two-part article for Radio-Electronics in April and May 1982 discussing its internals and its operation, including a full schematic and images of the printed circuit board. The Micro Script did not have a built-in genlock (short for "generator lock"), which is to say it could not overlay its own output over another video signal, though this also made it less electronically complex and therefore cheaper. Its simple display was nevertheless amenable to being used in that fashion with an external genlock or similar device, such as this still from a YouTube video that employed a slightly later Micro Script Model II. A user could create up to two "pages" of artwork and flip between them instantly, though the device was intended for immediate use as the Micro Script had no facility for saving or reloading its contents. To a certain class of (Tandy or Dick Smith) user, the font in that grab will have given away exactly what was producing the image: a Motorola 6847 ("MC6847") Video Display Generator. The Micro Script is very close to Motorola's reference design, pairing a 6800-family CPU — in this case a Motorola 6802 microcontroller, incorporating an on-chip oscillator and 128 bytes of RAM — with the VDG and two 2114 static RAMs providing the two 512-byte pages of display memory (i.e., 1K). The VDG's Y-Pb-Pr output lines are then connected to a Motorola 1372 ("MC1372") video modulator which in this application directly generates the device's composite output, though the MC1372 can also produce RF for connection to a standard-definition TV. Both the VDG and the MC6802 are driven by a standard 3.58MHz crystal (i.e., 315/88, the NTSC colourburst subcarrier frequency), which the CPU internally divides by four to yield its nominal clock rate of 0.89MHz (315/352).&lt;p&gt;The VDG is a nearly autonomous chip which generates an image from connected memory independently of the CPU. It does not map anywhere in memory per se and it has no external registers for a CPU to manipulate. Forcing a particular mode such as bitmap graphics requires controlling chip lines, which in machines with software-controllable video modes must be provided by extra hardware. On every screen refresh, the MC6847 reads memory and creates a frame based on its option inputs; since character attributes are also selected by chip lines instead of registers, the data bus lines for certain bits are often wired to these lines so that each character cell can have its own attributes, which the chip will consult as it fetches. Here, this is accomplished by wiring bit 6 to both the VDG's data bus and to its Alphanumeric/Semigraphics line, and bit 7 to both the data bus and the VDG's inverse video line. Other mode control lines are hardwired to +5V or ground, limiting this application to the internal character ROM and "semigraphics 4" mode (four blocks per character cell), selectable by cell — interestingly, the 6847's CSS line, selecting one of two text colour palettes, is instead controlled globally using one of the keypad buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the VDG and the CPU must access the same RAM for display, there is an inevitable risk of collision, even with CPUs like the MOS 6502 that are off the bus for much of their machine cycle. Unlike systems like the Tandy Color Computers, the Micro Script has nothing like the 6883 SAM to arbitrate between the CPU and the VDG; the Micro Script's small 2K ROM instead keeps its working data and processor stack in the CPU's internal RAM, only using the 2114 SRAMs for storing characters and semigraphics for display. Two 74LS367 tri-state hex buffers and a 74LS245 octal bus transceiver serve as bus arbitrators, protecting the 6802 from the 6847's bus activity and suppressing the VDG on its MS pin when the CPU accesses the SRAMs (gated via a 74LS138 used for address decoding). Although the MC6847 can generate a signal on its FS pin when it finishes drawing a frame, which in many systems is wired to the CPU's interrupt line, here the CPU's halt, IRQ and NMI (and memory ready, incidentally) lines are all hardwired high. Instead, the 6847's FS line runs to one of the 74LS367s and then to the data bus which the CPU can busy-read as a single bit. The Micro Script's ROM constantly checks this bit, waiting for the precise time it goes low, after which the CPU is guaranteed 32 scan lines where the VDG will not interfere. This period equals 32 times the NTSC horizontal scan time of (1/(13500/858)) milliseconds (~2.03ms), or approximately 440 cycles at the MC6802's clock speed. This number will become important later.&lt;/p&gt;The Micro Script is a very simple architecture, but categorical home computers have been built on designs nearly as uncomplicated. The 1979 APF Imagination Machine paired a 6800 with a 6847, both at the same speed as the Micro Script, and a simple one-channel sound generator. The base unit, the 1978 APF MP1000, was a cartridge game console with built-in controllers sold for a similar price to the Micro Script, and designed to compete against the Atari 2600 with 1K of built-in RAM — which the Micro Script also has. Note that this is not sufficient memory for the VDG's bitmap modes, so to enable better graphics the MP1000 has additional hardware which effectively allows a custom character set to be defined in one 512 byte half and displayed as text from the other. The Imagination Machine accepts the MP1000 and adds a cassette deck, keyboard, more RAM, and expansion options (the unreleased Imagination Machine II consolidated the MP1000 into the chassis). Or how about the VTech Laser 200, perhaps best known in its Australian rebadge as the Dick Smith VZ200 Personal Colour Computer? One of the cavalcade of super-low-end 1983 home systems, this machine pairs up the VDG with a Zilog Z80 instead, though both still ran at the same 3.58MHz speed (despite the PAL locality for AU/NZ). The base 8K VZ-200/Laser 200 system devoted 2K of its built-in RAM to the VDG, just enough for a 128x64 bitmap mode in four colours and the standard text/semigraphics mode, and also used a 74LS245 to gate CPU access to this specific tract of memory. A cheap and well-supported entry to home computing down under, the VZ200 and the upgraded VZ300 were beloved in their adopted home country and we'll be looking at these computers in a future article. Or what about Radio Shack? Tandy, never one to let anyone else define the bottom of the market, had a system like this of their own that was even cloned in France — the TRS-80 MC-10 Micro Color Computer, another low-binned 1983 system that was "new for 1984" in the RSC-10 catalogue. Superficially a stripped-down Color Computer, the MC-10 actually uses a different CPU — the MC6803, more closely related to the 6800 (and 6802) than the CoCo's 6809, and also at 0.89MHz from a 3.58MHz crystal. There's no SAM in the MC-10 to arbitrate the bus either, just another 74LS245 controlling access to its 4K of RAM. Although the 6803 has a serial port which the 6802 lacks, the on-board RS-232 is in fact bitbanged because the 3.58MHz crystal cannot be used to generate any standard baud rate with an integer divider. The machine was hobbled by its intentional design limitations and the poor quality (and quantity) of available software, and after reviewers mercilessly savaged it Tandy slashed the price and discontinued it about a year later. Nevertheless, the MC-10 survived briefly in an alternative French form as the cherry-red Matra Alice, another competitor for the French Plan Informatique pour Tous ("computing for all") school initiative alongside the Exelvision and Thomson systems. Similarly unsuccessful, it nevertheless spawned two direct successors which added more RAM and replaced the MC6847 VDG with a Thomson EF9345, as used in Minitel terminals.&lt;p&gt;The upshot of all this is that the Micro Script, other than its ROMs, was not that far divorced in either architecture or capability from contemporary home computers and even some later ones. Indeed, that goes just as much for its follow-on, which is our victim of the day.&lt;/p&gt;The Micro Script and Micro Script II sold well enough (certainly as kits, but based on surviving examples more so as fully-assembled units) for the Champagnes to design a successor, though this time as a fully commercial product for prosumers: the 1985 Scriptovision Super Micro Script, introduced at just under $500 [in 2026 dollars about $1500]. Popular Photography in their October 1985 issue called it "the lowest-priced character generator in a separate unit that we have seen." Sold in a handsome compact custom enclosure with wood trim, it supported the same eight-colour palette and generated two font sizes, with the larger font in any of the eight colours. It also introduced an internal genlock for overlaying output on a connected video signal, a battery backup (with two AAs) for maintaining the contents of RAM, and a separate port for an external RF modulator which could mix the final video output with an audio signal. It must have been a success for the small company, because in this 1987 advertisement they were still selling it, then reduced to $350 [$980], and advertisements for the product continued to run as late as 1989. Since their previous address appears to now be a private residence, I have censored it from this image. A demonstration videotape was available for $10, though I have yet to see it, and it appears no one has digitized it. The Super Micro Script was sold openly, both direct from Scriptovision and through various distributors. While I surmise the Videonics Video TitleMaker family was the best cumulatively selling titler in this class, a conclusion purely based on the number still offered for sale on eBay, the Super Micro Script seems to have sold widely enough to be at least as common today as its ancestor the Micro Script and perhaps even more so. I spotted one a couple months back for cheap because the seller said it wasn't working, and I figured it might make a nice little project enclosure if I couldn't fix it: it has a 5x8 (40 key) keypad which was a bit grimy, a slide fader for controlling the opacity of the generated text overlay, multiple RCA jacks, and power and genlock switches. It came with its wallwart power adapter but no manual or other paraphernalia. Later I found a second example while I was doing the write-up which was fully operational, though it was sold untested since it didn't even come with the wallwart.&lt;p&gt;At the time it arrived, I had no knowledge of the device's architecture or function other than it was an early character generator, and I had yet to find Michel Champagne's complete technical description of its ancestor until I started on the historical research for this article. I'll throw in some "notes from the future" as we go through it, but I'll write this teardown of the Super Micro Script — which I'll abbreviate periodically as the SMS — mostly as I had previously performed it unaided at the time, and it has some unique attributes of its own that we'll have to unravel ourselves anyway.&lt;/p&gt;On the rear are its ports. New on the SMS is a 5-pin DIN port for connecting an external RF modulator, the pinout of which we'll determine shortly. (Keeping the RF modulator external might have also helped them avoid explicitly having to obtain FCC Part 15 certification, which in those days was notoriously strict; see also the Apple II Sup'R'Mod.) However, its native output is still composite, which it provides on both a preview output — the only output the Micro Script provided — and a fully mixed output incorporating the genlock. Video input, audio input and the external power connector complete the set. The serial number is #268910; my second unit is serial #270209. The main assembly is within a sturdy steel sheet-metal case, which surely did well for reducing interference both to and from the unit. I could also hear something rattling inside as I moved it around, so let's get it open. It is released from its moorings on the bottom by unscrewing the feet and lifting the top of the unit off. You can then flip back the top portion with the controls, to which the mainboard is bolted, and then lift the whole thing off the base plate. Immediately the rattling was revealed: the old, old alkaline batteries had come out from their holder. (On my second unit, the batteries had leaked and actually corroded off their own negative lead!) Fortunately, due to the way the mainboard is mounted, they would not have been easily able to leak onto the electronics as long as the unit remained right way up — which is more than I can say for some Apple systems I've encountered. The mainboard PCB is double-sided but only one side has components, so we will concentrate on the other side for the rest of this entry. The Super Micro Script mainboard is about half again as large as the Micro Script's. Although the metal on the PCB carries the legend "SMS 6000 iss[ue] 1A," most of the markings on the board are silkscreened on, including "MICRO SCRIPT" in the lower right corner — but despite this appellation and being evolved from the earlier design, the board bears little resemblance to the original Micro Script PCB even though their IC designations largely match. While the board itself was clearly mass-produced, the hand-numbered UV EPROMs (both apparently 4K D2732As or equivalent) and the appearance of the solderwork suggest final assembly was done manually. (Proudly manufactured in Canada!) This unit must also have been relatively early given the 1983 and 1984 production dates on most of its chips. The 3.579545MHz crystal is the shiny "can" under the EPROM marked "2."&lt;p&gt;Later Scriptovision started using a green consolidated board. This is the one in my second unit and is marked "SMS 6000 iss[ue] 3." We'll come back to this board when we start talking about the Super Micro Script's various obfuscations. I don't know how many board versions there ultimately were.&lt;/p&gt;The CPU is marked AMI S68B02P, a 68B02 in a plastic DIP manufactured by American Microsystems as a second source. The 68B02 is rated to 2.0MHz and substitutes directly for the 68A02 (top clock speed 1.5MHz) and original MC6802 (1.0MHz). Its primary advantage over the original 6800, besides its 128 bytes of on-chip RAM, is an integrated internal oscillator that generates both clock phases from a single source instead of the two inputs required by the 6800. What is almost certainly the main program ROM is next to it, a 4K NEC D2732A marked with the number "1." A small set of jumpers next to it go both to the ROM and to the 74LS138, which suggests they are involved with where it maps in memory, so I left them alone. We'll come back to the 74LS273 and 74LS244 chips above the CPU in this picture when we get to adding a serial receive port; these chips handle much of the system's memory-mapped I/O, including the keyboard lines. On a small daughtercard on the other side of the board sits the VDG, here an MC6847P in a plastic DIP also. The daughtercard is for providing the VDG an external font ROM (marked "2"), a higher quality font than the default one built into the 6847, assisted by the 74LS161 to generate each character's row addresses. This ROM is expected to carry some reasonable number of 8x12 glyphs (stored as 8x16), though the presence of the D2732A main ROM suggested this one was probably one too and therefore would have 256 glyphs to equal 4Kbytes. (We'll confirm later that this is in fact the case.) The daughtercard looks like a factory upgrade, with the VDG's pinout appearing to match the socket it is installed in, but the daughtercard is in there very tight and I didn't want to damage it with a hasty extraction. Also, although the wiring indicates the board could either accept a VDG by itself or a VDG on the font ROM daughtercard, only this unit has a daughtercard — the later issue 3 device consolidates it into the logic board. The Micro Script and Micro Script II don't seem to have supported an external font ROM, so this was new for the Super Micro Script.&lt;p&gt;On the mainboard under the daughtercard we also see the same Motorola MC1372 we saw in the Micro Script, which I already knew was undoubtedly generating the composite output, and was high on my list of suspects if the seller was right about its inability to emit a picture.&lt;/p&gt;Also under the daughtercard are the two 74LS367s we saw in the Micro Script, though at this point I didn't know their exact purpose. However, next to those are what looked like two SRAM chips piggybacked on each other in a most unusual fashion which also appear to be hand-soldered. I couldn't get a light probe on its top to see what it was, but later we'll find out this machine has 4K of RAM and thus these would likely be 2116 or 6116 SRAMs. No other RAMs are visible on the board, so apart from the 6802's internal RAM this dagwood RAM sandwich is all it's got. How we actually deal with its atypical RAM configuration will become a major topic in the second half of this article. Up near the back are the various wires going to the rear ports. The board appears to accept a single +9V DC input, plus ground, video in, video out and +3V from the battery compartment. Although the 6802 has a standby feature that preserves part of its internal RAM with low power from one of its pins, this wouldn't be enough to power the RAM sandwich, so the AA batteries preserve the entire contents of the external RAM instead of the 6802's standby RAM. The rear jacks are here. Notice there are few explicit grounds: instead, the ground portion of the power input and most of the RCA jacks is simply soldered to the sheet metal, the portions around them having the enamel paint scratched off, making the entire case one big common ground. Another set of ground wires goes from the RF modulator to the negative pole of the battery compartment and from the sleeve of the video input. This last one is bolted onto the metal top of a 7805 voltage regulator which is also secured to the sheet metal, making the case an oversized heatsink at the same time.&lt;p&gt;With this view we can now derive the pinout for the RF modulator. If we orient the notch to the top (i.e., have the unit upside down) while we look at the female rear port, numbering the pins from left to right, pin one is audio, pins two and three are tied together to ground, pin four is video and pin five is +9V from the logic board. Except for the voltage, this would match things like a Commodore VIC-20 RF modulator (+6V) or the TI 99/4A's (+12V).&lt;/p&gt;The wallwart that came with the unit is nominally 9V, tip positive (1/8" TRS). However, it's an old unregulated thing and the multimeter read +12V off it, though the voltage might get pulled down to +9V depending on how much current the device draws, so I decided to put it on a bench supply first. Fortunately the power input terminals are easy to access. At +9V it powers on and pulls about half an amp, which would easily reduce the +12V unregulated output into the rated range. I concluded the wallwart was probably fine. But the screen wasn't. Now, I have no manual for this, so I had no idea precisely what I was expecting to see, but no amount of adjustment on our trusty Commodore 1702 monitor would generate a stable picture even though I could see what looked like letters. Eyeballing it, it looked like the horizontal sync was totally shot, and both the preview out and video out jacks generated the same distorted image. On the other hand, the fact I could see recognizable, sensible text strongly suggested the CPU and probably the VDG were both okay. Interestingly, if I messed with the genlock switch enough, I could glitch it into a much better picture — colours were probably wrong and it still flickered, but this gave me hope that possibly even the MC1372 was fine and the real problem lay in the output stage from there, perhaps a bad cap or something. The main menu also responded to me pressing 4 on the keypad to display the colour palette, though this didn't match at all what I would expect from a 6847 nor the example palette painted on the SMS case. But it's alive! We have a pulse and it's talking to us!&lt;p&gt;There was still an outside chance that the MC1372 was bad, but it so happens that for any system with a 6847/1372 combo there's an easy way of finding out, and it can even be installed without altering the logic board: put in a Color Computer composite modification, like the Mark Data Universal Video Driver or one of its modern clones. Now, wait, I hear you say, doesn't the Super Micro Script have composite output already? It does indeed, but the idea is that if the problem is in one of the downstream components between the MC1372 and the video out port, then the comp mod will act as a bypass and generate a proper image on its own output. On the other hand, if the MC1372 or the VDG are at fault, then the picture from the composite mod board will also be bad. Either way we'll be better able to narrow down what broke.&lt;/p&gt;The theory of hooking up the comp mod (this particular one was an eBay purchase; I am not affiliated with this seller or any other) would be the same as for a regular CoCo; we just have to find equivalent points for it on the SMS. The black clip for audio can be immediately dispensed with since this board does not generate sound and the "silver" one for ground (though this clip is more like blue) can go right on one of the copper ground wires. The other clips will need proper board points, though the clips used here are kind of big for getting around the SMS' chip legs, so I buzzed out pin connections for discrete components I could better attach to instead. The red clip for +5V went on the edge side of the R12 resistor where I found a nice strong voltage reading, and the green clip for the MC1372's chroma output, from the chip's pin 7, went on the ports-side of R15.&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I didn't find a component I could attach the yellow clip to for the luma output from the 6847 and I could not get the yellow clip easily around its leg. For the purposes of testing, I got one of my smaller test clips and put that on, and clipped the yellow clip from the comp mod to its wire. I then plugged the 1702 into the output from the comp mod, and ...&lt;/p&gt;... we have a good image! I got out the USB composite capture device and indeed we have beautiful output from the composite board. (The screen grabs in this article have been corrected and cropped to the proper 4:3 aspect ratio but are otherwise unretouched.)&lt;p&gt; While the VDG offers two text colour palettes, green on dark green and orange on dark orange, most computers based on the MC6847 (like the Tandy Color Computers, Samsung SPC-1000, Dragon 32/64, etc.) use the first one. The SMS, on the other hand, exclusively uses the orange palette. This choice is controlled with the CSS pin which the majority of such sysytems — though not the original Micro Script, which made this choice selectable, nor the APF or NEC TREK — hardwire to a unchangeable fixed logic level. As semigraphics and text can coexist in this screen mode, the SMS ROM then uses an all-black &lt;del&gt;rugby team&lt;/del&gt; semigraphics character to extinguish the background around the text, which is why the entire screen isn't dark orange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with this board bypassing everything between the MC1372 and the rear ports, what about the genlock? If I flick on the genlock, the picture — from the comp mod, remember, not from the rear jacks — disappears. After some puzzlement, I realized this could only happen if the genlock switch turns out to change the path of the video signal on the board.&lt;/p&gt;For yuks, I dug out my Emerson VHS deck — yes, for the first time in an Old VCR article, but probably not the last, we're going to use an actual old VCR. This generates a nice clean composite signal of its own as shown on the 1702. I plugged it into the SMS' video input jack and hit the genlock switch once more. Now we actually have a screen again — though remember that this display is coming from the comp mod, not the rear jacks. It's somewhat warped and the character colours have become more desaturated, but we have sync between the VCR and the SMS, and that sync seems to be getting picked up by the mod. Although this implies some portion of the genlock is working, we'll come back to this presently.&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, since we're getting really nice low-noise frame captures, let's have a look around. Again, I have no manual for this, so everything I'll demonstrate here was discovered by simple trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;The Micro Script had no main menu, but the SMS does, which pops up immediately on power on. Although seven screens are officially available, this menu itself must surely count as a screen too, so eight times 512 equals our 4096 bytes of RAM. From here you can start a slideshow ("page cycling") or a bottom-line crawl, though these modes are generated from the same set of screens. The speed and content range are all selectable with the number keys, using the up and down arrows to change the value. The asterisk key on the keypad toggles between the main menu and the screen editor. The screens are not cleared when you turn on the machine — because if you have functional batteries installed, you'll just go right back into whatever screens you were designing earlier.&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of the screen a little mode line periodically flashes. This tells you, in order, whether you are entering text or semigraphic characters, whether the cursor moves horizontally or vertically, and which of the seven pages is being displayed.&lt;/p&gt;To clear the screen, hold down the CLEAR key on the keypad; this will clear the screen to black characters, leaving just the blue cursor and the mode line. This only affects the current page, so to clear other pages you must switch to them first. You could do so by starting a slide show and hitting asterisk when you get to the one you want, or you could also just go directly to a page by number by pressing the PAGE key on the keypad and then the page number (1-7). Regular text is entered by simply typing it on the keypad. There is no lowercase with the default font ROM, so the SHIFT key handles things like punctuation symbols and even numbers. Text only appears in the basic orange-on-not-so-bright-orange colour scheme, even if the COLOR key is pressed; there is no "inverse" capability even though the VDG is perfectly capable of displaying it. Notably, the ERASE key doesn't place a space on screen (if it did, it would be dark orange): instead, it uses the semigraphics 4 character that is entirely black. By pressing the ZOOM key, enlarged 3x4 characters can be generated. These may appear in multiple colours selected by the COLOR key because they are in fact semigraphics 4 as well. Since 32 is not evenly divisible by three, characters on the far edge will wrap. The cursor is yuuuge in this mode, but the cursor and the flashing status line may be temporarily quelled with the CURSOR ON OFF key. It is also possible to manually select and place semigraphic characters directly with CHAR/GRAPHIC. When in this mode, ZOOM cycles through the available characters and COLOR through the available colours. The ability to generate a slide show by placing content on multiple screens should be obvious, and the ROM supports this, but it's less obvious how this works with the bottom crawl mode. We'll put some more big text here to show you how that looks since it can crawl both regular and zoomed characters. Interestingly, while the slide show has no problem with all seven available screens, you may not use the seventh one in crawl mode, probably for buffering purposes. (The menu occupies the remaining eighth screen.) We'll retract it to screen six and then start the scroll. Scroll speed is also adjustable using the delay setting, the same one used for the delay between screens, which can be from one (fastest) to thirty (slowest). The scroll routine runs text from the top of each screen, left to right, top to bottom. It is also smart enough to know the difference between regular and zoomed characters: if it detects what it thinks are semigraphics, it will take it as a four-row block. This mostly works for other kinds of graphics, even if the art doesn't exactly match those dimensions. The scroll continues through all the screens you specify, even if they contain junk (in that case they undoubtedly have semicharacters in them and get taken as four-row blocks too). We'll stop it here. It is possible to lay down vertical strips of characters with HOR./VERT., but these don't rotate the actual glyphs, of course. This is less useful in the scroll mode because how many characters of a vertical strip end up in the scroll depends on whether the routine sees semigraphics there or not: ... but it's still handy for certain types of slide displays.&lt;p&gt;The next two orders of business would be to dump the ROMs for posterity and hopefully study, and then to see what we could do with the genlock.&lt;/p&gt;Being vanilla 2732A EPROMs, the two internal ROM chips can be read in pretty much anything, and I got good reliable dumps of both. Since we're most interested in the main code, we'll now rig up a ROM emulator so that we can modify it. I am not affiliated with My Geeky Hobby, but he makes a very nice Arduino-based open-source ROM emulator kit. This can take a binary (for testing purposes, our dump) and present it in multiple configurations as if it were an actual ROM. It includes a probe that replaces the ROM itself. To get the probe to clear the nearby wires and components without contacting them, I put a strip of electrical tape over the exposed sections and then mounted the probe in another socket to give it a little extra height. Since the 2732A is only 24 pins, the remaining four (the probe is 28-pin) dangle. The emulator runs fine this way except it can't draw +5V from the board, meaning it must always be connected to USB power (which for our purposes is no problem). Starting the system up with no ROM image loaded intentionally to make sure there were no shorts. The CPU is just reading open bus and the RAM is full of garbage, but we have a picture, so we probably didn't kill anything. Loading our ROM 1 dump into the emulator and resetting the SMS, we get the menu, so we are now in fully working order. Next, let's see if we can get the genlock running. I took two snapshots from my crappy handheld oscilloscope of the output from the internal preview out (top) and the composite bypass (below). The bottom signal from the bypass shows a decent NTSC composite waveform: the sync tip (drop), followed by the colourburst, the black level (flat), and then the horizontal lines. By contrast, the internal video isn't generating anything recognizeable as vertical sync and the horizontal lines seem to have abnormally small amplitude. For all that, though, when we connect the monitor to the genlocked output using our VCR again as the composite signal, we do get a picture. It's distorted and not fully stable, but it's legible. Interestingly, it is also entirely monochrome — the colour is not in fact overlaid, suggesting this is entirely being generated solely by the luminance output from the VDG and not the chroma information. The MC6847 emits these signals on separate pins. This also means that the output of the VDG used for the genlock is likely a completely parallel pathway from the preview output and we'll need to deal with them separately.&lt;p&gt;I have no schematics for this board and while it is certainly derived from the Micro Script, the Super Micro Script has of course moved some components around, some are difficult to access because of the font daughterboard, and obviously I have no documentation of the genlock side. I did some work figuring out where signal paths went and left some notes to myself on the PCB. However, it was straightforward to determine the composite signal from the MC1372 is eventually funneled into a large capacitor at the top before it feeds the preview output.&lt;/p&gt;Since we know the bypass generates a nice picture, I decided to simply use it for the preview output (and, when the genlock is off, the main video output) instead of potentially making a mess by attempting to repair the board directly. I also didn't want to make any irreversible modifications either, but the capacitor has nice long leads and makes a good point to splice in the output from the bypass, so I clipped the input side to isolate it since even a dolt like me could solder that much back together if needed. There isn't much length on the bypass output to wire that directly to the preview output, so I chopped up a cable with enough length. Next, I got out the soldering iron, soldered the other end of the cable from the bypass to the preview jack, and also cleaned up the wiring from the luminance pin so we didn't need the "double clip" anymore. However, there is nothing here that can't be easily undone either. To ensure this can all fit back into the enclosure, I moved the bypass inside of the metal exterior under the jacks and looped the internal cable back around to the top. The signal got a bit noisier after that. The internal cable admittedly ended up being longer than it needed to be (which can make it into a big antenna), and there might also be some additional RF interference from the board components since the bypass is now jammed inside an effective Faraday cage with them. Here's a comparison grab from the issue 3 unit which we'll use as an example of the machine's intended quality. There's still a bit of fringing, although the issue 3 board is more consolidated, so it may well have better components (I'll show you a picture of the internals a little later). But I'd say for now our repair is good enough and everything fits within the box. Doing some more buzzing out of interconnections, the genlock path turns out to run through several adjustment points. The most important two seemed to be R27, a largish variable resistor which controlled the strength of the VDG luminance signal (distinct from the fader slide), and C15, a variable capacitor. I'm not sure what that one exactly does to the signal but tweaking it did stabilize the picture at the expense of compressing the VDG output a bit horizontally. (Later I compared this with the working issue 3 and found that its genlock overlay also doesn't quite match the geometry of the preview output, so perhaps this is something about the circuitry.) Nevertheless, with these adjusted, you can compare the width of the display to the non-genlocked version above. To avoid any takedown notices by using actual movie grabs in this blog — except for the absolutely necessary SCTV joke earlier, rest in peace, Catherine O'Hara — I pulled out one of our family home VHS movies from when we went to Universal Studios Hollywood in 1990 and stuck that in the VCR. Here the fader slide is all the way down, so you just see the video. This was the Animal Actors' Stage live show which closed in 2023. And here it is with the fader back up. There's no shadowing or emphasis around the letters, unfortunately, so they can get blown out in bright portions of the picture. Here is your humble author attempting to shake hands with Frankenstein's monster. He won. And here are the colour bars as they appear with genlock on and off. Our blue and red strips have a bit of artifact colouration in the genlock view, though this may be because of the horizontal compression. I think this is as good as we can get at repairing it without a schematic to make additional guesses.&lt;p&gt;Back to the firmware. Since we have a known good dump of the ROM, let's try to hack it — and that's where the real fun starts. Here are the last 128 bytes of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;00000f80 52 9f e1 cf 81 bb 7e 72 61 08 7b 82 a4 01 cf ff |R.....~ra.{.....| 00000f90 c9 61 84 04 9c 60 49 32 49 1f ff 01 de e9 d1 c0 |.a...`I2I.......| 00000fa0 90 5a 46 ff 9c 64 00 32 e1 71 71 04 39 f8 b1 2c |.ZF..d.2.qq.9..,| 00000fb0 64 28 b1 2a 7e e1 e7 82 08 d4 cf a2 9f c0 52 ff |d(.*~.........R.| 00000fc0 76 76 6c ff 55 1f 65 81 a0 7e 8c 82 00 84 10 ff |vvl.U.e..~......| 00000fd0 ec 5f 84 01 99 64 18 01 b3 10 bd a2 00 f1 01 b0 |._...d..........| 00000fe0 61 18 84 ff cf 11 c3 08 99 00 7b c2 84 f0 40 3e |a.........{...@&amp;gt;| 00000ff0 76 98 ee 04 bd a8 64 4a 08 10 a4 59 42 bd 1f 0e |v.....dJ...YB...|&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is very odd. The reset vector at $fffe-f appears to be $1f0e (the 6800 is big-endian), which is plausible, because it's possible the ROM could be mapped at multiple locations. However, the other vectors for IRQ, software interrupts and NMIs are bogus. Plus, when we try disassembling the putative reset routine from offset $0f0e (following the assumption the ROM is also visible at $1000), we get gibberish:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;% ../f9dasm/f9dasm -6802 -offset 1000 sms1.bin [...] Z1F0E ADCB $FF,X ;1F0E: E9 FF '..'

CMPA M01BD ;1F2A: B1 01 BD '...'&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no way this would do anything useful because the X register and stack pointer haven't been initialized to a predictable value before they're used. Plus, we end up executing an undefined opcode ($7b) right in our code path, which likely is treated the same as DEC, but makes no sense with the bytes after it. Most of the ROM is in fact this same sort of gibberish; nothing looks clearly executable. Also, we don't see any strings corresponding to the menu text in any obvious encoding. For example, we would reasonably expect to find a byte sequence like $13, $05, $14 plus some offset (e.g., $53, 45, $54) to match "SET" somewhere, but we don't. Yet the dump must be good, because the ROM verifies and works when we run it through the ROM emulator.&lt;/p&gt;Arcade game hackers have already guessed: the ROM must be encrypted somehow. Indeed, it looks like Scriptovision themselves were quite concerned about knockoffs; the later issue 3 board in my second Super Micro Script has all the chip markings blotted out (quite a few arcade boards did this too, as it happens), and our adjustment points have also been potted with some sort of glue to discourage any mucking around. If you didn't know what chips were there — and didn't have access to back issues of Radio-Electronics to try to match the silkscreened IC numbers — you'd have very few clues to guess at what the ROMs should contain. There would have been a good chance if I'd ended up first with this later unit that you'd be reading a droll and shorter article about the new enclosure I made out of a video titler instead.&lt;p&gt;Still, this is 1985, where things like public key cryptography in hardware of this sort would be unheard of, and there are no chips visible on either board that would plausibly store an encryption key for something like XOR. There is only this ROM and the font ROM. Otherwise, all the visible logic and ICs are off-the-shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if it's not a chip on the board that does the decryption, what about the board itself doing the decryption? The most obvious technique would be to scramble the address and/or data lines between the ROM and the CPU, and this method was not uncommon either in devices of the era: for example, several Commodore 64 cartridges do this, as do certain cartridges for the Neo Geo. This doesn't prevent someone from doing a bitwise copy of the ROM(s), which is what we did, but it does prevent using them in another board where the address and data lines aren't swizzled around in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;Lo and behold, the same thing has occurred here. I did some checks with my continuity tester, theorizing that since the CPU and the main ROM are next to each other they would be directly connected to each other without any intervening components, and indeed they are — but not on the pins I was expecting. Using a silver Sharpie to mark my findings, both the address and data bus lines between ROM 1 and the CPU are swizzled in multiple places (only the lowest 12 address pins need be checked, though, since the ROM is only 4K). I wrote a simple-minded Perl script to unscramble the binary bitwise and looked at the output. The most immediately interesting part is the last 192 bytes.&lt;quote&gt;00000e40 0b 53 45 54 2d 55 50 20 50 41 47 45 17 31 80 80 |.SET-UP PAGE.1..| 00000e50 80 80 43 48 41 4e 47 45 20 44 45 4c 41 59 20 20 |..CHANGE DELAY | 00000e60 20 20 20 20 17 32 80 80 80 80 53 45 4c 45 43 54 | .2....SELECT| 00000e70 20 46 49 52 53 54 20 50 41 47 45 20 17 33 80 80 | FIRST PAGE .3..| 00000e80 80 80 53 45 4c 45 43 54 20 4c 41 53 54 20 50 41 |..SELECT LAST PA| 00000e90 47 45 20 20 17 34 80 80 80 80 44 49 53 50 4c 41 |GE .4....DISPLA| 00000ea0 59 20 43 4f 4c 4f 52 20 42 41 52 20 17 35 80 80 |Y COLOR BAR .5..| 00000eb0 80 80 53 54 41 52 54 20 50 41 47 45 20 43 59 43 |..START PAGE CYC| 00000ec0 4c 49 4e 47 17 36 80 80 80 80 53 54 41 52 54 20 |LING.6....START | 00000ed0 43 52 41 57 4c 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 05 50 52 45 |CRAWL .PRE| 00000ee0 53 53 02 54 4f 0e 46 49 52 53 54 20 50 41 47 45 |SS.TO.FIRST PAGE| 00000ef0 3a 80 80 80 0e 4c 41 53 54 20 20 50 41 47 45 3a |:....LAST PAGE:| 00000f00 80 80 80 09 44 45 4c 41 59 3a 80 80 80 12 49 4e |....DELAY:....IN| 00000f10 56 41 4c 49 44 20 53 45 4c 45 43 54 49 4f 4e 21 |VALID SELECTION!| 00000f20 1e 49 4e 56 41 4c 49 44 20 46 49 52 53 54 2f 4c |.INVALID FIRST/L| 00000f30 41 53 54 20 50 41 47 45 20 4e 55 4d 42 45 52 10 |AST PAGE NUMBER.| 00000f40 4e 4f 20 44 41 54 41 20 54 4f 20 43 52 41 57 4c |NO DATA TO CRAWL| 00000f50 15 55 53 45 20 55 50 20 4f 52 20 44 4f 57 4e 20 |.USE UP OR DOWN | 00000f60 41 52 52 4f 57 53 1f 50 41 47 45 20 37 20 43 41 |ARROWS.PAGE 7 CA| 00000f70 4e 4e 4f 54 20 42 45 20 55 53 45 44 20 46 4f 52 |NNOT BE USED FOR| 00000f80 20 43 52 41 57 4c ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | CRAWL..........| 00000f90 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff |................| 00000fa0 02 04 fe 4c 02 05 fe 64 02 06 fe 7c 02 08 fe 94 |...L...d...|....| 00000fb0 02 09 fe ac 02 0a fe c4 0a 00 fe 40 00 02 fe dc |...........@....| 00000fc0 0d 02 fe e2 04 0c fe e5 04 0d fe f4 14 0c ff 03 |................| 00000fd0 ff 1b 0c 00 02 10 0c 00 00 10 0d 00 01 ff ff 0d |................| 00000fe0 ff 20 ff 3f ff 50 ff 66 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff |. .?.P.f........| 00000ff0 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff f9 99 ff ff f1 d0 |................|&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see our menu strings, so we must have descrambled it correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would Scriptovision do this? My guess is because it's all off-the-shelf components, this prevents a competitor from using their ROM code in anything but another Super Micro Script unit or exact clone. It doesn't prevent reading the ROM but it does make it more difficult to modify or rip it off completely, and though I don't claim to be an expert in copyright law (let alone Canadian copyright law), it might also provide them with a plausible case of infringement if a competitor, failing to grok the scrambling mechanism, nevertheless manufactured a functional copy of the unit with the same ROM in it because the ROM can be copyrighted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, now that we understand the process, I created a scrambler that reverses the process, ran the scrambler on the unscrambled binary, confirmed the hashes matched, and sent the re-scrambled version to the ROM emulator. The SMS worked just the same as it did before, so the machine is now fully pwned. We can write arbitrary code, scramble it and have the SMS run it. Yee haw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that solved, let's analyze the code further to see what we can make the hardware do. The reset vector points to $f1d0 and the software interrupt vector to $f999. The other IRQ and NMI vectors are nonsense, so we assume that like the Micro Script there are also no IRQs or NMIs in this system. Disassembling from $f1d0, the reset code is now much more sensible. It starts off like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;hdlr_RST LDS #M007F ;F1D0: 8E 00 7F '...' CLR &amp;gt;M000F ;F1D3: 7F 00 0F '...' JSR ZF4F0 ;F1D6: BD F4 F0 '...' LDAB M0005 ;F1D9: D6 05 '..'

[...]&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sets the stack pointer to $007f, which is at the end of the 6802's built-in RAM, and then proceeds to do some opaque calls and tests we don't understand at the moment. We'll come back to this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a proof of concept and basic primitive we should first figure out how to write to the display. The VDG uses its own private access to RAM to draw the screen, but this says nothing about where that RAM is mapped in the CPU's memory map, and the reset routine at $f1d0 is not immediately informative because we don't know what most of it does yet. However, we do know where in ROM our menu strings are, and that gives us a critical clue: the only place our set-up page string at $fe40, assuming the first byte is a length byte, is referenced is at $ffba (the 6800 is big-endian). This pointer is surrounded by what is obviously data, not 6800 assembly, but we can guess from the position of SET-UP PAGE on the screen that the two bytes before it are the X,Y coordinate. If so, then it must be part of that larger block of multiple such "records" starting at $ffa0 and bordered on both ends by $ff bytes. This block would be undoubtedly referenced somewhere by the X register, so we should look for where X gets explicitly set to that value, and we find it occurs in two places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;% grep LDX disas.txt | grep FFA0 ZFCCE LDX #ZFFA0 ;FCCE: CE FF A0 '...'

We can surmise this because it is alternating between two values for X, one stored at $0014 (since this is loaded from, it must be the string in ROM) and the other at $0018 (since this is stored to, it must be the pointer to video memory). This loop uses B as a counter, set to the length of the string by $fcf1. The pointer at $0018 is initialized by the two calls at $fceb to $f38b and $f399:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;ZF38B PSHB ;F38B: 37 '7' CLRB ;F38C: 5F '_' ASLA ;F38D: 48 'H' ASLA ;F38E: 48 'H' ASLA ;F38F: 48 'H' ASLA ;F390: 48 'H' ASLA ;F391: 48 'H' ROLB ;F392: 59 'Y' STAA M003A ;F393: 97 3A '.:' STAB M0039 ;F395: D7 39 '.9' PULB ;F397: 33 '3' RTS ;F398: 39 '9' ZF399 LDAA M003A ;F399: 96 3A '.:' ORAA M003B ;F39B: 9A 3B '.;' STAA M0019 ;F39D: 97 19 '..'

The high byte and low byte populate that store pointer at $0018. This suggests our video memory must start at $8000, or at least it does when the menu is displayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is enough to make a tiny driver in MAME to see how it actually executes. Initially I did this largely based on the Tandy MC-10 driver (of course) but also with some study of the VDG implementation in the Samsung SPC-1000 and Dragon drivers. You can get this from this article's Github project. There is a draft for each stage of the evolution of the Super Micro Script MAME driver, so you can use this as a means to learn how to write your own MAME driver.&lt;/p&gt;To my disappointment, but not really surprise, I didn't get anything on the screen initially (this is in draft1.cpp). However, I could see in the MAME debugger that if we write manually to $8000, characters show up. I could also see that the ROM did start but quickly settled into an infinite loop within this routine before writing anything:&lt;quote&gt;ZF8C7 PSHA ;F8C7: 36 '6' ZF8C8 LDAA M6000 ;F8C8: B6 60 00 '.`.'

In fact, our string display routine above at $fcf7 calls this routine (at $fcf4) just before it starts writing to our presumed video memory, which strongly suggests we are waiting for the VDG to signal we can write there without interference. As I did most of this work before I found the Micro Script article, I didn't know how that system (or this one) implemented this flag. While the Motorola datasheet says the signal (called the "negative field sync") would typically be hooked up to the IRQ line, we know the Super Micro Script can't support hardware IRQs because its IRQ vector is bogus. Instead, this code shows that it too simply busy-waits. We'll program our MAME driver to map changes to the FS line into this location's flag bit, and with that sorted out (draft2.cpp), we have a menu!&lt;/p&gt;The colours are wrong, though, and we're not using our font ROM, which (surprise!) also needs to be unscrambled. The problem here is that only the data lines from the ROM actually go to the VDG. The VDG instead relies upon a separate chip to generate the row addresses for the lower four bits (in this system and in the Motorola datasheet a 74LS161 4-bit counter is used), and display memory itself indexes the remaining eight: the VDG's own address lines are only ever used for talking to video RAM. I worked out the transposed data lines with the continuity tester, but I could only figure out the four lines to the 74LS161, especially since getting to the RAM (which may itself have scrambled lines, so no guarantees anyway) would require removing the stuck daughterboard. Consequently, this process would have been easier on the unified issue 3 board in my second SMS, but I hadn't bought it yet.&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we have an alternative: unlike the main ROM, where we didn't know exactly what we would see, we know the bit pattern the ROM generates for letters because it displays them onscreen, so we can work out the patterns that we should see. The character data is stored "horizontally" like the font ROM in the Dragon 200E (i.e., line one for each glyph followed by line two, etc., instead of all lines for a single glyph followed by the next). If we rearrange them into that more familiar "vertical" format, we see distorted shapes which are nonetheless recognizeable as letters, numbers and symbols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;** |60 ***** * |fa * ** * |9a ***** * |fa * ** * |9a * ** * |9a ********|ff ********|ff **** |f0 * ** * |9a * ** * |9a ***** * |fa * ** * |9a |00 ********|ff ********|ff **** * |f2 * ** * |9a ***** * |fa ***** * |fa * ** * |9a **** * |f2 ********|ff ********|ff ***** * |fa * ** * |9a **** * |f2 * ** * |9a ***** * |fa |00 ********|ff ********|ff&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gives us enough visual clues, combined with our tests of the data lines, to descramble the font ROM as well. It turned out only the data lines and the 74LS161 lines were scrambled; the lines back to the display memory were not. Whew!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The character set does have some gaps in it. These gaps are for characters that can't be entered on the keypad (specifically @, [, \, ], ↑, ←, &amp;amp;, *, ;, &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;). Rather than creating glyphs for them that would never be shown except in uninitialized RAM, Scriptovision instead simply chose to make them solid blanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just to make sure we weren't dealing with different versions or boards, I pulled and dumped the ROMs from my later issue 3 device and to my great relief its main and font ROMs have identical hashes to my original issue 1a unit. I suspect they kept them the same likely because it would have required the overhead of stocking different ROMs for each board revision.&lt;/p&gt;While adding font ROM support I also made sure the CSS bit was being set for each character and that we were using semigraphics 4 for graphics. At this point we now have an emulator appearance approximately like our display (draft3.cpp). Still, the colours are a wee bit different, so let's sort out the keypad next so we can bring up the colour bars for comparison. After the menu comes up the ROM ends up kicking around in this loop:&lt;quote&gt;ZF81F LDX #M2500 ;F81F: CE 25 00 '.%.' ZF822 LDAA #$1F ;F822: 86 1F '..' ORAA M0003 ;F824: 9A 03 '..'

RTS ;F832: 39 '9'&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, this was prior to my finding that article, so I had to derive things by hand with the knowledge that a common way of decoding a switch matrix, which of course keypads and keyboards are, is to energize each row or column as a group and then see what result you get. I don't know yet what $03 is doing (this is part of the 6802's internal RAM) but our theory then is $2000 is the I/O register for picking a group and $4000 is the result. During this routine $03 is set to $c0. If we look at the call stack (we know from our reset routine that this starts in 6802 internal RAM at $007f and grows down), this routine got called from $fb27, which is very near where the menu got drawn at $fb21 (calling $fcce, which we dissected above) and just after another screen routine at $fd15:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;ZFB1E JSR ZF858 ;FB1E: BD F8 58 '..X' ZFB21 JSR ZFCCE ;FB21: BD FC CE '...'

JMP ZFCC2 ;FB34: 7E FC C2 '~..'&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The keypad is 5x8. Because we're apparently using a mask of $1f (from $f822, i.e., bottom-most five bits set) and looking at the entire 8-bit result in $4000 (the coma instruction at $f82c would complement every single bit), we are most likely either selecting every column or no column, at which point the byte is read. That means the routine at $f81f could either be waiting for a keypress or making sure there isn't one; at this point I couldn't tell yet for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, we can guess that the normal situation if no key is pressed is all bits set because we complement A and re-enter the loop at $f82c if not equal to zero. Following this theory, if we alter our driver to presumably always say no key is pressed (i.e., always return $ff when $4000 is read from) and use the MAME debugger to set a watchpoint on $2000 (wpset 0x2000,1,w), we see this sequence from startup: $c0 (at $f45f) twice, then $df repeatedly in the loop at $f81f until the countdown terminates, then a repeating $cf $d7 $db $dd $de from yet another routine at $f311 that appears to do the actual keyscan. Do you see the pattern? Put more plainly,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;% perl -e 'foreach (0xcf,0xd7,0xdb,0xdd,0xde){print unpack("B8",pack("C", $_))."\n";}' 11001111 11010111 11011011 11011101 11011110&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;... the column is selected by whichever of the lowest five bits is zero. (This means the routine at $f81f is actually waiting for no keys to be pressed because $df shouldn't energize any columns.) This suffices for draft4.cpp. Now the only guess left is in which direction the key bits and column bits go.&lt;/p&gt;As a very lucky first guess, if we return 254 (i.e., 11111110) when there is a zero in the second column from the right (i.e., 11011101), the menu persistently thinks the two key is being pressed. So now we can simulate a keypress of 4 by returning 254 when there is a zero in the second column from the left (11010111), and this finally displays our colour bars (draft5.cpp): This clearly doesn't match what we saw previously, so we'll manually sample the palette on our video captures both here and in the menu and wedge in a custom palette for the MAME VDG driver. At last we have an accurate screen, so let's finish hooking up the keys. This requires creating INPUT_PORTs in MAME which is tedious but in the end "just works" combined with a simple function to query those input port keymappings based on the column in $2000 and push the correct bits to $4000. It isn't apparently possible to have multiple PORT_CODEs in our MAME ports definition, so we define alternate rows with the numbers for convenience and query those at the same time as the letters. This suffices for a complete keyboard but also yields an initial set-up menu that works like you think it should (draft6.cpp).&lt;p&gt;The last frontier is page flipping. We have eight pages, so we'll need more than just the single bit the original Micro Script twiddles. The VDG merely fetches the lower 12 bits of the address bus; the higher bits are set externally. Although our other memory mapped I/O locations neatly fell on large binary boundaries ($2000, $4000, $6000, $8000), a pleasingly simple addressing scheme, we don't see any other access at $a000, $c000 or $e000, so our paging register for what shows up onscreen must be either elsewhere or consolidated into one of the existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quick scan of the disassembly shows that only $2000 is ever stored to; the others (our RAM at $8000 notwithstanding) appear to be read-only. But there is the matter of those upper three bits in $2000 which didn't change while in the menu, and three bits is just enough for eight pages of memory. Lo and behold, if we watchpoint $2000 with wpset 0x2000,1,w,(wpdata &amp;amp; 0xc0) != 0xc0 and press */ESC to jump into the first page, it changes to ... $20! And so does the value in $03. If we change our watchpoint to $03 this time, start cycling the screens and wait for any change to that register (wpclear and then wpset 0x03,1,w), we get the repeating sequence $20, $60, $a0, $e0, $00, $40, $80. Or, in binary,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;% perl -e 'foreach(0xc0,0x20,0x60,0xa0,0xe0,0x00,0x40,0x80){print unpack("B3",pack("C", $_))."\n";}' 110 001 011 101 111 000 010 100&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a predictable binary pattern, but there are two things worth noting: the value is always an even multiple of 32, and no matter what that value is, the title editor still writes to $8000. (This is how we can see the page hasn't flipped, or at least not the one onscreen.) I suspect this is so that the general architecture could be more quickly adapted to any potential number of memory pages, say for a future "Super-Duper Micro Script" or something.&lt;/p&gt;There is also a bit of garbage that gets written to the first few bytes of $8000 at the same time when we enter the editor ... but carefully checking the timing in the MAME debugger shows these are written with $03/$2000 set to $c0. If we look carefully, we can see this on the real system too.&lt;p&gt;One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that $8000 is just a window into RAM and this bitset determines what tract of memory is seen there (and thus the VDG just goes on fetching from the same place regardless of the current page too). However, if so, then one wonders what the actual page size is. Let's run with this theory, since we know we can execute code on the CPU now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;org $f000 ; init stack pointer, set page to default start sei clc lds #$7f ldaa #$00 staa $2000 ; wait for VDG wait1 ldaa $6000 anda #$40 beq wait1 wait2 ldaa $6000 anda #$40 bne wait2 ; clear screen to black ldx #$8000 ldaa #$80 ; black clrl staa 0,x inx cpx #$8200 bne clrl ; put different characters at $8000 $8100 $8200 $8300 ; and then read them back ldaa #$01 staa $8000 inca staa $8100 inca staa $8200 inca staa $8300 ldaa $8000 staa $8040 ldaa $8100 staa $8041 ldaa $8200 staa $8042 ldaa $8300 staa $8043 clc bcc * ds ($fffe-*) dw start&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This little program, when assembled (using the Macroassembler AS, which is what we will be using for all of our assembly code snippets in this article), then scrambled and uploaded to the ROM emulator, will clear the screen and put what should be an A at $8000, a B at $8100, a C at $8200 and a D at $8300. It then tries to read them back. We know the window must be at least 512 bytes long because the screen must be at least 512 bytes long (32x16), given that the VDG can't cope with anything smaller. If the memory window is a full 1K (or more), we should see ABCD. If the window is only 512 bytes and the 512 bytes are repeated in each half of the 1K zone, then we would see CDCD because the memory is mirrored and the subsequent writes to $8200 and $8300 obliterate $8000 and $8100. If the window is only 512 bytes and not mirrored, then we would see AB and then whatever reading open bus looks like.&lt;/p&gt;And it looks like a 512 byte window with mirroring. (By contrast, the original Micro Script kept both pages in memory at once at $2000 and $2200.) This is kind of a bummer because it means apart from the 6802's internal RAM, we can only access the main RAM in 512 byte pages and whatever page we choose ends up displayed on-screen whether we want it to or not — except perhaps during the vertical blank, which gives us an idea, so hold that thought.&lt;p&gt;In the meantime we can finish the basic components of the driver: we'll use the register at $2000 as an offset into the RAM pool, set up lambdas on that range so that the editor keeps on writing to $8000-$81ff and have our VDG read routine reference the same register so that it sees the right page as well. To speed this up a bit we'll cache the bank offset and the RAM pointer in our driver.&lt;/p&gt;This is a good time to explore memory further. For this I wrote up a primitive live monitor program I dubbed "SMSBUG" that is aware of the current "video bank" (page). Moving through the address space,&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;there is open bus from $0080 to $1fff&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;$2000 is mirrored through $3fff, and only ever reads $ff&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;$4000 is mirrored through $5fff&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;$6000 is mirrored through $7fff, but only bit 4 (the rest is open bus)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;$8000-$81ff is mirrored in 512-byte windows through $9fff&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;$a000-$dfff is open bus&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;$e000 is a mirror of $f000&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let's try to program it like a home computer. There's not a lot of room in the 6802's built-in low memory and you have to share those 128 bytes besides with the stack and whatever the system ROM is using. Fortunately, because the wiring allows the CPU to push the VDG off the bus whenever it wants, it is absolutely possible to run machine code from the RAM sandwich. The problem with doing so is that the page your program occupies must be banked in, so unless you call "external code" (air quotes) to show some other page until the VDG enters the border and vertical blank (VBL), your code — which is probably not very nice looking — must be displayed. In this respect, programming the original Micro Script would have been easier because you could simply run your code from whatever page wasn't onscreen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example of that kind of "external code" I wrote a few primitive helpers into SMSBUG to evaluate how practical writing machine code was; I didn't find it particularly so, but I left the primitives in there for you to try if you want. SMSBUG has a concept of the page you want to display — we'll call it the S-bank, for "screen bank" — and the page you want to execute from — we'll call it the U-bank, for "user bank." The U-bank is that hex digit in the screenshot before addresses, while the S-bank is in fact whatever is onscreen at that time. These primitive helpers, accessible from a jump table at $ff00 in the SMSBUG ROM, let you wait for the next VBL with the S-bank visible, scan or wait for a key, read or write a byte in the S-bank, fill memory in the S-bank, or specify an address in another page and jump to it as the new U-bank. The helpers handle banking your program out, doing the task, and banking it back in plus-minus waiting for the vertical blank again to keep the screen clean. This works about as well as can be expected, though you need to be constantly aware of your code's cycle count because overstaying the VBL (i.e., exceeding that ~440 cycle count) will make the display ugly quickly, and having to call at least one helper routine every screen refresh is a bit obnoxious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are other home computers that exist with only a small amount of "real" RAM and keep the rest of it tied up in the video controller, which is effectively our present situation. The most (in)famous of these would probably be the Texas Instruments 99/4A, which in the unexpanded state has only the 256-byte scratchpad RAM directly accessible to the CPU, and its advertised 16K is entirely controlled by the 9918 VDP. It's possible to run tiny programs directly from scratchpad RAM, but that's about it. However, BASIC programs can be run from VDP memory because the TI ROM has an interpreter for a middle-level language called GPL, for Graphic Programming Language. This interpreter knows how to pull bytes in and out of VDP RAM, and TI BASIC is written in GPL, so it can use its facilities to (more slowly) access VDP RAM like regular RAM. We can do something similar. For simplicity we'll put together a tiny VM that happens to use bytecode the same as various 6800 instructions. It runs a subset of them and has its own A, B, P and X registers, plus some larger macro-operations for running small sections of native code and easier handling of the screen. By using this VM we can abstract away much of having to manage which page is displayed and which page is executing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how we actually write the programs, though, we'll need to be able to load those programs into it. And, with just a couple clips in the right places, we can do that too!&lt;/p&gt;The 74LS273 is an 8-channel ("octal") flip-flop. It energizes the five keypad columns, and because it's octal, it also appears that the three video banking bits go here too (i.e., this chip is what is decoded to $2000-$3fff). The 74LS244 next to it, a tri-state octal buffer driver, accepts the eight row outputs from the keypad ($4000). After some careful experiments with the multimeter, each of these outputs have pull-up resistors to +5V and ground their output when the button is pushed. Since we know we can completely de-energize the keypad, this is the ideal place to wire in, and all we need for a serial port is a single bit. We'll choose the input from row 0 (pin 2), which is wired to the low bit, and hook up one more test clip to anywhere we can get a ground level.&lt;p&gt;Borrowing some code from SMSBUG, as a proof of concept we'll now write a simple loop that will display the value received from the key rows when no column is selected (all column bits set to one). This should avoid any interference with the keypad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;org $f000 start sei clc lds #$7f loop ldaa #$df staa $2000 ldaa $4000 tab jsr hexnyh sta $8000 tba jsr hexny sta $8001 bra loop ; convert nybble in a to storable value ; 48-57 (0-9) and then 1-6 (a-f) hexnyh ; enter here if in high nybble rora rora rora rora hexny anda #15 ; enter here if in low nybble cmpa #10 bge hexnya adda #48 rts hexnya suba #9 rts ds ($fffe-*) dw start&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we're necessarily bitbanging — did I mention the Radio Shack MC-10? — we need to be precise about the timing, though in this system with no interrupts or NMIs that should be pretty easy to do. We already know our clock speed is the "standard" 3.58MHz (i.e., 315/88) internally divided by 4 (i.e., 315/352) to yield 894,886.3636... cycles per second. To sample and store each bit would be something like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;ldaa $4000 rora ror 0,x&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;which rotates the low bit into carry, then rotates the carry into the current byte pointed to by the X register (recall that RS-232 transmits bits little-endian first). That's a total of 4 + 2 + 7 = 13 cycles per bit. For 57600bps at this clock speed we could take no more than 15.5 cycles per bit, so we could achieve it potentially by requiring an extra stop bit, but there's not a lot of room for error. 38.4kbps or 19.2kbps are more forgiving; we would need to be under 23.3 or 46.6 cycles per bit, though we're not transferring a lot of data, so let's go for the slower rate to give us plenty of margin. It's okay to be a little faster sampling bits as long as we're never slower, and we'll use the start bit (the transmission will be 8-N-1, i.e., 8 data bits, no parity and one stop bit) to resynchronize anyway.&lt;/p&gt;Of course, you always have to make sure you're sampling at the right point within each bit time. Each of these test bytes I sent should be advancing a single one bit (RS-232 is little endian). Pop quiz: can you see what I did wrong with my first attempt?&lt;p&gt;Pencils down. In each block of eight bits, I came off the start bit (always zero) too fast, so I got an extra zero at the beginning — and then an extra spurious character of all-ones because it saw the last zero as the start bit of another character followed by the line staying high. With that fixed, I can type (using control characters) a HELLO WORLD! ...&lt;/p&gt;... and see it onscreen!&lt;p&gt;Since we're not sending back any information to the transmitting side, we'll devise a simple format for encapsulating a page with a checksum. It will always be 514 bytes, padded with nulls, starting with a simple 16-bit big-endian short sum of the following 512 bytes of data (meaning the null padding won't invalidate the checksum). This is more than sufficient for a fast local transmission because it's not like we're using noisy copper POTS lines here. SMSBUG will then read that fixed 514 bytes, noting the checksum and storing the 512 bytes of data trailing it into the selected page, then verify the checksums match and display an error if they do not. I created a simple file of all byte values from 0-255, wrote a Perl script to pad, sum and tag it, and then sent it from the MacBook Air using picocom and ascii-xfr through the receive routine I wrote for SMSBUG.&lt;/p&gt;Success! — and also the entirety of the character set, for posterity. Let's add this support to our eighth and last revision for MAME, now the final draft in smicros.cpp. This requires specifying the serial port's speed and characteristics and the type of device it represents (in our case the closest equivalent is a simple null modem, not a full-blown terminal), then adjusting our keyboard read routine to check and incorporate the receive line from the virtual RS-232.&lt;p&gt;What we would like is to run that emulated null modem on a TCP socket and blast data at it with something like netcat. This can be done with MAME, but MAME nowadays expects to connect to an existing socket, like emulating a terminal to connect to some other listening process; it doesn't create a listening socket itself. Happily it's simple enough to create a receive-only pipe that MAME can connect to and that we can also push data to, which is all we need for our homebrew SMS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate window somewhere (I'm doing this on macOS but it also works on Linux, *BSD and other Unixy things, and Windows folks can do something similar or identical in e.g. WSL), start up the pipe and leave it running for the duration of your session. Essentially we want to listen on two sockets at once but take data from one of the ports and feed it to the other, and two socats lashed together can do this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;% socat -s -d0 tcp-listen:5555,bind=127.0.0.1,fork STDOUT | socat -s -d0 STDIN tcp-listen:4444,bind=127.0.0.1,fork&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The -s -d0 options make it more bulletproof and suppress warnings.) There is a shorter alternative with netcat:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;nc -lk 5555 | nc -lk 4444&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, note that as written this listens on all interfaces, not just localhost as the socat version does, which can be dangerous on a public network. Some versions or forks may let you change the listen address with -s 127.0.0.1. Either way, with this pipe running MAME will duly connect to the listener on port 4444, but programs we squirt into port 5555 will get passed over the shell pipe to the listener process on port 4444 and thus be transparently sent to MAME. This link isn't bidirectional, but we don't need it to be since our hacked SMS can't transmit anyway, so I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One other consideration is that if you reset the emulator, you may lose the link because MAME closes the connection and opens a new socket which will be a different process. I found it simplest just to quit and restart MAME manually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now for the MAME ROMs. Since most of you aren't going to have a real Super Micro Script, you can get the SMSBUG ROM from the Github project. Create a directory called smicros in your MAME ROMs folder, and then put smsbug.rom in it. To replace the font ROM with a less encumbered alternative, I added another ROM entry for the default 6847 font but with the unused characters blanked out as they are in the regular SMS font; this file is called 6847font.rom, is also in the Github project, and goes in the same directory. (If you do have real SMS ROMs, unscramble them using descramble and deframble, then rename the main ROM to smicros.rom and the font ROM to font.rom and place them in the same roms/smicros directory.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, build MAME. In the source tree under src/mame, create scriptovision/ and put smicros.cpp in it, then edit src/mame/mame.lst to include the following, keeping it in alphabetical order and making sure there are blank lines between it and the other stanzas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;@source:scriptovision/smicros.cpp smicros&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can either do a full build at this point or a single-driver build, which is what I use (on my M1 MacBook Air, I do make SUBTARGET=sms SOURCES=scriptovision/smicros.cpp REGENIE=1 -j8 which yields a binary called sms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally we'll start the emulator. Here I'm using that single-driver build but the rest of the command line is the same if you compiled it into a full MAME binary. If you have no real SMS ROMs, use BIOS smsbugf for SMSBUG and the 6847 font ROM both on Github. Otherwise, you can also request BIOS factory for the factory ROMs, or smsbug for SMSBUG but using the factory SMS font ROM (my personal preference). The other options after selecting the BIOS set up a "bitbanger" serial port which connects to TCP port 4444 and internally routes the data it receives to the driver's emulated null modem:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;./sms smicros -bios smsbugf -rs232 null_modem -bitb socket.127.0.0.1:4444&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, after you skip through the MAME info screens you'll be in SMSBUG on your very own emulated homebrew Super Micro Script, here using the 6847 internal font:&lt;/p&gt;By default you'll be in SMSBUG's memory monitor and U-bank 0 (the hex digit before each address). Page through memory with the up and down cursor keys; type slowly when interacting with the emulator, as the ROM is designed for a real SMS with the blister keypad, and those need a lot of debouncing. To look at different U-banks (this only matters when viewing the $8000-$9fff range), press U (a "U" will appear) and then press any even numbered hex digit. 0-9 are the numbers 0-9, but since these are doubled with A-J on the keypad, use K-P to generate A-F. You can jump to any address by typing a full four digits (press ESC, mapped to *, to cancel).&lt;p&gt;As a test of our network bitbanger, let's attempt to load one of the checksummed binaries. Press R ("receive") to accept a transmission to $8000 in the current U-bank and the screen will change to bright orange, indicating SMSBUG is ready for data. We'll choose my inexpertly rendered Canadian flag screen. In another terminal window,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;nc localhost 5555 &amp;lt; cflag.chk&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You'll see a flash of the flag and then, assuming you don't get a checksum ERROR, be returned to the SMSBUG monitor. Press TAB (mapped to PAGE) and you should see one sorry-looking maple leaf.&lt;/p&gt;De rien, Canada. The ESC/* key will return you to SMSBUG. But before we look at some other programs for our homebrew SMS, let's also get this working on our real Super Micro Script.&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have already placed the two serial clips on, next we need to burn this to a real ROM so I can use the ROM emulator for something else. The 2732 EPROM is a little bit of a problem child, though: some of the very common Xgecu programmers cannot generate the necessary voltage without modification, and it's just my luck to have one of those. Plus, UV-erasable EPROMs aren't nearly as convenient as flash anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution came, of all places, from the automotive tuning enthusiast community. It turns out 2732s were used a lot on various older engine control units and our gearhead friends have ways to replace them. C.A.T.S. sells a passive conversion board called the G2 EPROM Adapter for $35 at time of writing which takes a more typical SST27SF512 64K flash chip and reroutes the signals (not affiliated, just satisfied). You program the 27SF512, then plunk it in the adapter and install it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking the generated file smsbug.rom, we repeat it 16 times to ensure that we get the same bundle of bits no matter how it gets programmed, and then flash the entire thing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;% perl -e 'print "smsbug.rom " x 16' smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom % cat smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom smsbug.rom &amp;gt; main512.rom % minipro -p SST27SF512@DIP28 -w main512.rom [...] Erasing... 0.21Sec OK Writing Code... 17.84Sec OK Reading Code... 1.10Sec OK Verification OK&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;quote&gt;% minipro -p 2732A@DIP24 -r test.rom [...] Reading Code... 0.13Sec OK % md5sum smsbug.rom 53d5311edb14b992a137e445cb0fa884 smsbug.rom % md5sum test.rom 53d5311edb14b992a137e445cb0fa884 test.rom&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure it's aligned properly in the adapter for the check read; it will overhang the ZIF socket slightly because its pins are shifted back. (Hashes only current as of this writing, of course.)&lt;/p&gt;Out goes the probe and in goes the flash. I also put in a green clip for our serial wire instead of red since I decided I liked that colour better. Now SMSBUG is running independently on the real Super Micro Script as well. Programs are loaded into it the same way, using a TTL-to-USB serial dongle and any terminal program at 19.2kbps (e.g., picocom -b19200 /dev/path/to/your/serial/port --send-cmd="ascii-xfr -snv"). And to prove it's reproducible and reversible, I went ahead and did the same mod to my working issue 3, using a blue serial jumper so I can tell them apart without looking at the serial numbers. Yes, you too can make your own homebrew SMS with just two clips and a new ROM. Fired up and working and testing the genlock with this fun little composite test pattern generator that runs on an M5StickC-Plus2.&lt;p&gt;Let's explore the other demonstrations I put together. Along with cflag.chk you've also already seen charset.chk; that was our sample image of all 256 character glyphs.&lt;/p&gt;When creating the VM I didn't really have a systematic way of selecting which opcodes to support; I decided just to create a few simple programs and see what was efficient to do. Since we only have 4K of ROM to work with, I already knew it wasn't possible to emulate every single 6800 opcode, and some opcodes would have to be unique to or modified for the SMS (for example, I repurposed the otherwise useless WAI and RTI instructions as key-wait and return-to-SMSBUG opcodes). Opcodes "internal" to the emulated CPU or that don't require banking pages out are stacked back-to-back up to approximately the maximum number of cycles available in the vertical blank; otherwise, opcodes that modify the screen automatically force a VBL wait where appropriate.&lt;p&gt;A simple game is always a good first project, so I put together an SMS version of Paper-Scissors-Rock (Rock Paper Scissors, whatever). SMSBUG VM programs are primarily interpreted, but may contain small sections of native code which are copied into a 32-byte buffer in the low internal RAM of the 6802 and executed from there. While VM-based programs are still assembled with the Macroassembler AS, there is a include file that sets all the proper modes and provides macros for the emulated opcodes. Paper-Scissors-Rock primarily tests screen and character handling and the built-in random number generator (a simple PRNG based on Xorshift), with some of the decision logic written in native code blocks to make it more compact. Gameplay is self-explanatory. Load psr.chk with the (R)eceive key and then e(X)ecute it (with the X key). The eXecute option will automatically run the VM for addresses between $8000 and $8fff. The source code is in psr.a68.&lt;/p&gt;For comparison, here is the Hello World I created for testing native machine code (the source is mltest.a68). It's slower than it should be, mostly because it has to call into SMSBUG or create small low-memory routines to do anything with the S-bank, which also makes any aspiring demo screen effects a lot more complicated. Sure, you could create a whole bunch of support routines and call them to handle common tasks, but then you might as well just make those calls into opcodes for compactness, right? Receive mltest.chk, but instead of immediately eXecuting it, enter 9000 to move the monitor to $9000, and then eXecute. This memory range mirrors $8000, but SMSBUG treats anything outside of $8000-$8fff as native code instead of VM code, setting the U-bank before it jumps into it. Press any key to return to SMSBUG.&lt;p&gt;Wait, you still want to use it as a video titler too? Hey, we got yer back.&lt;/p&gt;For slides, I wrote up a simple slide show system that goes through the other pages and displays them, a la what the original SMS menu did. Receive slides.chk into U-bank 0 and your other screens into the next ones (remember, U changes the U-bank; R will load to whatever the current U-bank is). For this example, Receive cflag.chk into U-bank 2 and charset.chk into U-bank 4.&lt;p&gt;Now go back to U-bank 0 where the slides code is. Look at the bytes at $8003 and $8004 (as shown in the screenshot). This is the total number of screens (here two) and the number of VBLs to wait between screens (200, roughly 3 seconds or so). The default is fine for our two screens, but if you want to change them, enter the address (either 8003 or 8004) and then the S key (Set), and then type hex bytes which will be stored; press ESC/* when you're done. Either way, when ready, ensure you're in U-bank 0 at address $8000 and eXecute the program. The screens are shown from last to first and cycle in that order endlessly. Hold down ESC/* to exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advantage of implementing the slideshow feature as a runnable VM program, besides saving space in ROM, is now you can have it do more than just flip pages: you could alter the code to animate screens, change colours, place text on them, you name it. The source code is in slides.a68. I should parenthetically note here that it isn't possible to Receive to U-bank E from the SMSBUG monitor because the monitor uses that page as its S-bank (so it gets overwritten immediately), which limits you to six slides (2, 4, 6, 8, A and C). However, page E is free for use once your program is executing.&lt;/p&gt;Horizontal scrolling, however, is one thing that the VM is not well-suited for, and even a native code scroller loaded into the RAM sandwich would have to do a lot of fancy footwork between pages. I decided this one I would implement in SMSBUG. As an example of the scroller in action, Receive scroll.chk into the current U-bank, than press T. A scroll appears on the bottom of the screen and repeats endlessly until you press ESC/*. Here I have it genlocked with the composite video generator.&lt;p&gt;The first byte in the U-bank ($8000) is the speed between characters, again measured in VBLs. Change this with the Set option. The scroll routine doesn't do multiple pages nor zoomed characters, but you can have multiple scroll texts in different U-banks and switch between them by changing the U-bank before starting the scroll. The scroller uses S-bank E like the SMSBUG monitor, permitting up to seven scroll strings in the other U-banks. The Perl script genscroll.pl takes a string of up to 446 ASCII characters on standard input and creates a checksum file, converting the characters to screen codes and padding it with black spaces on either side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally what passes for a demo, or at least an advertisement: a fully animated "store demo" for the homebrew Super Micro Script. This video is of a real SMS. It pushes the VM fairly close to its limits and there is some "snow" during scrolling because not all of the byte moves get done before the 6847 starts fetching again, but I still think it came out pretty good for a hack thrown together over a weekend. It uses the VM primitives for screen scrolling and filling to generate the colour bar effects, and string display for the informational text boxes. Receive ad.chk and eXecute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's finish the story of Scriptovision before we conclude.&lt;/p&gt;The Super Micro Script was succeeded in 1990 by the Micro Script IV, a radically different unit. Three fonts were included, with upper and lower case letters in sixteen sizes and seven colours with proportional spacing. The slideshow and scroll/crawl modes were now complemented by slide and cycle modes, up to 32 screens were supported, the genlock remained standard equipment, and it additionally provided an RS-232 port for input. It sold for $895 [about $2185 in 2026 dollars], plus $23 shipping. Inflation had hit the demo tape as well: it was now $15.&lt;p&gt;While it's not clear what the architecture was, we know this was a small business that used chips from off-the-shelf, and the presence of a PC keyboard suggests it may well have been ... an embedded x86 PC. Indeed, seven colours could be an EGA palette if they only used one brightness and didn't count black, but this is mere conjecture on my part. The Micro Script IV was succeeded by the Micro Script V in the mid-1990s, though I can't find any information on it, and it appears to be the last of the line. Scriptovision also developed a duplication system in 1997 called (surprise!) Duplicator, also with apparently no surviving documentation, and to date I've found no further record of any later products the company made. Nevertheless, it was not officially dissolved until 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall I'm pretty happy with how this homebrew "Canadian home computer" came out, and we solved some mysteries about the hardware in the process. Scriptovision clearly didn't intend this machine to be used in this fashion and for 1985 it would not have been a cutting-edge general purpose computer by any means, but it was certainly comparable to other low-end machines and at the right price it might have found sufficient interest. Indeed, the built-in genlock would certainly have been a unique feature in a home system. I look forward to other people using this article to convert the next Super Micro Script they run across on eBay, or devise a simpler version for the Micro Script, and then start writing their own programs. The Great White North deserves no less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have not done a pull request to the MAME team for the SMS MAME driver. I don't know if they'd be interested in a video titler (and a hacked one at that), nor have I closely audited what I wrote for adherence to their code policy. However, if you know this is something the MAME project would want, let me know in the comments or on Github.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the programs in this article, including the ROM scramblers and unscramblers, the SMSBUG source code, and the sample programs, along with full documentation of the SMSBUG VM opcodes and system calls, are in the Github project. They are provided to you under a BSD 3-clause license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Newsletter platform Substack has confirmed a data breach in an email to users. The company said that in October, an “unauthorized third party” accessed user data, including email addresses, phone numbers, and other unspecified “internal metadata.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Substack specified that more sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, passwords, and other financial information, was unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an email sent to users, Substack chief executive Chris Best said that the company identified the issue in February that allowed someone to access its systems. Best said that Substack has fixed the problem and started an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’m reaching out to let you know about a security incident that resulted in the email address and phone number from your Substack account being shared without your permission,” said Best in the email to users. “I’m incredibly sorry this happened. We take our responsibility to protect your data and your privacy seriously, and we came up short here.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not clear what exactly the issue was with its systems, and the scope of the data that was accessed. It’s also not yet known why the company took five months to detect the breach, or if it was contacted by hackers demanding a ransom. TechCrunch asked the company for more details, and we will update our story if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Substack did not say how many users are affected. The company said that it doesn’t have any evidence that users’ data is being misused, but did not say what technical means, such as logs, it has to detect evidence of abuse. However, the company asked users to take caution with emails and texts without any particular indicators or direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On its website, Substack says that its site has more than 50 million active subscriptions, including 5 million paid subscriptions — a milestone it reached last March. In July 2025, the company raised $100 million in Series C funding led by BOND and The Chernin Group (TCG), with participation from a16z, Klutch Sports Group CEO Rich Paul, and Skims co-founder Jens Grede.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Changelog 31 - Masterful Material, Expressive Emotions, Awesome Android&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h6"&gt;Written on February 8, 2026 by Inhishonor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;23.2 Halftime Release&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello again!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last few months have been quite the endeavor, as we have been busy rebasing and updating LineageOS, on not one but two large AOSP releases. Nevertheless, we have persevered and are pleased to present LineageOS 23.2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Changes in AOSP&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, AOSP has been shifting to a quarterly release cadence, meaning that new features and bug fixes are released every three months. Google recently announced that AOSP will be shifting to a biannual release cadence, meaning that the latest fixes and features will drop every six months now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Android Security Bulletins will still be released, and picked to all supported LineageOS versions monthly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this change does not significantly alter our development process, it is worth noting that LineageOS will adopt a six-month cadence, with work on each new point release starting every six months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What’s Changed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you install or upgrade to this release, you will immediately notice the new UI and color scheme. This is because LineageOS is now officially using Google’s Material Expressive design system which focuses on expressive colors, and emotive design elements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, you may notice the updated UI of the Quick Settings panel, which now contains fully customizable tiles, which in our opinion are much more pleasant to use! In this release, you will also find an expanded dark theme, and more powerful file utilities surrounding private spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Updated Apps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This release mainly focuses on the Material Expressive design language, and in the interest of keeping up with these guidelines, we have been working diligently at updating the default apps to Material Expressive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Updater&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contributor pjgowtham has been hard at work on updating the Updater app, and when those changes are merged, you will be treated to a completely redesigned UI, improved update management, delightful animations and various bugs fixed. It wasn’t quite ready for the 23.2 launch, but will be soon, so be on the lookout!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Other apps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to the Updater, Twelve (the default music app), Deskclock and ExactCalculator have received Material 3 Expressive updates, which brings them into the modern era. Stay tuned for similar updates to the other default apps!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Development Tools&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the previous release changelog, we teased some development tools that were in the midst of being reviewed. These have now been merged, and developers have some new tools in their arsenal:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;beautify_rro.py&lt;/code&gt;: Beautifies multiple existing RROs given a directory.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;generate_rro.py&lt;/code&gt;: Extracts RROs from a prebuilt overlays directory.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;update_certificates.py&lt;/code&gt;: Updates app certificates given a stock dump directory.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;decompile_cil.py&lt;/code&gt;: Extracts sepolicy rules from a prebuilt SELinux image.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;extract_aconfig.py&lt;/code&gt;: Extracts config files from stock dumps.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;match_manifest_tarball.py&lt;/code&gt;: Matches kernel (or source) tarball releases against public Git history.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Leadership Changes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After roughly seven years with Lineage, and another five with CyanogenMod, we’re sad to announce Rashed is stepping away from the project to spend more time offline. We wish him the best!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re also glad to announce that the current directors group have voted Nolen Johnson (npjohnson) in as the ninth director. Welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Deprecations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, we feel that the 23.2 branch has reached feature and stability parity with 23.0 and is ready for initial release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will still allow new LineageOS 21 submissions to be forked to the organization, but we will continue our policy of no longer allowing newly submitted LineageOS 21 devices to ship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LineageOS 23.2 will launch building for a decent selection of devices, with additional devices to come as they meet the requirements specified by the Charter and are marked as ready for builds by their maintainer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Upgrading to LineageOS 23.2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To upgrade, please follow the upgrade guide for your device by clicking on it here and then on “Upgrade to a higher version of LineageOS”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re coming from an unofficial build, you need to follow the good ole’ install guide for your device, just like anyone else looking to install LineageOS for the first time. These can be found at the same place here by clicking on your device and then on “Installation”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please note that if you’re currently on an official build, you DO NOT need to wipe your device, unless your device’s wiki page specifically dictates otherwise, as is needed for some devices with massive changes, such as a repartition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Developers, Developers, Developers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or, in this case, maintainers, maintainers, maintainers. We want your device submissions!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re a developer and would like to submit your device for officials, it’s easier than ever. Just follow the instructions here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above also applies to people looking to bring back devices that were at one point official but are no longer supported - seriously - even if it’s not yet completely compliant, submit it! Maybe we can help you complete it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After you submit, within generally a few weeks, but in most cases a week, you’ll receive some feedback on your device submission; and if it’s up to par, you’ll be invited to our communications instances and your device will be forked to LineageOS’s official repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t have the knowledge to maintain a device, but want to contribute to the platform? We have lots of other things you can contribute to. For instance, our apps suite is always looking for new people to help improve them, or you can contribute to the wiki by adding more useful information &amp;amp; documentation. Gerrit is always open for submissions! Once you’ve contributed a few things, send an email to devrel(at)lineageos.org detailing them, and we’ll get you in the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, if you sent a submission that didn’t get a response in the last few months, please follow up, we’ve swapped providers again!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Generic Targets&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ve talked about these before, but these are important, so we will cover them again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although we’ve had buildable generic targets since 2019, to make LineageOS more accessible to developers, and really anyone interested in giving LineageOS a try, we’ve documented how to use them in conjunction with the Android Emulator/Android Studio!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, similar targets can now be used to build GSI in mobile, Android TV configurations, and Android Automotive making LineageOS more accessible than ever to devices using Google’s Project Treble. We won’t be providing official builds for these targets, due to the fact the user experience varies entirely based on how well the device manufacturer complied with Treble’s requirements, but feel free to go build them yourself and give it a shot!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please note that Android 12 (and by proxy all later Android versions) diverged GSI and Emulator targets. Emulator targets reside in &lt;code&gt;lineage_sdk_$arch&lt;/code&gt;, while GSI targets reside in
&lt;code&gt;lineage_gsi_$arch&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, experimental targets now exist for QEMU-based virtual machine software (libvirt, UTM, etc). Instructions on building and utilizing these targets can be found on the Wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Translations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bilingual? Trilingual? Anything-lingual?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you think you can help translate LineageOS to a different language, jump over to our wiki and have a go! If your language is not supported natively in Android, reach out to us on Crowdin and we’ll take the necessary steps to include your language. For instance, LineageOS is the first Android custom distribution that has complete support for the Welsh (Cymraeg) language thanks to its community of translators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please, contribute to translations only if you are reasonably literate in the target language; poor translations waste both our time and yours.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matchlock is a CLI tool for running AI agents in ephemeral microVMs - with network allowlisting, secret injection via MITM proxy, and everything else blocked by default. Your secrets never enter the VM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI agents need to run code, but giving them unrestricted access to your machine is a risk. Matchlock lets you hand an agent a full Linux environment that boots in under a second - isolated, disposable, and locked down by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When your agent calls an API the real credentials are injected in-flight by the host. The sandbox only ever sees a placeholder. The network is sealed by default and nothing gets out unless you say so. Even if the agent is tricked into running something malicious your keys don't leak and there's nowhere for data to go. Inside the agent gets a full Linux environment to do whatever it needs. It can install packages and write files and make a mess. Outside your machine doesn't feel a thing. Every sandbox runs on its own copy-on-write filesystem that vanishes when you're done. Same CLI and same behaviour whether you're on a Linux server or a MacBook.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Linux with KVM support&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;macOS on Apple Silicon&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;brew tap jingkaihe/essentials
brew install matchlock&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Basic
matchlock run --image alpine:latest cat /etc/os-release
matchlock run --image alpine:latest -it sh

# Network allowlist
matchlock run --image python:3.12-alpine \
  --allow-host "api.openai.com" python agent.py

# Secret injection (never enters the VM)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-xxx
matchlock run --image python:3.12-alpine \
  --secret ANTHROPIC_API_KEY@api.anthropic.com python call_api.py

# Long-lived sandboxes
matchlock run --image alpine:latest --rm=false   # prints VM ID
matchlock exec vm-abc12345 -it sh                # attach to it

# Lifecycle
matchlock list | kill | rm | prune

# Build from Dockerfile (uses BuildKit-in-VM)
matchlock build -f Dockerfile -t myapp:latest .

# Pre-build rootfs from registry image (caches for faster startup)
matchlock build alpine:latest

# Image management
matchlock image ls                                           # List all images
matchlock image rm myapp:latest                              # Remove a local image
docker save myapp:latest | matchlock image import myapp:latest  # Import from tarball&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matchlock also ships with Go and Python SDKs for embedding sandboxes directly in your application. Allows you to programmatically launch VMs, exec commands, stream output and write files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original Game (1982) by Atari, Inc.&lt;lb/&gt; Original Designer: Howard Scott Warshaw&lt;lb/&gt; Disassembly &amp;amp; Analysis: Dennis Debro &amp;amp; Halkun (That's me!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This repository contains the fully reverse-engineered and commented source code for the Atari 2600 classic, Raiders of the Lost Ark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project has been reorganized for a clean development workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/&lt;/code&gt;: Contains the main assembly source (&lt;code&gt;raiders.asm&lt;/code&gt;) and header files (&lt;code&gt;tia_constants.h&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;bin/&lt;/code&gt;: Contains build tools (DASM) and emulator executable (Stella).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;out/&lt;/code&gt;: Destination for compiled binaries (&lt;code&gt;.bin&lt;/code&gt;), symbol files (&lt;code&gt;.sym&lt;/code&gt;), and listing files (&lt;code&gt;.lst&lt;/code&gt;). (auto generated at compile time)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;make.bat&lt;/code&gt;: Windows batch script to compile the project.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;run.bat&lt;/code&gt;: Windows batch script to launch the compiled game.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Windows OS&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;DASM: &lt;code&gt;dasm.exe&lt;/code&gt;must be in the&lt;code&gt;bin/&lt;/code&gt;folder.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stella: &lt;code&gt;Stella.exe&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;SDL2.dll&lt;/code&gt;must be in the&lt;code&gt;bin/&lt;/code&gt;folder (optional, for running).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run the build script from the root directory:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make.bat&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launch the compiled ROM in Stella:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;run.bat&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game uses a 2-bank ROM (8KB total) with bank-switching via strobes at &lt;code&gt;BANK0STROBE&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;$FFF8&lt;/code&gt;) and &lt;code&gt;BANK1STROBE&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;$FFF9&lt;/code&gt;). Bank switching is done through a self-modifying code technique whare opcodes are written into zero-page RAM variables and executed in-place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bank 0 (&lt;code&gt;BANK0TOP&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;$D000&lt;/code&gt;): Contains game logic — collision handling, inventory management, room event handlers, scoring, movement, input processing, and sound.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bank 1 (&lt;code&gt;BANK1TOP&lt;/code&gt;=&lt;code&gt;$F000&lt;/code&gt;): Contains the display kernels, sprite data, playfield graphics, room handler dispatch, and music frequency tables.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like all Atari 2600 games, the program is structured around the NTSC television signal — one complete pass through the loop produces one frame of video (~60 fps). The frame is divided into four phases: VSYNC, VBLANK, Kernel (visible picture), and Overscan. Game logic is split across VBLANK and Overscan to stay within the CPU time budgets of each phase, and the two ROM banks are switched in and out at specific points every frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Entry point: &lt;code&gt;startNewFrame&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CPU asserts the VSYNC signal for exactly 3 scanlines, during which it performs lightweight housekeeping:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Scanline&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Work&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Assert VSYNC. Clamp weapon position — if &lt;code&gt;weaponPosY&lt;/code&gt; ≤ &lt;code&gt;$50&lt;/code&gt;, center &lt;code&gt;weaponPosX&lt;/code&gt;. Increment &lt;code&gt;frameCount&lt;/code&gt;; every 64th frame (&lt;code&gt;and #$3f&lt;/code&gt;) increments &lt;code&gt;timeOfDay&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;eventTimer&lt;/code&gt; is negative, decrement it (paralysis/cutscene countdown).&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Check for game restart — if &lt;code&gt;arkRoomStateFlag&lt;/code&gt; bit 7 is set (endgame state) AND the RESET switch is pressed, jump to &lt;code&gt;startGame&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;De-assert VSYNC. Arm the VBLANK timer: &lt;code&gt;TIM64T = VBLANK_TIME&lt;/code&gt; (44). This gives 44 × 64 = 2,816 cycles ≈ 37 scanlines of CPU time for game logic.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All game logic runs while the TIA outputs a blank screen. Work is spread across both ROM banks with two bank switches during this phase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the largest block of game code, executing in order every frame:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Step&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Label&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;frameFirstLine&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Game-over check: if &lt;code&gt;gameEventFlag&lt;/code&gt; overflows to 0, call &lt;code&gt;getFinalScore&lt;/code&gt; and transition to the Ark Room.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;checkShowDevInitials&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ark Room / title screen: if in the Ark Room, play Raiders March, check Yar bonus for HSW initials easter egg. Otherwise skip.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;(Ark Room only)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Pedestal elevator: slowly lower Indy to his score height. Check fire button for restart. Set &lt;code&gt;arkRoomStateFlag&lt;/code&gt; to enable RESET.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;HandleEasterEgg&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Cutscene check: if &lt;code&gt;screenEventState&lt;/code&gt; bit 6 is set, advance the Arkbreveal sequence.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;advanceArkSeq&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Snake AI: every 4th frame, grow snake sprite, steer toward Indy using &lt;code&gt;snakePosXOffsetTable&lt;/code&gt;, update &lt;code&gt;ballPosX&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ballPosY&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;kernelRenderState&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;configSnake&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Snake kernel setup: load &lt;code&gt;kernelDataPtrLo/Hi&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;kernelDataIndex&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;snakeMotionTable&lt;/code&gt; for the wiggling ball sprite.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;checkMajorEventDone&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;If &lt;code&gt;gameEventFlag&lt;/code&gt; bit 7 is set (death in progress), skip to &lt;code&gt;finishedScrollUpdate&lt;/code&gt; — bypass normal input.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;8&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;checkGameScriptTimer&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;If &lt;code&gt;eventTimer&lt;/code&gt; is negative (Indy paralyzed/frozen), force standing sprite and skip input.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;9&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;branchOnFrameParity&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Frame parity split: even frames run full input processing. Odd frames skip to &lt;code&gt;clearItemUseOnButtonRelease&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;10&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;gatePlayerTriggeredEvent&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Weapon aiming: joystick moves the weapon crosshair (missile 1) with boundary clamping.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;11&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;handleIndyMove&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Movement: read &lt;code&gt;SWCHA&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;getMoveDir&lt;/code&gt; → move Indy → check room boundary override tables (&lt;code&gt;CheckRoomOverrideCondition&lt;/code&gt;) → trigger room transitions if a boundary is crossed.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;12&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;HandleIInventorySelect&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Left controller: fire button cycles through inventory slots. Handles item drop, bullet reload (+3), and shovel placement.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;13&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;clearItemUseOnButtonRelease&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Clears &lt;code&gt;USING_GRENADE_OR_PARACHUTE&lt;/code&gt; flag on right fire button release.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;14&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;handleItemUse&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Right controller: fire button dispatches the selected item — grenade throw/cook timer, parachute deploy, grapple hook launch, shovel dig, Ankh warp, revolver fire, whip strike. This is the largest single block in VBLANK.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;15&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;updateIndyParachuteSprite&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sprite selection: choose Indy's current sprite pointer — parachute sprite, standing sprite, or walk-cycle animation (advances frame on a timer).&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;16&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;handleMesaScroll&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Vertical scrolling: in Mesa Field or Valley of Poison, shift the camera offset (&lt;code&gt;roomObjectVar&lt;/code&gt;) and adjust all object Y positions to scroll the world.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At &lt;code&gt;finishedScrollUpdate&lt;/code&gt;, the code writes &lt;code&gt;selectRoomHandler&lt;/code&gt; as the target address and jumps through the &lt;code&gt;jumpToBank1&lt;/code&gt; trampoline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;selectRoomHandler&lt;/code&gt; dispatches via &lt;code&gt;roomHandlerJmpTable&lt;/code&gt; — each room has its own handler that runs room-specific AI and physics:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;

        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Sets mesa landing bonus, then shares thief-movement code&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All handlers exit via &lt;code&gt;jmpSetupNewRoom&lt;/code&gt;, which bank-switches back to Bank 0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;setupNewRoom&lt;/code&gt; prepares the TIA for display:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If &lt;code&gt;screenInitFlag&lt;/code&gt;≠ 0, call&lt;code&gt;updateRoomEventState&lt;/code&gt;(one-shot room initialization), then clear the flag.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;NUSIZ0&lt;/code&gt;from the per-room&lt;code&gt;HMOVETable&lt;/code&gt;entry.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;CTRLPF&lt;/code&gt;from&lt;code&gt;roomPFControlFlags&lt;/code&gt;(playfield reflection/priority/ball size).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;COLUBK&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;COLUPF&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;COLUP0&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;COLUP1&lt;/code&gt;from per-room color tables.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If in the Thieves' Den or Well of Souls, initialize 5 thief HMOVE positions from table data.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then &lt;code&gt;setObjPosX&lt;/code&gt; positions all 5 TIA objects (P0, P1, M0, M1, Ball) using the coarse/fine HMOVE technique. This consumes 6 scanlines (one WSYNC per object + one for HMOVE).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;code&gt;waitTime&lt;/code&gt; spins on &lt;code&gt;INTIM&lt;/code&gt; until the VBLANK timer expires, then bank-switches to Bank 1 for &lt;code&gt;drawScreen&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Entry point: &lt;code&gt;drawScreen&lt;/code&gt; (Bank 1)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first few visible lines set up the display state:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clear horizontal motion registers (&lt;code&gt;HMCLR&lt;/code&gt;) and collision latches (&lt;code&gt;CXCLR&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Write initial PF0/PF1/PF2 from per-room playfield tables.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Enable TIA output (&lt;code&gt;VBLANK = 0&lt;/code&gt;), zero the&lt;code&gt;scanline&lt;/code&gt;counter.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disable the Ball sprite in the Map Room (used for the sun position mechanic).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Read &lt;code&gt;SWCHA&lt;/code&gt;→ set&lt;code&gt;REFP1&lt;/code&gt;for Indy sprite reflection (skipped during death/Ark Room).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Three WSYNC+HMOVE pairs to settle object positions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Dispatch to the appropriate kernel via RTS-trick: push return address from &lt;code&gt;kernelJumpTable&lt;/code&gt;indexed by&lt;code&gt;KernelJumpTableIndex&lt;/code&gt;for the current room, then&lt;code&gt;rts&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kernel index table maps each room to one of four kernels:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Index&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Kernel&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Rooms&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Scanline Method&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;staticSpriteKernel&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0–5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2 scanlines/iteration, 80 iterations&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;scrollingPlayfieldKernel&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6–10&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2 scanlines/iteration, 80 iterations&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;multiplexedSpriteKernel&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;11–12&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;State machine, variable per thief zone&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;arkPedestalKernel&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;13&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1 scanline/iteration, ~160 lines&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;staticSpriteKernel&lt;/code&gt; (Treasure Room, Marketplace, Entrance, Black Market, Map Room, Mesa Side):
Two scanlines per loop. Scanline 1: HMOVE, check snake/ball draw range, enable missiles M0 (web/swarm) and M1 (weapon) by comparing against their Y positions. Scanline 2: draw P0 sprite — bit 7 of the graphics data encodes inline TIA register writes (color/HMOVE) instead of shape data, allowing P0 to change color or position mid-frame. Enable the ball by scanline comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;scrollingPlayfieldKernel&lt;/code&gt; (Temple Entrance, Spider Room, Shining Light, Mesa Field, Valley of Poison):
Two scanlines per loop with playfield scrolling. On each iteration, the scanline is compared to &lt;code&gt;p0DrawStartLine&lt;/code&gt; — above that boundary, the kernel indexes &lt;code&gt;(pf1GfxPtrLo),y&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;(pf2GfxPtrLo),y&lt;/code&gt; with a scroll offset (&lt;code&gt;roomObjectVar&lt;/code&gt;) to render the scrolling wall. Below that boundary, &lt;code&gt;dynamicGfxData&lt;/code&gt; renders destructible dungeon wall segments or cleared passages. Both paths draw P0 and P1 (Indy) by scanline–vs–Y comparison. The ball object is driven through &lt;code&gt;(kernelDataPtrLo),y&lt;/code&gt; for the snake wiggle animation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;multiplexedSpriteKernel&lt;/code&gt; (Thieves' Den, Well of Souls):
Displays 5 enemy thieves using a single P0 hardware sprite, repositioned between each thief's zone (~32 scanlines each). Operates as a state machine via &lt;code&gt;kernelRenderState&lt;/code&gt;: positioning phase (bit 7) uses a coarse/fine delay loop to place RESP0, drawing phase (bit 6) streams &lt;code&gt;(p0GfxPtrLo),y&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(kernelDataPtrLo),y&lt;/code&gt; for sprite and color data across 16 lines. Between thief zones, P1 (Indy) is drawn using the PHP/stack trick — &lt;code&gt;txs&lt;/code&gt; redirects the stack pointer so that &lt;code&gt;php&lt;/code&gt; writes directly to TIA enable registers (&lt;code&gt;ENABL&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ENAM1&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;ENAM0&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;code&gt;$1F&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;$1E&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;$1D&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;arkPedestalKernel&lt;/code&gt; (Ark Room — title and ending screen):
Single-height scanlines (1 WSYNC per line). Lines 0–14: draw the Ark top/wings sprite with rainbow color cycling (only in win state). Lines 15–28: draw the Ark body with alternating gold patterns. Lines 29–143: draw Indy's standing sprite at the pedestal height determined by &lt;code&gt;adventurePoints&lt;/code&gt; — above Indy is empty, below is the diamond-pattern &lt;code&gt;PedestalLiftSprite&lt;/code&gt;. Lines 144–159: draw the pedestal base.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All four room kernels converge at &lt;code&gt;drawInventoryKernel&lt;/code&gt;, which draws the bottom-of-screen inventory strip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2 lines: Clear all sprites, fill PF1/PF2 solid (separator bar).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2 lines: Set &lt;code&gt;NUSIZ0&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;NUSIZ1&lt;/code&gt;to 3-copies-close mode, enable VDEL for both players, position P0/P1 for 48-pixel-wide multiplexed rendering.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1 line: HMOVE to fine-position, set inventory item colors (gold), position ball (selection cursor).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;1 line: Clear playfield, set &lt;code&gt;COLUBK&lt;/code&gt;to black.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;5 lines: Burgundy background border.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;8 lines: &lt;code&gt;drawInventoryItems&lt;/code&gt;— render 6 inventory item sprites using the 48-pixel GRP0/GRP1 VDEL technique (write P0, P1, P0, P1, P0, P1 in rapid succession each line).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;4 lines: Clear sprites, reset VDEL/NUSIZ, draw selection cursor ball.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;4 lines: Final separator lines and overscan preparation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Immediately after the inventory kernel, the TIA is blanked (&lt;code&gt;VBLANK = $0F&lt;/code&gt;) and the overscan timer is armed: &lt;code&gt;TIM64T = OVERSCAN_TIME&lt;/code&gt; (36). This gives 36 × 64 = 2,304 cycles ≈ 30 scanlines. The stack pointer is also reset to &lt;code&gt;$FF&lt;/code&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Step&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Label&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;updateSoundRegisters&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Process both TIA audio channels (X=1, then X=0). Set AUDC, AUDV, AUDF. Dispatch to &lt;code&gt;playRaidersMarch&lt;/code&gt; (effect &lt;code&gt;$9C&lt;/code&gt;) or &lt;code&gt;playFluteMelody&lt;/code&gt; (effect &lt;code&gt;$84&lt;/code&gt;) for sustained music playback.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;finishUpdateSound&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;If holding the Timepiece: toggle open/closed sprite on right fire press. If holding the Flute: activate Snake Charmer song.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;updateEventState&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;If &lt;code&gt;screenEventState&lt;/code&gt; bit 7 is set: animate the on-screen event (move object toward target via &lt;code&gt;updateMoveToTarget&lt;/code&gt;), update timepiece graphics pointer for the snake reveal animation.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;UpdateInvItemPos&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Position 3 inventory display objects (X=2,3,4) via &lt;code&gt;UpdateInvObjPos&lt;/code&gt; — converts item slot sprite pointers into on-screen X positions.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;(death check)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Death dissolve sequence: if &lt;code&gt;gameEventFlag&lt;/code&gt; bit 7 is set, shrink &lt;code&gt;indySpriteHeight&lt;/code&gt; by 1 line every 16 frames with a descending sound effect. At height &amp;lt; 3 (hat only), rotate the flag and pause for 60 frames. At frame 120: respawn with full height, decrement &lt;code&gt;livesLeft&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;livesLeft&lt;/code&gt; goes negative, set &lt;code&gt;gameEventFlag = $FF&lt;/code&gt; (triggers game-over on the next frame's overflow check).&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;invItemSelectCycle&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;If not in the Ark Room: read &lt;code&gt;SWCHA&lt;/code&gt; left/right to cycle inventory selection. Handle hourglass → grapple initialization in Mesa Field. Drive the grapple state machine (incrementing stages, position alignment checks).&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At &lt;code&gt;jmpObjHitHandeler&lt;/code&gt;, the code bank-switches to Bank 0 and enters the collision dispatch chain. This reads the TIA collision registers that were latched during the kernel:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Step&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Label&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Collision Register&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Description&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;checkWeaponPlayerHit&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;CXM1P&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Weapon (M1) hit player/thief → flip thief direction, clear weapon, apply &lt;code&gt;thiefShotPenalty&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;

        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;CXM1FB&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Weapon hit playfield → destroy dungeon wall segment (modify &lt;code&gt;dynamicGfxData&lt;/code&gt; bitmask).&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;checkWeaponBallHit&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;CXM1FB&lt;/code&gt; bit 6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Weapon hit ball/snake → kill the snake.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;checkIndyBallHit&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;CXP1FB&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Indy hit playfield/ball → timepiece pickup, flute immunity check, tsetse fly paralysis, snake death.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;5&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;checkMesaSideExit&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;CXM0P&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Mesa Side: M0 collision enters Well of Souls; falling off (Indy Y ≥ &lt;code&gt;$4F&lt;/code&gt;) enters Valley of Poison.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;6&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;checkPlayerCollision&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;CXPPMM&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Player-player collision → dispatches to room-specific handlers via &lt;code&gt;playerHitJumpTable&lt;/code&gt; for pickups and interactions (whip, key, baskets, shovel, parachute landing, etc.).&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;7&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;playerHitDefault&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;CXP1FB&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Secondary dispatch → &lt;code&gt;playfieldHitJumpTable&lt;/code&gt; for wall/boundary collisions and idle room logic.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;8&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;checkMissile0Hit&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;CXM0P&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;M0-player collisions (spider web capture, tsetse swarm death), grenade detonation timer check.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the collision chain completes, execution falls through to &lt;code&gt;newFrame&lt;/code&gt;, which spins on &lt;code&gt;INTIM&lt;/code&gt; waiting for the overscan timer to expire — and the cycle begins again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both banks contain a symmetric trampoline routine (&lt;code&gt;jumpToBank1&lt;/code&gt; in Bank 0, &lt;code&gt;JumpToBank0&lt;/code&gt; in Bank 1). The trampoline writes self-modifying code into zero-page RAM (&lt;code&gt;temp0&lt;/code&gt;–&lt;code&gt;temp5&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;temp0: LDA $FFF8/$FFF9    ; reading the strobe address switches banks
temp3: JMP &amp;lt;target&amp;gt;        ; then jumps to the target address
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The caller sets &lt;code&gt;temp4&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;temp5&lt;/code&gt; to the target address before jumping to the trampoline. Executing &lt;code&gt;jmp temp0&lt;/code&gt; reads the bank strobe (switching ROM) and immediately jumps to the target label in the new bank.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bank switches per frame (in execution order):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;#&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Direction&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Trigger&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Target&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Bank 0 → 1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;finishedScrollUpdate&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;selectRoomHandler&lt;/code&gt; (room-specific handler)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Bank 1 → 0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;jmpSetupNewRoom&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;setupNewRoom&lt;/code&gt; (pre-kernel color/position setup)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Bank 0 → 1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;jmpDisplayKernel&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;drawScreen&lt;/code&gt; (visible kernel + overscan)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Bank 1 → 0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;jmpObjHitHandeler&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;checkWeaponPlayerHit&lt;/code&gt; (collision dispatch)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bank 1 also has a safety stub (&lt;code&gt;BANK1Start&lt;/code&gt;) at its reset vector entry — it immediately reads &lt;code&gt;BANK0STROBE&lt;/code&gt; to switch back to Bank 0 if Bank 1 is entered on power-on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Title / Ark Room: The Ark Room (&lt;code&gt;ID_ARK_ROOM&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;$0D&lt;/code&gt;) serves double duty as the title screen and the endgame screen. On cold boot, &lt;code&gt;startGame&lt;/code&gt; sets &lt;code&gt;currentRoomId = ID_ARK_ROOM&lt;/code&gt; and fills inventory with copyright text sprites. The VBLANK Ark Room logic plays the Raiders March, runs the pedestal elevator animation (lowering Indy to his score height), and checks the fire button for restart.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Death Sequence: Setting &lt;code&gt;gameEventFlag&lt;/code&gt; bit 7 triggers the death dissolve during overscan. Indy's sprite height shrinks by one line every 16 frames. Once only the hat remains (height &amp;lt; 3), the flag is rotated and the sprite disappears for 60 frames. At frame 120, Indy respawns at full height and &lt;code&gt;livesLeft&lt;/code&gt; is decremented. If lives drop below zero, &lt;code&gt;gameEventFlag&lt;/code&gt; is set to &lt;code&gt;$FF&lt;/code&gt; — on the next frame, the VBLANK overflow check catches this and transitions to the Ark Room.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Room Transitions: Triggered by the boundary override system in &lt;code&gt;handleIndyMove&lt;/code&gt;. When Indy crosses a room edge (checked via &lt;code&gt;CheckRoomOverrideCondition&lt;/code&gt; against per-room boundary tables), &lt;code&gt;currentRoomId&lt;/code&gt; is changed and &lt;code&gt;initRoomState&lt;/code&gt; reinitializes all per-room state — sprites, playfield pointers, object positions, and event flags. Special transitions include: Mesa Side fall into Valley of Poison (Y position check), M0 collision into Well of Souls, blown-open wall alignment into the Temple, and Ankh warp directly to Mesa Field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game uses 4 different scanline kernels selected via &lt;code&gt;KernelJumpTableIndex&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;kernelJumpTable&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Index&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Kernel&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Rooms&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;0&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;staticSpriteKernel&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Treasure Room, Marketplace, Entrance Room, Black Market, Map Room, Mesa Side&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;scrollingPlayfieldKernel&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Temple Entrance, Spider Room, Shining Light, Mesa Field, Valley of Poison&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;&lt;code&gt;multiplexedSpriteKernel&lt;/code&gt; (thiefKernel)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Thieves' Den, Well of Souls&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;arkPedestalKernel&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ark Room (title/ending)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each kernel handles TIA register writes differently to accommodate the visual needs of those rooms — the thief kernel manages multiple P0 objects across scanlines, while the playfield kernel handles scrolling dungeon walls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;staticSpriteKernel&lt;/code&gt;: P0's data stream is dual-purpose — bit 7 encodes direct TIA register writes (color/HMOVE) instead of graphics. Simplest kernel.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;scrollingPlayfieldKernel&lt;/code&gt;: Full PF1/PF2 rendering from pointer tables, dynamic dungeon wall segments, conventional P0/P1 drawing, ball object for timepiece. Supports scrollable rooms.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;multiplexedSpriteKernel&lt;/code&gt;: P0 is repositioned and redrawn multiple times per frame via coarse timing loops — classic scanline multiplexing to display several enemies from one hardware sprite.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;arkPedestalKernel&lt;/code&gt;: Single-purpose kernel for the title/ending screen — draws the Ark sprite and Indy on a height-adjustable pedestal.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are 14 rooms defined as constants (IDs &lt;code&gt;$00&lt;/code&gt;–&lt;code&gt;$0D&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;ID&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Constant&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;ID_TREASURE_ROOM&lt;/code&gt;

          &lt;code&gt;ID_WELL_OF_SOULS&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Well of Souls&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;$0D&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;ID_ARK_ROOM&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ark Room (Title/End)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Room transitions call &lt;code&gt;initRoomState&lt;/code&gt; which loads per-room data from tables: &lt;code&gt;roomBGColorTable&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;roomPFColorTable&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PFControlTable&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;objectPosXTable&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;roomObjPosYTable&lt;/code&gt;, playfield graphics pointers, and sprite data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each room has a handler dispatched from &lt;code&gt;roomHandlerJmpTable&lt;/code&gt; (Bank 1), which runs room-specific logic every frame.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The player can carry up to 6 items (&lt;code&gt;MAX_INVENTORY_ITEMS&lt;/code&gt;). Each slot is a pair of zero-page pointers (&lt;code&gt;invSlotLo&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;invSlotHi&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;invSlotLo6&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;invSlotHi6&lt;/code&gt;) that point directly to 8-byte sprite data in the &lt;code&gt;inventorySprites&lt;/code&gt; table.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Item IDs are computed at assembly time as offsets from the sprite table:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ID = (spriteLabel - inventorySprites) / HEIGHT_ITEM_SPRITES
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key items and their IDs include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Item&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Constant&lt;/cell&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Selection uses the left joystick. &lt;code&gt;selectedItemSlot&lt;/code&gt; tracks the cursor position (byte offset 0,2,4,6,8,10 into the slot array), and &lt;code&gt;selectedInventoryId&lt;/code&gt; holds the current item's ID. Items are added via &lt;code&gt;placeItemInInventory&lt;/code&gt; and removed via &lt;code&gt;removeItem&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Item Tracking Bitmasks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game tracks which items have been collected using two separate bitmasks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;basketItemStatus&lt;/code&gt;— Tracks spawnable items found at fixed world locations. In the Marketplace, these are the three literal baskets that contain the Key, Grenades, and Revolver. In the Treasure Room, the term "basket" is a code abstraction — it simply means the item is in its original, non-picked-up state (P0 displays the cycling item, and touching it picks it up). These items can respawn when dropped.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;pickupItemStatus&lt;/code&gt;— Tracks unique items that exist as one-of-a-kind objects in the world: Whip, Shovel, Head of Ra, Timepiece, Hourglass, Ankh, and Chai. Once collected, their world placement changes.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;itemIndexTable&lt;/code&gt; determines which bitmask applies to each item: even indices use &lt;code&gt;basketItemStatus&lt;/code&gt;, odd indices use &lt;code&gt;pickupItemStatus&lt;/code&gt;. The helper routines &lt;code&gt;showItemAsTaken&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;setItemAsNotTaken&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;isItemAlreadyTaken&lt;/code&gt; handle the bit manipulation transparently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The score (&lt;code&gt;adventurePoints&lt;/code&gt;) starts at &lt;code&gt;INIT_SCORE&lt;/code&gt; (100) and is modified in &lt;code&gt;getFinalScore&lt;/code&gt;. Lower is better — bonuses are subtracted and penalties are added.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;4&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final value determines Indy's pedestal height in the Ark Room.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implemented in &lt;code&gt;playerHitInWellOfSouls&lt;/code&gt;. All three conditions must be true:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;indyPosY &amp;gt;= $3F&lt;/code&gt;— Indy is deep enough in the Well&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;diggingState == $54&lt;/code&gt;— dirt fully cleared via shovel&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;secretArkMesaID == activeMesaID&lt;/code&gt;— correct mesa (discovered via Map Room)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When all three are met, &lt;code&gt;arkRoomStateFlag&lt;/code&gt; is set positive, triggering the endgame sequence in &lt;code&gt;arkPedestalKernel&lt;/code&gt; which shows the Ark above Indy's pedestal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calculated in &lt;code&gt;calculateMesaGrapple&lt;/code&gt; — converts the hook's pixel position to a grid ID:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;RegionY = ((HookY - 6) + ScrollOffset) / 16
RegionX = (HookX - 16) / 32
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;mapRoomHandler&lt;/code&gt;, when Indy holds the Head of Ra and the sun (driven by &lt;code&gt;timeOfDay&lt;/code&gt;) is at the correct position, a beam reveals the Ark's mesa using data from &lt;code&gt;mapRoomArkLocX&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;mapRoomArkLocY&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;timeOfDay&lt;/code&gt; increments every ~63 frames (roughly once per second), driven in the VBLANK section. It controls the timepiece display, treasure room rotation, sun position, and Head of Ra timing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Handled in &lt;code&gt;handleMesaScroll&lt;/code&gt; — the camera offset &lt;code&gt;roomObjectVar&lt;/code&gt; shifts all object positions when Indy nears screen edges, bounded by &lt;code&gt;MESA_MAP_MAX_HEIGHT&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;$50&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two channels with effect timers (&lt;code&gt;soundChan0Effect&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;soundChan1Effect&lt;/code&gt;). The Raiders March plays from &lt;code&gt;raidersMarchFreqTable&lt;/code&gt; when triggered with &lt;code&gt;RAIDERS_MARCH&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;$9C&lt;/code&gt;). The flute melody uses &lt;code&gt;snakeCharmFreqTable&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;SNAKE_CHARM_SONG&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;$84&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Triggered via &lt;code&gt;HandleEasterEgg&lt;/code&gt; — finding Yar on the Flying Saucer Mesa sets &lt;code&gt;yarFoundBonus&lt;/code&gt;. When combined with a high enough score, Howard Scott Warshaw's initials (&lt;code&gt;devInitialsGfx0&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;devInitialsGfx1&lt;/code&gt;) appear in the inventory strip at &lt;code&gt;checkShowDevInitials&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Right joystick: Movement + action button (use items/weapons)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Left joystick: Inventory selection + drop button&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Input is read from &lt;code&gt;SWCHA&lt;/code&gt;(&lt;code&gt;$0280&lt;/code&gt;) and&lt;code&gt;INPT5&lt;/code&gt;(fire buttons)&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;analysis&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;In the Australian outback, we're listening for nuclear tests. What we hear matters more than ever&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tyres stick to hot asphalt as I drive the Stuart Highway from Alice Springs northward, leaving the MacDonnell Ranges behind. My destination is the Warramunga facility, about 500 kilometres north — a remote monitoring station I've directed for the Australian National University for nearly 19 years, and one of the most sensitive nuclear detection facilities on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I started exploring Earth's inner core in 1997, I had no idea my calling would lead me here, or that I'd spend years driving this highway through the red expanse of the Australian outback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And today, as the New START treaty curbing the US and Russian nuclear weapons programs expires, the work we do in the red centre has become more important than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A giant telescope pointed at Earth's centre&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Located 37km southeast of Tennant Creek — or Jurnkkurakurr, as it's known in the local Warumungu language — Warramunga consists of what might generously be called a demountable building, surrounded by sensors lined up across 20km of savannah, covered by red soil and long, white spinifex grass.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The facility operates two sophisticated arrays. One consists of 24 seismometers detecting vibrations through Earth, the other eight infrasound sensors picking up ultra-low-frequency sound waves inaudible to human ears.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When North Korea detonated its largest nuclear device in September 2017 — about 7,000km away — our instruments captured it clearly. Warramunga detected all six of North Korea's declared nuclear tests, and our data was among the first to reach the International Data Centre in Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The geological stability and remoteness mean we detect events that might be masked elsewhere. When a wild brumby gallops past our sensors, we pick it up. When a nuclear bomb is tested on the other side of the world, we definitely know about it. We can distinguish it from an earthquake because of the different kinds of vibrations it produces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Warramunga detects more seismic events than any other station in the global network. With multiple instruments in a carefully designed configuration, far from the coast and human activity, you have something like a giant telescope pointed at the centre of Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;An unusual partnership&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Warramunga's story began in 1965 when Australia and the United Kingdom jointly established it for nuclear test detection during the Cold War. In 1999, it was upgraded and later certified as a primary station in the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization's International Monitoring System.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CTBTO, headquartered in Vienna, operates a global network of more than 300 facilities designed to detect any nuclear explosion anywhere on Earth. Australia hosts 21 of these facilities — the third-largest number globally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Warramunga is unique. It's operated by a university on behalf of both the CTBTO and the Australian government, located on Warumungu Country. The location of sensors was determined in consultation with Traditional Owners to ensure the instruments would not interfere with sacred sites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Research School of Earth Sciences at the Australian National University in Canberra has managed Warramunga for more than 50 years, and we still do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Life at the station&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The station requires constant attention. Two dedicated technicians drive from Tennant Creek to the array each morning. By the time they arrive, the sun is already high above the red land across which the array's elements and termite mounds are spread.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They keep a careful watch on the world's earthquakes and explosions, enduring extreme heat, dust, flies, fires, floods, thunderstorms and the occasional visit from wildlife. They ensure data flows continuously via satellite to Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After one infrastructure reconstruction, we found two large goannas wrapped around a seismometer, having decided to spend their nights in the firm embrace of our equipment. You don't learn about this kind of challenge in Vienna's United Nations offices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From Canberra, I coordinate between the on-site team, the Australian government, and our partners at the CTBTO. At least once a year, I make the drive up the Stuart Highway to Warramunga, checking equipment and discussing challenges with the technicians.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also meet regularly with colleagues at the United Nations in Vienna. Managing this facility means bridging two worlds: the practical realities of maintaining sensitive equipment in a harsh environment and the international diplomacy of nuclear verification.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why it matters now&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more than 30 years, the world has observed a de facto moratorium on nuclear explosive testing. The last US test was in 1992. Russia's was in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This norm has been crucial in limiting nuclear weapons development. Verification systems such as Warramunga make this possible, because would-be violators know any significant nuclear explosion will be detected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this system faces its greatest challenge in decades. In October 2025, President Donald Trump announced the United States would begin testing nuclear weapons "on an equal basis" with Russia and China.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Days later, President Vladimir Putin directed Russian officials to prepare for possible nuclear tests. If this moratorium collapses, it opens the door to a new era of nuclear arms racing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is when verification becomes most crucial. The CTBTO's network doesn't just detect violations — its existence deters them. If the world knows a country has carried out a nuclear test and tried (but failed) to hide it, the testing country will face political consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A hidden contribution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Warramunga's data also helps researchers understand earthquakes, study Earth's deep interior, such as the solid inner core, and track phenomena from meteorite impacts to Morning Glory clouds — extraordinary atmospheric waves travelling 1,400km from Cape York, first scientifically documented with Warramunga's infrasonic array in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What strikes me after nearly two decades is how this unique partnership represents a remarkable example of academic institutions contributing directly to global security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Few people realise that a university research school operates one of the world's most crucial nuclear verification facilities. It's an arrangement that brings together fundamental scientific research with practical obligations under international treaties — a model for how researchers can engage with pressing global challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As nuclear rhetoric intensifies globally, the quiet technical work in the Australian outback gains new significance. Nuclear test monitoring is essential to deter would-be nuclear nations — and that's a mission worth maintaining, even from the remote red centre of Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;What if this is as good as software is ever going to be? What if AI stops getting better and what if people stop caring?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine if this is as good as AI gets. If this is where it stops, you'd still have models that can almost code a web browser, almost code a compiler—and can even present a pretty cool demo if allowed to take a few shortcuts. You'd still get models that can kinda-sorta simulate worlds and write kinda-sorta engaging stories. You'd still get self-driving cars that almost work, except when they don't. You get AI that can make you like 90% of a thing!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;90% is a lot. Will you care about the last 10%?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm terrified that you won't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm terrified of the good enough to ship—and I'm terrified of nobody else caring. I'm less afraid of AI agents writing apps that they will never experience than I am of the AI herders who won't care enough to actually learn what they ship. And I sure as hell am afraid of the people who will experience the slop and will be fine with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a woodworking enthusiast I am slowly making my peace with standing in the middle of an IKEA. But at the rate things are going in this dropshipping hell, IKEA would be the dream. Software temufication stings much more than software commoditization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think Claude and friends can help with crafting good software and with learning new technologies and programming languages—though I sure as hell move slower when I stop to learn and understand than the guy playing Dwarf Fortress with 17 agents. But at the same time AI models seem to constantly nudge towards that same median Next-React-Tailwind, good enough app. These things just don't handle going off the beaten path well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mind you, it's not like slop is anything new. A lot of human decisions had to happen before your backside ended up in an extremely uncomfortable chair, your search results got polluted by poorly-written SEO-optimized articles, and your brain had to deal with a ticket booking website with a user interface so poorly designed that it made you cry. So it's a people problem. Incentives just don't seem to align to make good software. Move fast and break things, etc, etc. You'll make a little artisan app, and if it's any good, Google will come along with a free clone, kill you, then kill its clone—and the world will be left with net zero new good software. And now, with AI agents, it gets even worse as agent herders can do the same thing much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developers aside, there's also the users. AI models can't be imaginative, and the developers can't afford to, but surely with AI tools, the gap between users and developers will be bridged, ChatGPT will become the new HyperCard and people will turn their ideas into reality with just a few sentences? There's so many people out there who are coding without knowing it, from Carol in Accounting making insane Excel spreadsheets to all the kids on TikTok automating their phones with Apple Shortcuts and hacking up cool Notion notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what if those people are an aberration? What if this state of tech learned helplessness cannot be fixed? What if people really do just want a glorified little TV in their pocket? What if most people truly just don't care about tech problems, about privacy, about Liquid Glass, about Microsoft's upsells, about constantly dealing with apps and features which just don't work? What if there will be nobody left to carry the torch? What if the future of computing belongs not to artisan developers or Carol from Accounting, but to whoever can churn out the most software out the fastest? What if good enough really is good enough for most people?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm terrified that our craft will die, and nobody will even care to mourn it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;From: "Cherry, Hei Yui WONG" &amp;lt;cherry.heiyui@keio.jp&amp;gt; Date: Sun, 8 Feb 2026 11:06:40 +0900 Subject: Sad news: Dave Farber has passed away&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We are heartbroken to report that our colleague -- our mentor, friend, and conscience -- David J. Farber passed away suddenly at his home in Roppongi, Tokyo. He left us on Saturday, Feb. 7, 2026, at the too-young age of 91.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To his son Manny, he was simply ???Dad???, his bedrock whom he will miss immeasurably. They spoke almost daily by video throughout his time in Japan, and shared special times on numerous visits. He is survived by son Manny Farber and daughter-in-law Mei Xu, daughter-in-law Carol Hagan and grandsons Nate Farber and Sam Farber. He was preceded in death by his wife Gloria (G.G.) and son Joe Farber.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Dave???s career began with his education at Stevens Institute of Technology, which he loved deeply and served as a Trustee. He joined the legendary Bell Labs during its heyday, and worked at the Rand Corporation. Along the way, among countless other activities, he served as Chief Technologist of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission; became a proficient (instrument-rated) pilot; and was an active board member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital civil-liberties organization.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;His professional accomplishments and impact are almost endless, but often captured by one moniker: ???grandfather of the Internet,??? acknowledging the foundational contributions made by his many students at the University of California, Irvine; the University of Delaware; the University of Pennsylvania; and Carnegie Mellon University&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In 2018, at the age of 83, Dave moved to Japan to become Distinguished Professor at Keio University and Co-Director of the Keio Cyber Civilization Research Center (CCRC). He loved teaching, and taught his final class on January 22, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At CCRC, one of his most enjoyable activities was co-hosting the IP-Asia online gathering, which has met every Monday for more than five years and has addressed many aspects of the impact of technology on civilization. Dave thrived in Japan in every way.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We, the IP-Asia community, will gather for an online remembrance of Dave at the usual time and place, 2100 JST on Monday, February 9, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It???s impossible to summarize a life and career as rich and long as Dave???s in our few words here. And each of us, even those who knew him for decades, represent just one facet of his life. But because we are here at its end, we have the sad duty of sharing this news. Further information and a more formal obituary are forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;With condolences to Manny and the rest of the family,&lt;/p&gt;
