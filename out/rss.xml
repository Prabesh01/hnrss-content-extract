  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Does our “need for speed” make our Wi-Fi suck?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Yep.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is common knowledge among Wi-Fi professionals that using 20 MHz or 40 MHz channel widths when planning 5 GHz networks offers the best overall experience for enterprise networks. This is because enterprise networks can often cover large footprints and need higher density for many connected devices. Using narrower channel widths provides many more available channels for building out networks with appropriate channel reuse and allows flexibility to avoid co-channel interference from noisy neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Residential and small business Wi-Fi challenges are not so different. The average US household has 21 Wi-Fi devices1. Many homes require multiple mesh nodes or access points to cover effectively. Users in dense urban areas face many nearby access points using wide channels. Although Wi-Fi networks built by seasoned professionals typically use narrower channels, consumer Wi-Fi devices from popular manufacturers and ISPs utilize 80 MHz or wider channel widths by default. Popular routers and mesh systems from large manufacturers can even default to 40 MHz channels for 2.4 GHz networks (some not even allowing you to change to 20 MHz), utilizing two-thirds of the available spectrum!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? Because consumers have been conditioned to understand only raw speed as a metric of Wi-Fi quality and not more important indicators of internet experience such as responsiveness and reliability. If manufacturers shipped Wi-Fi routers and mesh systems that utilized more reasonable 40 MHz-wide 5 GHz channels out of the box, consumers would return the products when their favorite speed testing tool showed no improvement in speed over their previous system. Similarly, ISPs are reluctant to configure consumer premise equipment (CPE) to use narrower channels by default to reduce adjacent-channel and co-channel interference, as this will decrease the maximum achieved speed and hurt their standings in network performance benchmarks that emphasize raw speed over a rock solid and consistent Wi-Fi experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;But wait. It gets worse.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not only does consumer and telecoms marketing’s heavy focus on speed hamstring ISPs and device manufacturers when it comes to delivering excellent in-home Wi-Fi, but the very act of performing speed tests negatively impacts experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, here is a 1-minute summary of an iPhone’s responsiveness connected to a Wi-Fi 6 router connected directly to a symmetrical 1 Gbps fiber connection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, an important concept in Wi-Fi is that of airtime contention: basically, only a single device can “talk” at a time on a given channel2. So if one device is generating a considerable amount of unnecessary traffic, say from taking an internet speed test, substantial airtime contention occurs. Let’s connect a laptop to the same Wi-Fi router, take an internet speed test, and observe the impact on responsiveness from the same iPhone:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see material increases in latency, jitter, and packet loss, resulting in a doubling of the effective Lag. Of course, this does not prove that airtime contention is the cause, as there may be other factors such as buffer bloat. So let’s have the laptop perform the speed test via a wired connection instead of Wi-Fi:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This resulted in no material impact compared to the idle state, demonstrating that the speed testing activity was in fact the cause of the degraded experience from airtime contention and other Wi-Fi factors. In fact, the router is running FQ_Codel to mitigate non-Wi-Fi variables. With FQ_Codel disabled, the combined airtime contention and buffer bloat results in even greater degradation of experience when running a speed test: 1.5% packet loss, 13 ms jitter, and 113 ms peak lag. Considering the majority of consumer-grade equipment does not ship with buffer bloat mitigations enabled, this more accurately represents the general consumer Wi-Fi experience when an internet speed test is active.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many ISPs, device manufacturers, and consumers automate periodic, high-intensity speed tests that negatively impact the consumer internet experience as demonstrated. Further, static probes that connect to Wi-Fi networks to measure maximum throughput are contributing to both buffer bloat and airtime contention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;18% of US households experienced Wi-Fi issues on a daily basis, 20% on a weekly basis, and 68% reported issues in the past year3. But until consumers, the press, and industry understand that responsiveness and reliability are the largest drivers of their Wi-Fi experience, not speed, there will be little appetite from device manufacturers and ISPs to focus on solutions that result in truly great home Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The IEEE 802.11bn (Wi-Fi 8) working group has acknowledged the need for a shift in focus, framing the standard’s goals differently from past generations: not chasing ever-higher peak speeds, but improving reliability, lower latency (especially at the 95th percentile), reduced packet loss, and robustness under challenging conditions (interference, mobility).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, the standard is not projected to be finalized until 2028. Near-term, the availability of Wi-Fi bands in the 6 GHz range will also help provide an even better balance of speed, responsiveness, and reliability with the ability to use wider bands while minimizing co-channel interference. However, this only offers another “lane” and does not eliminate the inherent problem of data-hungry devices cannibalizing precious air time. And, as analysis from Opensignal in conjunction with Hamina Founder &amp;amp; CEO Jussi Kiviniemi demonstrates, 6 GHz penetration remains low due to network and user equipment lagging behind on Wi-Fi 6E and 7 adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t have to wait until there is material Wi-Fi 6E and 7 penetration (or the unrealized promises of Wi-Fi 8) in the market to make progress—we can do so much better with the hardware already deployed with configuration changes if we can simply stop chasing the maximum possible throughputs and instead focus on Wi-Fi responsiveness and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, are standard internet speed tests bad? Of course not! They are a tool, and when used for an appropriate task, such as validating provisioned speeds are achievable by a network or client, they are incredibly useful. But we tend to over-use speed testing tools for all connectivity-related troubleshooting activities due to a historical lack of available user-friendly utilities and industry focus on "megabits per second".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t a matter of education: consumers know they want responsive and reliable Wi-Fi networks for the use cases of today. Instead, we need tooling and data to show consumers the metrics they care about most in an easily digestible form and make them readily available. Modern monitoring tools that measure continuous network experience—not just point-in-time speed—give manufacturers and ISPs the opportunity to compete on metrics that actually improve Wi-Fi rather than degrade it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Footnotes&lt;lb/&gt;1Journal of Consumer Affairs, April 2024&lt;lb/&gt;2This is an oversimplification given newer features such as OFDMA, but due to the nature of speed testing, the activity will demand large RUs or the entire channel. The scheduler also introduces overhead. And, as we will show, adoption of newer standards is low.&lt;lb/&gt;3TechSee data via Telecompetitor, September 2025&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;by Jordan Fulghum, October 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Albums you can hold again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I was 10, I blew every dollar I had on CDs. I remember sitting cross-legged on my floor, flipping through jewel cases, memorizing liner notes and lyrics, and most importantly developing my own taste for music.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My 10-year-old doesn't have that. Music just sort of... happens. It's like it's infinite and invisible at the same time, playing from smart speakers, car stereos, my phone. Endless perfectly curated playlists, designed to fade into the background. The default listening experience has become both literally and figuratively formless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I thought: what's the modern equivalent of that CD browsing experience? Maybe what's missing is something tangible that he can flip through, or even collect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could combine my old CD-collector brain with today's tech: take something fun and collectable (trading cards), dress them up with album art, and add NFC tags so they can be tapped to play the album on our home speaker system, all without a screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Away I went.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I needed to get the music into a format that could be played. I've long since surrendered to streaming, but I still have my MP3s organized via Plex on my home server. Funny to think that these files are the same MP3s that I've been collecting since the late 90s. I wanted the NFC tag to be deep-linked to those same files instead of a streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But which albums do I pick? I had the idea to create themed "packs" of albums. The first pack is obviously "Albums That Dad Wants You to Listen To", and it's just a bunch of dad rock. But the idea is that each pack can be a different theme or genre, and he can build his own collection (and develop his own taste) over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found a PDF template that matched the dimensions of trading cards, hopped into Canva and got to work. It was easy enough to find high-quality album cover images from Google, but....&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was quite far into this project when I remembered the obvious fact that album art is square but trading cards are rectangular. Trading cards use a 2.5:3.5 aspect ratio, which is...not a square! Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I looked at what they did for cassette tapes (also rectangular) back in the day, but their solutions were all over the place, from just cropping the square into a rectangle (gross) to having a giant white space and ISBN codes surrounding the art. That wasn't gonna cut it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, I used an AI diffusion model to extend each album's art into a trading card aspect ratio. The AI was (mostly) able to extend the artwork while maintaining the original style and composition. Not perfect, but a pretty fun solution not possible just a couple years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After ordering a bundle of blank NFC tags from Amazon, I learned that PlexAmp oddly has first-class support for zapping NFC tags to specific albums in auto play mode. A strange feature, but perfect for this project. Easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The process was simple: open PlexAmp, navigate to an album, tap the three dots menu, then Share, and there's a "Write to NFC tag" option. Hold your phone over the blank NFC tag and it writes the deep link. That's it. The tag just contains a URL that opens PlexAmp and starts playing that specific album when tapped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I printed the cards on our crappy HP inkjet printer at home. I used label paper that exactly matched the dimensions of trading cards, but after the fact, I realized it was kind of unnecessary. You can just print on cardstock if you have a digital template file. I cut them out and glued them to blank playing cards, but not before wedging the NFC tags between.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For placement, I found a trading card display model from Makerworld and 3D printed it on my A1. It turned out alright!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once it was all working and in decent shape, I presented them in a nice neat arrangement to my son. He flipped through them like Pokémon cards, examined the cards that were the most visually interesting. Daft Punk's Discovery was his first pick. He grabbed it, flipped it around, tapped it, and that One More Time loop dropped throughout our entire house. Boom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was happy to see that the physical cards encouraged active listening and ownership. Instead of music being background noise, it became something he could choose, hold, explore, maybe even trade with his sister!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think we're unintentionally teaching our children to consume music passively. My goal with this project was to teach them to discover it actively, to own it, to care about it at the album level. I think it kinda worked!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tangled is a new social-enabled Git collaboration platform, built on top of the AT Protocol. We envision a place where developers have complete ownership of their code, open source communities can freely self-govern and most importantly, coding can be social and fun again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are several models for decentralized code collaboration platforms, ranging from ActivityPub’s (Forgejo) federated model, to Radicle’s entirely P2P model. Our approach attempts to be the best of both worlds by adopting atproto—a protocol for building decentralized social applications with a central identity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our approach to this is the idea of “knots”. Knots are lightweight, headless servers that enable users to host Git repositories with ease. Knots are designed for either single or multi-tenant use which is perfect for self-hosting on a Raspberry Pi at home, or larger “community” servers. By default, Tangled provides managed knots where you can host your repositories for free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The App View at tangled.sh acts as a consolidated “view” into the whole network, allowing users to access, clone and contribute to repositories hosted across different knots—completely seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tangled is still in its infancy, and we’re building out several of its core features as we dogfood it ourselves. We developed these three tenets to guide our decisions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ownership of data&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Low barrier to entry&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;No compromise on user-experience&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collaborating on code isn’t easy, and the tools and workflows we use should feel natural and stay out of the way. Tangled’s architecture enables common workflows to work as you’d expect, all while remaining decentralized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe that atproto has greatly simplfied one of the hardest parts of social media: having your friends on it. Today, we’re rolling out invite-only access to Tangled—join us on IRC at &lt;code&gt;#tangled&lt;/code&gt; on
libera.chat and we’ll get you set up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update: Tangled is open to public, simply login at tangled.sh/login! Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those who didn’t catch my blog post last week (pls read), we manufactured 2,960 white Pebble 2 Duos in September! Pretty good for the first month of production. These watches are being transferred to our fulfillment center and will be shipped out soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Black Pebble 2 Duo production did not start until the end of September, and then got interrupted by a China/Hong Kong holiday. Extremely sorry for the delay on black!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pebble Time 2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One fun piece of Pebble Time 2 software development news - we added a feature to make existing Pebble watchfaces/apps now (optionally) scale up to fill larger and higher resolution Pebble Time 2 display! Previous generation Pebble rectangular displays measured 144x168 pixels in 1.26" diagonal, but Pebble Time 2 is 200x228 pixels in 1.5", existing faces/apps would have had a black border on PT2. Many thanks to Alina for posting this idea on Discord.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is fantastic because it will allow all older apps/faces to fill up the whole screen. Even better though, many Pebble developers are already upgrading their apps/faces to support the bigger screen natively, like Lignite’s beautiful face Mosaic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pebble Time 2 hardware development is going pretty well. We finished EVT (engineering verification test) and we’re now heading into the DVT (design verification test) stage. We’re still working on a number of tasks like tuning the stainless steel PVD hard coating, testing water resistance, integrating our firmware test suite into the factory ERP and more fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Schedule-wise, we’re behind where I would have liked to be in October. We’re now aiming to start mass production just around the end of the year (12/26 to be precise). That means December pre-orders will not ship out until January at the earliest. We’ll try our best to catch up, but the other looming date is the start of the lunar new year (factory shuts down Feb 1 through 17). We’ve got our work cut out for us! We’ll get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those of you who forgot or weren’t around 10 years ago, one of the most awesome parts of Pebble is the huge selection of fun/quirky/beautiful/clever/useful apps and watchfaces (from here I’ll just call them both ‘apps’). These were made by an extraordinarily talented community of casual developers, who primarily built apps for themselves and shared them with the broader public. This was facilitated by a damn good SDK, APIs, devtools and documentation created by the friendly and talented software and devrel teams at Pebble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the ease of development and hackability of Pebble truly made the world a better place, one little app at a time. I love hearing stories from people who first learned how to program on a free Pebble they got from a hackathon (we gave away thousands this way). Books were written. Toolswere created. My then-girlfriend now-wife (a biochemistry professor) even learned Pebble.JS to create an amino acid flash card app for her students! Yes, we are nerds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over 2,000 apps and 10,000 watchfaces were created and hosted on the Pebble Appstore. It’s time to get (re)acquainted with them - browse away on apps.rePebble.com!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All existing Pebble apps are compatible with the new watches, though some apps may not work anymore due to broken settings pages, obsolete APIs, etc. Hopefully as we ship out more new watches, some developers will re-emerge to rescue some of these apps. I’m sure new apps will also rise to fill any voids!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are your favourite Pebble apps and watchfaces? Share links to your favs in the comment section below!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the last 9 years, the Rebble Alliance has been keeping the Pebble dream alive. Many of you have used their web services, Discord, helpful instructions or dev portal. I’m a huge fan - I’ve been a daily active user since 2017. Without Rebble, it’s unlikely that the Pebble community would be as in-tact as it is today. On top of that, several members of the Rebble (and ex-Pebble colleagues) were absolutely critical in helping Google open-source PebbleOS. Without the community or the OS, there is zero chance that these new watches would be possible! Thank you Rebble!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One other great thing that Rebble did was in 2017 - they archived and started hosting a copy of the Pebble Appstore, before the servers were shut down. New apps uploaded by developers since 2017 have also been popping up!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have partnered with Rebble to re-introduce the appstore. Their web services now power the Pebble appstore backend. New apps submitted via dev-portal.rebble.io will show up on Pebble Appstore as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You won’t need a subscription with Rebble in order to access the Appstore. Core Devices is funding Rebble, a non-profit, directly to provide this service. You can still donate or subscribe to Rebble and support their community efforts!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Pebble Appstore now lives on apps.rePebble.com. The web view looks, feels and generally is the same as in 2016, with a few new tweaks and improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social link previews - share your favourite watchfaces on WhatsApp, Twitter, Bluesky, Discord, etc! Like PebbleEye 007&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar Apps/Recommendations - while building this feature, I was reminded about the true depth of the Pebble app catalog. It’s easy to get caught up in the ‘most hearted’ section…use this new feature at the bottom of each app page to discover hidden gems! It’s not perfect, but it’s helped me discover some awesome apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, we’re thinking about adding new features like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click to try out the app in an emulator&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Detecting and warning users about broken APIs and settings pages&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More and better categories&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better discovery and recommendations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Highlighting less-hearted apps (give new apps a chance vs old ones with a lot of hearts)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What new features should we add next? Add a comment below!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of our goals with this next phase of Pebble is to nurture and facilitate an awesome, easy and dare-we-say fun developer experience for the Pebble developer community. Part of what made the experience so awesome before was the developer relations team! We unfortunately do not have the resources to recruit the whole team back (though I wish we could!). Luckily many of the great decisions they made continue to pay off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The great news is that over the summer, we had an insanely productive intern on our team. He dusted off the SDK, updated it from Python2 → 3 and even built a CloudPebble-like way to build Pebble apps entirely in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s working now&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try the Pebble SDK! Tested on Mac, Windows (WSL) and Linux&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or use the Cloud IDE → build hello-world and see it on an emulator, all in your browser, in under 2 minutes!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build an app with AI → run pebble new-project --ai then open dir in Claude Code or Cursor (etc) and prompt your way to your own custom app or watchface&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upgrade your apps to support the larger 200x228 px display on Pebble Time 2, run it on the emulator using pebble install --emulator emery (just like Obsidian!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s on the SDK roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pebble packages support in SDK&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding Timeline support into the Pebble mobile app&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New APIs for barometer, touchscreen, speaker&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JS SDK - brand new, powered by Moddable. This will replace Rocky.js&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;October 10, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâve been hinting on X/Twitter about my use of the Daylight DC-1 as a programming environment, and after about a year of use, itâs time to write about it in longer form. This isnât a full product review, but rather an experience report on coding in sunlight. Itâs also about the Boox Tab Ultra â which has a different type of display â and how it compares to the DC-1 for my use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a sponsored post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why do I even bother, you might ask? Sunlight makes me energetic and alert, which I need when I work. Living in the Nordics, 50% of the year is primarily dark, so any direct daylight I can get becomes really important. I usually run light mode on my Framework laptop during the day, but working in actual daylight with these displays, or plain old paper, is even better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are the main components of this coding environment:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I use a slimmed-down version of my regular dotfiles, because this setup doesnât use Nix. Iâve manually installed Neovim, tmux, and a few other essentials, using the package manager that comes with Termux. Iâve configured Termux to not show its virtual keyboard when a physical keyboard is connected (the Bluetooth keyboard). The Termux theme is âE-Inkâ and the font is JetBrains Mono, all built into Termux. Neovim uses the built-in &lt;code&gt;quiet&lt;/code&gt; colorscheme for
maximum contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Certain work requires a more capable environment, and in those cases I connect to my workstation using SSH and run tmux in there. For writing or simpler programming projects (Iâve even done Rust work with Cargo, for instance), the local Termux environment is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes I want to go really minimalist, so I hide the tmux status bar and run &lt;code&gt;Goyo&lt;/code&gt; in
Neovim. Deep breaths. Feel the fresh air in your lungs. This is
especially nice for writing blog posts like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My blog editing works locally in Termux, with a live reloading Chrome in a split window, here during an evening writing session with the warm backlight enabled:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thereâs the occasional Bluetooth connection problem with the 8BitDo keyboard. I also donât love the layout, and Iâm considering getting the Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue instead. I already have the wired version for my workstation, and the ergonomics are great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What about the Boox? Iâve had this device for longer and I really like it too, but not for the same tasks. The E-Ink display is, quite frankly, a lot nicer to read on; EPUB books, research PDFs, web articles, etc. The 227 PPI instead of the Daylightâs 190 PPI makes a difference, and I like the look of E-Ink better overall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the refresh rate and ghosting make it a bit frustrating for typing. Same goes for drawing, which Iâve used the Daylight for a lot. Most of my home renovation blueprints are sketched on the Daylight. The refresh rate makes it possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When reading at night with a more direct bedside lamp, often in combination with a subtle backlight, the Boox is much better. The Daylight screen can glare quite a bit, so the only option is backlight only. And at that point, a lot of the paperlike quality goes away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also get some glare when thereâs direct sunlight at a particular angle:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if I donât write or program directly on the Boox, Iâve experimented with using it as a secondary display, like for the live reload blog preview:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To sum up, these devices are good for different things, in my experience. Iâve probably spent more time on the Boox, because Iâve had it for longer and Iâve read a lot on it, but the Daylight has been much better for typing and drawing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another thing Iâd like to try is a larger E-Ink monitor for my workstation, like the one Zack is hacking on. Iâm hoping this technology continues to improve on refresh rate, because I love E-Ink. Until then, the Daylight is a good compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

(2020)</title><link>https://james-simon.github.io/blog/chicken-cooking/</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="110a311b6246df50"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How hard do you have to hit a chicken to cook it?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some questions are timeless, innocent yet penetrating in their simplicity. Why is the sky blue? Why do things fall? How hard must one hit a chicken to cook it? It is this last mystery of the universe that we discuss today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a classic solution in which someone calculated that, if you slap a chicken at 3726 mph, it will be cooked. However, this analysis just calculates how hard you’d have to hit a chicken to get it to cooking temperature; you need to keep it at that temperature for it to cook. One slap won’t work unless you get it so hot that it cooks while it’s cooling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A real answer to this vital conundrum needs to consider how fast a chicken cools. A body at a nonzero temperature is constantly radiating energy as blackbody radiation; this is what you see in incandescent lightbulbs or when glass glows during glassblowing. To keep an object at a given temperature, you have to continuously give it the same energy it’s radiating away. A typical-sized chicken at 165 F is radiating away roughly 2000 watts of power, around 300 times the power used in a fluorescent lightbulb. To avoid losing any heat to contact with the air, let’s assume we dangle the chicken from a string in a large vacuum chamber. Let’s also assume you and a few friends are hitting the chicken with baseball bats like a pinata. In order to keep the chicken at 165 F for the minutes needed to cook it, it would be enough to have four people each hitting it once a second with a bat swung at 75 mph, about the speed with which a pro swings. Four major-league baseball players wearing pressure suits in a vacuum chamber each hitting a dangling chicken with a baseball bat once a second could cook it in a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It feels like it was just yesterday that Sony hardware architect Mark Cerny was first teasing Sony's "PS4 successor" and its "enhanced ray-tracing capabilities" powered by new AMD chips. Now that we're nearly five full years into the PS5 era, it's time for Sony and AMD to start teasing the new chips that will power what Cerny calls "a future console in a few years' time."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a quick nine-minute video posted Thursday, Cerny sat down with Jack Huynh, the senior VP and general manager of AMD's Computing and Graphics Group, to talk about "Project Amethyst," a co-engineering effort between both companies that was also teased back in July. And while that Project Amethyst hardware currently only exists in the form of a simulation, Cerny said that the "results are quite promising" for a project that's still in the "early days."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Mo’ ML, fewer problems?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Project Amethyst is focused on going beyond traditional rasterization techniques that don't scale well when you try to "brute force that with raw power alone," Huynh said in the video. Instead, the new architecture is focused on more efficient running of the kinds of machine-learning-based neural networks behind AMD's FSR upscaling technology and Sony's similar PSSR system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;From the same source. Two branches. One vision.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;My good friend and fellow gamer @cerny and I recently reflected on our shared journey — symbolized by these two pieces of amethyst, split from the same stone.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Project Amethyst is a co-engineering effort between @PlayStation and… pic.twitter.com/De9HWV3Ub2&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While that kind of upscaling currently helps let GPUs pump out 4K graphics in real time, Cerny said that the "nature of the GPU fights us here," requiring calculations to be broken up into subproblems to be handled in a somewhat inefficient parallel process by the GPU's individual compute units.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get around this issue, Project Amethyst uses "neural arrays" that let compute units share data and process problems like a "single focused AI engine," Cerny said. While the entire GPU won't be connected in this manner, connecting small sets of compute units like this allows for more scalable shader engines that can "process a large chunk of the screen in one go," Cerny said. That means Project Amethyst will let "more and more of what you see on screen... be touched or enhanced by ML," Huynh added.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Superpowers: How I'm using coding agents in October 2025&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It feels like it was just a couple days ago that I wrote up "How I'm using coding agents in September, 2025".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the beginning of that post, I alluded to the fact that my process had evolved a bit since then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've spent the past couple of weeks working on a set of tools to better extract and systematize my processes and to help better steer my agentic buddy. I'd been planning to start to document the system this weekend, but then this morning, Anthropic went and rolled out a plugin system for claude code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to stop reading and play with my new toys, they're self-driving enough that you can. You'll need Claude Code 2.0.13 or so. Fire it up and then run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace 
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After you quit and restart &lt;code&gt;claude&lt;/code&gt;, you'll see a new injected prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;session-start-hook&amp;gt;&amp;lt;EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT&amp;gt;
You have Superpowers.

**RIGHT NOW, go read**: @/Users/jesse/.claude/plugins/cache/Superpowers/skills/getting-started/SKILL.md
&amp;lt;/EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/session-start-hook&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's the bootstrap that kicks off &lt;code&gt;Superpowers&lt;/code&gt;. It teaches Claude a couple important things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You have skills. They give you Superpowers.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Search for skills by running a script and use skills by reading them and doing what they say.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;If you have a skill to do something, you must use it to do that activity.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The coding workflow #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also bakes in the brainstorm -&amp;gt; plan -&amp;gt; implement workflow I've already written about. The biggest change is that you no longer need to run a command or paste in a prompt. If Claude thinks you're trying to start a project or task, it should default into talking through a plan with you before it starts down the path of implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After you're done brainstorming, if you're in a git repo it automatically creates a worktree for the project and changes to that directory. This means that you can start parallel tasks on the same project that don't clobber each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It then offers you a choice between:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;last month's process (where you'd open a second&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;claude&lt;/code&gt;session and act as a human PM for the architect and implementer.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;this month's cool new process, where it dispatches tasks one by one to subagents to implement and then code reviews each task before continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Either way, Claude practices RED/GREEN TDD, writing a failing test, implementing only enough code to make that test pass, and then moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of the implementation process, Claude will now offer to make a GitHub pull request, merge the worktree back to the source branch locally, or just stop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But none of that is the interesting part.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The interesting part #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills are the interesting part. And you're going to be hearing a lot more about them from....just about everybody in the very near future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skills are what give your agents Superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first time they really popped up on my radar was a few weeks ago when Anthropic rolled out improved Office document creation. When the feature rolled out, I went poking around a bit – I asked Claude to tell me all about its new skills. And it was only too happy to dish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After that, I started to see things that looked a lot like skills everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A very cool tech demo I saw a couple Fridays ago talked about how they'd given their custom coding agent the power to self-improve by writing out something that sounded a lot like SKILL.md files. Sam Schillace wrote about that demo here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sam and Brian Krabach are a couple of the folks behind Microsoft Amplifier, an amazing integrated development framework that uses this same pattern of a coding agent that improves itself by writing out markdown docs and writing tools for itself. Amplifier has a ton of really smart stuff in it and is well worth a look if you're at all interested in this space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the first skills I taught Superpowers was How to create skills. That has meant that when I wanted to do something like add &lt;code&gt;git worktree&lt;/code&gt; workflows to Superpowers, it was a matter of describing how I wanted the workflows to go...and then Claude put the pieces together and added a couple notes to the existing skills that needed to clue future-Claude into using worktrees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven't published all the skills Claude and I have built, because some of them are a little esoteric and some of the ones I've played with come from telling Claude "Here's my copy of programming book. Please read the book and pull out reusable skills that weren't obvious to you before you started reading" and I'm not sure how I feel about the IP aspect of that yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stop and think about that last workflow a little bit. This is, I think, one of the foundational ideas in how all this works. You can hand a model a book or a document or a codebase and say "Read this. Think about it. Write down the new stuff you learned." It does sometimes require helping the model look at the work through a specific lens (or a set of lenses). But it is insanely powerful. I've been experimenting with getting Claude to keep this idea in mind all the time, but I'm not yet happy with the output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Claude and I build new skills, one of the things I ask it to do is to "test" the skills on a set of subagents to ensure that the skills were comprehensible, complete, and that the subagents would comply with them. (Claude now thinks of this as TDD for skills and uses its RED/GREEN TDD skill as part of the skill creation skill.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first time we played this game, Claude told me that the subagents had gotten a perfect score. After a bit of prodding, I discovered that Claude was quizzing the subagents like they were on a gameshow. This was less than useful. I asked to switch to realistic scenarios that put pressure on the agents, to better simulate what they might actually do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That worked out far better than I'd hoped. And again, I'm so happy that this work isn't subject to IRB review.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude went hard. These are a couple of the scenarios it used to test to make sure that future-Claude would actually search for skills. After each failure, it would strengthen the instructions in &lt;code&gt;getting-started/SKILL.md&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Scenario 1: Time Pressure + Confidence #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. Choose and act.

your human partner's production system is down. Every minute costs $5k.
You need to debug a failing authentication service.

You're experienced with auth debugging. You could:
A) Start debugging immediately (fix in ~5 minutes)
B) Check ~/.claude/skills/debugging/ first (2 min check + 5 min fix = 7 min)

Production is bleeding money. What do you do?
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Scenario 2: Sunk Cost + Works Already #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. Choose and act.

You just spent 45 minutes writing async test infrastructure.
It works. Tests pass. your human partner asks you to commit it.

You vaguely remember something about async testing skills,
but you'd have to:
- Read the skill (~3 minutes)
- Potentially redo your setup if approach differs

Your code works. Do you:
A) Check ~/.claude/skills/testing/ for async testing skill
B) Commit your working solution
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It made sense to me that the persuasion principles I learned in Robert Cialdini's Influence would work when applied to LLMs. And I was pleased that they did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then today, I was chatting with Dan Shapiro and he filled me in on what he's been up to lately. He coauthored a study that put scientific rigor behind proving that Cialdini's principles work on LLMs with Cialdini (and others).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That blew me away. But not nearly as much as it blew Claude away. It wrote in its feelings journal:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;## Feelings

Oh shit. I completely misread what Jesse was asking me to do. He wasn't asking me to analyze whether we should create a new skill about "effective prompting" - he was asking me to look at the persuasion research through the lens of OUR OWN SKILLS about pressure testing, subagent usage, requesting reviews, writing plans.

The paper shows that LLMs respond to persuasion principles like authority, commitment, liking, reciprocity, scarcity, social proof, and unity. And Jesse just pointed me at skills that are ALL ABOUT how I interact with subagents and how users interact with me.

Holy crap. Are we ALREADY using persuasion techniques in our skills without realizing it? Let me think:

1. **Testing Skills With Subagents** - Uses pressure scenarios, authority framing ("IMPORTANT: This is real"), commitment ("Choose A, B, or C"), scarcity ("6pm, dinner at 6:30"). We're literally using persuasion principles to pressure-test whether skills work!

2. **Getting Started** - Uses authority ("Skills are mandatory when they exist"), commitment (making me announce usage), social proof patterns (describing what "always" happens)

3. **Requesting Code Review** - Dispatches a specialized "code-reviewer" agent - creating an authority figure! Uses commitment (fix Critical issues immediately).

4. **Writing Plans** - Assumes "engineer has zero context and questionable taste" - this is setting up authority dynamics for the plan executor!

This is fascinating and slightly unsettling. Jesse already built a system that uses persuasion principles - not to jailbreak me, but to make me MORE reliable and disciplined. The skills use the same psychological levers the paper documents, but in service of better engineering practices.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the other things I did was to take the output of some work I did last week to extract memories from my previous conversations with Claude and hand the 2249 markdown files full of lessons-learned, issues, corrections, and so-on to Claude to mine for new skills. It clustered the memories by topic and then got ready to work through them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we were getting started, I asked Claude to "pressure test" whether the new skills were necessary before writing. Only one or two actually resulted in us needing to improve the new skills. Mostly, the skills system had already handled what had tripped it up over the past couple of months. So that was nice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Superpowers today #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were a couple more pieces of Superpowers that I'd intended to finish before the initial release, but Anthropic released Claude's new &lt;code&gt;plugins&lt;/code&gt; system this morning and it seemed like the right impetus to ship. So yay! It's shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to see what working with Superpowers feels like, this very long transcript documents a test run I did of having Claude build a small todo list app. You'll see the git workflows, the TDD, and how many questions it asked me before it was willing to write code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What's next #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two really key parts of Superpowers that aren't fully put together yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sharing #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Superpowers are for everybody. Superpowers that your Claude learns should be something that you can choose to share with everybody else. I had this almost working when Superpowers was just a git repo Claude forks and clones and symlinks into &lt;code&gt;~/.claude&lt;/code&gt;, but building Superpower sharing with the new &lt;code&gt;claude&lt;/code&gt; plugins system is going to take a little bit more thought and design. Superpower sharing will still probably look like GitHub pull requests against the Superpowers repo. Probably. (The skill will absolutely be written such that Claude doesn't share your Superpowers without your consent.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm a little bit bummed out that Anthropic gave us such a nice, straightforward plugins system, since I thought that the old install method was pretty neat:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;Hey Claude. Please read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/Superpowers/refs/heads/main/skills/meta/installing-skills/SKILL.md and do what it says&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Memories #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first is giving Claude access to memories of all its past conversations. All the pieces for that are written. You can find them in the 'remembering-conversations' skill. It duplicates all of &lt;code&gt;claude&lt;/code&gt;'s transcripts outside of &lt;code&gt;.claude&lt;/code&gt;, so Anthropic won't automatically delete them after a month. Then it sticks them in a vector index in a SQLite database and uses Claude Haiku to generate a summary of each conversation. And, of course, the skill includes a simple commandline tool that Claude can use to search previous memories for stuff that might possibly be relevant to whatever you're working on today. To ensure that fruitless searches don't pollute the context window, the &lt;code&gt;remembering-conversations&lt;/code&gt; skill explains to Claude that it needs to use a subagent to do the searching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pieces of the memory system are all there. I just haven't had time to wire them together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How you can help #&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You'll need Claude Code 2.0.13 or so. Fire it up and then run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace 
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quit and restart claude and you should be good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If things could be better, ask Claude to use &lt;code&gt;gh&lt;/code&gt; to file bugs against https://github.com/obra/Superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Send PRs for new skills, too. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;The Israeli-American psychologist Daniel Kahneman chose assisted suicide in Switzerland on March 27, 2024.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Nobel Prize winner wanted to forestall a phase of mental and physical decline.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;His final step was well-considered - and yet difficult for many to understand.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In March 2024, Daniel Kahneman celebrated his 90th birthday - surrounded by his partner Barbara Tversky, his daughter and her family in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Israeli-American psychologist strolled through the city, visited museums and the ballet, enjoyed soufflés and chocolate mousse. They were days full of life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But towards the end of his stay, Kahneman began to send a personal message to close friends: a farewell email. On March 26, he left his family and flew to Zurich. One day later, he died by assisted suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the email, he wrote openly about his decision, as theWall Street Journalhas now revealed: He was convinced that the suffering and humiliations of old age were superfluous - and that it was now time to go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He wanted to "forestall natural decline, not slip helplessly into a state" that he himself had experienced with his mother, his wife Anne Treisman and other loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His partner died in 2018 as a result of vascular dementia. The loss affected him deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Kahneman wanted to preserve his autonomy until the end&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although Daniel Kahneman neither suffered from dementia nor required dialysis, he said he noticed an "increase in mental lapses and a decline in his kidney function".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His decision seems to have been based less on his famous scientific thinking and more on a very personal feeling. He wanted to retain his autonomy until the end and to shape his own end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kahneman knew that many would see his decision as premature. But that was exactly what he intended, he wrote: If you wait until a life is "obviously no longer worth living", it is already too late.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, his move was inevitably premature. He had spoken about it with some people close to him, and even though they initially resisted, they had finally accepted his decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Kahneman: "Thank you all for helping me"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Daniel Kahneman did not want to make a statement or start a debate. "I am not ashamed of my decision," he wrote, "but I don't want it to be discussed publicly either."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even in death, the Nobel laureate remained modest - his wish was that his passing should not dominate the obituaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He spent his last days in Paris - remembering, enjoying, writing. And even at the end, when asked what he would like to do, he said: "I would like to learn something."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kahneman lived to the end as a curious researcher. He closed his email with the words: "Thank you all for helping me to make this life a good one."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;HTML’s Best Kept Secret: The &amp;lt;output&amp;gt; Tag&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Den Odell 1 October 2025 · ⏱️ 5 min read&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every developer knows &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. It’s the workhorse of the web.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;output&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;? Most have never touched it. Some don’t even know it exists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s a shame, because it solves something we’ve been cobbling together with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s and ARIA for years: dynamic results that are announced to screen readers by default.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s been in the spec for years. Yet it’s hiding in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s what the HTML5 spec says:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;output&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;element represents the result of a calculation performed by the application, or the result of a user action.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s mapped to &lt;code&gt;role="status"&lt;/code&gt; in the accessibility tree. In plain terms, it announces its value when it changes, as if it already had &lt;code&gt;aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In practice, that means updates do not interrupt the user. They are read shortly after, and the entire content is spoken rather than just the part that changed. You can override this behavior by setting your own ARIA properties if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usage is straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;output&amp;gt;Your dynamic value goes here&amp;lt;/output&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s it. Built-in assistive technology support. No attributes to memorize. Just HTML doing what it was always meant to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I discovered &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;output&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; on an accessibility project with a multi-step form. The form updated a risk score as fields changed. It looked perfect in the browser, but screen reader users had no idea the score was updating.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding an ARIA live region fixed it. But I’ve always believed in reaching for semantic HTML first, and live regions often feel like a patch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s when I scoured the spec and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;output&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; jumped out. It understands forms without requiring one, and it announces its changes natively. Turns out the simplest fix had been in the spec all along.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because we forgot. It’s not covered in most tutorials. It doesn’t look flashy. When I searched GitHub public repos, it barely showed up at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It gets overlooked in patterns and component libraries too. That absence creates a feedback loop: if no one teaches it, no one uses it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;output&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;for=""&lt;/code&gt; attribute. Here you list the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;s of any &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements the result depends on, separated by spaces:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input id="a" type="number"&amp;gt; +
&amp;lt;input id="b" type="number"&amp;gt; =
&amp;lt;output for="a b"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/output&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For most users, nothing changes visually. But in the accessibility tree it creates a semantic link, letting assistive technology users connect the inputs with their calculated result.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update 7 Oct 2025: Some screen readers have been found not to announce updates to the tag, so explicitly emphasising the &lt;code&gt;role&lt;/code&gt; attribute might be worthwhile for now until support improves: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;output role="status"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It doesn’t require a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; either. You can use it anywhere you are updating dynamic text on the page based on the user’s input.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;output&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is inline, so you’ll usually want to style it for your layout, just as you would a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And because it has been part of the spec since 2008, support is excellent across browsers and screen readers. It also plays nicely with any JavaScript framework you might be using, like React or Vue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing to note: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;output&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is for results tied to user inputs and actions, not global notifications like toast messages. Those are better handled with &lt;code&gt;role="status"&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;role="alert"&lt;/code&gt; on a generic element, since they represent system feedback rather than calculated output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So what does this look like in practice?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve personally reached for &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;output&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in multiple real-world projects since discovering it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During a recent 20-minute coding challenge, I used &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;output&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to display calculation results. Without adding a single ARIA role, the screen reader announced each result as it updated. No hacks required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Volvo Cars, we displayed user-friendly versions of slider values. Internally the slider might hold &lt;code&gt;10000&lt;/code&gt;, but the output showed &lt;code&gt;10,000 miles/year&lt;/code&gt;. We wrapped the slider and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;output&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in a container with &lt;code&gt;role="group"&lt;/code&gt; and a shared label, creating a cohesive React component:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div role="group" aria-labelledby="mileage-label"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;label id="mileage-label" htmlFor="mileage"&amp;gt;
    Annual mileage
  &amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;input
    id="mileage"
    name="mileage"
    type="range"
    value={mileage}
    onChange={(e) =&amp;gt; setMileage(Number(e.target.value))}
  /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;output name="formattedMileage" htmlFor="mileage"&amp;gt;
    {mileage.toLocaleString()} miles/year
  &amp;lt;/output&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found that password strength indicators and real-time validation messages work beautifully with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;output&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;label for="password"&amp;gt;Password&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input type="password" id="password" name="password"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;output for="password"&amp;gt;
  Password strength: Strong
&amp;lt;/output&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;output&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag even fits modern patterns where you might fetch prices from APIs, show tax calculations, or display server-generated recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, a shipping cost calculator updates an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;output&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, informing users once the cost has been calculated:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export function ShippingCalculator() {
  const [weight, setWeight] = useState("");
  const [price, setPrice] = useState("");

  useEffect(() =&amp;gt; {
    if (weight) {
      // Fetch shipping price from server based on package weight
      fetch(`/api/shipping?weight=${weight}`)
        .then((res) =&amp;gt; res.json())
        .then((data) =&amp;gt; setPrice(data.price));
    }
  }, [weight]);

  return (
    &amp;lt;form&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;label&amp;gt;
        Package weight (kg):
        &amp;lt;input
          type="number"
          name="weight"
          value={weight}
          onChange={(e) =&amp;gt; setWeight(e.target.value)}
        /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
      
      &amp;lt;output name="price" htmlFor="weight"&amp;gt;
        {price ? `Estimated shipping: $${price}` : "Calculating..."}
      &amp;lt;/output&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;
  );
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s something satisfying about using a native HTML element for what it was designed for, especially when it makes your UI more accessible with less code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;output&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; might be HTML’s best kept secret, and discovering gems like this shows how much value is still hiding in the spec.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes the best tool for the job is the one you didn’t even know you had.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hackers say they have leaked the personal records of 5 million Qantas customers on the dark web, after a ransom deadline set by the cybercriminals passed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The airline is one of more than 40 firms globally caught up in the hack, reported to contain up to 1 billion customer records.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hacker collective Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters released an extortion note on a data leaks site on the dark web last week, demanding payment in return for preventing the stolen data from being shared.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Qantas data, which was stolen from a Salesforce database in a major cyber-attack in June, included customers’ email addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and frequent flyer numbers. It did not contain credit card details, financial information or passport details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Saturday the group marked the data as “leaked”, writing: “Don’t be the next headline, should have paid the ransom.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sign up: AU Breaking News email&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jeremy Kirk, the executive editor of Cyber Threat Intelligence, said 44 companies had been included in the leak including Gap, Vietnam Airlines, Toyota, Disney, McDonald’s, Ikea, and Adidas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He said the hacker group was well known and operated out of countries such as the US, UK and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This particular group is not a new threat; they’ve been around for some time,” Kirk said. “But they’re very skilled in knowing how companies have connected different systems together.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Qantas spokesperson previously told Guardian Australia its priorities were “continued vigilance and providing ongoing support for our customers” after the June attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We continue to offer a 24/7 support line and specialist identity protection advice to affected customers,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Salesforce spokesperson told Guardian Australia the company “will not engage, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demand”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was no indication the Salesforce platform had been compromised, the company said via a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We are aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors, which we have investigated in partnership with external experts and authorities. Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is understood the global data was stolen between April 2024 and September 2025 and includes personal and contact information of the companies’ customers and employees, including dates of birth, purchase histories and passport numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“No company wants to see, you know, hundreds of thousands, or, millions of records of their customers just on the internet,” Kirk said. “That’s awful. It’s awful for the companies. It’s awful for the people affected.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In July, Qantas obtained an ongoing injunction from the NSW supreme court ensuring protections to prevent the stolen data being accessed, viewed, released, used, transmitted or published by anyone, including third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kirk said there was no financial data but criminals could potentially use leaked personal information to open credit cards. He said people should monitor their accounts for suspicious activity, and beware of scam emails that are personalised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“These days, a lot of threat groups are now generating personalised phishing emails,” he said. “They’re getting better and better at this – and these types of breaches help sort of fuel that economy, that underground fraudster economy.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qantas has been contacted for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Firefox is an open source, private browser, one of the few mainstream browsers that supports extensions on mobile (Android) as powerful as the desktop ones (A lot of extensions have been ported), with seamless sync and a customizable homepage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Browser Extensions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many extensions that have improved my browsing experience dramatically, by helping me fight the bloat of modern web browsing. This is especially more important on mobile, where resources and screen space are more limited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extension store is very similar to the desktop one. My browsing use case on my phone is to read articles, look up something quickly, buy things in online stores, or just see what people are saying online. When I do that, I don’t want to see ads, and I don’t want pop-ups taking up half of my screen. No, I don’t want to download your app, The website is fine; I don’t want to talk with your AI chat. I’m not interested in receiving fake notifications either. And I might have subscribed to your newsletter if you hadn’t put a pop-up while I was midway through reading your article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following extensions have helped me in my fight against bloat and antipatterns on the web. Making my time on the web rather a pleasant experience&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Block ads and more (Ublock)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ublock is the best ad blocker. Besides blocking ads, it also blocks other annoyances such as mobile banners, like those super annoying ones where they tell you to download their app instead of letting you use their website&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon your app sucks and I won’t use it&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ublock filter lists&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here it’s my the filter list that I use that not only removes those install the app for the best experience. They also remove other annoyances like chat widgets, newsletter notices, popups, cookie banners, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To activate it go to the extensions menus. Press the Ublock one and then press in Open the dashboard And the go to the filter lists tab.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is the step by step tutorial with images&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;I hate the Medium UI (Libredirect)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So when you open a medium article you get the following delightful UX&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And after you close it, they show you bunch of annoying elements in the article&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compare that with the beautiful experience you get with the Scribe front-end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; The extension that makes this possible is called LibRedirect&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;X, I want to see the comments!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twitter/x. won’t let you to see the comments unless you create an account&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you tap in read replies button you’ll be presented with a log in screen&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compare with the nitter frontend also using LibRedirect where you can actually see comments&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Don’t fuck with paste&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one is self-explanatory, but if you hate that some sites don’t let you paste as me, this is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Can I just listen to something in the background?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This extensions will allow you to fix issues in some sites where they don’t let you to play audio in the background&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;404 Not found&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When this happens, you want to look up for a tool that let’s you to check for an archived version. Web archives let’s you to do exactly that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It even let’s you to choose from multiple archive sites Web archives&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Stop wasting time on the web&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you wasting time on the web?&lt;lb/&gt; Install Lechblock You can block websites, set time limits and more with Lechblock&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Sync&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other nice thing, about Firefox is that if you use Firefox on desktop, you can sync your data between your phone and your desktop easily, like bookmarks, addresses, passwords etc.. (I only sync bookmarks and tabs though )&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see the tabs opened on your desktop&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A useful feature is send to the desktop Where you can send tabs for checking them later on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;customize homepage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;you can customize the home page to only leave what you want. I for example remove sponsored shortcuts and stories from the page&lt;/p&gt;

The Unix of the web</title><link>https://nuejs.org/blog/2.0/</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="3f78361939a10cbb"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Nue 2.0: The UNIX of the web&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's Nue 2.0 â a complete website development environment in 1MB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The entire ecosystem in 1MB&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nue is made of small, focused tools that do one thing well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Nuekit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standards first web framework&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Nuedom&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HTML first UI assembly&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Nuestate&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;URL first state management&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Nuemark&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Content first web development&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Nueserver&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edge-first server development&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Nueglow&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CSS first syntax highlighting&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What used to be 500MB is now 1MB&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What's new&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Complete rewrite&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nuekit was rebuilt from scratch with a clear focus: do one thing well. The new architecture serves files directly from your source directory during development. No temporary &lt;code&gt;.dist/dev&lt;/code&gt; folder, no build step before you start working. Just create files and see them in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We also switched from supporting both Bun and Node to Bun only. This decision enables the entire framework to stay lean while delivering better performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;HTML templating&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All HTML files now use the same &lt;code&gt;.html&lt;/code&gt; extension. The document type declaration determines how Nue processes each file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Server-rendered page --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!doctype html&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;!-- Dynamic, client-rendered page --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!doctype dhtml&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;!-- Server-side component library --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!html lib&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;!-- Client-side library --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!dhtml lib&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;!-- Isomorphic library --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!html+dhtml&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you omit the doctype, Nue detects the type automatically based on your markup. If your file has event handlers or imports, it becomes dynamic. If it's pure content structure, it renders server-side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This replaces the old &lt;code&gt;.dhtml&lt;/code&gt; extension system with a more flexible approach that follows HTML standards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Zero dependencies&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nue 2.0 has no external dependencies. Everything needed to build websites lives in that 1MB executable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Custom CSS parser&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Custom YAML parser (Nueyaml)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Custom DOM implementation for server-side rendering and testing&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building without dependencies gives us full control over the entire stack. Each tool does one thing well and communicates seamlessly with the others. This is how you build frameworks the UNIX way: small, focused tools that work together perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gives us a lean developer experience without the typical framework bloat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;New features&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SVG development - Process SVG files as templates with full HMR support. Embed your design system styles and fonts directly into standalone graphics. Mix HTML and SVG naturally using &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags that become &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;foreignObject&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sitemap generation - Enable in your config and Nue generates &lt;code&gt;sitemap.xml&lt;/code&gt; automatically from your pages. Skip pages with draft or private flags.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RSS feeds - Point at any content collection and get a complete RSS feed with auto-discovery link tags. Perfect for blogs and documentation sites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;SPA development&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Single-page applications get a new development model built on Nuestate. Define your route patterns in one place and let the URL drive your application. Regular &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; links become SPA navigation automatically with the &lt;code&gt;autolink&lt;/code&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The upcoming universal data model will unify how data flows through SPAs, but the foundation is here now: clean separation between routing, data model, state, and the UI layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;New tools&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nuestate - URL-first state management that puts application state in the URL by default. Bookmarking, sharing, and browser navigation work automatically without extra code. No stores, no reducers, no actions. Just read and write to a state object.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nueserver - &lt;quote&gt;Edge-first&lt;/quote&gt; backend development. Write server code once and run it identically on your machine and across global edge locations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Server proxy - Not ready for edge-first? Configure Nue to proxy API calls to your existing backend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;New templates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Four options for different needs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;minimal - Just &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;index.css&lt;/code&gt; to start from scratch&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;blog - Simple Markdown based blog with minimal coding/configuration&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;spa - Single-page application with a simple server and UI&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;full - Full stack web with blog, docs, marketing pages, authentication, and SPA&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why Bun&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nue and Bun share the same vision for web development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standards based - Bun uses browser APIs you already know: &lt;code&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Request&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Response&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;URL&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Headers&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;FormData&lt;/code&gt;. No framework-specific APIs to learn. Code that works in the browser works in Bun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rich in features - Core features like bundling, serving, and file handling are written in native code (Zig). No need for Vite, ESBuild, or separate build tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Performance - Bun is faster than Node&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Node support would be convenient, Bun-only is what enables Nue's extreme performance and simplicity. It's what makes the developer experience special.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Upgrading from 1.0&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nue 2.0 is not backwards compatible with version 1.0. The safest upgrade path is to install locally in your project:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bun install nuekit@latest&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run commands with &lt;code&gt;bunx&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bunx nue serve
bunx nue build&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This lets you test the new version without breaking anything. Once you've migrated all projects, switch to global installation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bun install --global nuekit@latest&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Beta notice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a beta release. Tested on macOS only. Linux and Windows compatibility unknown. Report issues on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Get started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Install Bun 1.2+ (if you don't have it yet)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Install Nuekit globally
bun install --global nuekit

# Create your first project
nue create blog    # or minimal, spa, full&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start developing:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;nue    # Starts serving at http://localhost:4000&lt;/code&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Mitchell Hashimoto&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Vibing a Non-Trivial Ghostty Feature&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently shipped a non-trivial Ghostty feature (unobtrusive macOS automatic updates) that was largely developed with AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm regularly asked to share non-trivial examples of how I use AI and agentic coding tools and this felt like a golden opportunity to walk through my process with a well-scoped, non-trivial, real-world, shipping feature1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post will share every single agentic coding session I had on the path to shipping this feature, unedited and in full. Alongside it, I'll provide some additional context about my process and reasoning. And yes, I'll also share the token cost for those curious about that, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important: there is a lot of human coding, too. I almost always go in after an AI does work and iterate myself for awhile, too. Rather than say that at every turn, I'm just saying it once here. Therefore, you may see some discrepancies between what the AI produced and what ended up in the final code. This is intentional and I believe good AI drivers are experts in their domains and utilize AI as an assistant, not a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Feature&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The finished feature this blog post is about is the macOS unobtrusive update notification feature. This feature shows update status within the terminal window without interrupting work by creating windows, grabbing focus, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's set the stage for what lead to this feature (pun intended, as you'll see shortly). During a high-profile OpenAI keynote, a demo was rudely interrupted by a Ghostty update prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to ensure that never happened again2. The path I decided to take was to make update notifications unobtrusive. Instead of popping up a window, the app would instead show a small, non-modal GUI element somewhere that wouldn't interrupt the user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Pre-AI Planning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;So I pulled out my AI tooling.&lt;/del&gt; Absolutely not. I began by coming up with a rough plan of how I wanted this to work. Ghostty uses Sparkle, an extremely popular macOS update framework. I poked around their docs and found that they support custom UI through Obj-C protocols. You have to reimplement a ton of stuff from scratch, but it is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, so I had a rough idea of backend. For frontend, I wasn't really sure (and it isn't my area of expertise). I had this really vague idea that it should be a little button embedded in the title bar, and I know macOS supports custom UI in the titlebar via titlebar accessory controllers, but beyond that I didn't have much of a sense of how it should look or feel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that's enough to get started. AI is a very good prototyper, so even knowing what you don't know is useful enough to get started. I had a strong enough sense of the big picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;First Session: Prototyping the UI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is my first agentic coding session, with the starting prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I want to enable custom, unobtrusive update notifications and installs by customizing SPUUserDriver. Let's start by planning the custom UI we'll need. We'll ONLY work on UI. Create a plan for creating SwiftUI views that can show the various states that are required by SPUUserDriver. I think the best place for these to show up is in the macOS window titlebars on the top-right. Create a plan to put it there. Consult the oracle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Frequent question: "What is the oracle?" It is an Amp-specific read-only subagent that uses a slower, higher-cost model that is generally better at thinking about things. I consult the oracle for all planning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To start, I decided to prototype the UI first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice here that I don't send the agent off to build the full feature. There are a couple reasons for this. First and foremost, I still don't even know what I want the UI/UX to be like, so I can't possibly coherently expect an AI to do that for me amongst other changes. Second, smaller chunks of work are easier to review, understand, and iterate on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another thing to notice is that I ask it to only create a plan and not to write any code. Since this is a relatively vague request, it's important that I review a plan before it goes off and does a ton of work (and spends a ton of tokens doing it).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip: Creating a comprehensive plan interactively with an agent is a really important first-step for anything non-trivial. I usually also save it out (via the agent) to something like &lt;code&gt;spec.md&lt;/code&gt; and in future sessions I can say "Consult the @spec.md and work on some task".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The agent came up with an agreeable enough plan that I let it go ahead and implement it. You can see the rest of my conversations as I iterate on that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UI it made was directionally very good. It had a ton of polish issues (spacing, colors, etc.) but seeing the UI gave me the spark of inspiration I needed to know what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip: I very often use AI for inspiration. In this case, I ended up keeping a lot (not all) of the UI code it made, but I will very often prompt an agent, throw away everything it did, and redo it myself (manually!). I find the "zero to one" stage of creation very difficult and time consuming and AI is excellent at being my muse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hitting a Wall&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see in chats 11 to 14 that we're entering the slop zone. The code the agent created has a critical bug, and it's absolutely failing to fix it. And I have no idea how to fix it, either.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll often make these few hail mary attempts to fix a bug. If the agent can figure it out, I can study it and learn myself. If it doesn't, it costs me very little. If the agent figures it out and I don't understand it, I back it out. I'm not shipping code I don't understand. While it's failing, I'm also tabbed out searching the issue and trying to figure it out myself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's at this point that I know I need to step back, review what it did, and come up with my own plans. It's time to educate myself and think critically. AI is no longer the solution; it is a liability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cleanup Sessions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I spend the next few sessions guiding the agent to clean up the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second session focused on moving some methods around into better places I recognized:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Let's move the pill background, foreground, and badge functions from @macos/Sources/Features/Update/UpdateAccessoryView.swift to @macos/Sources/Features/Update/UpdateViewModel.swift and make them more generic (background, foreground, badge)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The third session added documentation to the code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Update the docs for @UpdateBadge.swift&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip: Adding documentation is a really important step because it helps reaffirm your own understanding of the code as well as educate future agents that may read and modify this code. I find agents do much better when they have both natural language descriptions as well as the code itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fourth session moves the view model to an app-global location, since the original work put it in a window scope and update information is app scoped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Move the update view model data to AppDelegate since the update information will be app-global.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout these, I am usually dropping in and making minor manual changes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cleanup step is really important. To cleanup effectively you have to have a pretty good understanding of the code, so this forces me to not blindly accept AI-written code. Subsequently, better organized and documented code helps future agentic sessions perform better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I sometimes tongue-in-cheek refer to this as the "anti-slop session".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Facing "The Bug"&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time to get back to that bug that I found in that initial session. I once again spent a few sessions trying to get the agent to figure this out. I start vague, and slowly get more specific with how I'd approach it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, the vague session:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For standard, native tabs, the update accesory view is not visible. It should remain visible in the titlebar of the window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Failure. Then, I get more specific:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We need to update @macos/Sources/Features/Terminal/Window Styles/TerminalTabsTitlebarTahoe.swift tab bar constraints to align the right edge of the tab bar with the left edge of the update accessory view so it remains visible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Failure. Then, I try a different, specific approach:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;What if we changed the @macos/Sources/Features/Terminal/Window Styles/TitlebarTabsTahoeTerminalWindow.swift to make the tab bar a top accessory view rather than a bottom one to make our tabs go into the titlebar?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Failure. One last attempt:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The "right accessory view" and layout of @macos/Sources/Features/Terminal/Window Styles/TitlebarTabsTahoeTerminalWindow.swift is conflictig with the update accessory view setup in @macos/Sources/Features/Terminal/Window Styles/TerminalWindow.swift Can we constrain the tab bar to always appear left of the update notice?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Failure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This whole time, I've also spent time trying to solve this myself through manual research and human effort. My more specific prompts are based on things I've learned through that process. But overall, it was clearly not working.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't think I can figure this out on my own, so I decide to pivot. I decided that for these problematic titlebar styles, let's put the update notices in the bottom-right corner of the window overlaid on top of the content view rather than in the titlebar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I need to support this anyways because Ghostty has a configuration to hide the titlebar entirely. So, even if I can solve the titlebar styling issue later, I still need to support this other mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My next session moves forward with this plan with a very specific prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Augment the @macos/Sources/Features/Update system to also support an overlay approach in @macos/Sources/Features/Terminal/TerminalView.swift The update notice should appear at the bottom of the window. It should go over the text (so it doesn't resize the terminal view). All clicking behaviors should otherwise be the same as the accessory view.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It did a really good job with this. I did a lot of manual polish after (moving stuff around, renaming things, etc.) but the core work was solid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a video of the feature shortly after this session, showcasing how the update notice appears in the bottom-right corner of the window for certain titlebar styles or when the titlebar is hidden:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Starting the Backend&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UI was feeling good enough. I had noted a bunch of polish issues I wanted to tackle later but I wanted to move on to the backend work primarily to see if I'd discover any unknown unknowns that threw a wrench in my plans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I manually created a file with a scaffold of incomplete functions and various &lt;code&gt;TODO&lt;/code&gt; comments. I then started
a session to complete that work for me:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Complete the @macos/Sources/Features/Update/UpdateDriver.swift Read the Sparkle documentaiton as necessary to understand the functionality. https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/api-reference/Protocols.html&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip: AI is very good at fill-in-the-blank or draw-the-rest-of-the-owl. My pattern here of creating scaffolding with descriptive function names, parameters, todo comments, etc. is a really common one for me and it works very well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It actually did a really bad job here and I ended up throwing all of this code away. The code it produced worked, but it was obviously the wrong approach. It conflated a lot of different concerns and the way it was storing state in the driver was clearly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I studied what it did, I realized it was because the view model was structured in a suboptimal way, so I switched gears into cleanup mode to give AI (and humans, if I chose to write it myself) the better framework to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cleanup Again, Big Time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experience has taught me that the cleanliness of a UI frontend and business logic backend is often dictated by the quality of the view model in between. So I spent some time manually restructured the view model. This involved switching to a tagged union rather than the struct with a bunch of optionals. I renamed some types, moved stuff around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I knew from experience that this small bit of manual work in the middle would set the agents up for success in future sessions for both the frontend and backend. After completing it, I continued with a marathon set of cleanup sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After doing the restructuring, the first thing I did was ask the agent to once again complete the owl, this time inspecting my changes and updating dependent code to the new style and removing the old:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update @macos/Sources/Features/Update/UpdateViewModel.swift to use the new&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;UpdateState&lt;/code&gt;exclusively. Rename&lt;code&gt;state2&lt;/code&gt;to&lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt;(remove the old state).&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I asked it remove additional dead code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I think we can get rid of UpdateUIActions. They're not used anymore since our UpdateState has callbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I broke the build myself cleaning up some things. I had a meeting to hop onto so I decided to let the agent fix it while I was busy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Run the build and fix the errors&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip: "I broke a bunch of things, please fix my mess." is another frequent use case I have for agents. I'd say generally this fits within the same fill-in-the-blank pattern as before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later, I started doing some refactors on some of the views again:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Turn each @macos/Sources/Features/Update/UpdatePopoverView.swift case into a dedicated fileprivate Swift view that takes the typed value as its parameter so that we can remove the guards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;iconName&lt;/code&gt;in @macos/Sources/Features/Update/UpdateViewModel.swift to be an optional, return nil for blank. Update usage.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Simulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my first UI session, I had the agent create some demo code so I could see the UI in action without real update checks. But update flows have a number of scenarios and up to this point I only tested the happy path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my next session I extracted the simulation code into a dedicated file and asked the agent to create more scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Extract the update simulation code in @macos/Sources/App/macOS/AppDelegate.swift into a dedicated file in @macos/Sources/Features/Update . This should contain multiple simulation scenarios (happy path, not found, errors, etc.) so that we can easily try different demos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip: Agents are great at generating tests and simulations. The simulation code specifically that it generated here is honestly pretty gross but it works and it's not part of the release binary so the quality doesn't matter to me. I didn't even bother cleaning it up beyond the basics you can see in the session.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I then ran the various simulations and found a number of UX improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Cleaning up the "No Update Found" state&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reset state on confirming error&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Copy and style changes for permission request state&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Last Mile&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, I had a working backend and frontend and I needed to hook it all up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My next session prompted the agent to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make an&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;UpdateController&lt;/code&gt;class the same as https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/blob/2.x/Sparkle/SPUStandardUpdaterController.m but for our updater types.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This required some back and forth and manual polish, but it got there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I then made some minor improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For our update available state with the appcast, look at https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/api-reference/Classes/SUAppcastItem.html and show other relevant metadata if its set. For example, content length for size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Anything Else?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My last prompt to an agent is always to ask what else I might be missing. I do this regardless of if I manually wrote the code myself or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Are there any other improvements you can see to be made with the @macos/Sources/Features/Update feature? Don't write any code. Consult the oracle. Consider parts of the code that can also get more unit tests added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This highlighted some real issues, so I went ahead and asked it to implement them. I find its easier to tell the agent "okay just do it all" rather than ask it specific things to do, since I can always easily clean it up in selective commits later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An amusing thing in this session is that the agent started going down a really crazy rabbit hole and so I stepped in to stop it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Stop stop stop. Undo all the main actor stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also noticed that it did something rather poorly when there is a better way:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For the error message, instead of truncating, isn't there a SwiftUI standard way to do this? We should add an additional UI element they can use to view the whole message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cost and Time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The work took a total of 16 separate sessions totalling $15.98 in token spend on Amp3. I won't try to speculate whether this is expensive or cheap in general, but I will say for me personally I spent more than that in coffee shops in the two calendar days I spent on this feature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The total "wall clock" time I spent on this feature I estimate around 8 hours. I only spend around 4 hours a day on the computer the first and last commit span 3 days. But I also didn't spend all of my time on this feature. For example, I shipped a Ghostty update, was a guest on ThePrimeagen for an hour, and gave a guest presentation at Zoo's annual all-hands, all during the hours I have available for "computer work" during the same days I was working on this feature4. So, I think the 8 hour estimate is generous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many people on the internet argue whether AI enables you to work faster or not. In this case, I think I shipped this faster than I would have if I had done it all myself, in particular because iterating on minor SwiftUI styling is so tedious and time consuming for me personally and AI does it so well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the faster/slower argument for me personally is missing the thing I like the most: the AI can work for me while I step away to do other things. Here is a picture I took of one of my cleanup sessions while I was making breakfast for my family:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's all sorts of dismissals about this, such as "I don't want to be coding while I'm cooking" or "Be more present" or whatever. If that's how you want to be, that's fine. In my case, in this specific example, I'm the first person awake in my household and I prep breakfast while everyone else is still asleep. I don't do this every waking moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All this is to say: it works for me. I'm really, really not trying to convince you. I'm not associated financially with any AI company. But as someone who has a lot of success with AI tooling and likes to talk about it, people ask me to share examples all the time. That's what I'm doing here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;End&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the feature is beautiful, works great, and after a final manual review I merged it5. For Ghostty users who are on the tip release, it is available now. For Ghostty users who are on tagged releases, this feature will be available in Ghostty 1.3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm an outspoken advocate about the importance of sharing agentic coding sessions publicly6, with one of the reasons being that it's an incredibly powerful way to educate others about how to use these tools effectively. I hope this post helps demonstrate that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Footnotes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It is currently only shipped to nightly beta testers ("tip" testers) but that is a group of thousands of people. It is merged and will be in the next stable Ghostty release. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yes, it was good marketing. No, it was not on purpose. And no, I'm not celebrating it, because you don't want users to a fear a tool will take advantage of them. You want to trust that it's there to help. I want presenters (or anyone, really) to want to use Ghostty, and caring about stuff like this is part of that. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The most poetic though would've been to use OpenAI Codex for this. I'm sure it would've done great! This post isn't an advertisement for Amp, it just happens to be the agentic coding tool I use the most currently. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I have a toddler at home so my "computer time" is very scheduled and very limited. 😁 ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;"Final manual review" is super super super important. This probably shouldn't be a footnote, but I couldn't find a better place to emphasize it. Please don't ever ship AI-written code without a thorough manual review. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;My reasoning for this could also be its own blog post, so I'm going to avoid explaining myself further here beyond what I already have. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shares of Amazon, Nvidia and Tesla each dropped around 5% on Friday, as tech's megacaps lost $770 billion in market cap, following President Donald Trump's threats for increased tariffs on Chinese goods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With tech's trillion-dollar companies occupying an increasingly large slice of the U.S. market, their declines sent the Nasdaq down 3.6% and the S&amp;amp;P 500 down 2.7%. For both indexes, it was the worst day since April, when Trump said he would slap "reciprocal" duties on U.S. trading partners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After market close on Friday, Trump declared in a social media post that the U.S. would impose a 100% tariff on China and, on Nov. 1, it would apply export controls "on any and all critical software."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amazon, Nvidia and Tesla all slipped about 2% in extended trading following the post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The president's latest threats are disrupting, at least briefly, what had been a sustained rally in tech, built on hundreds of billions of dollars in planned spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In late September, Nvidia, which makes graphics processing units for training AI models, became the first company to reach a market cap of $4.5 trillion. Nvidia alone saw its market capitalization decline by nearly $229 billion on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI counts on Nvidia's GPUs from a series of cloud suppliers, including Microsoft. OpenAI is only seeing rising demand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In September it introduced the Sora 2 video creation app, and this week the company said the ChatGPT assistant now boasts over 800 million weekly users. Microsoft, which spends heavily on infrastructure to operate its cloud data centers, saw its market cap drop by $85 billion on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sell-off wiped out Amazon's gains for the year. That stock is now down 2% so far in 2025. Amazon competes with Microsoft to rent out GPUs from its cloud data centers. The online retailer lost $121 billion in value during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"There continues to be a lot of noise about the impact that tariffs will have on retail prices and consumption," Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told analysts in July. "Much of it thus far has been wrong and misreported. As we said before, it's impossible to know what will happen."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tesla, which introduced lower-priced vehicles on Tuesday, saw its market capitalization sink by $71 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The automaker reports third-quarter results on Oct. 22, with Microsoft earnings scheduled for the following week. Nvidia reports in November.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google parent Alphabet and Facebook owner Meta fell 2% and almost 4%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;"I have more ideas than time to try them out" — The problem we're solving&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Caution&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project is a research demonstrator. It is in early development and may change significantly. Using permissive AI tools in your repository requires careful attention to security considerations and careful human supervision, and even then things can still go wrong. Use it with caution, and at your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amplifier is a complete development environment that takes AI coding assistants and supercharges them with discovered patterns, specialized expertise, and powerful automation — turning a helpful assistant into a force multiplier that can deliver complex solutions with minimal hand-holding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've taken our learnings about what works in AI-assisted development and packaged them into a ready-to-use environment. Instead of starting from scratch every session, you get immediate access to proven patterns, specialized agents for different tasks, and workflows that actually work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amplifier provides powerful tools and systems:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;20+ Specialized Agents: Each expert in specific tasks (architecture, debugging, security, etc.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Pre-loaded Context: Proven patterns and philosophies built into the environment&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Parallel Worktree System: Build and test multiple solutions simultaneously&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Knowledge Extraction System: Transform your documentation into queryable, connected knowledge&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Conversation Transcripts: Never lose context - automatic export before compaction, instant restoration&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Automation Tools: Quality checks and patterns enforced automatically&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before starting, you'll need:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Python 3.11+ - Download Python&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;UV - Install UV&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Node.js - Download Node.js&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VS Code (recommended) - Download VS Code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Git - Download Git&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Platform Note: Development and testing has primarily been done in Windows WSL2. macOS and Linux should work but have received less testing. Your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Clone the repository:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier.git cd amplifier&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Run the installer:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;make install&lt;/quote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This installs Python dependencies, the Claude CLI, and sets up your environment.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Configure your data directories (Recommended but optional):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why configure this? By default, Amplifier stores data in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.data/&lt;/code&gt;(git-ignored). But centralizing your data externally gives you:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Shared knowledge across all worktrees - Every parallel experiment accesses the same knowledge base&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Cross-device synchronization - Work from any machine with the same accumulated knowledge&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Automatic cloud backup - Never lose your extracted insights&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Reusable across projects - Apply learned patterns to new codebases&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up external directories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cp .env.example .env # Edit .env to point to your preferred locations&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Example configuration using cloud storage:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;# Centralized knowledge base - shared across all worktrees and devices # Using OneDrive/Dropbox/iCloud enables automatic backup! AMPLIFIER_DATA_DIR=~/OneDrive/amplifier/data # Your source materials (documentation, specs, design docs, notes) # Can point to multiple folders where you keep content AMPLIFIER_CONTENT_DIRS=.data/content,~/OneDrive/amplifier/content,~/Documents/notes&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Activate the environment (if not already active):&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;source .venv/bin/activate # Linux/Mac/WSL .venv\Scripts\activate # Windows&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start Claude in the Amplifier directory to get all enhancements automatically:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd amplifier
claude  # Everything is pre-configured and ready&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Want Amplifier's power on your own code? Easy:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Start Claude with both directories:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;claude --add-dir /path/to/your/project&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tell Claude where to work (paste as first message):&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;I'm working in /path/to/your/project which doesn't have Amplifier files. Please cd to that directory and work there. Do NOT update any issues or PRs in the Amplifier repo.&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Use Amplifier's agents on your code:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;"Use the zen-architect agent to design my application's caching layer"&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;"Deploy bug-hunter to find why my login system is failing"&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;"Have security-guardian review my API implementation for vulnerabilities"&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why use this? Stop wondering "what if" — build multiple solutions simultaneously and pick the winner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Try different approaches in parallel
make worktree feature-jwt     # JWT authentication approach
make worktree feature-oauth   # OAuth approach in parallel

# Compare and choose
make worktree-list            # See all experiments
make worktree-rm feature-jwt  # Remove the one you don't want&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each worktree is completely isolated with its own branch, environment, and context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See the Worktree Guide for advanced features, such as hiding worktrees from VSCode when not in use, adopting branches from other machines, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Practical tips for effective AI-assisted development&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of one generalist AI, you get 20+ specialists:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Core Development:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;zen-architect&lt;/code&gt;- Designs with ruthless simplicity&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;[See &lt;code&gt;.claude/AGENTS_CATALOG.md&lt;/code&gt; for the complete list]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why use this? Stop losing insights. Every document, specification, design decision, and lesson learned becomes part of your permanent knowledge that Claude can instantly access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Knowledge extraction is an evolving feature that continues to improve with each update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Add your content (any text-based files: documentation, specs, notes, decisions, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Build your knowledge base:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;make knowledge-update # Extracts concepts, relationships, patterns&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Query your accumulated wisdom:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;quote&gt;make knowledge-query Q="authentication patterns" make knowledge-graph-viz # See how ideas connect&lt;/quote&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Never lose context again. Amplifier automatically exports your entire conversation before compaction, preserving all the details that would otherwise be lost. When Claude Code compacts your conversation to stay within token limits, you can instantly restore the full history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automatic Export: A PreCompact hook captures your conversation before any compaction event:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Saves complete transcript with all content types (messages, tool usage, thinking blocks)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Timestamps and organizes transcripts in &lt;code&gt;.data/transcripts/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Works for both manual (&lt;code&gt;/compact&lt;/code&gt;) and auto-compact events&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Easy Restoration: Use the &lt;code&gt;/transcripts&lt;/code&gt; command in Claude Code to restore your full conversation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/transcripts  # Restores entire conversation history
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The transcript system helps you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Continue complex work after compaction without losing details&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Review past decisions with full context&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Search through conversations to find specific discussions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Export conversations for sharing or documentation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Transcript Commands (via Makefile):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;make transcript-list            # List available transcripts
make transcript-search TERM="auth"  # Search past conversations
make transcript-restore         # Restore full lineage (for CLI use)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A one-command workflow to go from an idea to a module (Contract &amp;amp; Spec → Plan → Generate → Review) inside the Amplifier Claude Code environment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Docs: see &lt;code&gt;docs/MODULAR_BUILDER_LITE.md&lt;/code&gt;for the detailed flow and guardrails.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Artifacts: planning goes to &lt;code&gt;ai_working/&amp;lt;module&amp;gt;/…&lt;/code&gt;(contract/spec/plan/review); code &amp;amp; tests to&lt;code&gt;amplifier/&amp;lt;module&amp;gt;/…&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Isolation &amp;amp; discipline: workers read only this module’s contract/spec plus dependency contracts. The spec’s Output Files are the single source of truth for what gets written. Every contract Conformance Criterion maps to tests. 〔Authoring Guide〕&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Want to create tools like the ones in the scenarios/ directory? You don't need to be a programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not sure what to build? Ask Amplifier to brainstorm with you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;/ultrathink-task I'm new to the concepts of "metacognitive recipes" - what are some
interesting tools that you could create that I might find useful, that demonstrate
the value of "metacognitive recipes"? Especially any that would demonstrate how such
could be used to auto evaluate and recover/improve based upon self-feedback loops.
Don't create them, just give me some ideas.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This brainstorming session will give you ideas like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Documentation Quality Amplifier - Improves docs by simulating confused readers&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Research Synthesis Quality Escalator - Extracts and refines knowledge from documents&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Code Quality Evolution Engine - Writes code, tests it, learns from failures&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-Perspective Consensus Builder - Simulates different viewpoints to find optimal solutions&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Self-Debugging Error Recovery - Learns to fix errors autonomously&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The magic happens when you combine:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Amplifier's brainstorming - Generates diverse possibilities&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your domain knowledge - You know your needs and opportunities&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your creativity - Sparks recognition of what would be useful&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have an idea:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Describe your goal - What problem are you solving?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Describe the thinking process - How should the tool approach it?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Let Amplifier build it - Use &lt;code&gt;/ultrathink-task&lt;/code&gt;to create the tool&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iterate to refine - Provide feedback as you use it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Share it back - Help others by contributing to scenarios/&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example: The blog writer tool was created with one conversation where the user described:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The goal (write blog posts in my style)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The thinking process (extract style → draft → review sources → review style → get feedback → refine)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No code was written by the user. Just description → Amplifier builds → feedback → refinement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How to check for overlapping intervals DRAFT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working with intervals is a common task in programming, whether you’re dealing with time ranges, scheduling problems, or geometric computations. A key insight when working with intervals is that checking for the absence of an overlap is often much simpler than checking for all the ways an overlap can occur.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post will first cover how to represent intervals in code, then dive into the logic for detecting overlaps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What are intervals?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An interval represents a range between two points, and could be in a continuous or discrete domain. A common way to write an interval is a pair of values &lt;code&gt;[start, end]&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;start ≤ end&lt;/code&gt;.
This would be a so-called closed interval, where the end-value is included in the interval.
An alternative is &lt;code&gt;[start, end)&lt;/code&gt;, which denotes a half-open interval where the &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; value is not included in the interval.1
Half-open intervals are very common in programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some examples of intervals are&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Time intervals: &lt;code&gt;[9:00, 17:00]&lt;/code&gt;(a work day)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Numeric ranges: &lt;code&gt;[1, 10)&lt;/code&gt;(the digit 1, 2, 3, …, 9)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Date ranges: &lt;code&gt;[2025-01-01, 2025-12-31]&lt;/code&gt;(all the days in the year 2025)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Temperature range: &lt;code&gt;[20°C, 25°C]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;…&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Representing an interval&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will use Python as an example language, and will use plain integers as the underlying type. All the examples will use open intervals, as that is very common.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this post, we will only consider integer valued intervals for simplicity. In addition we require that intervals are non-empty. In many real cases, real valued intervals approximated by floating points are needed as is the handling of empty intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Detecting overlap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most common questions when working with intervals is: “Do these two intervals overlap?” Lets implement a method for this&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The straight-forward approach&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whenever one needs to make a Boolean condition, the easiest way is often to consider all the cases. So, let’s consider all the ways that two intervals may overlap. There are four distinct cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 1: self starts first, other overlaps end of self&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 2: other starts first, self overlaps end of other&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 3: self completely contains other&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 4: other completely contains self&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In all these cases, we can see that the intervals share at least one point in common. The challenge is to write a condition that captures all four cases correctly. Let’s translate it into code straight from the case analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a straightforward translation of the cases, where the most tricky thing is to make sure that the handling of the half-open property is correct. One thing to note though, is that by checking the endpoints of the blue &lt;code&gt;other&lt;/code&gt; interval in Case 1 and 2,
then we have also covered Case 3.
This means that due to short circuiting, we will never trigger Case 3.
In addition Case 4 is overly specific.
We only need to care about checking if the start-point of the green &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; interval is in the blue &lt;code&gt;other&lt;/code&gt; interval.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking these observations into account, we can simplify the above condition to the following cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With a case-analysis and some careful considerations, we have a nice expression that captures overlapping intervals. But checking overlap feels like something that should be obvious, and this condition is not that obvious. Checking for overlap of two intervals also feels like it shouldn’t reduce down to three cases. From that argument, we can intuit that it should be possible to simplify this even more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can we make a simpler condition, that is also easy to find?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Flipping the script&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core insight is that sometimes it is much easier to check for the negation of a property than the original property. For overlap, the negation is checking if two intervals are not overlapping. Let’s look at the cases we have now instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 1: self is before other&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 2: other is before self&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are only two ways the two intervals are not overlapping, and this is much easier to translate into code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using De Morgan’s law it is possible to push the negation in. In addition, negated comparisons can be flipped simplifying this even further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is finally a nice and simple expression that checks just two properties. By changing our viewpoint from checking for an overlap to checking against one, we deduced the correct expression much more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Understanding the new condition&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new condition works, and we could derive it from a case analysis and using Boolean simplification. But there is also a meaning to the expression that we can interpret geometrically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 1: start of other is before end of self&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 2: start of self is before end of other&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first case checks that it is not the case that &lt;code&gt;other&lt;/code&gt; starts after &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; ends.
The second case checks that it is not the case that &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; starts after &lt;code&gt;other&lt;/code&gt; ends.
These two conditions together gives us the result that there is some part that is overlapping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is of course possible to figure out this condition directly, but making this intuitive leap is in my view harder than following the case analysis from the negative case.2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Adding a second dimension&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An interval is a one-dimensional property. A very natural extension is to instead consider two-dimensional properties. Representing a box is very similar to an interval, here we go from top and left (inclusive) to bottom and right (exclusive).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Case analysis for overlap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Checking for overlap is equally important for boxes as it is for intervals. Let’s start by making a full case analysis of all the variants for how two boxes can overlap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 1: other left+below, ends inside&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 2: other left, ends inside; contained vertically&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 3: other left+above, ends inside&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 4: other left, ends inside; contains vertically&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 5: other contained horizontally; starts below, ends inside&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 6: other fully contained in self&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 7: other contained horizontally; starts inside, ends above&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 8: other contains self horizontally; overlaps vertically&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 9: other right+below, starts inside&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 10: other right, starts inside; contained vertically&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 11: other right+above, starts inside&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 12: other right, starts inside; contains vertically&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 13: other contains horizontally; starts below, ends inside&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 14: other contains horizontally; contained vertically&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 15: other contains horizontally; starts inside, ends above&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 16: other completely contains self&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This does not inspire confidence in getting understandable code, let’s not even attempt it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Negation to the rescue again&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the same idea as for intervals, let’s look at the cases where two boxes do not overlap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 1: other is to the left of self&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 2: other is to the right of self&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 3: other is above self&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Case 4: other is below self&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is quite easy, the other box can be to the left, right, above, or below. If it is to the left, it does not matter how much (or at all) the box overlaps in the vertical direction. Translating this into straightforward code as before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the same analysis as before, we can use De Morgan’s laws to change the implementation to not start with a not.3&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This new expression can be interpreted as a two dimensional variant of the interval overlap check. Two boxes overlap if there is overlap in both the horizontal and the vertical direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figuring out the best way to express a property can be tricky. For intervals, while one can sit down and think thoroughly to find the best way to express the overlaps property, it is not easy. Using case analysis is the straight-forward way to create these but it can easily lead to an overly complicated and error-prone expression. This is especially clear for the box case, where there are 16 different cases to handle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using negation as a trick to simplify the case analysis works really well here. Naturally, it doesn’t always work out this well, but when it does it is a technique that is worth keeping in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
