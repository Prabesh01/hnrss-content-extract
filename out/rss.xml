  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;AGI fantasy is a blocker to actual engineering&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reading Empire of AI by Karen Hao, I was struck by how people associated with OpenAI believe in AGI. They really do think someone, perhaps them, will build AGI, and that it will lead to either the flourishing or destruction of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elon Musk founded OpenAI because he thought Demis Hassabis was an evil genius who would build AGI first:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;…Musk would regularly characterise Hassabis as a supervillain who needed to be stopped. Musk would make unequivocally clear that OpenAI was the good to DeepMind’s evil. … “He literally made a video game where an evil genius tries to create AI to take over the world,” Musk shouted [at an OpenAI off-site], referring to Hassabis’s 2004 title Evil Genius, “and fucking people don’t see it. Fucking people don’t see it! And Larry [Page]? Larry thinks he controls Demis but he’s too busy fucking windsurfing to realize that Demis is gathering the power.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenAI’s co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever regularly told audiences and employees to “feel the AGI”. At a company off-site in Yosemite in September 2022, employees gathered around a firepit:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In the pit, [Sutskever] had placed a wooden effigy that he’d commissioned from a local artist, and began a dramatic performance. This effigy, he explained represented a good, aligned AGI that OpenAI had built, only to discover it was actually lying and deceitful. OpenAI’s duty, he said, was to destroy it. … Sutskever doused the effigy in lighter fluid and lit on fire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think it’s remarkable that what was until recently sci-fi fantasy has become a mainstream view in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hao writes that GPT-2 was a bet on the “pure language” hypothesis, that asserts that since we communicate through language, then AGI should emerge from training a model solely on language. This is contrast to the “grounding” hypothesis, that asserts an AGI needs to perceive the world. Successfully scaling GPT to GPT-2 convinced enough people at OpenAI that the pure language hypothesis was valid. They just needed more data, more model parameters, and more compute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the belief in AGI, plus the recent results from LLMs, necessitates scaling, and justifies building data centres that consume hundreds of litres of water a second, run on polluting gas generators because the grid can’t supply the power (and might use as much power as entire cities), driving up CO2 emissions from manufacture and operation of new hardware, and exploits and traumatises data workers to make sure ChatGPT doesn’t generate outputs like child sexual abuse material and hate speech or encourage users to self-harm. (The thirst for data is so great that they stopped curating training data and instead consume the internet, warts and all, and manage the model output using RLHF.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And this is all fine, because they’re going to make AGI and the expected value (EV) of it will be huge! (Briefly, the argument goes that if there is a 0.001% chance of AGI delivering an extremely large amount of value, and 99.999% chance of much less or zero value, then the EV is still extremely large because &lt;code&gt;(0.001% * very_large_value) + (99.999% * small_value) = very_large_value&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But AGI arguments based on EV are nonsensical because the values and probabilities are made up and unfalsifiable. They also ignore externalities like environmental damage, which in contrast to AGI, have known negative value and certain probability: costs borne by everyone else right now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a technologist I want to solve problems effectively (by bringing about the desired, correct result), efficiently (with minimal waste) and without harm (to people or the environment).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLMs-as-AGI fail on all three fronts. The computational profligacy of LLMs-as-AGI is dissatisfying, and the exploitation of data workers and the environment unacceptable. Instead, if we drop the AGI fantasy, we can evaluate LLMs and other generative models as solutions for specific problems, rather than all problems, with proper cost benefit analysis. For example, by using smaller purpose-built generative models, or even discriminative (non-generative) models. In other words, make trade-offs and actually do engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For decades, Lyme disease has frustrated both physicians and patients alike. Caused by the corkscrew-shaped bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, the infection, if left untreated, can linger for months, leading to fever, fatigue and painful inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a new study, Northwestern University and Uniformed Services University (USU) scientists have uncovered a surprising — and ironic — vulnerability in the hardy bacterium. By exploiting this vulnerability, researchers could help disarm B. burgdorferi, potentially leading to new therapeutic strategies for Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Northwestern and USU team discovered that manganese, which helps shield B. burgdorferi against its host’s immune system, is simultaneously also a crack in its armor. If B. burgdorferi is either starved of or overloaded with manganese, the bacteria become highly vulnerable to the host’s immune system or treatments they would otherwise resist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study was published today (Nov. 13) in the journal mBio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Our work shows that manganese is a double-edged sword in Lyme disease,” said Northwestern’s Brian Hoffman, who co-led the study with USU’s Michael Daly. “It’s both Borrelia’s armor and its weakness. If we can target the way it manages manganese, we could open doors for entirely new approaches for treating Lyme disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hoffman is the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Chemistry and molecular biosciences at Northwestern’s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. He also is a member of the Chemistry of Life Processes Institute and the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. Daly is an emeritus professor of pathology at USU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the 1980s, the occurrence of Lyme disease has increased dramatically across North America and around the globe. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, roughly 476,000 people in the United States are diagnosed annually. Currently, there are no approved vaccines against the disease, and long-term use of antibiotics is problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Although antibiotics harm B. burgdorferi, they also kill beneficial gut bacteria,” Daly said. “Lyme disease is transmitted through tick bites and — if not treated promptly — can cause lingering effects by attacking the patient’s immune, circulatory and central nervous systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a series of previous studies, Hoffman and Daly collaborated to understand the role of manganese in Deinococcus radiodurans, a radiation-resistant bacteria known as “Conan the Bacterium” for its extraordinary ability to survive harsh conditions. Now, they wanted to see if manganese played a role in B. burgdorferi’s defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To conduct the study, the team used a new tool called electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging to characterize the atomic composition of manganese inside the living bacteria. To add even finer detail, the team harnessed electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy to examine the atoms surrounding manganese. Together, the technologies created a molecular map, showing which forms of manganese were present, where they were located and how they changed under stress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “map” revealed a two-tier, manganese-based defense system comprising an enzyme called MnSOD and a pool of manganese metabolites. To withstand bombardment from the host’s immune system, the bacteria first use MnSOD, which acts like a shield. If any oxygen radicals slip past this shield, they are met with the metabolite pool, which acts like a sponge to soak up and neutralize those toxic molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Our study demonstrates the power of EPR and ENDOR spectroscopies for uncovering hidden biochemical mechanisms in pathogens,” Hoffman said. “Without these tools, B. burgdorferi’s defense system and weak spots would have remained invisible.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scientists found the bacteria constantly juggle where to send the manganese — to the MnSOD enzymes or the metabolite pool. Too little manganese and the bacteria lose their defense mechanisms. But, as the microbes age, their metabolite pools dramatically shrink, leaving them exposed to damage and stress. At this point, too much manganese becomes toxic because the bacteria can no longer store it safely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This discovery holds potential for new Lyme disease therapies. Future drugs could starve the bacterium of manganese, disrupt its ability to form protective manganese complexes or even push it into toxic overload. Any of these approaches would leave B. burgdorferi wide open to attack by the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“By disrupting the delicate balance of manganese in B. burgdorferi, it may be possible to weaken the pathogen during infection,” Daly said. “Manganese is an Achilles’ heel of its defenses.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Notes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study was supported by the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs’ Tick-borne Disease Research Program and the National Institutes of Health. Additional funds were from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You are seeing this because the administrator of this website has set up Anubis to protect the server against the scourge of AI companies aggressively scraping websites. This can and does cause downtime for the websites, which makes their resources inaccessible for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anubis is a compromise. Anubis uses a Proof-of-Work scheme in the vein of Hashcash, a proposed proof-of-work scheme for reducing email spam. The idea is that at individual scales the additional load is ignorable, but at mass scraper levels it adds up and makes scraping much more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this is a hack whose real purpose is to give a "good enough" placeholder solution so that more time can be spent on fingerprinting and identifying headless browsers (EG: via how they do font rendering) so that the challenge proof of work page doesn't need to be presented to users that are much more likely to be legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bitchat for Gaza - messaging without internet&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bitchat is a new messaging app that allows users to chat securely with or without internet access. Download it today via the App Store or Google Play store to begin communicating safely, even when connectivity disappears.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Bitchat is needed&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Palestinians are dependent on Israel for their access to electricity, telecoms, and internet routing. Israel has weaponized this dependence in Gaza by deliberately causing blackouts that have left Palestinians cut off from communicating with each other or with the outside world. The relentless bombing campaign has also destroyed or severely crippled any remaining communication infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even when Palestinians use regular communication methods, their conversations and messages can be monitored and recorded, leaving them exposed to surveillance and potential targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The basic human right to communicate freely, and without interruption, has been denied to the Palestinian people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The solution&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bitchat lets you keep messaging even when the internet or power is down. It connects phones directly through Bluetooth, and each phone helps pass messages along, allowing communication to stretch much farther than just your immediate area. Everything is fully encrypted so your conversations stay private.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you do have internet or cell service, Bitchat can send your messages anywhere in the world using a network of relays. There is no central server that stores any of your data. You don’t need to create an account, share your phone number or email, or even have a SIM card to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Staying connected when all else fails&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bitchat is an Israel-proof messaging alternative that continues to work even when traditional networks are shut down. The app also has “Geohash” channels that allows users to join location-based chats, so Palestinians can stay connected to their neighbors down the street or to the larger community in cities across the region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This lets Palestinians check on the safety of loved ones, organize and coordinate within their communities, and share critical news and updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Validated by T4P&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;T4P has evaluated the app, testing it in various conditions, and looked at the technology and governance of the application. After this evaluation, T4P recognizes it as a secure and resilient communication tool for Palestinian communities when faced with internet disruptions or outages. In addition, Tech for Palestine community members are among BitChat’s top code contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bitchat has seen a surge in downloads in countries facing civil unrest like Nepal, Indonesia, Côte d'Ivoire, and most recently Madagascar. The Nepali government blocked access to all major social media platforms, forcing civilians to search for alternative methods of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WhatsApp is known to expose private data, potentially to Israel – and these breaches have been used to target Palestinians. Communicating via WhatsApp or social media presents the risk of exposing private data, limiting free expression, and undermining user privacy. BitChat does not have the same vulnerabilities and does not allow Meta to help Israel surveil Palestinians.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get started&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can start using Bitchat easily, without even creating an account. To start, download the app from the App Store or Google Play store.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once installed, the first thing you should do is change the default @anon username at the top. Click on it to change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The blue #mesh channel in the top right corner will indicate that you are active on your local bluetooth network. Next to it you will see an icon with the number of users connected within your network. Click on the icon and begin private conversations with users from the list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recommend confirming your friends’ and family members’ usernames in person when possible. This helps make sure you’re talking to the right people and avoids confusion or impersonation. Once you’ve confirmed someone’s identity, you can start messaging them privately. You can also “favorite” them so they’re easy to find later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Begin messaging by using the “type a message…” box. Type in a forward slash / to open the menu for additional commands and options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you click on the blue #mesh channel on the top right it will open the various location channels available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;#mesh: The mesh channel is your local bluetooth network that extends as far as the number of connected devices using Bitchat. So the more users with the ability to relay over distance, the larger the network. This is the channel that will allow you to communicate when all other networks are down.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Location channels: You will see default channel names for your block, neighborhood, city, province, and region. These work best when connected to the internet.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;#Geohash: the geohash channel is a custom channel that you can start to connect with your immediate family or local groups. Type in a name for your channel and click teleport. Users within your network can then join it.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Helpful tips:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It is encouraged to clear your messages with the command “/c” on a regular basis. This is good practice in the scenario where your phone is confiscated. Messages are only accessible on device as Bitchat has no central servers. If you delete the messages, they aren’t accessible anywhere.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Gaza Online provides renewable eSIMs to restore internet access across Gaza, helping people stay connected and access essential services. Paired with Bitchat, it can help communication continue even when networks are down.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download Bitchat today and see additional tools that Tech for Palestine has been working on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stay connected, stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Much of the developer world is familiar with the AWS outage in &lt;code&gt;us-east-1&lt;/code&gt; that occurred on October 20th due to a race condition bug inside a DNS management service. The backlog of events we needed to process from that outage on the 20th stretched our system to the limits, and so we decided to increase our headroom for event handling throughput. When we attempted that infrastructure upgrade on October 23rd, we ran into yet another race condition bug in Aurora RDS. This is the story of how we figured out it was an AWS bug (later confirmed by AWS) and what we learned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Background&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Hightouch Events product enables organizations to gather and centralize user behavioral data such as page views, clicks, and purchases. Customers can setup syncs to load events into a cloud data warehouse for analytics or stream them directly to marketing, operational, and analytics tools to support real-time personalization use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the portion of Hightouch’s architecture dedicated to our events system:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hightouch events system architecture&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our system scales on three levers: Kubernetes clusters that contain event collectors and batch workers, Kafka for event processing, and Postgres as our virtual queue metadata store.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When our pagers went off during the AWS outage on the 20th, we observed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Services were unable to connect to Kafka brokers managed by AWS MSK.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Services struggled to autoscale because we couldn’t provision new EC2 nodes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Customer functions for realtime data transformation were unavailable due to AWS STS errors, which caused our retry queues to balloon in size.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kafka’s durability meant that no events were dropped once they were accepted by the collectors, but there was a massive backlog to process. Syncs with consistently high traffic or with enrichments that needed to call slower 3rd party services took longer to catch up and were testing the limits of our (small) Postgres instance’s ability to act as a queue for the batch metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an aside, at Hightouch, we start with Postgres where we can. Postgres queues serve our non-events architecture well at ~1M syncs/day and for events scaled to 500K events per second at ~1s end-to-end latency on a small Aurora instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After observing the events on the 20th, We wanted to upsize the DB to give us more headroom. Given that Aurora supports fast failovers for scaling up instances, we decided to proceed with an upgrade on Oct 23rd without a scheduled maintenance window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;AWS Aurora RDS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The central datastore for real-time streaming and warehouse delivery of customer events uses Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aurora's architecture differs from traditional PostgreSQL in a crucial way: it separates compute from storage. An Aurora cluster consists of:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One primary writer instance that handles all write operations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multiple read replica instances that handle read-only queries&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A shared storage layer that all instances access, automatically replicated across multiple availability zones&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This architecture enables fast failovers and efficient read scaling, but as we'd discover, it also introduces unique failure modes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A failover is the process of promoting a read replica to become the new primary writer - typically done automatically when the primary fails, or manually triggered for maintenance operations like ours. When you trigger a failover in the AWS console:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Aurora designates a read replica as the new primary&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The storage layer grants write privileges to the new primary&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The cluster endpoint points to the new writer&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The old primary becomes a read replica (if it's still healthy)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The diagram below explains how Hightouch Events uses Aurora.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How Hightouch Events uses Aurora&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Plan&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was our upgrade plan:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Add another read replica (instance #3) to maintain read capacity during the upgrade.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Upgrade the existing reader (instance #2) to the target size and give it the highest failover priority.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Trigger a failover to promote instance #2 as the new writer (expected downtime less than 15s, handled gracefully by our backend).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Upgrade the old writer (instance #1) to match the size and make it a reader.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Remove the temporary extra reader (instance #3).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AWS docs supported this approach and we had already tested the process successfully in a staging environment while performing a load test, so we were confident in the correctness of the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Upgrade Attempt&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At 16:39 EDT on October 23, 2025, we triggered the failover to the newly-upgraded instance #2. The AWS Console showed the typical progression: parameter adjustments, instance restarts, the usual status updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the page refreshed. Instance #1 - the original writer was still the primary. The failover had reversed itself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to AWS everything was healthy. The cluster appeared healthy across the board. But our backend services couldn't execute write queries. Restarting the services cleared the errors and restored normal operation, but the upgrade had failed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We tried again at 16:43. Same result: brief promotion followed by immediate reversal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two failed failovers in five minutes. Nothing else had changed - no code updates, no unusual queries, no traffic spikes. We had successfully tested this exact procedure in a staging environment under load earlier in the day. We checked our process to see if we had made any mistakes. We searched online to see if anyone else had encountered this issue but found nothing. Nothing obvious could explain why Aurora was refusing to complete the failover in this cluster. We were perplexed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Investigation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We first checked database metrics for anything unusual. There was a spike in connection count, network traffic, and commit throughput to the read replica (instance #2) during the failover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The higher commit throughput could have been due to replication or the execution of write queries. The other two metrics simply indicated a higher query volume.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We checked the read query traffic from the app (graph below), and found that there was no change during this period. This told us the extra traffic to instance #2 came from our backend services which are supposed to connect to the writer instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Query traffic from the Hightouch app&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we looked at the backend application logs, we found this error -&lt;code&gt;DatabaseError: cannot execute UPDATE in a read-only transaction&lt;/code&gt; in some pods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Backend application logs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our services do not connect directly to the writer instance, but rather to a cluster endpoint which points to the writer. This could mean one of 3 things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The pods did not get the signal that the writer had changed - i.e. the cluster did not terminate the connection.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The cluster endpoint incorrectly pointed to a reader instance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The pod was connected to the writer, but the write operation was rejected at runtime.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We did not find any evidence supporting or disproving #1 in the application logs. We had a strong suspicion it was either #2 or #3. We downloaded the database logs to take a closer look and found something interesting. In both the promoted reader and the original writer, we found the same sequence of logs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;2025-10-23 20:38:58 UTC::@:[569]:LOG:  starting PostgreSQL...
...
...
...
LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
LOG:  server process (PID 799) was terminated by signal 9: Killed
DETAIL:  Failed process was running: &amp;lt;write query from backend application&amp;gt;
LOG:  terminating any other active server processes
FATAL:  Can't handle storage runtime process crash
LOG:  database system is shut down
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This led us to a hypothesis:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the failover window, Aurora briefly allowed both instances to process writes. The distributed storage layer rejected the concurrent write operations, causing both instances to crash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We expect Aurora’s failover orchestration to do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Stop accepting new writes. Clients can expect connection errors until the failover completes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Finish processing in-flight write requests.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Demote the writer and simultaneously promote the reader.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Accept new write requests on the new writer.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was clearly a race condition between steps 3 &amp;amp; 4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Testing the Hypothesis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To validate the theory, we performed a controlled failover attempt. This time:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We scaled down all services that write to the database&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We triggered the failover again&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We monitored for storage runtime crashes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By eliminating concurrent writes, the failover completed successfully. This strongly reinforced the race-condition hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;AWS Confirms the Root Cause&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We escalated the findings and log patterns to AWS. After an internal review, AWS confirmed that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The root cause was due to an internal signaling issue in the demotion process of the old writer, resulting in the writer being unchanged after the failover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They also confirmed that there was nothing unique about our configuration or usage that would trigger the bug. The conditions that caused it were not under our control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AWS has indicated a fix is on their roadmap, but as of now, the recommended mitigation aligns with our solution: use Aurora’s Failover feature on an as-needed basis and ensure that no writes are executed against the DB during the failover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Final State&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the race condition understood and mitigated, we:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Successfully upsized the cluster in &lt;code&gt;us-east-1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Updated our internal playbooks to pause writers before an intentional failover&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Added monitoring to detect any unexpected writer role advertisement flips&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Takeaways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following principles were reinforced during this experience:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prepare for the worst in any migration - you could end up in your desired end state, beginning state, or an in-between state - even for services you trust. Ensuring you’re ready to redirect traffic and handle brief outages in dependencies will minimize downtime.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The importance of good observability cannot be emphasized enough. The “brief writer advertisement” was only detectable because we were monitoring queries to each instance in Datadog and had access to database logs in RDS.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;For large scale distributed systems, isolating the impact any single component can have on the system can help both uptime and maintenance. It helps a lot if the design allows for such events without completely shutting down the system.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Test setups are not always representative of production environments. Even though we practiced the upgrade process during a load test in a staging region, we could not reproduce the exact conditions that caused the race condition in Aurora. AWS confirmed that there was nothing specific about our traffic pattern that would trigger it.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Minisforum MS-R1 uses the same Cix CD8180 Arm SoC as the Orion O6 I reviewed earlier this year. But everything else about this thing is different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What this thing should be, is a box that runs Linux and can compete with at least an Apple M1 Mac mini, or a mid-range Mini PC. But what we got... is something different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Video&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hate reading? I also published a video on the MS-R1 on my YouTube channel. Watch it here, or scroll on past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hardware overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's get started with the hardware. At first glance, it looks great!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have a 12 core Arm CPU with a Mali G720 iGPU. There's a full-size PCIe slot, NVMe storage, WiFi 6E, and a ton of ports on the front and back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have a grand total of 9 USB ports, with 2 of them Type C with DisplayPort 1.4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's HDMI, dual 10 Gbps NICs (Realtek RTL8127), and even an old fashioned audio combo jack, so you can plug in a headset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It looks great on my desk, it's quiet, it uses a 19V 180W power adapter (which is a bit chunky, but par for the course with Minisforum PCs), and overall, the hardware is some of the nicest of any Arm system, outside Apple's walled garden.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the way you get inside is simple: press a little button and slide the chassis out of the shell (see photo above).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It came with adapters for a U.2 drive (see above) or a second M.2 drive, which replace the built-in Mediatek WiFi card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yes, the unit I'm testing is a review unit sent by Minisforum. They did not pay me to test the machine, write this blog post, nor did they have any input into its contents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Cix SoC - iGPU and a Big/Medium/Little Arm CPU&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, let's dive into why this machine puzzles me, starting with the iGPU. Using Minisforum's default Debian 12 install, I could run &lt;code&gt;glmark2&lt;/code&gt;, and it performed well, scoring 6322, far above something like a Raspberry Pi 5 (which got 1935).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Vulkan support was iffy. &lt;code&gt;vulkaninfo&lt;/code&gt; Segfaulted, and &lt;code&gt;vkmark&lt;/code&gt; wouldn't run at all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But GravityMark did. And while the G720 won't bring home any awards, it's about on par with the Adreno 750 in Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 cx Gen 3.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's the chip Microsoft used in their 'Project Volterra' 2023 Windows Arm Dev Kit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that's not the only similarity between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Geekbench 6 scores were also pretty close, coming in at 1336 single core, and 6773 multicore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That soundly beats SBCs like the Pi 5 or a Rockchip. But it's still well under Apple's four-year-old M1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other benchmarks, this thing is all over the place. I have two theories about that, which I'll get to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in real-world use, it does feel fast. At least, faster than any Arm SBC. You can actually watch 4K video on YouTube while you do other things, which is kind-of a novelty on anything that's not Qualcomm or Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More testing revealed some oddities, though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider my Top500 High Performance Linpack benchmark. This is a massive CPU stress test, great for testing memory access, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I played around with 4 cores, 8 cores, all 12 cores, and even limited the amount of RAM I was testing, because the results I was getting were confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, after some help from GitHub user @volyrique, we found the Cix P1 SoC is affected by the same BLIS issue other chips like the Nvidia GB10 'Superchip' and cloud chips using Neoverse N2 CPU cores run into: Poor DGEMM performance for armsve build on Neoverse N2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're diving a bit deep here, but with newer SVE technology (vs. Arm's more traditional NEON 128 bit SIMD), chips can use arbitrary vector lengths. The BLIS library optimizes newer chips with an &lt;code&gt;armsve&lt;/code&gt; configuration, which assumes 256+ bit vector lengths, and is not optimized at all for 128-bit vector lengths (used by the Cix P1 in the Orion O6 and Minisforum MS-R1).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All that out of the way, I have deleted the section of the video embedded above covering HPL entirely, and have updated my benchmark graphs below:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MS-R1 with it's 64 GB of RAM edged out my Orion O6 (I have the 16 GB model...), though it is less than half as performant as the M4 Mac mini.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not a bad showing, overall, and after adjusting the HPL configuration to account for the instruction set mismatch, I was able to get a score almost triple that of the fastest small Arm SBCs'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Energy efficiency is a step down, though—it's not the worst, and certainly, under load, it is better than most Intel/AMD systems:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the efficiency story is much worse considering the idle power draw:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unless you are running large workloads constantly, this machine will end up using far more energy than other Arm solutions (especially Apple's M-series Macs), due to the high idle power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But why is it so high? This is a graph of core to core memory latency, showing how fast it is for different CPU cores to share memory on the system. Honestly, this isn't horrible, especially when I pair it with raw memory access speed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MS-R1's RAM is pretty fast (though notably slower than the O6, which directly impacts performance with tasks like AI inference).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I think the strange CPU core layout is causing power problems; Radxa and Minisforum both told me Cix is working on power draw, and enabling features like ASPM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems like for stability, and to keep memory access working core to core, with the big.medium.little CPU core layout, Cix wants to keep the chip powered up pretty high. 14 to 17 watts idle is beyond even modern Intel and AMD!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For networking, the onboard NICs provide a full 10 gigs, and the built-in WiFi 6E was good for a gigabit on my network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And with 64 gigs of RAM, one thing this box could excel at compared to an SBC is local AI, even if it's just on the CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ran a bunch of different models that would fit in the memory, and here are those results:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is one place where it actually underperforms the older Orion O6 with the same CPU, which is directly related to the slower RAM speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Efficiency&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The performance inconsistency is puzzling, but the power consumption is really what hurts the most—that's an area Arm is supposed to shine in. But it goes to show you, CPU core architecture and even process nodes aren't everything when it comes to effiency. Design matters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple's M-series puts everything to shame, but even taking that out of the mix, it's not quite what I'd expect from 2025 Arm CPU design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite all that, it's quiet and the fans keep it cool. The performance profile ramps up the fans to 100%, but that didn't make much difference in real-world performance except making it about 50 dBa from a foot away instead of 40 dBa in the normal profile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dedicated GPU Upgrade&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're thinking about loading up AI models, or even modest gaming, a dedicated GPU will get you a lot further than the iGPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minisforum added ventilation holes across the entire top, so a modded GPU like the Abovetop RTX A2000, with 8 gigs of VRAM, will fit and get adequate cooling. Similar to older MS-** Minisforum workstations, this machine only fits half-height single-slot PCI Express cards, and ones that are not too long at that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Installation is easy, though finicky due to the tight spaces. You unscrew and pull a small retention clip out, remove the slot cover, and fit the new card. It rests on a small foam spacer to isolate the card from the motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Booting the computer back up, I saw the card using &lt;code&gt;lspci&lt;/code&gt;, so Linux can see it. But I wasn't able to install the drivers on the Debian 12 OS image shipped with the machine. I also tried an Intel Arc A310 ECO, a lower-specced and smaller single-slot card, but that wasn't even recognized when I ran &lt;code&gt;lspci&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the Intel card, it's probably just a signaling issue, though—I'm not going to hold it against the MS-R1 since I've had issues with the A310 ECO on other systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;BIOS detour&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'll get back to A2000 testing, but these experiments took me on a detour into the BIOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are settings for USB, RAM, power on behavior, and a lot more. It's pretty complete, but I still see a lot of things labeled 'Beta', so keep that in mind if you buy one of these things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing I tested that didn't work is the AC Power Loss setting. You're supposed to be able to tell it to turn on when power is restored—that's great for something like a homelab. But the BIOS setting didn't do anything. I remembered seeing a hardware switch on the board, though, and sure enough! That's how you actually control the AC power loss setting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Switching to Ubuntu&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting back to the A2000, I decided to switch gears and try Ubuntu from an Arm ISO install via USB flash drive. The process was easy enough (I didn't have to change anything in the BIOS), and Ubuntu installed without a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The A2000's drivers were automatically installed, and I was off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI is obviously faster on the GPU (total system power draw was around 94W):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And GravityMark, a good proxy for how games will run on a given GPU, ran fine too, increasing the score over the iGPU from 3,037 to 16,679.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having a full PCI Express slot in here is nice. Coupled with the extra included U.2 and M.2 adapters, it's clear Minisforum thinks of this thing as a good homelab box. They even published guides for installing Proxmox (a community maintained version) and Jellyfin with iGPU acceleration. Considering expansion-options-per-cubic meter, this has all other Arm machines beat, including the Mac mini.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Honestly, this works fine as an Arm desktop, certainly better than any SBC. But Intel and AMD exist, and so does Apple, for that matter, and that makes this a bad value where it stands today, in the $500-600 range. Unless you're an Arm enthusiast, you should save some money and get a different mini PC—even one of Minisforum's other MS-series desktops. Or if you can afford $600 bucks, buy the best value Arm desktop on the market, the M4 Mac mini. Of course, that thing can't run bare metal Linux, so take that into account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like that it exists. And I like that Cix and Minisforum are trying to shake up the Arm desktop market a bit. But it's still half-baked:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can performance and power issues be fixed in firmware?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Will they get all the drivers mainlined so all features work in every Linux distro?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Windows can run on here, but will Nvidia ever release GPU drivers for Windows on Arm?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure. But I will try gaming in Linux on here soon, and some other tests. So make sure you follow this blog's RSS feed or subscribe over on YouTube, if you want to follow along!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can buy the Minisforum MS-R1 from Minisforum's online store, starting around $500 at the time of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Comments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just wanted to note after some discussion over in the sbc-reviews issue for the MS-R1, I'm re-running my HPL top500 benchmark with the correct optimizations for the Cix CPU and will update the HPL benchmark and efficiency graphs in the post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minis Forum is advertising Proxmox support for virtualization. All of the builds I have seen previously for this are unsupported or custom. It appears there is a build based on Debian ARM64? Does it work? Is it viable? I see people running routing software (like OpenWRT) on these VM's.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their PVE install guide for the MS-R1 seems to use the pxvirt fork of Proxmox targeting Arm and LoongArch architectures. It's not an officially supported way to get Proxmox going, but it does work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do note that those "Abovetop" cards are not modified A2000s they are actually mobile A2000s. Desktop A2000s have either 6GB or 12GB of VRAM and the dual slot cooler that can infact be modified by nerdwares all copper single slot cooler. The Desktop cards also have 4 mini Displayports and not the more standard 1 DP 1 HDMI that you would see on gaming cards. There is also the terrible AMD RX 6400 that would fit in these but no-one should ever use a 4GB GPU in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minisforum proudly advertises ECC support for this. Have you done any testing on that?&lt;lb/&gt; It's going to reduce performance, Minisforum says it's 1/8, so the best case is 12.5% reduction in memory bound workloads and none in compute bound workloads, though it's probably much worse.&lt;lb/&gt; Anandtech (RIP) tested Intel's in-band ECC, which is 1/32, and found that it reduced performance by 0% to 10% in CPU tests, which isn't that bad, but in iGPU tests performance was reduced by 20% to 30%, which is pretty awful. Also the energy efficiency was reduced by similar amounts.&lt;lb/&gt; (Couldn't add a link, so just search for "Anandtech in-band ECC" and you should find the article)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lack of mainline support in the kernel AND in uboot/edk2 is the primary reason I can't take the arm market seriously. It's firmly in the hobby-fiddling space, no matter how much I want it to be otherwise. Looks like RISC-V isn't doing anything differently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems like Cix is trying—but like with most Arm vendors, the mainline efforts begin after real world products are already shipping, instead of before. So you end up with at least a 1-2 year lag time before even the basic parts are in a bleeding edge kernel...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Structured outputs on the Claude Developer Platform&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Guarantee responses match your JSON schemas and tool definitions with structured outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Guarantee responses match your JSON schemas and tool definitions with structured outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Claude Developer Platform now supports structured outputs for Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.1. Available in public beta, this feature ensures API responses always match your specified JSON schemas or tool definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With structured outputs, developers can eliminate schema-related parsing errors and failed tool calls by ensuring that Claude's responses conform to a defined schemaâwhether you're extracting data from images, orchestrating agents, or integrating with external APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For developers building applications and agents in production, a single error in data formatting can cause cascading failures. Structured outputs solves this by guaranteeing your response matches the exact structure you define, without any impact to model performance. This makes Claude dependable for applications and agents where accuracy is critical, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Structured outputs can be used two ways: with JSON or tools. When used with JSON, you provide your schema definition in the API request. For tools, you define your tool specifications, and Claude's output conforms to those tool definitions automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The end result is a reliable output, reduced retries, and a simplified codebase that no longer needs failover logic or complex error handling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenRouter provides 4M+ developers access to all major AI models through a single, unified interface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Structured outputs have become a really valuable part of the agentic AI stack. Agents constantly ingest and produce structured data, so Anthropicâs structured outputs close a real gap for developers. Agent workflows run reliably, every time, and teams can focus on their customers rather than debugging tool calls,â said Chris Clark, COO, OpenRouter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Structured outputs is now available in public beta for Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.1 on the Claude Developer Platform, with support for Haiku 4.5 coming soon. Explore our documentation for supported JSON schema types, implementation examples, and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Genergo: an Italian Company Builds the World’s First Known Propellantless Space-propulsion System, Flight-tested and Validated On Orbit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Genergo, an Italian deep-tech company based in Como, comes out of stealth and unveils an innovative electromagnetic space-propulsion system that uses no propellant, successfully flight-tested and validated across three space missions and protected by a portfolio of granted international patents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operational satellites equipped with propulsion carry propellant on board to perform orbital maneuvers, maintain position, and, in some cases, execute end-of-life atmospheric re-entry. Propellant takes up volume and adds mass - often further increased by the hardware required to manage it (pressurized tanks, control valves, feed lines) - introduces operational risks (leaks, explosions), and is, by definition, a finite resource. Once depleted, the spacecraft is no longer maneuverable and the mission ends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Genergo’s system generates thrust without using any propellant and without expelling reaction mass, by directly converting electrical energy into thrust through controlled electromagnetic impulses. To the company’s knowledge, it is the first space-propulsion system worldwide capable of operating without propellant, flight-tested and validated on orbit, and it represents a clear discontinuity from current standards. By design, the technology is scalable and operates with a modest power requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The system also exhibits a highly sustainable profile: it uses no hazardous or toxic materials, requires no pressurized components to be stored on board, and introduces no risk of contaminating the space environment—either during operations or upon atmospheric re-entry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After passing, on the first attempt and within a few months, all mission launch-qualification tests to the industry’s most stringent standards, the technology accumulated more than 700 hours of on-orbit operation across three missions launched between 2022 and 2023. The missions—still operational—were launched on SpaceX Falcon 9 as part of the Transporter rideshare campaigns (Transporter-5, -6 and -9) and hosted on D-Orbit’s ION Satellite Carrier spacecraft (platforms designed by the Italian company based in Fino Mornasco, Como, also used to carry and qualify emerging technologies in space). Over the past two years, multiple on-orbit activation cycles have continued alongside data analysis and characterization activities; additional tests are planned to further characterize the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The campaigns confirmed system functionality in real space conditions, bringing the technology to a maturity level equivalent to TRL 7–8 (Technology Readiness Level). As additional confirmation of the results, several long-duration tests were conducted in which it was observed, objectively and repeatedly, that motor activation produced a measurable acceleration or deceleration of the host spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The performance achieved to date by the flight-tested prototypes is already aligned with market requirements for specific mission profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several Italian organizations contributed to the project, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB) at Politecnico di Milano, for laboratory bench measurements;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Department of Aerospace Science and Technology (DAER) at Politecnico di Milano, which developed the spacecraft dynamics model for the on-orbit analysis of the first mission and produced the motor electromagnetic-emissions report required during preliminary qualification for on-orbit acceptance;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An independent company specializing in high-technology solutions, which validated the in-orbit results using a broad set of methodological approaches, ensuring the robustness and repeatability of the observed performance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Genergo’s technology opens new perspectives for space missions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inaddition to further on-orbit campaigns planned forcontinued development, the first commercial application will be controlled deorbit—namely, lowering a satellite’s orbit to guide atmospheric re-entry and ensure burn-up at the end of the mission.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Portaits featured in this story were taken at Peabody High School and Trenton Elementary School in Trenton, Tennessee.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;November 4, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Granny won me over with the government cheese. As a child, maybe 4 or 5 years old, when I’d visit her on occasional Sundays in Blue Ridge, Georgia, she’d slice me off a little treat — an orange rectangle from a brown cardboard box in the refrigerator. We would sit around her kitchen table, where she held court with my aunts by telling stories and making plans for canning vegetables. Sometimes the aunts smoked cigarettes, which they’d quickly stamp out when my preacher-grandfather came around the corner. Nevermind that my snack was processed and inexpensive, a generic type of Velveeta. In those days at Granny’s, sitting with my cheese and the grown-ups in our rural mountain town, I might as well have been tasting Camembert on the banks of the Seine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevermind, too, the Mason jars of homemade soup on her shelves, a kaleidoscope of summer’s bounty — tomatoes, okra, corn — put up and waiting to take the chill off colder days. Nevermind the freshly baked pound cakes under Tupperware domes like trophies, which she kept atop the washing machine, also in the kitchen, or the biscuits she could whip up with nary a measuring device or recipe. I would learn to appreciate all those later. As a kid, the cheese wowed me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My mother tried to explain that it was a commodity provided by government funding for the school cafeteria where my grandmother worked. “Maybe you shouldn’t mention the cheese,” Mom said recently, when I told her about writing this story. She has a good point. Folks don’t like to hear the words processed and school food in the same sentence. And Mom wouldn’t want people to think Granny was somehow taking advantage of the system. But don’t worry, Mom. The cheese is part of the point. I want people to know how Granny believed in wasting nothing, in sharing everything. In cooking from scratch as often as possible but also making do with every resource provided to her. And, yes, she sometimes had leftover cheese at home, but she also got in trouble for sneaking extra food into the paper sacks of kids without lunch money or even handing food out the back of the lunchroom screen door. “Situational ethics,” my cousin Susie calls it. I’d come to understand all that later. But as a kid, I just knew Granny’s job was cool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beulah Culpepper started work as an assistant lunch lady at Blue Ridge Elementary School in 1950 at age 43. That’s after she’d had eight kids of her own, whom she raised by home cooking, pickling, canning, and keeping chickens. She married young, after a rough childhood. My grandparents held a small ceremony on the railroad tracks outside the textile plant where they’d met. My grandfather called her Sunshine. And, for the outsized proportion of his noggin, she called him Fathead. She never learned to drive, and she only had a third-grade education. But when my father, her youngest, started school, she decided she was going with him. “We walked to school together every morning,” Dad told me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She worked her way to manager at the cafeteria, retiring in the early 1980s. Over the course of her tenure, her education level sometimes couldn’t keep up with her natural-born smarts, so she’d ask for my aunt’s help on the weekends to work out the financial parts of her menus. She became known for her vegetable soups, yeast rolls, and peanut butter cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mom remembers Granny’s frustration as, over time, guidelines and budgets added complicated layers to the work and hampered the scratch cooking she preferred. The government cheese went into big batches of creamy macaroni served alongside crisp, fried fish and scoops of turnip greens. She’d sneak in bacon grease from home to flavor green beans. Sadly, her own savory cornbread eventually gave way to a quicker and sweeter mix at school. My cousin Margaret remembers a student asking her: “Mrs. Culpepper, is this cornbread — or just bad cake?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;County employees would sometimes join the students for lunch as if she were running a restaurant. “She had a name county-wide for the meals she served,” says Gene Crawford, a columnist for the local newspaper who taught at the school in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sheila Robinson (age 56; 7 years in the cafeteria; from St. Louis, Missouri)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dad remembers when the lunchroom was just an old clapboard structure with wooden floors. Students who brought their lunch, often because they couldn’t afford the cafeteria meal, sat on benches along the perimeter. Granny tried to be discreet in making sure those kids had plenty. “What have you got to eat today?” Dad remembers her asking, peeking into their bags and sometimes finding nothing but a leftover biscuit. “She would give them anything she could get her hands on,” he says. She left out extra bowls of grits and gravy or commodity foods for students to share. At least once, the principal scolded her for giving away food for free. “Do I make money for this lunchroom?” she asked him. Yes. “Do I lose money for this lunchroom?” No. “Well, don’t you ever get on to me again for giving those kids food,” my mother remembers Granny recounting. “No kid will ever leave this lunchroom hungry.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But before we go too far: a warning. If you’re looking for a dreamy, idyllic grandma story where I stand at her elbow and learn recipes, this ain’t it. I somehow don’t have a single recipe from Granny, even if she was the best cook I’ve ever known. But I did learn plenty else from her and felt her love in different ways. I’d sometimes sit with her and her dogs Tico or George while she chewed tobacco and watched Braves games. I remember her feisty attitude, stout build, and strong hands. She would squeeze my upper arms every time I entered her kitchen and compliment me on weight gain (a confusing but comforting message for a teen girl). It took me years to realize how she’d influenced my life as a food writer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In reflecting on her now, I wanted to check in with modern-day heroes of the school lunch line. Even as it feels like our social safety nets are crumbling, I see in these workers a sharp stewardship of resources, a special sort of hospitality, and — despite government red tape and political divides — a deep commitment to community care.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stephanie Dillard at Enterprise City Schools in South Alabama likes to sit down for lunch with the kids and hear their thoughts on the food. She’s a longtime board member and newly elected president of the School Nutrition Association, a nonprofit organization of more than 50,000 lunch ladies (and fellas) and others interested in school nutrition. But day to day, you’ll find Dillard filling in for kitchen staff, crunching budget numbers, and working to get fresh, locally grown foods onto kids’ plates. Last year that meant satsumas from a neighboring county to serve with roasted chicken and broccoli. It meant local strawberries and even a special shrimp bowl with the region’s beloved Conecuh sausage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The greatest joy is just knowing that we are feeding children healthy meals. So many families rely on us daily,” Dillard says. “I just want to continue to see that all children have equal access to the meals.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Dillard is clear about the challenges. “Number one, we need more funding, so we can increase scratch cooking and more farm-to-school programs,” she says. “With the MAHA movement, they’re pushing, obviously, more scratch cooking, and that’s great and grand. I have no problem with less processed foods in schools, but we need the funding to be able to support it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To be sure, the stew of school food has long been mixed with politics and money. The National School Lunch Act, which passed in 1946, four years before my grandmother started cafeteria work, had its roots in an ecosystem of competing interests, says Marcus Weaver-Hightower, author of Unpacking School Lunch: Understanding the Hidden Politics of School Food. Over the years, politicians have argued over funding cuts, regulations, and what makes food healthy — along with who gets to set the menu.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of late, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. seems to champion some of the healthier standards that conservatives once criticized, and partly rolled back, when the same ideas were espoused by then-First Lady Michelle Obama’s Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act campaign. (The opening lines of a 2014 Heritage Foundation article: “Michelle Obama thinks she knows what your children should eat.”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kennedy has advocated for healthier school food even as the Trump administration has cut millions in funding that would help make that possible, including eliminating the Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program and Patrick Leahy Farm to School Grants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Deloris Morgan “The babies make you feel young.” (age 63; 8 years in the cafeteria; from Trenton)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Caryn Needham “I love seeing the children every day.” (age 44; 4 years in the cafeteria; came to Trenton from California)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Samantha Goyret and Caroline Ideus, co-directors of the Northwest Tennessee Local Food Network, had a statewide farm-to-school plan ready to implement — at least until the funding was cut.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goyret and Ideus, who produce a guide to local farmers and producers and manage a West Tennessee farmers market, began serving as vital liaisons between farmers and school nutrition directors several years ago. They knew both groups were overworked, with little time to make connections. Goyret and Ideus also helped arrange transportation and delivery. Local farmers earned market values for their products while schools amped up nutrition in ways that appealed to kids. “It’s like, OK, we’re finally finding solutions to these problems,” Goyret says. “Then the government’s like, No, we’re not going to fund you anymore. So, good luck. Just try to figure it out on your own.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lisa Seiber-Garland, school nutrition director for the Trenton Special School District in Trenton, Tennessee, says students loved items like local butter lettuce and purple hull peas obtained through a federal grant. She learned that at least one student convinced her mother to visit a nearby farm for the tender leaves she had tasted atop her school burger. “It was so cool,” Seiber-Garland says. “Grants like that provide access for kids to have things they wouldn’t normally have. With that grant, we were also able to provide fresh ground beef. … We’re still doing it, but not to the extent with the grant. It was such a blessing I didn’t want to stop. I told my farmers I will do what I can to still buy. One had planted his strawberries and his watermelons and everything to meet what we needed in the school for that year. And then we lost the grant.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goyret confirms that, indeed, seeds had been planted, orders had been placed. “With every administration, there’s always changes,” she says. “But what’s different about this administration is that they are taking away already allocated funds — funds allocated by the Congress. That should be 100 percent illegal.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, per usual, school nutrition directors are making do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Lisa Seiber-Garland “They’re gonna be fed. We'll find a way.” (age 60; 20-plus years in the cafeteria; from Trenton)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Pat Morgan (age 67; 5 years in the cafeteria, from Trenton)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dillard says the federal funding cuts will hurt local farmers in Alabama, but her state offers rebates when she serves Alabama-grown foods. “They direct us and help me find the farmers that have the ability to grow enough for our district,” she says. “So I’m very lucky in that aspect. As soon as we find something new or new farmers willing to grow for us, we jump on that.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Likewise, in Tennessee, Seiber-Garland works through a different grant specifically for elementary students to provide snacks of fresh fruit and vegetables paired with nutritional education. “The kids are the joy for sure. Watching them and their excitement when there’s something they really like,” she says, of offering students new tastes as well as standbys like peaches, grapes, berries, pepper strips, and carrots. A student’s mother came up to her at the cafeteria and said, “You’re the reason my daughter likes raspberries.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2022, California became the first of a half dozen or so states to offer free school meals to all students, regardless of family income. Dillard supports free meals for all students with an emphatic, “Yes, yes, yes!” Food should not be based on income, she says: “It should be part of the school day. Your transportation is of no charge to students. School books are no charge to students. School lunch should be of no charge to students. … It’s just the right thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, most schools must provide a mix of fee-based and subsidized free and reduced-price meals. Some communities with high percentages of families on SNAP and enrolled in Medicaid automatically qualify for the USDA’s Community Eligibility Provision, which authorizes free meals for all students in the district. But, as the “Big Beautiful Bill” slashes both SNAP and Medicaid, it will surely reverberate through school lunchrooms too. “It’s going to be a huge burden for a lot of families,” says Weaver-Hightower. “The number of problems I think [free lunches] would solve is a really long list. There’s paperwork, of course. And there’s the shame and stigma that some kids feel. Why would we do that to little 5-year-olds?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Janet Roach “The kids — that’s what I love about the job.” (age 63; 9 years in the cafeteria; from Trenton)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through all of the policy changes, the cafeteria has remained the “heart of our schools,” according to acclaimed chef Alice Waters. In 1995 she founded the Edible Schoolyard Project, an international nonprofit dedicated to promoting organic school gardens, kitchens, and cafeterias. Waters’ new book, A School Food Revolution (October 2025) celebrates this beating heart of public education.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dan Giusti, formerly head chef at world-renowned Noma, is another prominent advocate for school lunches. He left his prestigious role in 2015 to create Brigaid, a company now working with 40 school districts in eight states along with other institutions such as senior centers and prisons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His team has adopted the pragmatic approach long espoused by the professionals in those settings. “We don’t say, This is the food you should serve, or, You shouldn’t serve this food,” he explains. “It is their program and it is their community. Who are we to come from the outside to tell them otherwise? So we come in and ask, What are you trying to achieve with your program?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giusti loves the puzzle — the dynamics and balance of nutrition and taste preference. “I was talking with a food service director, and she uses the statistic that roughly 70 percent of the calories students eat in her district come from the food in the schools. So you have a real responsibility to make sure that food is nutritious. But at the same point you also need to make sure kids want to eat it. … Kids need to eat. Period.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giusti stresses that policies need to be backed up with resources. “It’s amazing to talk about removing processed foods, cooking more from scratch. I have a business based off of that,” he says. “It’s also really hard to do. If we’re going to say to School District XYZ, You can’t use these things anymore, then I hope we’re also going to give them money to buy more equipment and train their staff.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, edicts need to take into account the people who have to implement them, Giusti stresses. “Folks who work in the kitchens get caught in the mix,” he says. “You can feel it on them. They’re just waiting for the next initiative. They’ve maybe been working in these schools for 20, 30 years, and they’ve seen so many initiatives come and go, come and go. They’ve seen people come and go. Superintendents come and go. But they’re still there. Doing this work every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cherie Kelly (age 48; 9 years in the cafeteria; from Ottawa, Illinois)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to my grandmother, Hope North in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, started work at the cafeteria when her son entered school. She’s been in food service ever since, about 27 years. Long enough to see her grandson attend Murfreesboro City Schools, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a recent summer day, she climbed onto a brightly painted old school bus with the words CHOW BUS across its front. Inside, the seats had been reconfigured into booths with tables. About 50 meals sat in cooler bags: penne pasta with tomato-meat sauce, a side of carrots, fruit cups, and milk. The bus was headed for Chariot Pointe Apartments, the first stop of about five that day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We meet people where they are,” says Tori Carr, a school employee who was driving a van that followed the bus, which had been converted into a sort of free book store. Its shelves also carry cleaning supplies, pantry items, and simple toys like glow sticks and coloring pages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;North’s cousin Keith Sneed drives the Chow Bus as well as regular bus routes during the school year. The two make a good team — tough and tender. They run their route every day in the summer heat, bus windows down. North keeps tabs on her people at each stop. She knows their stories and worries. And if they don’t show up for a few days, she’ll be on the case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’d hardly parked at their first location, when a young man in a yellow T-shirt approached the bus. Sneed poked his head out the window. “Man, go get a book!” he said. “You ain’t read a book all summer.” The boy couldn’t help but oblige. Book in hand, he got a fist bump from Sneed as he climbed up the steps for a meal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s not just about the food,” Sneed explained later. “All they want is for you to listen to them.” But, of course, food is important, too. Not all schools can serve summer meals, which leaves many students at risk. And while this school used to have three Chow buses, funded by a USDA grant, they’re now down to one. “If we lose this bus,” Sneed says, “people will be hungry.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Cathy Hill (age 62; 2 years in the cafeteria; from Humboldt, Tennessee, but moved to Trenton)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Carolyn White “The kids keep me active.” (age 64; 4 years in the cafeteria; came here from California)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, my grandmother’s town of Blue Ridge is surrounded by million-dollar vacation homes, its downtown sidewalks lined with art galleries and outfitters selling $6,000 bamboo fly rods. The economic disparity between visitors and full-time residents is vast. Fannin County schools qualify for the Community Eligibility Provision, which allows free meals for all — at least for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Martha Williams, who works as director of nutrition and wellness in Fannin County School District, grew up here and originally returned to teach math. But a cafeteria lunch lady inspired Williams to work in school nutrition when she pulled the teacher aside and pointed out a student who seemed disheveled and kept wearing the same clothes. Williams recognized the insights that can be gleaned from the serving line and how the work goes beyond keeping kids fed to providing stability, routine, and community care.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Williams points to another inspiration, GiGi Thomas, 63, who has worked in school food service for more than two decades. These days one of her duties is serving cookies, kept in an ancient warmer that “probably came over on the Mayflower,” Thomas says with a laugh. She hands students freshly baked cookies on napkins. “I see these kids every day,” she says. Some of them like chocolate chip cookies, others prefer sugar cookies. “It tickles them to death that I kind of remember what they get.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, her cookies were featured in the high school seniors’ graduation video. “If you don’t have the cookies, those kids are devastated,” Thomas says. “That’s all you wanna do is take care of the kids.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over in West Tennessee, Seiber-Garland says she sometimes feels like she has 1,400 kids of her own. If no one shows up for a student on grandparents’ day, she fills in. And she loves running into students outside school, where they’re excited to say, “There’s my lunch lady!” Alumni sometimes share photos of their kids. “They’re so special. Every one of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over her 22 years in the business, Seiber-Garland has served her mother’s recipe for poppyseed chicken as well as old favorites like chicken tetrazzini and spaghetti. “I’ve always said, I want this to be their cafe. I can’t control what goes on at night. But for two-thirds or three-fourths of the day, I can. And I want them to be fed and happy, well, and blessed. They bless me.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She tells of a student who kept trying to save her meal to carry home, because she didn’t have anything to eat there. Seiber-Garland and her staff found a way to provide her with a second meal for the evening. “I also had a parent come tell me to not let her child eat. And I’m like, No ma’am. If she asks to eat in my line, I’m gonna feed her.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seiber-Garland says there are people who donate every year to help pay off lunch balances that have remained unpaid. Recently, she created a “share table” on a red cart with a donated Yeti cooler that helps teach kids about reducing food waste. It’s where students can leave unopened milks or whole food that they don’t want for their classmates to enjoy. She’s also been known to cover lunches out of her own pocket, and her staff has taken up collections, too. “They’re gonna be fed,” she says. “We’ll find a way.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hear in those words the resourcefulness and care of my own grandmother and a guiding phrase she taught my father in standing up for what you believe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Granny would say, “You take your part.” ◊&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Houston, we have a problem: Anthropic Rides an Artificial Wave&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll tip my hat to the new Constitution&lt;lb/&gt;Take a bow for the new revolution&lt;lb/&gt;Smile and grin at the change all around&lt;lb/&gt;Pick up my guitar and play&lt;lb/&gt;Just like yesterday&lt;lb/&gt;Then I’ll get on my knees and pray&lt;lb/&gt;We don’t get fooled again&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out there in the smoking rubble of the fourth estate, it is hard enough to cover cyber cyber. Imagine, then, piling on the AI bullshit. Can anybody cut through the haze? Apparently for the WSJ and the NY Times, the answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yeah, it’s Anthropic again. This time writing a blog-post level document titled “Disrupting the first reported AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign” and getting the major tech press all wound around the axle about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The root of the problem here is that expertise in cyber cyber is rare AND expertise in AI/ML is rare…but expertise in both fields? Not only is it rare, but like hydrogen-7, which has a half-life of about 10^-24 seconds, it disappears pretty fast as both fields progress. Even superstar tech reporters can’t keep everything straight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lets start with the end. What question should the press have asked Anthropic about their latest security story? How about, “which parts of these attacks could ONLY be accomplished with agentic AI?” From our little perch at BIML, it looks like the answer is a resounding none.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we know the ending, lets look at both sides of the beginning. Security first. Unfortunately, brute force, cloud-scale, turnkey software exploit is what has been driving the ransomware cybercrime wave for at least a decade now. All of the offensive security tool technology used by the attackers Anthropic describes is available as open source frameworks, leading experts like Kevin Beaumont to label the whole thing, “vibe usage of open source attack frameworks.” Would existing controls work against this? Apparently not for “a handful” of the thirty companies Anthropic claims were successfully attacked. LOL.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By now those of us old enough to know better than to call ourselves security experts have learned how to approach claims like the ones Anthropic is making skeptically. “Show me the logs,” we yell as we shake our canes in the air. Seriously. Where is the actual evidence? Who has seen it. Do we credulously repeat whatever security vendors tell us as it it is the gods’ honest truth? No we do not. Who was successfully attacked? Did the reporters chase them down? Who was on the list of 30?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI second. It is all too easy to exaggerate claims in today’s superheated AI universe. One of the most trivial (and intellectually lazy) ways to do this is to use anthropomorphic language when we are describing what LLMs do. LLMs don’t “think” or “believe” or “have intentionality” like humans do. (FWIW, Anthropic is very much guilty of this and they are not getting any better.) LLMs do do a great job of role playing though. So dressing one up as a black hat nation state hacker and sending it lumbering off into the klieg lights is easy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So who did it? How do we prove that beyond a reasonable doubt? Hilariously, the real attacks here appear to be asking an LLM to pretend to be a white hat red team member dressed in a Where’s Waldo shirt and weilding a SSRF attack. Wake me up when it’s over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, is this really the “first documented case of a cyberattack largely executed without human intervention at scale”…no, that was the script kiddies in the ’90s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lets be extremely clear here. Machine Learning Security is absolutely critical. We have lots of work to do. So lets ground ourselves in reality and get to it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Building the open source smart glasses operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mentra is building the operating system for smart glasses. Smart glasses will empower humans to be more than ever before. Use cases like subtitles for the deaf, proactive AI that during conversations, and POV streaming enhance our thinking and communication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mentra’s mission is to build universal interfaces between mind and machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re a team of passionate builders in San Francisco and Shenzhen building the world’s best smart glasses. We believe that the best future for computing is open, user-empowering, and cross-compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re sitting on the most transformative technology since the iPhone and we need a Head of Growth to help us tell our story and show the world what smart glasses can do for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Role&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re hiring a Head of Growth to bring smart glasses to millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Success looks like this: Mentra is what people think of when they hear “smart glasses”. Thousands of devs in February building apps on MentraOS. Dozens of companies ordering 10,000s of units by Q2 2024. Viral launch videos online define internet culture. Big content creators use our glasses in their videos to make better content. 100,000 deaf/HoH people in 2026 using Mentra live captions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The opportunity to show humanity that technology can once again be a force of good in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What you’ll do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we’re looking for:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apply if you want to scale the next personal computer to billions of users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mentra is building MentraOS, the open-source OS for smart glasses. It's like Android for smart glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Smart glasses hardware is finally ready, and we're building the software ecosystem to unlock the next personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our team (ex. MIT, Tsinghua, JITX (YCS18), University of Toronto) has been building smart glasses for over 6 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hardware was never ready, but breakthroughs in micro-optoelectronics has give us lightweight, all-day wearable smart glasses and put us on the precipice of the next personal computing revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the software still sucks. The apps still suck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're building MentraOS to change that. It's a fully open source operating system for smart glasses that unlocks this new interface for devs and brings their apps into the hands (and on the faces) of users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not another B2B SaaS. We're going to eat Apple and Google's lunch. Help us architect the OS for the next personal computer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Go Blog&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Go’s Sweet 16&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This past Monday, November 10th, we celebrated the 16th anniversary of Go’s open source release!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We released Go 1.24 in February and Go 1.25 in August, following our now well-established and dependable release cadence. Continuing our mission to build the most productive language platform for building production systems, these releases included new APIs for building robust and reliable software, significant advances in Go’s track record for building secure software, and some serious under-the-hood improvements. Meanwhile, no one can ignore the seismic shifts in our industry brought by generative AI. The Go team is applying its thoughtful and uncompromising mindset to the problems and opportunities of this dynamic space, working to bring Go’s production-ready approach to building robust AI integrations, products, agents, and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Core language and library improvements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First released in Go 1.24 as an experiment and then graduated in Go 1.25, the new &lt;code&gt;testing/synctest&lt;/code&gt; package
significantly simplifies writing tests for concurrent, asynchronous
code. Such code is particularly common in network services,
and is traditionally very hard to test well. The &lt;code&gt;synctest&lt;/code&gt; package works by
virtualizing time itself. It takes tests that used to be slow, flaky, or both,
and makes them easy to rewrite into reliable and nearly instantaneous tests,
often with just a couple extra lines of code. It’s also a great example of Go’s
integrated approach to software development: behind an almost trivial API, the
&lt;code&gt;synctest&lt;/code&gt; package hides a deep integration with the Go runtime and other parts
of the standard library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t the only boost the &lt;code&gt;testing&lt;/code&gt; package got over the past year. The new
&lt;code&gt;testing.B.Loop&lt;/code&gt; API is both easier to use
than the original &lt;code&gt;testing.B.N&lt;/code&gt; API and addresses many of the traditional—and
often invisible!—pitfalls of writing Go benchmarks. The
&lt;code&gt;testing&lt;/code&gt; package also has new APIs that make it easy to
cleanup in tests that use
&lt;code&gt;Context&lt;/code&gt;, and that make it
easy to write to the test’s log.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go and containerization grew up together and work great with each other. Go 1.25 launched container-aware scheduling, making this pairing even stronger. Without developers having to lift a finger, this transparently adjusts the parallelism of Go workloads running in containers, preventing CPU throttling that can impact tail latency and improving Go’s out-of-the-box production-readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go 1.25’s new flight recorder builds on our already powerful execution tracer, enabling deep insights into the dynamic behavior of production systems. While the execution tracer generally collected too much information to be practical in long-running production services, the flight recorder is like a little time machine, allowing a service to snapshot recent events in great detail after something has gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Secure software development&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go continues to strengthen its commitment to secure software development, making significant strides in its native cryptography packages and evolving its standard library for enhanced safety.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go ships with a full suite of native cryptography packages in the standard library, which reached two major milestones over the past year. A security audit conducted by independent security firm Trail of Bits yielded excellent results, with only a single low-severity finding. Furthermore, through a collaborative effort between the Go Security Team and Geomys, these packages achieved CAVP certification, paving the way for full FIPS 140-3 certification. This is a vital development for Go users in certain regulated environments. FIPS 140 compliance, previously a source of friction due to the need for unsupported solutions, will now be seamlessly integrated, addressing concerns related to safety, developer experience, functionality, release velocity, and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Go standard library has continued to evolve to be safe by default and safe by design. For example, the &lt;code&gt;os.Root&lt;/code&gt;
API—added in Go 1.24—enables traversal-resistant file system
access, effectively combating a class of vulnerabilities where an
attacker could manipulate programs into accessing files intended to be
inaccessible. Such vulnerabilities are notoriously challenging to address
without underlying platform and operating system support, and the new
&lt;code&gt;os.Root&lt;/code&gt; API offers a straightforward,
consistent, and portable solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Under-the-hood improvements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to user-visible changes, Go has made significant improvements under the hood over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Go 1.24, we completely redesigned the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;
implementation, building on the latest and greatest ideas in
hash table design. This change is completely transparent, and brings significant
improvements to &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; performance, lower tail latency of &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; operations, and
in some cases even significant memory wins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go 1.25 includes an experimental and significant advancement in Go’s garbage collector called Green Tea. Green Tea reduces garbage collection overhead in many applications by at least 10% and sometimes as much as 40%. It uses a novel algorithm designed for the capabilities and constraints of today’s hardware and opens up a new design space that we’re eagerly exploring. For example, in the forthcoming Go 1.26 release, Green Tea will achieve an additional 10% reduction in garbage collector overhead on hardware that supports AVX-512 vector instructions—something that would have been nigh impossible to take advantage of in the old algorithm. Green Tea will be enabled by default in Go 1.26; users need only upgrade their Go version to benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Furthering the software development stack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go is about far more than the language and standard library. It’s a software development platform, and over the past year, we’ve also made four regular releases of the gopls language server, and have formed partnerships to support emerging new frameworks for agentic applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gopls provides Go support to VS Code and other LSP-powered editors and IDEs. Every release sees a litany of features and improvements to the experience of reading and writing Go code (see the v0.17.0, v0.18.0, v0.19.0, and v0.20.0 release notes for full details, or our new gopls feature documentation!). Some highlights include many new and enhanced analyzers to help developers write more idiomatic and robust Go code; refactoring support for variable extraction, variable inlining, and JSON struct tags; and an experimental built-in server for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that exposes a subset of gopls’ functionality to AI assistants in the form of MCP tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With gopls v0.18.0, we began exploring automatic code modernizers. As Go evolves, every release brings new capabilities and new idioms; new and better ways to do things that Go programmers have been finding other ways to do. Go stands by its compatibility promise—the old way will continue to work in perpetuity—but nevertheless this creates a bifurcation between old idioms and new idioms. Modernizers are static analysis tools that recognize old idioms and suggest faster, more readable, more secure, more modern replacements, and do so with push-button reliability. What &lt;code&gt;gofmt&lt;/code&gt; did for
stylistic consistency, we hope modernizers can do for idiomatic
consistency. We’ve integrated modernizers as IDE suggestions, where they can
help developers not only maintain more consistent coding standards, but where we
believe they will help developers discover new features and keep up with the
state of the art. We believe modernizers can also help AI coding assistants keep
up with the state of the art and combat their proclivity to reinforce outdated
knowledge of the Go language, APIs, and idioms. The upcoming Go 1.26 release
will include a total overhaul of the long-dormant &lt;code&gt;go fix&lt;/code&gt; command to make it
apply the full suite of modernizers in bulk, a return to its pre-Go 1.0
roots.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the end of September, in collaboration with Anthropic and the Go community, we released v1.0.0 of the official Go SDK for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This SDK supports both MCP clients and MCP servers, and underpins the new MCP functionality in gopls. Contributing this work in open source helps empower other areas of the growing open source agentic ecosystem built around Go, such as the recently released Agent Development Kit (ADK) for Go from Google. ADK Go builds on the Go MCP SDK to provide an idiomatic framework for building modular multi-agent applications and systems. The Go MCP SDK and ADK Go demonstrate how Go’s unique strengths in concurrency, performance, and reliability differentiate Go for production AI development and we are expecting more AI workloads to be written in Go in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go has an exciting year ahead of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re working on advancing developer productivity through the brand new &lt;code&gt;go fix&lt;/code&gt;
command, deeper support for AI coding assistants, and ongoing improvements to
gopls and VS Code Go. General availability of the Green Tea garbage collector,
native support for Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) hardware features,
and runtime and standard library support for writing code that scales even
better to massive multicore hardware will continue to align Go with modern
hardware and improve production efficiency. We’re focusing on Go’s “production
stack” libraries and diagnostics, including a massive (and long in the making)
upgrade to &lt;code&gt;encoding/json&lt;/code&gt;, driven by Joe Tsai and people across
the Go community; leaked goroutine
profiling, contributed by
Uber’s Programming Systems team; and many
other improvements to &lt;code&gt;net/http&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unicode&lt;/code&gt;, and other foundational packages.
We’re working to provide well-lit paths for building with Go and AI, evolving
the language platform with care for the evolving needs of today’s developers,
and building tools and capabilities that help both human developers and AI
assistants and systems alike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On this 16th anniversary of Go’s open source release, we’re also looking to the future of the Go open source project itself. From its humble beginnings, Go has formed a thriving contributor community. To continue to best meet the needs of our ever-expanding user base, especially in a time of upheaval in the software industry, we’re working on ways to better scale Go’s development processes—without losing sight of Go’s fundamental principles—and more deeply involve our wonderful contributor community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go would not be where it is today without our incredible user and contributor communities. We wish you all the best in the coming year!&lt;/p&gt;
