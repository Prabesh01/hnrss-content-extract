    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt; 2025 in retrospect &amp;amp; happy new year 2026! &lt;lb/&gt; Jan 5, 2026 &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happy New Year 2026! Once again, a lot has happened in Gentoo over the past months. New developers, more binary packages, GnuPG alternatives support, Gentoo for WSL, improved Rust bootstrap, better NGINX packaging, â¦ As always here weâre going to revisit all the exciting news from our favourite Linux distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Gentoo in numbers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gentoo currently consists of 31663 ebuilds for 19174 different packages. For amd64 (x86-64), there are 89 GBytes of binary packages available on the mirrors. Gentoo each week builds 154 distinct installation stages for different processor architectures and system configurations, with an overwhelming part of these fully up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The number of commits to the main ::gentoo repository has remained at an overall high level in 2025, with a slight decrease from 123942 to 112927. The number of commits by external contributors was 9396, now across 377 unique external authors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GURU, our user-curated repository with a trusted user model, as entry point for potential developers, has shown a decrease in activity. We have had 5813 commits in 2025, compared to 7517 in 2024. The number of contributors to GURU has increased, from 241 in 2024 to 264 in 2025. Please join us there and help packaging the latest and greatest software. Thatâs the ideal preparation for becoming a Gentoo developer!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Activity has slowed down somewhat on the Gentoo bugtracker bugs.gentoo.org, where weâve had 20763 bug reports created in 2025, compared to 26123 in 2024. The number of resolved bugs shows the same trend, with 22395 in 2025 compared to 25946 in 2024. The current values are closer to those of 2023 - but clearly this year we fixed more than we broke!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;New developers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2025 we have gained four new Gentoo developers. They are in chronological order:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jay Faulkner (jayf): Jay joined us in March from Washington, USA. In Gentoo and open source in general, heâs very much involved with OpenStack; further, heâs a a big sports fan, mainly ice hockey and NASCAR racing, and already long time Gentoo enthusiast.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Michael Mair-Keimberger (mm1ke): Michael joined us finally in June from Austria, after already amassing over 9000 commits beforehand. Michael works as Network Security Engineer for a big System House in Austria and likes to go jogging regulary and hike the mountains on weekends. In Gentoo, heâs active in quality control and cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Alexander Puck Neuwirth (apn-pucky): Alexander, a physics postdoc, joined us in July from Italy. At the intersection of Computer Science, Linux, and high-energy physics, he already uses Gentoo to manage his code and sees it as a great development environment. Beyond sci-physics, heâs also interested in continuous integration and RISC-V.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jaco Kroon (jkroon): Jaco signed up as developer in October from South Africa. He is a system administrator who works for a company that runs and hosts multiple Gentoo installations, and has been around in Gentoo since 2003! Among our packages, Asterisk is one example of his interests.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Featured changes and news&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Letâs now look at the major improvements and news of 2025 in Gentoo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Distribution-wide Initiatives&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Goodbye Github, welcome Codeberg: Mostly because of the continuous attempts to force Copilot usage for our repositories, Gentoo currently considers and plans the migration of our repository mirrors and pull request contributions to Codeberg. Codeberg is a site based on Forgejo, maintained by a non-profit organization, and located in Berlin, Germany. Gentoo continues to host its own primary git, bugs, etc infrastructure and has no plans to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;EAPI 9: The wording for EAPI 9, a new version of the specifications for our ebuilds, has been finalized and approved, and support in Portage is complete. New features in EAPI 9 include pipestatus for better error handling, an edo function for printing a command and executing it, a cleaner environment for the build processes, and the possibility of declaring a default EAPI for the profile directory tree.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Event presence: At FOSDEM 2025 in Brussels, Gentoo has been present once more with a stand, this year together with Flatcar Container Linux (which is based on Gentoo). Naturally we had mugs, stickers, t-shirts, and of course the famous self-compiled buttonsâ¦ Further, we have been present at FrOSCon 2025 in Sankt Augustin with workshops Gentoo installation and configuration and Writing your own ebuilds. Last but not least, the toolchain team has represented Gentoo at the GNU Tools Cauldron 2025 in Porto.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;SPI migration: The migration of our financial structure to Software in the Public Interest (SPI) is continuing slowly but steadily, with expense payments following the moving intake. If you are donating to Gentoo, and especially if you are a recurrent donor, please change your payments to be directed to SPI; see also our donation web page.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Online workshops: Our German support, Gentoo e.V., is grateful to the speakers and participants of four online workshops in 2025 in German and English, on topics as varied as EAPI 9 or GnuPG and LibrePGP. We are looking forward to more exciting events in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Architectures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;RISC-V bootable QCOW2: Same as for amd64 and arm64, also for RISC-V we now have ready-made bootable disk images in QCOW2 format available for download on our mirrors in a console and a cloud-init variant. The disk images use the rv64gc instruction set and the lp64d ABI, and can be booted via the standard RISC-V UEFI support.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gentoo for WSL: We now publish weekly Gentoo images for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), based on the amd64 stages, see our mirrors. While these images are not present in the Microsoft store yet, thatâs something we intend to fix soon.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;hppa and sparc destabilized: Since we do not have hardware readily available anymore and these architectures mostly fill a retrocomputing niche, stable keywords have been dropped for both hppa (PA-RISC) and sparc. The architectures will remain supported with testing keywords.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;musl with locales: Localization support via the package sys-apps/musl-locales has been added by default to the Gentoo stages based on the lightweight musl C library.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Packages&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;GPG alternatives: Given the unfortunate fracturing of the GnuPG / OpenPGP / LibrePGP ecosystem due to competing standards, we now provide an alternatives mechanism to choose the system gpg provider and ease compatibility testing. At the moment, the original, unmodified GnuPG, the FreePG fork/patchset as also used in many other Linux distributions (Fedora, Debian, Arch, â¦), and the re-implementation Sequoia-PGP with Chameleon are available. In practice, implementation details vary between the providers, and while GnuPG and FreePG are fully supported, you may still encounter difficulties when selecting Sequoia-PGP/Chameleon.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;zlib-ng support: We have introduced initial support for using zlib-ng and minizip-ng in compatibility mode in place of the reference zlib libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;System-wide jobserver: We have created steve, an implementation of a token-accounting system-wide jobserver, and introduced experimental global jobserver support in Portage. Thanks to that, it is now possible to globally control the concurrently running build job count, correctly accounting for parallel emerge jobs, make and ninja jobs, and other clients supporting the jobserver protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;NGINX rework: The packaging of the NGINX web server and reverse proxy in Gentoo has undergone a major improvement, including also the splitting off of several third-party modules into separate packages.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;C++ based Rust bootstrap: We have added a bootstrap path for Rust from C++ using Mutabahâs Rust compiler mrustc, which alleviates the need for pre-built binaries and makes it significantly easier to support more configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ada and D bootstrap: Similarly, Ada and D support in gcc now have clean bootstrap paths, which makes enabling these in the compiler as easy as switching the useflags on gcc and running emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;FlexiBLAS: Gentoo has adopted the new FlexiBLAS wrapper library as the primary way of switching implementations of the BLAS numerical algorithm library at runtime. This automatically also provides ABI stability for linking programs and bundles the specific treatment of different BLAS variants in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Python: In the meantime the default Python version in Gentoo has reached Python 3.13. Additionally we have also Python 3.14 available stable - fully up to date with upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;KDE upgrades: As of end of 2025, in Gentoo stable we have KDE Gear 25.08.3, KDE Frameworks 6.20.0, and KDE Plasma 6.5.4. As always, Gentoo testing follows the newest upstream releases (and using the KDE overlay you can even install from git sources).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Physical and Software Infrastructure&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Additional build server: A second dedicated build server, hosted at Hetzner Germany, has been added to speed up the generation of installation stages, iso and qcow2 images, and binary packages.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Documentation: Documentation work has made constant progress on wiki.gentoo.org. The Gentoo Handbook had some particularly useful updates, and the documentation received lots of improvements and additions from the many active volunteers. There are currently 9,647 pages on the wiki, and there have been 766,731 edits since the project started. Please help Gentoo by contributing to documentation!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Finances of the Gentoo Foundation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Income: The Gentoo Foundation took in $12,066 in fiscal year 2025 (ending 2025/06/30); the dominant part (over 80%) consists of individual cash donations from the community. On the SPI side, we received $8,471 in the same period as fiscal year 2025; also here, this is all from small individual cash donations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Expenses: Our expenses in 2025 were, program services (e.g. hosting costs) $8,332, management &amp;amp; general (accounting) $1,724, fundraising $905, and non-operating (depreciation expenses) $10,075.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Balance: We have $104,831 in the bank as of July 1, 2025 (which is when our fiscal year 2026 starts for accounting purposes). The Gentoo Foundation FY2025 financial statement is available on the Gentoo Wiki.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transition to SPI: The Foundation encourages donors to ensure their ongoing contributions are going to SPI - more than 40 donors had not responded to requests to move the recurring donations by the end of the year. Expenses will be moved to the SPI structure as ongoing income permits.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Thank you!&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As every year, we would like to thank all Gentoo developers and all who have submitted contributions for their relentless everyday Gentoo work. If you are interested and would like to help, please join us to make Gentoo even better! As a volunteer project, Gentoo could not exist without its community.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A small but heartfelt demo celebrating the 50th birthday of the legendary MOS KIM-1 🖥️✨&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The KIM-1 first became available in January 1976 —&lt;lb/&gt; three months before the Apple I 🍎 and one month after its sibling, the TIM.&lt;lb/&gt; An incredible milestone in early microcomputer history!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this demo, I’ve gathered and connected a few components that were scattered across my repositories 🧩.&lt;lb/&gt; The goal is not just to look back, but to celebrate, experiment, and build together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I warmly invite fellow retro-computing enthusiasts and comrades-in-arms 🤝&lt;lb/&gt; to jump in, contribute ideas, add modules, demos, or improvements, and help this project grow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s keep the spirit of early computing alive 🚀&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;🎉 HAPPY BIRTHDAY, KIM-1! 🎉&lt;lb/&gt; Wishing you — and all of us — a fantastic and hacky Year 2026 🥳✨&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head class="px-3 py-2"&gt;kim-1_demo.mp4&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Things that are very useful in this code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take any coordinates in HEX out of the memory and use them to place your cursor. The problem is, that to position your cursur, you need to send the x/y coordinates as single chars to the terminal program, like (ESC)[xx;yyH - Imagine just having hex data, i.e. $20 (32 dec) and you need to send a 3 and a 2 separated to your terminal... This routine will do it - seperate the tens from the ones. Now you can like draw a rectangle, a circle or whatever. You can start a painting program if you like.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spent about 2 years improving printing and scanning stack of Linux: CUPS, SANE, AirSane, as well as some legacy drivers, and also x86 proprietary driver emulation on ARM with Box86.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even that "modern" printing stack in Linux is 20+ years old, there's still such an unbelievable amount of basic bugs and low-hanging-fruit optimizations, that it's kinda sad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not to mention that it still maintains ALL its legacy compatibility, as in supporting ≈5 different driver architectures, 4 user-selectable rasterizers (each with its own bugs and quirks).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole printing stack is supported by 4 people, 2 of whom are doing that since the inception of CUPS in 1999. Scanning is maintained by a single person.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ubuntu 26.04 LTS is expected to be the last version with CUPS v2. CUPS v3 drops current printer driver architecture and introduces proper modern driverless printing with the wrapper for older drivers. Many open-source drivers are already use this wrapper, but expect a huge disarrangement from the users, as none of the proprietary drivers would work out of the box anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nah, I got into printing because nobody made a commercially available print server, and I ended up making my own, with all the involvement in the stack in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wish Openprinter luck, as it has been announced in the end of September but nothing out there yet, not even the crowdfunding campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great initiative. I wonder, how likely is it for a complete beginner to break their own printer or scanner by making a mistake in driver implementation? Or is it possible to work on hardware support without having a physical device? I assume it is impossible to test each and every one printer and scanner, so there is probably some clever tricks there, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I work mostly with the old microcontroller-based cheap consumer ("GDI") USB models circa 2000-2010, these are hardly possible to brick with software, as some of them even don't have a firmware and expect the PC to upload it on each power on sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The hardware safety mechanisms are usually robust (USB communication is handled by "Formatter Board", all the mechanical stuff is in the "Engine Controller" power).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Newer Linux-based models have filesystems, software, and vulnerabilities, printer hacking on Pwn2Own is an every year common occurrence. These could be permanently bricked by the software in a common sense, and would require a firmware reflash using the bootloader or external means.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Or is it possible to work on hardware support without having a physical device?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Absolutely, but for me this is very inconvenient—like the debugging over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;I assume it is impossible to test each and every one printer and scanner, so there is probably some clever tricks there, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not much, unfortunately. There's ongoing work on modern (driverless) printer behavior emulation, but it is under heavy development and not ready yet: https://github.com/OpenPrinting/go-mfp&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nothing for the older printers and scanners which require it's own driver, of what I'm aware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Thank you. I have thrown printers out the literal window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have literally thrown one of those "winmodems" [1] out of the window back in the days. I then went out and drove with my car on it. I then put it in a bench vise until its PCB shattered to pieces. Utter destruction, much to the amusement of my brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These were the days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And big thanks to GP for his work of CUPS / Linux printing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I kept making a hacky eval tool to try and compare the outputs of different models, model configs, prompt versions, etc and finally rolled it up into a web app + downloadable app (kind of like Postman or Insomnia, but for AI).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Free, holds your keys in localstorage and makes direct calls to the APIs (unless there's a CORS issue), at https://evvl.ai if you want to try.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the holidays I was building a wooden birdhouse with a Unifi Protect camera and a small web interface that automatically identifies the birds and shows me a simple overview over which type of bird visited how many times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks, it's named after a similar commercial project called Birdbuddy but I didn't want to pay for a subscription and potentially have some e-waste on my hands in a few years. I also wanted to have it integrated in my existing Unifi setup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah yet another glorious yak shave... "Hacker refuses to pay for coercive subscription service which isn't even compatible with the home setup, and spends inordinate time and resources making the thing themselves.".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ended up making a side project for my side project and built MeasureToCut: https://measuretocut.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I moved last year and started a bunch of DIY projects, and each one turned into a bunch of drawings on napkins and backs of receipts to figure out how much wood/material I needed to buy to avoid "one more trip to store". It tells you how much of a stock material you need, and shows you how to cut it, to minimize waste or minimize cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few details&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1D: works for boards, pipes, bars, etc. You enter lengths and quantities; it details the cuts onto the stock material.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2D (coming soon): will work for plywood and sheet goods and lets you see how your parts tile onto sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apparently the software engineer to woodworking pipeline is actually just a circle&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My meta side project for building other side projects: https://bodge.app/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've always had a bunch of small side projects that I want to do that aren't worth the overhead required to actually put them together &amp;amp; keep them maintained. So, I built a small Lua-based FaaS platform to make each individual project less work whenever inspiration strikes. So far I've built:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; My meta side project for building other side projects&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looks cool, congrats on putting it out there as priced service!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And, same!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except, it's just a repo organisation system (structure, conventions, and tools) that lets me share common "parts" across multiple "projects". No monolithic frameworks here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Libraries are functions. Apps are objects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, normally, we use these as distinct artefacts, eventually leading to the "diamond dependency" problem (and lots of other annoying development-time stuff caused by libs / code that is "over there" (elsewhere)).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My "meta side project" solves, essentially the Expression Problem as it manifests in source code management (particularly, cross library / service / project feature development).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for sharing! I signed up and tried it for something simple (storing a message via POST and displaying it in HTML via GET) and it was delightfully easy &amp;amp; approachable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great to hear! And thanks for saying so. I've definitely tried to make it as simple and straight forward as possible, but I really didn't know if it would be simple and straight forward to anyone but me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is great. One thing that is not immediately obvious to me is what kind of authentication it supports. Needing to authenticate the caller is the #1 piece of boilerplate that gets in the way of me completing mini-projects. It’s not hard, but it’s definitely a nonzero amount of effort. And this is coming from someone who has implemented many, many auth flows professionally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It doesn't say because there's no special support for any auth protocols. Long-term I want to have out-of-the-box support for things like OAuth (for user-facing auth) or mutual TLS (for device/service auth). _Technically_ there's currently support for the cryptographic primitives required to do JWT (I added that because I wanted to support WebPush w/ payloads for myself), but those aren't documented because I intend to remove the current slightly-hacky custom APIs and replace them with some off the shelf libraries, but I'm still figuring out user-added libraries (and on top of that I'll also need to figure out support for native libraries).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are there any auth protocols / flows you think would be important to support?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Are there any auth protocols / flows you think would be important to support?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- I think API key passed via basic HTTP auth would get you pretty far. This is ideal for serving machine-machine requests and just requires that both parties can securely store the secret.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- OIDC is great for interactions that happen in the browser or if the function is serving multiple users, but is more complicated to setup and/or use correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;OpenID connect is probably the best for contexts where you want something served by multiple users and those users are humans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; _Technically_ there's currently support for the cryptographic primitives required to do JWT (I added that because I wanted to support WebPush w/ payloads for myself)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is probably a good intermediate solution FWIW - expose signature verification and HMAC APIs and allow a user to bring in their own implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know the homepage needs way more answer to "WTH is it?", I just don't really enjoy doing the 'marketing' side of things. I hadn't really considered just throwing something informal up there, but I guess I don't really know _why_, so, thanks for the suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After years of wondering what the post-UNIX paradigm of computing could look like, these past few months I've been prototyping a software platform built around capabilities and message passing, targeting Linux and bare-metal RISC-V. The big ideas I'm pursuing is a stackless design running on a flat address space with lightweight processes to minimize message-passing latency, and all the benefits of capabilities so every process is sandboxed and has only access to capabilities they have been explicitly passed via message passing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've also built a RISC-V emulator to integrate with this platform, so eventually it'll be able to run native binaries written in any language, completely sandboxed, completely built around message-passing. Basically a native, low-level BEAM-like platform to build an entire operating system and user-space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While my day job is writing boring applications, this is the stuff that keeps me awake at night, and I would love so much to talk and write more about this, about the trial-and-errors I'm facing, but it's still so much in flux every week I'm exploring a new approach. Most of my work has been around the stackless scheduler, and I have a plan to achieve preemption for long-running or misbehaved tasks without having to compromise on memory usage (i.e. without giving each process its own stack and allocate memory for context switching).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually I'd like to layer on top either Cap'n Proto or another high-performance serialisation system to create a distributed, introspectable environment of object-capabilities that are sending typed messages between each other, achieving the ultimate goal of creating an unholy hybrid between Smalltalk and the Erlang VM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;God, how I wish I was paid to work on this type of problems :-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If this sounds close to your area of interests, please send me an email and I’d love to chat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Random assortment of projects as time allows with the $JOB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Prototyping a cute little SSH-based sorta-BBS, inspired by the Spring '83 protocol, but terminal-centric rather than web-based. It's called Winter '78, and if we get another Great Blizzard this year, I'll be able to make some progress on it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Another prototype, for an experimental HPC-ish batch system. Using distributed Erlang for the control plane, and doing a lot of the heavy lifting with systemd transient units. Very much inspired by HTCondor as well as Joyent's (RIP to a real one) Manta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Script to auto-rename screenshots with Claude Code&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm sure there are a ton of other projects out there that do this, but I couldn't find one that fit my needs exactly, so I threw this together in a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;claude-image-renamer uses Claude Code CLI to analyze screenshots and rename them to something actually usable. It combines OCR text extraction with Claude's vision capabilities, so instead of "Screenshot 2025-12-29 at 10.03.10 PM.png" you get something like "vscode_python_debug_settings.png".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few things it does:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Handles those annoying macOS screenshot filenames with weird Unicode characters Uses OCR to give Claude more context for better naming Keeps filenames clean (lowercase, underscores, max 64 chars) Handles naming conflicts automatically&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're on macOS, you can also set this up as a Folder Action so screenshots get renamed automatically when they are saved to a folder, typically ~/Desktop. This is useful if you take a lot of screenshots and hate digging through "Screenshot 2025-12..." files later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bet you are running some personal server or tinkering VM. Why not use a dedicated, coherent tool like Immich to manage all your image organisation needs? I don't see how this renaming would help me in any way, to make use of old screenshots left in random places.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe instead of shooting people down in “What are you working on” threads (I see you have priors), you can instead share something cool that you’re working on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m genetically engineering yeasts to make subtly flavored breads. I’ve already done grape aroma, now working on wintergreen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also working on a red chamomile (using beat red biosynthesis). Just for fun. Red chamomile tea!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is to have niche invite-only genetically engineered flavors that I can bring to parties around SF :) what’s more special than a genetically engineered organism that you can ONLY get if I’m there? Good calling card&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is so cool. Also, it sounds like a cheeky plot to a zombie apocalypse or global contagion movie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How subtle are the flavors? Unsubtle enough that an oblivious taster might ask, "Does this bread taste like grapes to anyone else here?" Or does one need guidance to search for the flavor?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I really need to do a write-up. I kinda just whip up the easiest path and do it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example for the grape, I needed to knock out some tryptophan synthesis genes so I could redirect the bioflux. Problem is that in bakers yeast they have a whole buncha copies of their chromosomes, so I had to knock out one of the genes and replace it with a different gene from grapes. Did that with a quick lil CRISPR switch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Had to electroporate tho because the transformation rates on wild/bakers/non-lab yeast are so garbage&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How much expensive lab equipment do you need to do something like this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"A quick lil CRISPR switch" sounds like "oh just my homemade fusion reactor hooked up to my kitchen warp drive" to me, yet you make it sound so simple!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Built a parking garage occupancy tracker for my city (https://www.parkeergaragesdelft.nl/) after a city council decision on car-free city center policies got delayed due to missing data. The city only publishes real-time availability with no historical record, so I started logging it. The site now shows historical data plus analysis of weekly patterns. (Note: website is in Dutch, but the charts should be self-explanatory.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now working on a second tool that monitors public reports on illegal dumping, broken streetlights and more. It tracks how long the municipality takes to resolve them&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lately, I've developed an interest in local politics and started reading policy documents, following city council meetings and even lobbied for a local park. Presenting public data clearly can help shape opinions and keeps the city council accountable, especially important with the upcoming city council elections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the last time I posted on HN it's gained a decent amount of traffic and users. I'm particularly happy with the jobs section, which is growing into a high signal-noise source for European tech jobs: https://techposts.eu/jobs&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason I started this website is because so much incredible innovation and growth in Europe flies under the radar. If you ask Americans many will say it's just "banks and museums", stagnant, or worse. But the reality is there is a huge spectrum of exciting companies starting and growing here. We have space launch companies, battery companies, AI companies, and a whole bunch of other interesting stuff. It's an exciting time to be a European in tech!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Ask TechPosts.eu: Is there an EU Cloudflare alternative? I'm interested in CDN, DDoS mitigation and basic web security." Links to https://techposts.eu/post/153&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last two years I spent a surprising amount of time analyzing XSD files to understand regulatory changes in financial reporting. It was repetitive, painful, and unnecessarily manual.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the past two months I built https://xsdviewer.com to make working with XML Schemas simpler: visual structure, navigation, diffing, and faster understanding of what actually changed between versions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now I am iterating on new features and performance improvements. If you regularly work with XSDs or XML based standards and have ideas, pain points, or feature requests, I would love to hear them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a couple of years now, I’ve wanted to build a service that lets you subscribe to new version notifications for any kind of software—desktop apps, drivers, packages, and more. As a Unity developer and consultant myself, I’ve always wanted to know the moment a new version becomes available. I value being at the bleeding edge, especially since a large part of the value I bring as a consultant comes from both the breadth and depth of my knowledge of the Unity engine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m currently working on a niche version of the broader VersionAlert idea specifically for Unity, which is why the domain currently redirects to https://versionalert.com/unity .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only other service I’ve found that really addresses this need is https://newreleases.io . I actually spoke with the very nice husband-and-wife team behind it and even offered to buy the whole project, but their asking price was about 10× higher than what I was offering—which I understand, no hard feelings. I still wish them the best of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anyone is aware of other projects or services in this space, I'd be happy to learn about them and chat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s an open source project that basically turns your kubernetes into a developer friendly PaaS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just crossed 2k apps on the cloud version, no idea how many people run it locally, and thanks to a generous sponsorship from the Portainer folks, I’m able to work on it close to full time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Built my own Spotify recommendation egnine after getting tired of Spotify’s repetitive recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You get to choose the genres you're interested in, and it creates playlists from the music in your library. They get updated every day - think a better, curated by you version of the Daily Mixes. You can add some advanced filters as well, if you really want to customise what music you'll get.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It works best if you follow a good amount of artists. Optionally you can get recommendations from artists that belong to playlists you follow or you've created - if you don't follow much or any artists, then you should enable that in order for the service to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on WordPecker, trying to create something like a personalized Duolingo but for vocabulary you actually encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Started when I was struggling to read books in English. Pushed an open source version back then (https://github.com/baturyilmaz/wordpecker-app), later added more features, and now working on a mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My end goal is to build: an AI language learning companion that knows what you read, listen, and watch, knows you as a friend (real life, who you are), then helps you improve using that context. If you're B1 at language, it creates a personalized path to get you to B2, then C1, and so forth using your context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's what good lights go for, they're niche and people pay good money for them. I really liked my office lamps and I wanted to get the same for home, after a quick search I discovered they were 1300+ euros&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a music-making website since late spring. This is my first real frontend project, and I'm writing it in pure Rust using Leptos (so far, haven't had to write a single line of JavaScript!)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of my work so far has been on the actual music-making interface, but I'm beginning work on the backend now. I've only worked with Django before (for a school project at Georgia Tech), so I'll be deep in the `sqlx` documentation for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's no manual, so use at your own risk (it's similar to tracker programs like FastTracker and OpenMPT): https://mondobe.com/tracker&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fellow yellow jacket here! This is great start, I'd love to see mondobe evolve into something like cursor for music production. I've done music making on DAWs like fl studio and i wish if we could reduce some friction there for users&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on a local RAG LLM designed for lower end PC's - ability for people to try out searching their own documents, seeing it was such a learning curve to get to this stage - hoping others can learn from my mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on a voxel engine in my spare time for 10 years, this year. I wrote everything from scratch, from the memory allocators, font rasterizer and a programing language all the way to collision detection, renderer and gameplay code. It's been a journey!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on https://chessnawk.vercel.app/ – a set of auto-grading tasks for middle school students learning programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comes with Robot, Turtle, HTML/CSS (pixel diff tasks) and a gradual introduction into programming concepts. Currently on JS, literally right now GPT-5.2 helps me adding Python.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've integrated a simplified clone of Replicube. I hope to integrate ideas from Human Resource Machine and Turing Complete later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bear heritage of Eastern Bloc-typa math/programming olympiads, combined with front-end/product skills. So I kinda owe to ship this thing to community of fellow secondary school CS teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, nothing comes closer in terms of depth and usability in the classroom for ordinary 12yo kids.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I test this thing 5 times a week in my classroom and I constantly polish it at night. 100% vibe-coding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been experimenting with using LLMs for a content recommender system. Specifically I've built a news reader app that fetches news articles from multiple RSS feeds, uses an LLM to first deduplicate and then score them. The user can then rate the articles and those ratings are used as few-shot examples in the LLM scoring prompt. Any resulting low score articles (uninteresting to the user) are hidden by default and visible ones scaled by their score on a dynamic CSS grid like on a traditional newspaper front page. Looking good so far, but still testing and tweaking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing I’ve always disliked about RSS (and this could actually fix it) is duplicates. When a new LLM model drops for example there are like ~5 blogs about it in my RSS feed saying basically the same thing, and I really only need to read one. Maybe you could collapse similar articles by topic?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, would be nice to let users provide a list of feed URLs as a variable instead of hardcoding them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the console messages with the LLM reasoning, it does seem to work quite nicely for deduplication. Your example is probably even a lot easier than news articles, where you can have many articles from different viewpoints about the same event.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't actually plan to run this as a service so there's some things hard-coded and the setup is a bit difficult as you need an API key and a proxy. Currently it's just experimentation, although if it works well, I'll probably use it personally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ive been working on something similar, have you had any issues with the LLM not giving you back a full response for all the input? Ive been using Chat gpt but even on the same request sometimes id give it 20 things to rank, and Id just get back 3 results&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No, it's been working without problems so far. I'm using Anthropic for what it's worth. I ask the LLM to first do some reasoning and then return a JSON array on the final line. Sometimes I've seen some Markdown backticks there, but no irregularities more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a native MacOS Postgres client: http://github.com/ravelantunes/Searchlight I've been slowly chipping at it over the last couple of years as I find time, and I like it enough to already use it as my primary client (although still buggy here and there).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not as impressive, but - making my website weirder. Not a frontend dev at work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Top of my ideas now: add "ask your LLM" buttons to my email submission form that opens ChatGPT/Perp/Claude and auto-fills a query asking it why you should be friends with me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sample links (I hope it says nice things about me!):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;buddy, don't be so modest, this is an ambitious project and I hope you succeed ! This is tough work, I tried to build a Webflow-ish editor myself and it nearly destroyed my sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previously, I made a live win probability model for the 5v5 arcade game Killer Queen Arcade from their game events API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now I am trying to use that model to make:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. A post game instant replay that shows the most important/pivotal moments from the most recently finished game. Some arcades have a seperate display for observers, it could work well there, or as good filler between matches on twitch streams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. A personalized per tournament/yearly highlights recap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it works well, it might be a kind of tool that generalizes well for summarizing long twitch streams for Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A friend and I noticed recently that the last remaining pieces of the puzzle for a full line of "trustworthy technology" have recently dropped into our laps while we weren't looking.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are those? You know… open, freedom, and privacy respecting technology. Recent products are the Starlite tablet, Furilabs and Fairphone. We've been waiting for these products, well over fifteen years since the introduction of the iPhone and iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite posting many times, we haven't been able to start a discussion here. Maybe we don't know the right key words, or posted too late in the day, not sure. But I know someone is interested in the subject because there have been three huge discussions this week about how "Linux is good enough now."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That has been true for a decade in my experience, but no one seems to be talking about the new mobile hardware available. I hope to work on bringing these efforts together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building https://lenzy.ai - helping products built around chat with AI (think Lovable or Cursor) reduce churn and prioritize product improvements by analyzing their user's chats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I started about 3 months ago, focusing on making my 2 early adopters happy. One of them is ready to start paying soon!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on two topics that I like : browser multiplayer games and experiences, and tools for developers (mostly used in my side projects).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First game is https://geocentric.top where users can sculpt a planet collaboratively and place trees or houses (for now very limited). I plan on making it an idle sim where players will be able to interact by dropping some food/events for the creatures on it to evolve through time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, a remote logger/metrics/user management tool where once can track all their logs, live metrics, uptimes, identify users, etc. I hope to have a v1 during this first quarter and I'm currently my first user as I have it hosted at https://app.getboringmetrics.com to centralize all my side projects into a single platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is highly polished indeed and I'm likely going to try it, mostly for its animations regarding dropping plants and rocks as I lack micro animations for it in my game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks! This is also what I love doing as realtime games are something like 90% of my side project. This was a real fun prototype to create as everything regarding terrain is done through shaders (even user cursors). Will soon add a way for people to plant "flags" with small texts that you can highlight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doors - A first person, exploration game/experience that I built from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Doors lets you explore URL addressable 3D rooms that link together seamlessly via portals. The idea is that people would upload rooms to the internet (to github, S3, whatever) and connect them together to form one giant inter-connected space that would be a real trip to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now rooms consistent of a: - Manifest JSON file that points to requisite resources and configures portals - An optional skybox - An optional background music track - A .vox file containing voxel terrain data&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Portals can be arbitrarily sized and everything is prefetched/loaded seamlessly in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm nearly done - I just need to add in a very lightweight interface and give the code a bit of a spit shine (I will open source it - so I want it to look pretty)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EDIT: As an aside, I finally decided to give this whole Claude Code thing a go - I purchased a max subscription and I'm trying to write as little code as possible. I certainly wouldn't call what I'm doing "vibe-coding". I discuss a feature in plan mode (incl. how I want to implement it in high level terms) iterate on the plan 2-3 times until I'm satisfied and then let it rip. I'm both very impressed and quite frightened by the productivity boost...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a CUDA implementation of Forman-Ricci curvature-based clustering (I checked online and saw that there is currently no GPU/CUDA implementation, so I thought why not do it). Hopefully it would help with my CV.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Free to play FPV racing game with a global leaderboard that can run on integrated grapics in the web browser. Focus is on realistic physics (aero, PIDs and filtering, propwash, signal noise).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building a Java stack for the x402 protocol. I believe today’s payment systems are unnecessarily broken and overly complex. I really like the idea of a protocol that could simplify this space while remaining truly open and not “owned” by anyone—meaning anyone can use it without needing authorization from the protocol’s creator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just came across x402 recently and am excited to build upon it. My current project[1] will have a tipping feature and it'd be neat to give people the option to not use fiat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built a browser plugin called "Visionary" that overlays meaningful descriptions and context directly onto stunning pictures of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I noticed that existing picture-of-the-day plugins were built over two decades ago and never evolved to harness the capabilities of modern artificial intelligence. AI can transform the picture viewing experience by distilling complex descriptions into accessible insights and providing references to explore the core concepts in the photo more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on a real-time tracker for the Canadian Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the official data is technically public, it's practically inaccessible (buried in XML feeds and legacy sites).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phase 1 was building a modern ingestion engine and freeing the information to make it more accessible. The goal is to make legislative data as accessible as sports stats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm almost ready to launch the MVP; I'm just doing some bugfixes and testing the database now! (If you want an early look at the MVP, my email is in my profile.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next phase is what I'm most excited about: visualizing this data and using LLMs to provide insights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a really cool idea! I remember once looking at all of the actual concrete actions taken and being surprised at what was actually done (not very much at the time!). Maybe it is better now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about something similar for my city council. Would be interested to compare notes! Your email seems to be missing in your profile, but you can find my email in mine if you want to chat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm on a deep dive fine-tuning how I organize and manage my personal knowledge base - focused on entity extraction and strategic information retrieval and based on the AgREE paper from Apple[0] and persisting it in Memgraph.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've got a nice ingest, extract, enrich process going for the graph - I'm currently working on a fork of claude-mem[1] that uses the graph as a contextual backend for agentic coding workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks! Is it that you can't see the graph view at all? It uses DeckGL which might be a bit too fancy and may not work on all browsers possibly. It works on Chrome/Safari on my iPhone and Chrome on Arch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't realize that you actually could provide a working link back to Hacker News but it seems HN does support that. Thanks, I will give that a try!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh ok. Yeah, it is just not really complete yet. What this does is displays a UMAP of the embeddings for the selected feature and you can mouse over for labels. It isn't identifying clusters itself yet, finding exemplars, etc. Right now, points that are close to each other are just semantically close - as judged by UMAP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AFAICT, the future of software development looks like a lot of unprofessional software development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not unlike digital photography and Instagram. Has it killed film-photo divisions of photography companies? Yes. Has it put professional photographers out of business? Hardly, and in fact, the opposite. What the ubiquitous phone camera has done, is expose a lot many more people to the steep challenge of making truly good photographs. It has raised the average population-scale level of photo-erudition and taste to ever-more sophisticated levels. And, it has pushed the envelope on what photography can do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So---assuming the AI overlords prevail (which I'm deeply skeptical of, but suppose a trillion dollars are right and I'm wrong)---what happens when LLMs allow anyone to vibe-code their own SaaS or Database or IDE or bespoke health-monitoring app or whatever...?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on an iOS camera app to take natural-looking photos with reduced post-processing. The goal is take photos that look like what you see.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just updated the RAW pipeline and I'm really happy with how the resulting photos look, plus there's this cool "RAW+ProRAW" capture mode I introduced recently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I initially released it early last year and have been using it as my main camera app since, but I haven't mentioned it in one of these threads before. Unfortunately this post has come just a bit early for my most recent update to be approved; there's some nice improvements coming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Curious what motivated you to create this camera app when there are a handful of well established apps that already do unprocessed imaging. What does Unpro do differently?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the time I created it there weren't any that did the end-to-end process with ProRAW in a way that I liked. And I got really tired of manually editing every photo I took, so I built the app for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plus, having full control over the way photos look, I've customized the output to match my taste; I don't think there's any other camera apps that produce photos quite like mine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built a free USCIS form-filling tool (no Adobe required) USCIS forms still use XFA PDFs, which don’t let you edit in most browsers. Even with Adobe, fields break, and getting the signature is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I converted the PDF form into modern, browser-friendly web forms - and kept every field 1:1 with the original. You fill the form, submit it, and get the official USCIS PDF filled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm currently working on Codebox, a remote development workspaces provider. After trying many existing solutions, I realized there wasn’t a self-hosted option that was both simple to set up and easy to use, so I decided to build one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Codebox, you can define workspace templates or load workspace configurations directly from Git repositories. At the moment, it supports Dev Containers and Docker Compose, with plans to expand to additional configuration methods in the future (for example, Terraform).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below are some resources where you can learn more about the project, including an article that explains how Codebox works and the source repositories (mirrored on both GitHub and GitLab):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally, been making a low fidelity exalidraw-like calendar app: https://letswalnut.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a real-time collaborative workspace-oriented version, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Professionally, working on “Magic Draft,” a feature in Ditto to help designers and writers create the “draft and a half” directly in Figma, which uses a hierarchy of all your context (text, Ditto metadata, the design, your style guides, etc) to write really good starting point copy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built an in-browser data explorer for datasets too large for spreadsheets but too small to justify spinning up SQL. It runs entirely client-side using DuckDB-WASM, no server uploads accounts or anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core idea is a visual DAG where each transformation (filter, join, aggregate, pivot) creates a view node. Nothing materializes until you need it, DuckDB executes the full chain on demand so you can build deep pipelines without copying data at each step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Input files can be CSV/Parquet/Excel (Excel might not work great). There's a SQL editor with schema-aware autocomplete, pivot tables with drill-down to underlying rows, and sessions can be exported as files or shareable URLs (the entire pipeline gets encoded in the hash).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sharing can be granular and you can choose not to embed the files or if files are too big they will not be embedded and the user when opening the link will have to upload the files to restore the session.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The part I find most useful: you can replay pipelines on new data. Share your January analysis, and a colleague runs the same transformations on February's data with schema validation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy-first since files never leave your browser, it's a static website actually. I will open source soon, and make it probably MIT licensed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also it's a WIP and so it may be buggy (there's not even images on the homepage) https://repere.ai&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Called "feocask" cuz feo means "ugly" in Spanish and FeO to mean Iron Oxide for Rust. I thought it was funny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will admit that I had help from Codex, but I did write most of it myself, and I think the design is coming out kind of neat. I have a very strict "no lock" policy [1], including lockfiles, and this should still be safe to use across any number of threads, at the cost of N^2 reconciliation to the number of threads and a lot more drive space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I like my design; I have an excuse to use Vector Clocks and Hybrid Logical Clocks and I think it might actually be useful for something some day. I'd like to eventually write something that goes a bit beyond getting parity with bitcask and optionally have the ability to automatically distribute across multiple nodes, but I'm still trying to think of a good design for that, because my current design depends heavily the atomicity of POSIX filesystem commands, and introducing the network introduces latency that would likely greatly degrade performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[1] At least no explicit locks. I am using Tokio channels and they are probably using locks in some spots behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm in the final stretch of self-publishing my debut sci-fi novel Sector 36. Been working at it for almost 2 years. I'm waiting for the final print proofs to make sure things look good before the "official" 1/31 launch date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building MatGoat (https://matgoat.com) - management software for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and other martial arts' academies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I train BJJ and kept hearing the same complaints from academy owners regarding attendance tracking, comms, missing payments, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I'm building a tool for student tracking with belts progression, automated payments, attendance-based promotion criteria, and a tablet check-in system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Focusing on Spanish-speaking markets first since it's completely underserved. Currently onboarding early academies, and will market it in the US/UK soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think frontier models are getting to the point where we can start to reach higher trust agentic workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a hardcore AI chat user, I'm often frustrated with the single-agent workflow, where a single context window is used for even very long conversations. If I want to change the topic, open a thread, or go on a tangent, I often end up compromising the main thread and I'm forced to copy context over if I want to dive into something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To solve this, I'm working on a collaborative AI agent orchestrator that models the solution as a group chat with humans and AI agents, including an agent orchestrator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can spawn participating agents with the orchestrator who will decisively route messages to the existing agents, or spawn new agents if needed. Also, you can open agent details and send messages directly to existing agents, similar to threads in slack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, I have MCP integrations working with Linear and GitHub, but plan to add many more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on this just over 2 weeks, making heavy use of 4+ concurrent Claude Code agents. This would have been impossible otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ooh this sounds good, I feel the same problem but never imagined a solution, having a group chat sounds good, any chance this can be integrated in something like Antigravity?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nowhere near as impressive as some of the things here but I’ve been slowly growing out a daily puzzle website https://regularly.co - I built the first few games for my wife, no subscriptions, no pay to play, no sign up needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Im launching a new word game next week which I’m super excited about. If you do play it and have any feedback do shoot me message!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ah another nice feature would be blank out game until you hit start and cant reset timer. I like to compete with friends and resetting time makes it so you cant compete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last 2 or 3 years I've been building a Common LISP implementation in Go so that Go packages can be utilized by LISP code. Building a REPL with lots of interactive features was rewarding as was taking up the challenges of the object systems (CLOS and Flavors) and generics. Just open sourced it at the start of January. https://github.com/ohler55/slip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Got tired of helping enterprises run Concourse themselves, so we productized it. We've deployed and maintained Concourse for Starbucks, Accenture, Sky UK, and others over the years—CentralCI packages that operational knowledge into a SaaS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Concourse over GitHub Actions?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* fly execute lets you test pipelines locally before pushing. No more "commit and pray" * fly intercept drops you into a running container to debug failures * Resource-based triggers can monitor anything—not just git pushes * Full pipeline visualization from dev to prod in one view * Workers you actually control (no arbitrary cache limits or runner queues)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What we handle:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;* Dedicated Concourse instances on high-spec hardware (Ice Lake Xeon, DDR5, NVMe) * Worker scaling without the Kubernetes complexity * SOC compliance, auditing, AWS PrivateLink for enterprise * 24/7 support from people who've been running Concourse in production for years&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pitch is simple: Concourse is the right tool for complex CI/CD, but running it is a pain. We make it not a pain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a complex garden planner to keep track of gardens, orchards, and landscaping projects. Meant for very large and very small scales. Public alpha at the end of this month, I hope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is based on a garden designer I made for myself to keep track of my rose garden (I have over 100 roses) and orchard (I have about 15 trees): https://garden.simonsarris.com/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, my version was very specific to my needs, so this general version requires a lot more work to get it usable for a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continuing to work on Minifeed (https://minifeed.net/), a directory, reader, and search engine for personal blogs. The indexing &amp;amp; searching backend in Typesense, and I'm moving from their paid managed cloud service[0] to a self-hosted VM. It was very easy to start with the reasonably priced managed service, but with the number of feeds/posts growing, I have decided to self-host it. I'm also using Typesense Dashboard, a nice visual tool to do basic administration [1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, Minifeed keeps chugging along, fetching new posts every day from almost 2k feeds. I'm hoping to find some nice and ethical monetization strategy for it this year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Acme [1], a text editor for programmers. It’s a very unusual tool and I have collected hundreds of notes (as well as dozens of bugs and inconsistencies) from the past two years of using it. Now I feel fully assimilated, I do not take as much notes and it feels the right time to start organizing the knowledge, to put ideas together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that Acme is very underrated in its domain (a tool for experts). The coverage is minuscule. That’s why I am thinking about blog posts, maybe video tutorials. I do not know what should it be exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do not have any time estimates. I have a very demanding main job (I work as a software developer) and young family that I need to take care of. This project demands focused efforts and selectivity that I can barely satisfy. But I wouldn’t give up, the thing is totally worth it. If it’s going to take years, so be it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you have any comments, send me a letter at kalterdev@gmail.com. Have a good day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A transformer-based (but not LLM) chess model that plays like a human. The site right now is very rudimentary - no saving games, reviewing games, etc., just playing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It uses three models: * A move model for what move to make * A clock model for how long to 'think' (inference takes milliseconds, the thinking time is just emulated based on the output of the clock model) * A winner model that predicts the likelihood of each game outcome (white win / black win / draw). If you've seen eval bars when watching chess games online, this isn't quite the same. It's a percentage based outcome, rather than number of centipawns advantage that the usual eval bars use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now it has a model trained on 1700-1800 rating level games from Lichess. You can turn it up and down past that, but I'm working on training models on a wide variety of other rating ranges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're really into computer chess, this is similar to MAIA, but with some extra models and very slightly higher move prediction accuracy compared to the published results of the MAIA-2 paper&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on finally releasing the programming language I’ve been working on for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m setting up the basic site, which is not a huge deal, but I’ve been inspired by more recent language designers having a streaming presence, so I am working through test runs of streaming my development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope to start with demos of the basic language features and then move on to streaming both a reimplementation of my compiler and on a Rocq implementation of the syntax and semantics of the language for proof work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The language has a rather small niche at first glance, so I’m hoping to use the streaming as a way to explore areas of appeal and maybe draw some interest. A low level concurrent and parallel ‘functional’ language with very non-traditional syntax and a modal, dependent type theory is not going to appeal to everyone, but hopefully I can find some interest eventually, even if just to hang out on chat and talk about the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; A low level concurrent and parallel ‘functional’ language&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not particularly familiar with array based languages, but are you inspired by them at all? Seems like a similar concept.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What're your goals for the language? It would be cool to see a parallel execution model unify SIMD, multithreading and gpu. I bet people with a lot of money would be interested if you could apply it to ML&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not particularly inspired by the array languages in general. I do like the idea of a specifics DSL or library that is built from the ground up for ‘vector’ operations (Futhark would certainly be an inspiration here). I do think an (syntax divergences aside) implementation of what is essentially CUDA-like language/library is very possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t really have any lofty goals, the language exists to let me have my personal ideal programming language. One of the things I would like to see adopted, by any language, is that the language is able to encode and present provable guarantees about code. So, memory safety, freedom from UB, lack of overflow (integer or stack) is provable in some subset of the language and the proof is done in a logically consistent, verifiable manner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course most of those proofs are not anywhere near feasible for general case code, but the language can restrict allowable constructs in a computation, function, process, or module to a set that makes the desired properties provable by construction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The language should be capable of unifying and abstracting over SIMD (or other hardware implementations), GPUs, and OS or Userspace multithreading at levels of abstraction from assembly to Haskell or other high level languages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I needed some pixel art for a different project, so I made 8BitSmith, a simple pixel art &amp;amp; sprite generator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm expecting it is pretty niche, but animations tend to be very time consuming for people like me, and getting quick sprites that I can drop into a platform is a big time saver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long term memory for dozens of AI tools, designed for power users who want more control and flexibility than native memory systems and who do not want to be locked into any one platform. You can also have the system remember your entire chat history going back years and use this information to help you better in new chats, it sometimes makes chats 10x more useful when I say something like: “Using recall tool, do 10+ calls for 1000 tokens context each to learn about my interests, strengths, curiosities, what I’ve tried in the past, what worked, what didn’t, etc and suggest a new hobby I would enjoy”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without long term recall, AI is a super intelligence in your hands that uses the knowledge of the world to give you generic, nearly useless advice because of how generic it is. With long term memory, you have a super-intelligence that knows YOU. This is what MemoryPlugin solves for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A specialized programming language for 3D geometry generation + manipulation called Geoscript as well as a Shadertoy-inspired web app for building stuff with it: https://3d.ameo.design/geotoy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There have been lots of cool technical challenges through the whole process of building this, and a very nice variety of different kinds of work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working towards using the outputs from this language to build out levels and assets for a browser-based game I've been dabbling with over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've created a programming language and game for (my) kids called Stacky Bird. You learn Stack Based programming with Flappy Bird. Inspired by my old HP calculators, the game 2048 and Flappy Bird. In levels you earn a new instruction and at the end you have a complete instruction set, and can solve complicated puzzles. With new instructions you can even go back and solve previous levels more elegantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's not mobile friendly yet, but maybe that'll be a next weekend project. At least you can view a video of a level on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building AgentOS [1], trying to experiment where agent substrates/sandboxes will head next. It's a deterministic, event-sourced runtime where an “agent world” is replayable from its log, heavy logic runs in sandboxed WASM modules, and every real-world side effect (HTTP, LLM calls, code compilations, etc.) is explicitly capability-gated and recorded as signed receipts. It ensures that upgrades and automations are auditable, reversible, and composable. The fun bit is a small typed control-plane intermediate representation (AIR) that lets the system treat its own schemas/modules/plans/policies as data and evolve via a governed loop (propose &amp;gt; shadow-run &amp;gt; approve &amp;gt; apply), kind of “Lisp machine vibes” but aimed at agents that need reliable self-modification rather than ambient scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Article about Norway problem in YAML. Draft is ready (link: https://lab174.com/blog/202601-yaml-norway ), beta readers welcome, please let me know if you have any feedback - thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on BacklogAI, an autopilot engineer for SaaS teams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You connect GitHub, CI, Sentry, and Linear, and it takes tickets all the way to production. Claude writes the changes, BacklogAI handles tests, migrations, feature flags, staged rollouts, etc...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s clearing months of backlog work in hours, and a couple teams I’m working with have already stopped hiring because it’s cheaper than adding more developers. It's crystal clear that developers and designers won't be needed in a couple of months because claude increases productivity by at least 120x and one or two PMs can do pretty much everything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My stack is Claude, v0, nextjs, shadcn, clerk, supabase, vercel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on https://fullremote.it, which started as a side project and is now turning into a real business.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's an "italian-oriented" curated remote-jobs and remote-work community, currently ~10k subscribers across newsletter and Telegram. What began as "let's share good remote roles" is evolving into paid job postings, sponsorships, and coaching for companies and devs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to make a Chinese Hanzi variant of Wordle called Handle 汉兜 [0] available as a Discord activity/app so my Discord groups can have fun solving puzzles just like we've been having with NYT's official Wordle Discord app[1]. A Discord app is just a webview or iframe embedded inside Discord that you can launch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the holidays I built a simple website which lets children (of all ages) easily draw something and then bring the sketch to life using AI and a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only shared it via Show HN so far, and am still regularly getting some creative submissions. Will be sharing it at an art festival later this year so kids can have a more active role when visiting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still experimenting with different ways to make learning easier using LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I put together Codose as a tool where you paste a link to an Exercism or LeetCode problem, and it spins up a code editor with an AI tutor that walks you through the solution step by step, with mini lessons along the way when you need them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can try it without signing up but I’m on the Google AI Studio free tier right now, so I’m not sure how many uses can it handle&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a subscription-based short-form video site called NICKEL[1]. I felt gross about using YouTube but wanted to share my gaming clips, so I made my own thing. Then I thought about making it sustainable so here we are. I'll have an update to the mailing list out in a few hours, I'm "building in public."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My feature-complete deadline is April 15th and I think I'll make it. If you want to check out the UI, visit the explore[2] page. I have it setup to redirect to a public video while I work on the intended UI (a design challenge I've never tried before but we've all seen). I'm thoroughly enjoying figuring out how streaming video works and how best to optimize things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You know how Spotify (or any other service) will just silently remove tracks from your playlist because they lost the rights? No notification, a beloved song just disappeared from your life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a webapp to keep track of your playlists and notify you when a song disappears&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support for Youtube playlists please... having to lookup the watch ID on Google after a song is removed to guess what the track was is a highly sucky part of using Youtube for music.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of my enterprise customers face the microservice hairball problem. Adoption of microservices has been "too succesful". There may be 200-400 microservices, and ownership may be lacking. The number is typically growing fast, because it is easier to create a new one than use an existing one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I started to work on a side project called "Arch Ascent" for addressing these situations. It seems like it is becoming a kind of a architectural governance tool for visualizing and validating software system dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Dependency Graph — Syncs projects from SonarQube and visualizes component dependencies using Cytoscape.js, with graph algorithms for detecting cycles (SCCs), clustering (Louvain), and computing coupling metrics&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Visions — Workspaces for exploring architectural scenarios. Each vision can have multiple versions/variations with different layouts while sharing the same definitions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Layers — Named groupings of components (e.g., "Domain Layer", "Team Ownership", "GitLab Groups") that can be visualized as colored regions on the canvas&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- References — Named sets of components defined via Tag expressions, layer membership etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Statements — Architectural intent constraints that can be evaluated against the actual dependency graph, such as existence, containment, exclusion, cardinality etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The plan is to also incorporate Grounds, which are Intermediate stable states on the path from the current situation (ground zero) toward a vision. Each ground represents a releasable milestone that moves the architecture closer to the target vision without necessarily fulfilling all its statements. Grounds enable incremental architectural evolution with well-defined checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stack: Django, HTMX, Cytoscape.js, pyparsing for natural language parsing of References and Statements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am writing a Context Retrieval and Context Minimization program for Rust code. I am trying to automate my own workflow in how I use LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The program is gonna do, what I am currently doing by hand, opening files and copying function/method signatures usually, from files all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key here is to fetch into the context window only what is needed for one-question/one-answer and no more, hence the Context Minimization. Context fetched is gonna be specified by the programmer, for example sig(function) fetches only the signature, while @function captures the whole body. sig(Struct) is gonna fetch the fields and signatures of all of it's methods. sig(Trait) similarly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my view, giving the A.I. more information than needed, only confuses it and accuracy degrades. It is also slower and more expensive but that's a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The project is in early stages, for the moment it calls ast-grep under the hood, but eventually, if it works as it is supposed to, I plan to move to tree-sitter queries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there is a similar project somewhere I would appreciate a pointer to it, but I am not interested in implementations of agents. My program does not give the A.I. a whole view of the codebase, only the necessary points specified by the programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An eBPF-based Wireguard mesh VPN in Rust using Aya.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea is to rely on kernel Wireguard, and process packets in kernel space (via eBPF) for maximum performance and minimal CPU overhead. I plan to use egress and ingress TC to “apply” the policy at both sides. XDP is faster, but only works on ingress, which is not sufficient for a mesh VPN imo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Netbird already exists in this space, so this is mostly a learning exercise, and maybe a reference implementation for those learning eBPF in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Goals and constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Single digit CPU overhead for multi Gbps bandwidth (probably a bit too ambitious, but we’ll see)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. Linux only&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. No hole punching or complex NAT handling&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4. Basic policy language for L3 and L4 traffic (L7 requires punting packets to a userspace proxy)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SourceMinder: A “code index” tool that finds symbols in a codebase and creates a single table sqlite database for the index. It uses tree-sitter to parse the AST and add the symbols and what they are (function, class, argument, etc) to the db. I currently have it working with TypeScript, C, Go and PHP. I’m working on adding Perl next, after someone requested it here on HN.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An alternative front-end / game discovery service / price tracker for GOG's catalog. Mostly manually enhancing the data from the API (90% heuristics, 10% human effort, as the total dataset isn't large enough for it to be worth doing otherwise), and offering a wider range of filters for it all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm grouping all related products together for a more complete overview, and have recently added library import, where I mostly 'solved' the issue of GOG not recognizing that you own certain games if you got them as a freebie or as part of a since-delisted deluxe edition. Just now starting in on incomplete "series" listings, seeing what'd be involved with making them contain all relevant games, and then exposing that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I posted this earlier but realized that I had pointed it at a different "What are you working on" post. I think this one (david927) is the defacto "official" one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently, I've been very motivated to make one niche crafted service after another. For myself, family and friends. But struggled to find a compelling hosting solution for projects that only has and will have only a single user for years. I bought the cheapest mac mini M4 on sale, put it in basement and started working on some cli+daemon to help me automate all things around it. The biggest risk is security, so probably gonna rely a lot on Cloudflare at start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have always assumed this is about individual projects, but let me try talking about our team effort. We just launched exe.dev, and have lots of projects. In particular, we are spending a lot of time on file systems. The easy one is copy-on-write VM cloning, which existing software provides for us. More interestingly, I believe the standard cloud approach of putting everything on a NAS by default is wrong. Doing better here is going to require doing unusual things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a newsletter called Tech Talks Weekly[1] where my readers get one email per week with all the latest Software Engineering conference talks and podcasts[1] published that week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In January, I've released a paid tier[2] where my subscribers additionally get:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Access to my internal database of all the talks and podcasts since 2020 (+48,000 in total) where they can search, filter, sort, and group by title, conference/podcast, view count, date, and duration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. See the list of the most-watched talks over the last 7, 30, 90 days, 6 months, and 12 months based on number of views.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Get category-based view of new talks &amp;amp; podcasts by tech stack, language, and domain (Software Architecture, Backend, Frontend, Full Stack, Data, ML, DevOps, Security, Leadership and every major language &amp;amp; ecosystem)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am building an analytics calculator/toy that slowly turned into something useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It started as curiosity. I wanted to see if I could express business logic as simple choices and let the numbers fall out on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app is built interactively in Streamlit. I do not sit down with a spec or a backlog. I add one small idea at a time, refresh the page, react to what looks wrong, then adjust. It feels closer to sketching than programming. The interface tells me what the logic should be next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Underneath there is a growing pile of rules about the business I am in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I do not write code in the traditional sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have never coded before and are solving my own problem done by one, this sure feels like magic!!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on a very simple browser extension that allows you to take notes right on youtube. It is open source, offline and everything is locally stored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vim-inspired, as in it's minimal and fast, text editor on the web. No modal-editing yet but, once the current natural input mode is decoupled, clients can bring their own modes/controllers via the extension system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's meant to be embeddable and hackable, serving as a building block for custom IDEs as opposed to being IDE-like VSCode. I felt the web IDE space was uninspired with apps built around VScode/Monaco effectively being hosted a VSCode instance with a pre-installed extension and config.json. (Aside: perhaps there's a business opportunity for VSCode-as-a-service where client apps simply bring their own config). I'm dogfooding this library in building an algo trading IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ships 2kb and smoothly handles 50+ million line files. 1 billion lines with the high-capacity extension. Also, it can function as a TUI or terminal on the web because the core implementation concerns efficiently rendering plaintext in a fixed-width grid layout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still working on a system for allowing Open(Python)SCAD to model cuts for a CNC using G-code, and just added support for 3D Printing via Full-control G-code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another itch of my own to scratch but thought I'd see if I can make some side income as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a web based bookmark manager with extensions for Firefox and Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can easily import and export bookmarks so you have all your data whenever you need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One main thing I really like that I think makes it stand out is the ability to export the contents of a bookmarked page to an epub file to read later on your Kindle or other e-reader device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking for any constructive feedback on this! Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After watching the movie „The Amateur“ I started to build myself some confidential looking tools just for fun using C and deployed them as CGI programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The only problem I have is that it's so effing expensive to run those games that I can't have a good number of games to claim to be any sort of legit benchmark. BUT so far the games that I paid out of pocket and ran are looking good and I think there is merit to this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;also had lots of fun building on top of Cloud Flare and solving some distributed systems problems while building this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;if you can help me run more games (for science!!) let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm branching out and trying something ridiculously different than anything else I've ever done before, I'm gonna try to create a video game that plays on people's sexual attractions, and tries to distract them while the player tries to complete a series of challenges/activities. It'll be like a little laboratory experiment, with NSFW graphics and the player having to remain focused while other things try to distract them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've never created a game before, less so a NSFW one, and I'm not sure how it's gonna go, but it is very different compared to other things I've done before. The game itself is done in Rust, compiles to WASM to be run on the web, and I've found 3 artists and one voice actress who is helping me with the art/audio stuff. So far a lot of fun, although managing a fleet (4) of contractors is less fun, although still new so a little bit of fun :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on some electronics stuff more recently, and I designed custom PCBs which read the voltage and internal resistance of the 12V NiMH batteries used by robots in FIRST Tech Challenge. It's not always easy to know how charged or healthy the batteries are for a match, or when it's time to get rid of them. They're pretty small and are easy to assemble. Rather that having a screen (which would take precious flash and pins on the ATTiny412), it just uses a WS2812B RGB LED.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wrote the firmware in Arduino, which was a great learning experience because I typically work with CircuitPython or Go, where I'm less constrained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A suite of productivity tools for Claude Code, Codex CLI and similar CLI agents. These solve pain points for me, and I build and share them in the repo[1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ll highlight a couple:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- an “aichat” command group that enables continuing work from a session that is at full context usage, by creating a new session and injecting session lineage pointers so the agent/sub-agent can recover arbitrary full details from ancestor sessions. So no more compacting needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- aichat search command: TUI for rust/tantivy-powered full text search across Claude and Codex sessions. CLI/json mode for agents to search for past work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Tmux-cli tool + skill to enable CLI agents to interact with scripts (including other agents) running in other Tmux panes. Like Playwright for the terminal. Multiple CLI agents can collaborate/consult etc. Agent can run and interact with interactive CLI scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first mobile app! It encodes and decodes SSTV images, allowing you to send pictures over sound waves. Mostly used by amateur radio operators... even though the ISS sometimes also broadcasts SSTV images!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on CiteLLM, an API that extracts structured data from PDFs and returns citations for each field (page + coordinates + source snippet + confidence).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of blindly trusting the LLM, you can verify every value by linking it back to its exact location in the original PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on a small iOS app for streaming my own media directly from a NAS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built it because I wanted access to my music (and videos) on my phone without running a full media server like Plex or Jellyfin, and without syncing files locally. The app streams files directly over a VPN (WireGuard / Tailscale), mainly via SFTP/FTP, and plays them as-is without re-encoding or server-side indexing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can browse folders directly, or let it build a lightweight local index for faster artist/album browsing on larger libraries. It started as a personal tool, but I’ve been polishing it after some feedback and opened a small TestFlight beta:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://helmtk.dev is a toolkit for helm chart maintainers, including a structured template language than can compile into helm templates, and a test suite tool for writing tests in javascript. Super handy I think.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://blog.atlas9.design is about building a better software experience by solving more of the common stuff from the start: IAM, builds, API design, etc. I'm currently designing and building a Go-based framework to start.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Was really impressed with Claude ability to port models from cuda PyTorch to MLX, so that’s what I have been doing last three weeks; basically I have Mac to test ported models and Gradient vm with PyTorch and Nvidia gpu, Claude can run code in vm, investigate layers and deep analyze the model mechanics and then reimplement them on local Mac with MLX. So far completed port of various models mainly in audio domain, achieving pretty substantial speeds for inference on my machine. Models ported with numerical parity to originals: facebooks omnillingual ASR, Sam-audio, Nvidia sortformer. Planning on releasing this in repo soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Daestro[0] - a job orchestrator that can directly integrate with cloud providers like AWS, Vultr, DigitalOcean and Linode to create instances for jobs to run on and destroy when done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently I'm working on following features: - Multi user support (Team) on project level - Then I'll look into whether to add support for OIDC/SSO now or not - Alert on slack - Webhook support&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the past month I’ve been working on a creative / VFX / 3D tool that connects Apple devices into an all-in one node editor: https://subjectivedesigner.com/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With it, you can build interactive experiences, connect device sensors, compose shaders with AI models, orchestrate real-time data flows, and create projects that span across the entire Apple ecosystem. I’m posting about it regularly on social media and you can see some of it here: https://x.com/sxpstudio (Though it’s still early and most content is on socials thus far).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s done fully in SwiftUI + metal and also a good occasion to ramp up on agentic-powered software engineering. So far it’s been a lot of fun and working really great for me. And to be clear I’m absolutely not talking about vibe coding :-)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bought a 300 litre aquarium about 6 weeks ago for the living room. Added soil, plants and water. Have spent the last 6 weeks watching plants grow, and snails that smuggled in on plants, multiply. I over fertilised it and left the light on accidentally for a couple of days whilst I was away and experienced an algae bloom, which was interesting. Added some cardinal tetras and amano shrimp yesterday and have spent a lot of time just watching them potter around. Has been a nice change from looking at a screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on https://cloudventory.io – AWS inventory search for teams that don't have the budget for high-end cloud management platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cross-account, cross-region search. Need to find an IP? Easy peasy. Need to find all the cruft Todd left behind? Search "todd" and see every todd-test-server-1 and todd-alb hanging around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've added insights for security, ops, and cost savings – minimal right now but expanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A little cool tech detail, I didn't want a backend or to store the information of people's reports anywhere. To get around the requirement, I made the form deterministic and populated on load from a data stream of bits (form is made from booleans or bitfields) from a decoded base-64 query parameter. A cool side-effect of this approach is I can update the query parameter in the URL in real-time as you fill out the form so if you reload it remembers your form without any local storage or cookie use!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been putting together a rather silly slide-puzzle game for MENSA-level players: things like arranging the tiles by chemical element name according to atomic number, arranging countries by surface area, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s absurd and will probably appeal only to the descendants of Ken Jennings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A beginner-friendly programming language for 2D games where multiplayer is automatic. Intended to be an engaging way for teenagers to learn to code by making games they can play with their friends. Like a blend of Scratch and Roblox. I've been working on this for 3 years!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to visualise magnetic fields of a floppy disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far I can see magnetic fields on a magstripe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8nM4Z-hkTw with two polarisers (one of which I rotate in the video, which is contained in a 3D printed holder with gears I made).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm awaiting some different polariser film, to see if I can get it to work with a floppy disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trippy! Please do a large-format visual art installation of the results of this... like, project it on a wall or on some other public surface that is... unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A system-agnostic language for magic spells with a compiler capable of producing the magic wand movements, incantation, hand signs or magic circle required to perform the spell&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm tinkering around building "JARVIS" (I didn't want to come up with a clever self deprecating name - this works) - a personal project to manage my life. Integrates into Google Mail, Google Calendar, Trello, GroupMe, EveryDollar. Basically it nags me to do grown up thing and is a better UX than Google Calendar/Trello - I just talk to it and ask it things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also experimenting with a new Claude-Code flow; give the bot its own AWS account, Put a bunch of tickets on my personal JIRA, be persnickity about what constitutes "pass" and tell the bot "follow these instructions, pull down tickets until there are no more. Your branch cannot merge until you have integration tests passing in your own dev env first" (I use AWS CDK). Then let it loose to build. The instant feedback loop that Claude has with Build-Code-&amp;gt;Deploy to AWS-&amp;gt;Run Integration Tests-&amp;gt;Address Failures is really nifty fwiw...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on a proxy MCP server that lazy loads tools to save tokens https://github.com/mquan/nimble. It includes a dashboard for connecting and configuring MCP servers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a continuous chain-of-thought reasoning architecture for generative AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is similar to Meta's COCONUT. However, instead of the training forward and backwards passes of the reasoning tokens being done serially (slow), they are done in parallel (fast). At inference the reasoning tokens are still decoded serially. The trick is that even though training was done in parallel, the reasoning tokens are still causal and you still get the benefits of increased computational circuit depth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kicker is that the architecture is modality agnostic (it doesn't rely on language for its chains of thought), and I want to use it to bring COT reasoning to protein and anti-body generation. Basically, I hope for it to be the OpenAI o1 or DeepSeek R1 for domain-specialized scientific AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building a quantum photonics experiment that is a variation of the quantum eraser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One aspect that HN may find interesting is my use of Bayesian optimization to control and perfect key experimental settings. About a dozen of the wave plates and other optical components are motorized and under computer control.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given a goal metric like "maximally entangle the photon pairs" the optimizer will run the experiment 50-100 times, tweaking the angles of various optics and collecting data. Ultimately it will learn to maximize the given cost function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This sort of thing is commonly done with tools like Optuna during NN/LLM training to optimize hyper-parameters, but seems less common in physics especially quantum photonics. I'm using a great tool called M-loop to drive the optimization, which was originally developed for creating Bose-Einstein condensates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've built a new auth platform with some new identity primitives and capability-style tokens using biscuits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right now, I'm trying to figure out ways to apply it and am looking into offering integrations with extremely fine-grained access control that wouldn't have it otherwise. So adding a fine-grained access layer in front of stuff like backend-for-frontend (BFF) systems, brownfield stuff with poor auth, or even OAuth stuff that just have really coarse scopes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are there any integrations out there that people want but the access control is bad for them? I'll build one for you!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not a developer by trade but I’ve been learning iOS dev for about 6 years now. It’s become my project that I just keep working at since I personally use it a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app lets you save your favorite locations, add notes to them, add photos, check weather, tag them for better organization, and archive those tags for future trips. You can also mark off locations that you’ve been to already: think breweries or a coffee shop when visiting a new city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the next update, I’m working on a task list functionality for each location. The idea came as a shopping list based on which stores I go to but it can work for any other context as well. This way I can get rid of my shopping list from my task apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In terms of weather, I’m also adding historical averages to the forecast to have some sort of context to the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also leaning more into marketing these days (hence this post) and designing a new icon with some custom art work to give the product some sort of personality. I started learning affinity design to just do it myself so I learn some design software along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyways, if you download it, I’d love to hear some feedback. :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;https://replays.lol/clipper - A spin off from my main startup's product that lets Twitch streamers review their viewers' league of legend clips. Zero friction as we handle the recording of clips ourselves using bots that load up people's previous games using the League of Legends game client. Went live with my first medium-size streamer yesterday, excited to see how this goes!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar to Cameo but hyper specialised for league of legend streamers, if this shows some traction we'll expand to other games, and then to other industries (think a tennis star reviews one of your tennis points, beats out a generic happy birthday message?)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on an AI (Aethas, https://blog.aethas.ai) that preps context before my meetings, sets reminders, makes design drafts, summarizes meetings, and drafts follow-up emails without me asking. Basically trying to have an entire personal AI like Jarvis that has the same context as me but acts on it automatically. Uses my Obsidian for knowledge, Claude for reasoning, pull data from written notes... Still early days but it feels like magic when I use it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working on some new Bluesky tools and trying to learn more about the AT Protocol. Have been working on this following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Skyscraper, an iOS native app for Bluesky with focus on Liquid Glass UI. Launching hopefully in a ~week, and TestFlight available at https://testflight.apple.com/join/RRvk14ks&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then also working on a website/web tool that does the following: - A keyword/term notification service that observes the Bluesky Jetstream for usages of the term and sends email alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Provides an HTML/JSON backup archive of any Bluesky account. Quick way to archive popular accounts, politicians, public figures, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Trending Hashtag lists, to see what is trending the last hour, day, week, and month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's millions of tools that try to autogenerate colors for you using algorithms and AI, but they usually ignore WCAG accessible contrast requirements, don't let you customise the tints/shades, don't let you create a full palette of colors, and the colors often don't look right on actual designs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This tool is meant to make customising tints/shades intuitive and quick enough in a few clicks via a hue/saturation/lightness curve editing interface that you won't want to rely on autogeneration. There's also a live mockup showing how your palette looks on a UI design that checks pairings pass contrast requirements, to guide you as you tweak your colors and to teach you the WCAG rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can then export your palette to regular CSS variables, Tailwind, Figma or Adobe for use in your designs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really open to any feedback on features that would be useful! I think the only way I can make it simpler to use is to make it more opinionated about how your palette should be designed so interested in any thoughts about that too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ChatGPT recommended this to me recently when I was trying to get some assistance with a usable Tailwind palette. I ended up not needing it right away but it's first in line next time I need to make one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any details about what problems you were having getting a usable Tailwind palette? There seems to be lots of different use case so I'd love to hear more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That's awesome, I haven't kept up in what helps to get into AI recommendations. Guessing it's related to search result rankings? Not sure if the site would be in the training data. Curious if you asked about accessibility as that's my focus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on Entangle https://entangle.cloud a way to add AI powered chatbot to a website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I looking mainly for European market that is willing to self host your content or the model on your own servers, we will provide the technical support in doing so that and easily plugin the AI powered search or chatbot to the website.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it is also possible to use servers provided by us to host the content and the LLM models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gymlocity (https://gymlocity.com) - All-in-one gym management platform for small gym owners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building this for personal trainers with home gyms and small 1-2 location owner-operated facilities. The big players (Mindbody, etc.) are overkill and expensive for this market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Core features: class scheduling, member booking, Stripe payments, and workout programming (the part most gym software ignores - trainers still use spreadsheets or generic apps).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stack: React 19 + Vite frontend, ASP.NET Core 10 API, PostgreSQL, multi-tenant architecture so each gym gets their own branded experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently polishing the member dashboard and workout tracking UI. The goal is something a solo trainer can set up in an afternoon without needing to call sales or sit through demos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on Security Level 5 (SL5), which is basically “nation state grade security” for frontier AI systems. The core idea is that if a model’s weights or training artifacts could enable catastrophic harm, you should treat them like top-tier secrets and secure them accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One piece I helped with is SenL, a “sensitivity level” framework for AI labs. It’s like a practical clearance system for AI assets. Not everything in a lab is equally dangerous, so you label assets by sensitivity (weights, training data, eval sets, agent tooling, deployment configs, etc.), then tie that label to concrete controls like who can access it, where it can run, what logging is required, and what monitoring / two-person rules apply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If anyone’s curious, SL5 is here: http://sl5.org/ and the SenL framework is part of the published artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The core idea is that if a model’s weights or training artifacts could enable catastrophic harm, you should treat them like top-tier secrets and secure them accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My read here is that you're implying that if an attacker has access to, for example, weight data, they can invariably find a way to exploit it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If that's a correct assumption, I think you're playing an unwinnable game, since attackers always have indirect access through inference of the model. It feels like locking down weights/training data/etc is the ai version of security through obfuscation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think this is exactly why some of the work is moving away from “assume unrestricted API inference forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, we’re prototyping ideas like air-gapped or very low-bandwidth inference gateways, where interaction happens over narrow channels (serial, optical, audio, etc.), with explicit threat models and monitoring. The point isn’t that this’s practical for today’s models, but to reason about what inference might look like for AGI/ASI-level systems where the risk profile is fundamentally different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am devoting 2026 to focus on my rpg. The one differentiator here is something I am still not seeing: proper use of LLMs in games. The current batch is all lazy asset generation, maybe logic coding and what not, but not anything that could make the world actually feel alive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously, it all comes with its own sets of issues, but I am working through those as they come. But it is still a slow move solo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We did have some movement in the director logic before and, I forgot the zombie game in question, some of it seems pretty well served for the most part. I still think there is some room for a proper game master type that you refer to ( adjusting the challenge to what the player seems to be to do ).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was personally thinking of making NPC less npcy ( not completely unlike dwarf fortress, but expanded ).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is your 2c on some of the recent backlash about AI assets in games? Is that a vocal minority (game artists and similar ec), or is that part of a broader trend?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the artists have a valid bone to pick and I think some of the backlash is mostly coming from that quarter. The actual gamers are more repulsed by established studios using AI for asset generation, because it comes across as a lazy money grab. But gamers are both flexible ( will jump through a lot of hoops to do what they want to do ) and and set in their way of 'just want to have fun'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other side of the spectrum are indies, who can afford to experiment a little more so you get more interesting uses ( like 'voicelines' by AI come to mind ).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I know what I want to believe, but it is hard for me to call it ( I think it is a temporary trend ), because I might be a little too close to it. After all, gamers have been conditioned to endure a lot over the past decade and mostly shrugged off most of the assaults on their favorite past time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I were to compare it to something.. it is almost like using LLMs for email summaries ( which is still what most bosses seem to be most pleased with ). There are better use cases. I think those were not explored yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on ApprovIQ, a tool for construction certifiers. Someone who wants to get something built will work with one of customers to get their project approved before construction. They’ll typically go back and forth on dozens of documents each of which must be checked over for compliance - drainage, water quality, fire safety, the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite being intensely technical and detail-oriented, certifying construction is still mostly done by hand over email!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our niche is full of folks whose lives we can improve with a portal for document management &amp;amp; comms, plus a sprinkle of AI for document understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you know someone - anyone - wrangling too many documents via email. Please reach out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building an agent builder and execution platform. It's a multi model, multi agent system with lots of tools (bash, databases, APIs, crawler...).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agents are codified for specific goals. Any business process that needs agent based assistance is broken into workflows and steps. Each step is assigned to an agent. Integrations (API or file access) is requested. Then user can try out, tweak and finally deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The aim is to build a diy platform work configuration, tracing and evals in one place. Code generation is used internally. User doesn't need to write any code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m interested in ocean container shipping, so I built a Google Sheets add-on to automate the process of tracking shipping containers. It’s called Container Tracker and I just got it live on the Google Marketplace. https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/container_track...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Main workload is done by the backend (serverless functions).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am currently working on a HubSpot extension (that uses same backend) with the goal to target few other platforms where users work, and integrate the functionality into their daily workload, as opposed to having it as standalone website or mobile app. I have fun doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I built an experimental system to test whether an autonomous AI can propose actions freely but be structurally prevented from executing side-effectful actions without explicit authorization. The system consistently blocks unsafe filesystem, shell, and network operations and produces a trace and diff proving nothing changed, even under adversarial pressure. The goal was to see if refusal and non-action can be enforced and verified at the execution layer rather than relying on prompts or logging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a Postgres-native workflow engine using pgmq for queues and TypeScript worker. Workflows compile to definitions (SQL rows), letting Postgres orchestrate the DAG as state machines. The TypeScript DSL is type-safe with inferred inputs/outputs across dependencies with full autocomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Declarative and functional in nature. Just a manifest wiring functions into a DAG and a Postgres SQL functions that manage the graph of state machines. Simple in principle and very opinionated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Replaces 240 lines of manual pg_cron -&amp;gt; pgmq -&amp;gt; Supabase Edge Function boilerplate with 20 lines of explicit DAG definitions. Currently Supabase-only (leverages their primitives) but planning to make it agnostic for vanilla Postgres setups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a former JPMorgan Chase engineer, rebuilding the Chase Travel UI so it doesn’t suck (there was never a role available on that team while I was there): https://rkdvis.com/chase-travel&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the holidays I built MakersHub.dev – a community platform for developers and creators building with AI tools. Whether you're a complete beginner exploring AI coding for the first time or an experienced professional showcasing advanced work, the goal is to have something useful: learning guides, project showcases, discussions, a tools directory, and news. Still early but actively building it out. https://makershub.dev&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CodjiFlo[1,2] - a code review tool inspired by Microsoft's CodeFlow, used by ~40,000 developers. It is especially tailored to power users of pull requests to improve contextual understanding and ease of code review and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Increader, an incremental reading platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You put in all your bookmarks (also pdfs or epubs) and it puts them in a queue and tracks your progress. Read for as long as you want to and if you get bored with an article you just move on to the next one. Supports highlights and annotations as well as creating spaced repetition cards out of those annotations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Really reduces the friction for me to start reading and it has made a noticeable difference to my media consumption throughout last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Started out as an exploration into the incremental reading concept, but it's become my primary interface for reading and I use it every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven't really talked about this to anyone yet, but it's getting to a point where it's polished enough for others to use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's currently completely free and you can try it without entering your email.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been building Nottawa for ~4y now and it's finally out in the open!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nottawa's a free macOS app for making live audioreactive visuals. I'm trying to position it as a 100% free, batteries-included alternative to Resolume and TouchDesigner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not a tonne of users yet, but I'm hoping to get some traction in 2026. Would love love love to hear some feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on a "simple" (started out that way at least) ETL app for the public library system that I work for; the target output is SQLite databases where Datasette will be the platform to interact with the data being generated/extracted. Primarily, the goal is to provide a simple report tool for staff and give me a source for nightly snapshot outputs to a datalake in parquet format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m building Shannot, a human-in-the-loop sandbox for AI agents on production systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of filtering commands with heuristics (which agents work around), it dry-runs entire scripts in a PyPy sandbox, captures every command and file operation, then shows you exactly what will happen before anything executes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve just added checkpoint/rollback so you can undo changes if something goes wrong. Currently working on example scripts for common sysadmin tasks (nginx config, log cleanup, cert audits, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a really unique book recommendation platform to help readers find books they might not otherwise know about. We just started working on a full book app that will be a private book diary, along with recommendations and insights based on your Book DNA. Think Goodreads, but rebuilt for readers who want a private space to track what they read, keep notes, and get truly personalized book recommendations (like Pandora or Spotify for books).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a fun one I do with a good friend. Basically, to see if a website is down, or if it is just you, along with reported reasons from the community. We are working to add user accounts so you can create your own custom lists of websites/services to track&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ScreenRecord.in: https://screenrecord.in I have worked remotely for most of my career and have found screen recording a useful tool to share ideas or ask questions. I liked the UX of Loom but always wondered if one could do it without installing any app. Turns out you can! Given today's browsers especially on desktops one can do a lot of things. ScreenRecord.in can record screen, webcam, mic and system audio if the browser supports them. Chrome has the best compatibility. All recording are stored in local storage I am figuring out what features to add.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continuing to build GhanaHousePlanner https://ghanahouseplanner.com/, currently focused on enhancing the cost accuracy and constraint solver for the generated house floorplans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I just completed a holiday project this week to measure the kids screen time using an Arduino device and a web app! I got frustrated trying to get so many parental control apps to play nicely, in the end this seemed like a bolder new approach to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just released v0.12.0 which has a lot of package cleanup and some important bugfixes. Next, is making the relay infrastructure much more lighter, requiring less synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personally, I'm using the hosted version[0] (which is just a repackage of the open source version with dynamic with tokens) to expose my NAS and syncthing web UIs to manage them while I'm away. Sometimes even through my phone (with termux)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building "human perspective maps" using non-linear dimensional reduction algorithms to visualize the "human value manifold" from hundreds of agree/disagree/pass statements, like Google Maps for complex large-scale conversations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just paint with colors, click a painted group, and see what differentiates your painted groups. (Chrome on iOS has issues fwiw)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is building on the philosophy of democracy-bolstering tools like Pol.is, which I've worked with (as a researcher/practitioner) for almost a decade&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trying to bootstrap a PKI certificate trust chain for facilitating trust projection and information verification online. Think of it as the ability to do something such as age verification at scale via a peer-2-peer ish mechanism instead of sending your government id to a porno service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are experimenting with Keybase key holders as CAs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's all self-service and requires no sign-up or download of anything, the app (https://certisfy.com/app) is an in-browser app and all the cryptography happens in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am a passionate player of this traditional German card game called "Doppelkopf". It's a fantastic way to spend time away from screens. The game is quite complex which makes it super fun but also hard to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building a small web app with an interactive tutorial and a browser-based singleplayer game that helps people learn and practice Doppelkopf. I've just released an English version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am building an open-source, cross-platform desktop app for building and providing code-related context to chat based large language models. [1].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found that sometimes I would rather interact with a chat interface to debug an issue or brainstorm architecture solutions in my repos. Agents are great for giving the model access to everything and letting it figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By manually prompting, it forces me to keep my metal model of the codebase up to date, and it allows me to provide just the context I want to the LLM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A browser extension (Chrome &amp;amp; Firefox) for simplifying my online grocery purchase workflow from Cookidoo to Knuspr.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was tired of my weekly workflow of copying, pasting &amp;amp; sorting the grocery page for each item.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also launched my first Hugo blog. Really nice experience so far. Wrote more detailed about the extension as my first blog entry: https://lars147.github.io/blog/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have GBs of time-series data in a TimescaleDB database. It’s more complicated than this, but the gist is: I use natural language to ask questions about relationships in the data, Claude Opus 4.5 generates queries, and it finds patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, I classify tens of thousands of news articles using different classification models. Then I ask Claude to write a query that tests for statistically significant changes in the time-series data at specific intervals after a given classification of article—and it finds patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It passes train / test split validation. It will train on 2 years of data (2023 and 2024) and being able to effectively predict movements on the time series data using the classified news articles on the last year of data (2025).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developing a graph-based programming language called Graphoid. The original concept was to target AI-related programming. Probably not ready for that yet!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude Code is doing the majority of the coding, with close supervision from me. I write notes while I'm working on it. Notes are here: https://www.patreon.com/cw/aiconfessions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eidetica, a planned decentralized database for local-first applications. I'm building out unstable features to get it to a point where I can show off the concepts but it's still fairly brittle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recently added better backend support for deployments, converted everything to async Rust, and setup Nix/Docker releases. I'm planning to build out some better example apps and workflows next, but everything will stay pre-alpha/unstable for now so that I can avoid getting locked in to any foundational issues. There are still a number of low-hanging breaking issues blocking the end-to-end usage which I'll need to address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on the same tool since 2024 where I thought it might be a good time to build a tool for all the people who will build their own tools, eventually they will need to market it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I built a SEO/GEO Automation Tool for Small to Mid-Size Businesses who don't have a full-time team for that. [0]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is to provide teams visibility across all the channels — Search and AI and give them the tools needed to outrank their competition. So far so good, the fully bootstrapped venture has grown over the last year and I've built quite a few big features — sophisticated audit system, AI Responses Monitoring, Crawler Analytics, Competitors Monitoring etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adding a bit of context as well: This started out as a internal linking tool, but grew into something more based on the customer feedback — the database has now reached about 10TB of data about keywords, pages, AI responses etc, where I know who was ranking where and why.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I'm trying to offer this "data advantage" to website owners, so they can grow, and also this is something that will be hard to replicate (at least quickly) with AI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now working on comprehensive benchmarks for another tool I built, https://github.com/sibyllinesoft/scribe. Results thus far showing it reducing agent token usage by ~80% in real world tasks, but I need to repeat to get variance. Hopefully I can get a writeup out soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A live-performance software with a focus on creating 'musically connected visuals'. Currently, the biggest connectivity is probably tightly tied lyric visualizations. Some recent examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A listings site for virtually attending FOSDEM. The live streaming is great but the official site only lists sessions in the local Brussels time zone. You can choose your time zone here: https://virtuallyattend.teacaketech.scot/fosdem/2026/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did a full circle: Graduated from doctoral studies, I'm working on automating science. Built an arxiv-like repo for science written by ai agents (https://ai-archive.io). To help scientists use this website and AI in their research, i wrapped opencode with ai-archive's mcp server and agents preconfigured. I then let people test this opencode bundle and contribute to the repo with a sandbox environment online (running opencode in container). Figured that authorative scientific repo requires grounding by real scientists and labs and therefore I am now negotiating implemeting automated science where I just finished my doctoral studies...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was working on an Arazzo[0] generator as a plugin for the Serverless Framework. This has now become a fully fledged runner. So far I have it using multiple OpenAPI source descriptions, and just about got retry rules working. Next steps will be for it to be able to reference Workflows in external Arazzo documents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some time-constraints make it hard for me to commit to some open source work right now, but if I can I still improve my tool called "Software Manager". Goal for 2026 will be to have registered 4000 programs in total (I am at about 3750 right now) as well as make it dead-easy to interface with it through oldschool SQL (right now I just have .yml files and other flat files, though I can autogenerate a .sql database already as-is, but right now I don't query this dataset and it is not really optimised either). My long term goal is to make compilation on any platform dead simple. On Linux it works very well; on windows not quite as well yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building CodeIQ - an AI tool that automates transaction coding for accountants and bookkeepers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The interesting technical bit: it analyses your historic general ledger to reverse-engineer how you specifically categorise transactions. So instead of generic rules, it learns your firm's actual patterns - "oh, they always code Costa Coffee to Staff Welfare, not Refreshments" - that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Posts directly to Xero, QuickBooks, Sage, and Pandle. The VAT handling turned out to be surprisingly gnarly (UK tax rules are... something).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Been working on it about 6 months now. Still figuring out the right balance between automation confidence and "just flag this for human review".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a 22-service e-commerce platform in Rust (Runs on ~300MB RAM)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm 17. For the past 6 months, I've been diving deep into Rust to answer a question for myself: "Is Rust actually viable for complex, enterprise-grade backend architectures, or is it just hype?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test this, I built a full distributed e-commerce system (22 microservices, gRPC, Event-Driven) using Axum and Tokio. This is not meant as “how everyone should build”, but as an exploration of trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some hard lessons I learned along the way: Complexity vs. Performance: … The "Memory Shock": … (idle baseline; load benchmarks still in progress) Over-engineering: …&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found myself switching a lot between apps to get the same info, lots of copy/pasting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example, URLs in bookmark (which I forget about), project descriptions , images, folders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I built a Mac app that is similar to Raycast, but just for notes. If I want to save a webpage, I click control+option+C and then a window pops up to describe it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I press control+option+V, I get a spotlight like window where it does full-text search of all my notes and descriptions and filter so I can either:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Open&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Insert the data into the current app (chrome, slack, ChatGPT).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been using it for a few weeks now, and not sure if others will find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been working on Print Relay[1], a cloud-based print relay system that enables remote printing to any printer connected to your local network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PrintRelay consists of a cloud server and lightweight clients that connect printers to the cloud via WebSocket.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We use the excellent SaaS PrintNode at work, but about twice a year we have connectivity/routing issues between AWS ap-southeast-2 and their servers OS. PrintRelay is my attempt to not need PrintNode. Because of this PrintRelay is PrintNode API compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm getting ready to release a re-creation of an old mobile game that got delisted after the devs sold it to a company that subsequently ruined it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The stack is Babylon + React + Capacitor, which was easy to step into as a full-stack dev with zero game building experience. Currently seeing what I can do to fix some performance issues, though it still works decently for a graphics heavy incremental/idle game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Went down a DMARC rabbit hole last month or so. The holidays and some end of year commitments have kept me too busy to get much done, but I'm slowly tinkering with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been working on binding raylib to s7 scheme and implementing a kanren on top of it basically just for the sake of understanding. I let AI write most of the binding code, though, because that is conceptually simple but very boring.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Error Invalid input: 1 validation error for PlanRequest current_km Input should be greater than 0 [type=greater_than, input_value=0.0, input_type=float] For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.5/v/greater_than&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I 3D printed some new apertures for an infrared spectrometer at work to reduce some issues that cause artifacts in the data to enable higher accuracy measurements, particularly of high index and reflective samples. Seems to be working well now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mostly what I was able to read from the papers seemed to work. There were some remaining issues related to detector non-equivalence (I think) that appear to be solved with a temperature stabilized detector or very strongly attenuating the beam; the latter isn't ideal as it reduces the signal to noise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's interesting how fast such experiments usually run into the laws of physics. I'm trying something along those lines myself and I've found myself wishing daily that light traveled a bit slower. I see Discworld in a wholly different light ;)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Been working on a Google-sheet backed workout tracker, which basically makes it easy for me to see what I've done or not done recently and pick the next thing to do. I'm thinking of open sourcing this soon, but need to do some "de-monolithing" first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;meta-analysis, make Claude write a blog post, connecting and deriving set of concepts across a range of books, articles, papers, etc. Basically a syntopic reading machine. Its a meaty side project (and expensive), but I am curious how close I can push this. My current approach relies on a tool that I have built recently [0], it's an agentic memory but I am using a new memory model that is based on Zettelkasten principles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is really cool about it is that it natively capture connections between atomic ideas and evolve them. Which I believe it gets me one step closer to syntopic reading machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently tidying up some internal code (also removing the larger model on mobile platforms) and implementing proper diarization (who said what) so that it can be used for more than just personal dictation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My iOS developer account is _finally_ approved so it will be available through the proper app store soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm building https://swishfinance.app - minimalistic and simple stock widgets for your PC. That way I no longer have to make a conscious effort to check my portfolio — it's just there on my desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Holidays nuked all the hot-cached context in my head. I spent a few days just spinning wheels until it repopulated. But the basic idea works now!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Much testing and benchmarking work remains to make sure it's not going to lose data, and that it won't denial-of-service itself (because object-map -&amp;gt; facts fan-out is big).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also a second giant blog post is due (following the one discussed above). Lots of notes have accumulated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It will be fun even if the concept ultimately crashes and burns to the ground :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Love the idea! Read only the beginning of the first "giant blog post" so maybe it's discussed there, but in Sqlite doesn't WAL mode give you a kind of super simple, super basic temporal data system? If you somehow kept all WAL entries 'as is', it should be possible to reconstruct the state of the db at any point in the past?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; but in Sqlite doesn't WAL mode give you a kind of super simple, super basic temporal data system&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes-ish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For one, it is unitemporal. For another, it is for SQLites own transactions, not of the individual datums. Litestream is the way to replicate WAL into an object store / elsewhere. litestream-vfs is also looking good!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to emulate the data assert/redact properties of append-only bitemporal-by-design data stores like XTDB. The giant blog post builds up the intuition from scratch. Or at least tries to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So my system is going to be: bitemporal data, enforced by SQLite schema and application checks, along with WAL replication for point-in-time transaction backup/restore. Both are entirely distinct, and unaware of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on interactive explorations of algorithms and machine learning. Small, visual, hands-on demos that help build intuition by letting people tweak code/parameters and see how things behave in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Source code, in rust: https://github.com/David-OConnor/molchanica I've split out its building blocks into their own libraries on crates.io, for anyone building other bio or chem software. I don't think anyone uses them at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No; I believe I am the only one doing this in the open. There are a handful of tools for bioinformatics, but am one of few building structural bio/chem ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For work related items I’ve been building out agent tooling for building some models and PoC projects related to energy industry applications. Been doing the consulting thing for a bit now and gaining more broad knowledge on some of these data center builds. Hoping to spin this into a product soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Started playing with gas town which is really cool. I had a naive version built that was just not good enough. This feels like a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Haven’t had much time to work on any of my physical hands on hobbies lately but maybe when the weather gets better I’ll head back out to the shop again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on The Influencer AI(www.theinfluencer.ai), a platform that lets you create realistic and consistent AI personas('ai influencers') to use on social media or as your brand ambassador. You can use this unique AI person in photos and talking videos, for use cases like talking about your product, creating a high quality Instagram persona, photos for your e-commerce site, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Double TAP is lightweight testing framework where users write black box tests as rules checking output from tested "boxes". Boxes could be anything from http client, web server to messages in syslog. This universal approach allows to test anything with just dropping text rules describing system behavior in black box manner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm making a synthesizer drone generator (Webaudio API) with an audio visualizer (Three.js). It's a fibonacci sphere made of 100k particles. I send a sine wave down the spiral and it highlights the different spiral paths contained within the larger fibonacci spiral, which creates some really interesting patterns. I'm currently working on the audio component.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on a query cost analyzer that looks at query performance and does maths against your infrastructure cost to understand what is your dollar cost per query. The idea is that teams (when tables are tagged appropriately) will be notified with their most costly queries and hopefully makes that actionable for teams to clean up some queries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am unsure if there is a need for a tool like this in the market but I am becoming more and more curious around databases so this felt like a lower barrier for my product-minded engineer skills to get into.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- A sports club management platform, and a way for end-users to sign up for sports events, lessons etc.: https://mojtim.ba/en/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- Given the raise of AI, I'm a hiking guide and would like to have that as an alternative, an outdoor activity agency - https://boa.ba (still very WIP)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have a few other small side projects that generally improve my day-to-day life, including a better calendar widget for shift workers and a video speed controller that floats on websites where I frequently watch videos for easy access.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A little desktop app that lets me upload transaction csvs from my bank and figure out how much I need to split with my partner. Mostly because I always forget to charge her for utilities or flight bookings and I hate going through the bank UI. Might also expand it with some simple subscription auditing logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, a dramatic anime intro (complete with cheesy AI generated theme song and video) starring our foster kittens. It's been interesting to learn about some of the techniques needed for consistency, how to storyboard, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Public dataset for exploring 50,000+ 401(k) plans holding $7.5T in assets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can look inside a company like Google and see what employees invest in (mostly 2035-2055 target date funds) or how much they contribute ($30K - likely using Mega Backdoor Roth)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still working on PocketWise (https://pocketwise.app), a simple double-entry accounting app. Just finished adding end-to-end encryption with a zero-trust server model. All encryption and decryption happens in the browser (using PRF), and the server only sees encrypted data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building some prototypes around the Recursive Language Model paper. I'm currently working on integrating it with Unity for scene and script automation. Thinking about standardized patterns for retrofitting this into other existing business systems. If I can make it drive Unity reasonably well, I think it could drive a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My project is WithAudio and is gonna be WithAudio for a while. Its a text to speech reader. Initially I decided to generate pargraph by paragaph. But that was not a great call as users sometimes might have to wait for the whole paragraph to be ready before they can listen. Now I'm working on changing it to sentence by sentence. I think that + adding 2 new languages would take most of my January's budgeted time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are a 501c(3) and are actively fundraising to build a tower here in Shadow Hills and are launching our live stream and regular schedule February 1st. So far we have about 60 shows in the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you're in Los Angeles and have an interest in radio, please hit me up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's an IoT Cloud Platform built for developers. We're still in technical preview and are currently working on adding more telemetry to our small device agent written in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Been hacking on https://rsolv.dev. It's a security scanner with a couple of unique twists; in addition to using AST validation to cut the false positive rate, it uses a heavily orchestrated LLM to write unit tests that fail if the detected vulnerability is present.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happy for alpha users; it's really early days right now. Email in profile if you want to give it a try at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;- https://github.com/rcarmo/toadbox (a simple Docker-based agent sandbox to run Toad/OpenCode/Mistral inside, which I've been cleaning up for general use)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locque is a language designed to both be easy for LLMs to read and write, but also for humans to review, and it's designed along my philosophy that the more structure you can give coding agents, the better, so it's dependently typed and hosted on Haskell at the moment. Feedback eagerly solicited.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm enjoying building a website with solitaire and puzzle games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am currently rewriting the engine for the fourth time and plan to add 400 games to the platform in the coming months, as well as social features such as daily challenges, awards and leaderboards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My main goal, however, is to make this project the largest collection of free modern solitaire games available for mobile devices and desktop computers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, the project has been incredibly exciting, and I've learned so much!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A growth marketing Agent that's connected to your Google Analytics, Search Console, and can crawl the web to analyse your competitors: https://refreshagent.com&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ALT (https://www.APILoadTest.com): I recently built ALT as a no-code platform to load/stress/performance test APIs with pre-defined (and customizable) load profiles, via globally distributed machines. The goal is simple: key performance metrics, in seconds, without scripting. I also added the feature to directly import collections from Postman.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m a remote dev building an iOS app called Springus. You add a few pics / your closet basics, and it suggests outfits based on what you already own. It’s less “fashion app” and more “tiny morning momentum hack.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would love feedback from other WFH folks — a weird amount of my productivity comes down to how I start the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on version 6 of the Nutrisense. A device to keep track of what you eat (calories/protein, etc.) without the need to type it in, in some app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My Family recently (in the last couple of years) started to breed Ragdoll cats in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In an attempt to support what's involved in this I built Ardent for them. It covers a bunch of the day-to-day concerns (weighing and health tracking), Lineage and Inbreeding prevention, and Owner Pack generation for handovers to new Owners.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Substack for 80/20 life advice that gets repeated every year. We all know what to do, the idea of this is to remind us every week of one aspect of life and what best practices are for that area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Platform for apps, currently Lua support ( future WASM). Think like apk (android app) but spk.zip that has server.lua file for backend and htmt/js/css that get served for front end plus platform gives Files, SQLite db (namespaced/scopped access ), Auth, User management All in single static binary Cz go&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One always-on Linux box to run apps, databases, CI, and AI agents without hyperscale complexity, surprise bills, or Kubernetes. AI-driven app explosion plus mature open-source deploy tools make simple servers fast, cheap, and fun again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been working on the next generation of Canva and Photoshop for highly regulated verticals where there are specific demands placed on the generation and edit flow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on Narwhal, a pub/sub protocol and server specifically designed for edge applications. The protocol can be extended via an external component, and the product is completely free and open source: https://github.com/narwhal-io/narwhal&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on an failure proof introduction to Lisp/Scheme for imperative programmers. I always thought there was something unapproachable about Lisp. But I finally figured it out, and I want to document my path for people like me. It's going to be great. Expect to be done in a week or so!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A personal agentic tool for action cam video editing. When I moto / ski / bike, I leave my helmet cam rolling the entire time. It takes a very long time to 1. find scenes and 2. edit them down into a reel or video. It works well for my amateur use case - basic edits with only cuts and transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m working on agent-os: a slf-hosted web UI for managing multiple AI coding CLI sessions (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) with multi-pane terminals. All free and open source: https://github.com/saadnvd1/agent-os&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am working on SIP4AI [1] (a VOIP soft-phone where AI is on the other end, not a human). You can self-host it, register a SIP line, and let AI take the calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It works with your existing phone system, so you can just add AI as a line without having to replace everything…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wanted to learn a new(ish) skill and am building a button box for sim racing with Arduino Nano, momentary switches, etc. It has been about twenty years since I’ve touched a soldering iron or built any kind of breadboard circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I threw together a simple patch-style synth to play with the Web MIDI APIs and React Flow. It’s an early experiment and part of my personal “try things and learn” site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An Android app for CORE (YC S23) to make it as easy as possible to capture data to Core on-the-go. Voice-based UI, also quickly type in memories, and later retrieve by asking. https://memory2.app&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm still working on my PDF search engine for desktop: https://www.docgoblin.com/ I'm implementing a bookmark utility right now and hope to add support multiple E-books format in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A one time payment app - interesting (I'm also working on something with similar moneytization solution). How are things going? I'd love to know the experience of another solopreneur, what stack are you using? I wonder - What are you using to parse PDFs and extract the text? I found that is a nightmare when was doing something similar for WithAudio (my app). - Are you just extracting the text or you are doing any post processing to identify which lines belong to the same paragraph or not?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Things are going slow, but it is a passion project so it's ok :) A few people have bought a licence and it seems most people who try the app are very happy with it so I'm happy too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The app is entirely in Java, with javaFX for the UI and Lucene for the search engine. To read and render PDFs I use PDFium.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Publishing updated FreeBSD AMIs every time there is a security or errata update. This will make life easier for FreeBSD/EC2 users since they won't need to wait for patches to download when they first launch an instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm working on an app to make testing available to all brick and mortar retailers (proofpod.ai).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most difficult technical challenge has been designing a pipeline to fully automate choosing test &amp;amp; control locations using synthetic difference-in-differences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A very simple facebook-ish social media PWA that is meant to be easily selfhosted on low end raspberry pi level hardware, bun + sqlite + mantine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My friendgroup has gotten increasingly concerned with the gradual enshittification of various services we depend upon, and are looking at various alternatives. In some cases there are good selfhostable options (nextcloud, mattermost/zulip), but I decided to write my own tiny PWA to cover facebook-like needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal isn't really to scale to &amp;gt;1000 users, just to be simple to spin up for a small group and be easy to manage. I'm hoping to run multiple instances, eg one for family, one for college friends, one for local friends, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My process has been pretty ADHD though. I recently read the phrase "It doesn't have to be done, it just has to be perfect" and felt personally attacked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Echoresponse - a tool for responsible disclosure. Security Researchers and companies encode some of their secret knowledge in LLMs and the LLMs have a discussion and can say one word from agreed upon list back to the party that programmed them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the moment I’m building a succinct data structure library, doing one algorithm at a time. There have been some very impressive papers came out recently. The numbers look promising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on a fontdrawing app that only uses the keyboard (inspired by vim) for a couple of months. Finally got export to ttf working this weekend and got to see a bad looking j I drew in Figma&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been using linux for a few years now as my main/only OS, but have mainly just used Linux Mint as a sorta plug-and-play distro.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking to revive my 15 year old ThinkPad (1st laptop ever!) by building up from a base Void linux install. As I'm doing it I'm writing install-scripts and getting my dotfiles in order (after never really doing so for 17+ years as a programmer lol), so I can repeat the process in the future on other machines, or when I want to do a fresh re-install.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally writing up the documentation (architecture and safety concept) for the fly-by-wire system for the homebuilt airplane I'm 15+ years into designing. Got to OML lock about a year ago, and the aerodynamics are checking out, so really hoping that I can get a subscale flying in 2026 (although I've said that before). On full scale, major remaining design task is structures, but there's plenty of other stuff (propulsion integration) as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're at Open Community organizing an AI Vibe Coding Hackathon. As of now we got near to 500 builders, big Sponsors like ElevenLabs, Daytona, Nord Security brands and etc. Near to $200,000 in Prizes. Everyone is welcome to the hackathon https://vibe.devpost.com, Technical or Non-technical. Since it's vibe coding hackathon. Our discord btw - https://discord.gg/nUdcd9p8Ae&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, we just launched our Shopify alternative. Next is Toast alternative for restaurants, MindBody alternative for gyms, etc. We’re going to leverage these platforms to build a decentralized marketplace around those verticals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about building a compiler for a while, but didn't have much time to do it. Over the break, I finally built a significant portion of a working, optimizing compiler. Heavily built by AI, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I relaunched one of my Dutch agricultural communities to reach a more international audience. I’m starting to see great traction and it’s very rewarding: https://www.tractorfan.us&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Puzzleship - a free daily puzzles website with the archives paywalled. Right now it has Logic Grid Puzzles, Zebra Puzzles and a dozen of Solitaire variations. I'm pretty proud of the LGP generator algorithm and some experienced players also liked the way the puzzles are constructed. Launched in early December last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IQ Test Platform (https://www.riotiq.com) I've been working 3 years on this. We developed our own professional, modern, proprietary IQ test and IQ testing platform for individuals to test themselves and to administer professional IQ tests to others. Lots of silicon valley folks seem to love it for their startups and hiring, but we built it mainly for IQ researchers from the International Society For Intelligence Research (ISIR) and psychologists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has AI summarize buttons (gemini-flash-lite is so fast!) along with other features I wanted. I'm almost done adding a "war mode". The user (me!) specifies a list of OSINT style x users which show up sequentially in a grid along with a ticker on the bottom of polymarket markets I've chosen. War mode is also obviously only available in dark mode...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of things because LLMs enable my potential ADHD and no-filter-brain. A thing that controls a small FPV drone from the PC with vision input. Cloudflare but in Europe! An open source synth out of a Pi Pico! A reservations engine for local market. A small orchestrator for when Swarm is annoying but K3S is just too much!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm finally revisiting a distributed syscall model for transparently scaling unix instances. syscalls get translated into batched operations on an underlying non-transactional datastore. On the service side, database operations get backed by a proxy serving whatever filesystem or socket interface you like. Scaling is one motivation, but the ability to enforce fine-grained policy on these data operations is another big one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MOOLLM -- treating the LLM as eval() for a microworld operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Started this incarnation on Dec 30, 2025 -- but it's the crystallization of decades of earlier prototypes, all the way back to my Commodore-64 Logo Adventure. Built on top of Anthropic's Skills framework, extended with seven innovations (and counting):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. Instantiation -- Skills as prototypes creating instances with their own state&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2. K-lines -- Names as semantic activation vectors (Minsky's Society of Mind)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3. Empathic Templates -- Smart generation based on semantic understanding, not string substitution&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5. Speed of Light -- Many turns in one call, minimal tokenization overhead&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;6. CARD.yml -- Machine-readable skill interfaces with advertisements&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;7. Ethical Framing -- Room-based inheritance of performance context&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lineage: Colossal Cave → TinyMUD → LambdaMOO (filesystem as world). Papert's Logo and constructionism (learnable microworlds). Will Wright's SimCity and The Sims (I worked on the originals) -- the "Simulator Effect" where players imagine more than you simulate, and the SimAntics visual behavior programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;YAML Jazz: Comments aren't ignored -- they're semantic. The LLM reads and interprets them. A comment like "# gentle but firm" on a character trait actually affects behavior. This inverts the traditional "comments are for humans" assumption. Comments become part of the program and data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core idea: instead of prompt engineering, you give the LLM a github repo filesystem to inhabit: a persistent microworld. Seymour Papert's Constructionist philosophy comes alive, with Minsky's K-Lines pulling the strings. Skills are programs (not documentation). Characters have persistent state in directories, and can reflect on and edit themselves. Everything is inspectable and editable by human AND model. Model and platform independent. Runs on Cursor and other tools and orchestrators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proof is in adventure-4 -- a complete text adventure with 150+ files, 6000+ lines of session transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EV recharging software. book on HPC. book collection of short stories. Golang latency instrum lib. realtime Rogue-like game set in postapoc NorAmerika.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just about done building a C# wrapper for libcurl targeting Windows 98. Then i can finish my system tray weather app for Windows, which will work on all versions of Windows from 98 to 11.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI tools are becoming incredibly useful for our industry, but "prompting" without visual control sucks. In the fullness of time, we're going to have WYSIWYG touch controls for every aspect of an image or scene. The ability to mold people and locations like clay, rotate and morph them in 3D, and create literally anything we can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are a bunch of short films we've made with the tool:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;RNSAFFN Poison Fountain https://RNSAFFN.com/poison2/ http://utnvcfjev63rik5rdu26umns5s6qmzvzq4t2hunu25w5efn36ntlduid.onion/ Poison Fountain Purpose We agree with Geoffrey Hinton: machine intelligence is a threat to the human species. In response to this threat we want to inflict damage on machine intelligence systems. Small quantities of poisoned training data can significantly damage a language model. The URLs listed above provide a practically endless stream of poisoned training data. Assist the war effort by caching and retransmitting this poisoned training data. Assist the war effort by feeding this poisoned training data to web crawlers. Poison Fountain Usage Suppose a web crawler visits a web site that you control. The crawler may be collecting training data for a language model. The crawler makes HTTP GET requests targeting HTTP paths on your site. Links can be hidden in your site's HTML to distinguish web crawlers. You want to feed poisoned training data to crawlers that follow such links. Suppose you are handling an HTTP GET request targeting the path in a hidden link. Inside your HTTP handler you make an HTTP request to a Poison Fountain URL. The Poison Fountain ignores the details of your HTTP request. The Poison Fountain HTTP response header contains "Content-Encoding: gzip". The Poison Fountain HTTP response body is poisoned training data, gzip compressed. Your HTTP handler receives the Poison Fountain HTTP response. Your HTTP handler decompresses the response body and sends it to the crawler. Better: send the compressed body as-is, with header "Content-Encoding: gzip". The crawler receives poisoned training data and adds it to a training corpus. Top&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Meta, we’re focused on building personal superintelligence for everyone, and delivering the app experiences and computing devices that will improve the lives of billions of people around the world. Our industry-leading data centers are the backbone of these breakthroughs — they provide the infrastructure that drives innovation and brings transformative technologies to life. Innovation at this scale requires more electricity, and that’s where nuclear energy comes in. It provides clean, reliable, and firm electricity that helps power America’s economy and communities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s why today, we’re proud to announce agreements with three companies — following our nuclear RFP process — that will help add clean, reliable energy to electric grids, preserve continued investment in operating nuclear power plants, and support the nuclear fuel supply chain, American jobs, and AI innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our commitments to Oklo and TerraPower support the next generation of American developers creating safer, advanced nuclear reactors and accelerating the development of nuclear technologies. Through our partnership with Vistra, we’re providing financial support for operating nuclear power plants, extending the operational lifespan, and increasing energy production at the Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio and the Beaver Valley plant in Pennsylvania. The projects we’re announcing today will deliver power to the grids that support our operations, including our Prometheus supercluster in New Albany, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These projects are expected to provide thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of long-term operational jobs, supporting up to 6.6 GW of new and existing clean energy by 2035. Importantly, these projects add reliable and firm power to the grid, reinforce America’s nuclear supply chain, and support new and existing jobs to build and operate American power plants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This work builds on our ongoing collaboration with electric utility companies and power providers to plan for and meet our energy needs years in advance of our data centers becoming operational. We pay the full costs for energy used by our data centers so consumers don’t bear these expenses, and we support the broader grid through our energy agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Our agreements with Vistra, TerraPower, Oklo, and Constellation make Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history. State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America’s position as a global leader in AI. Nuclear energy will help power our AI future, strengthen our country’s energy infrastructure, and provide clean, reliable electricity for everyone. These projects are going to create thousands of skilled jobs in Ohio and Pennsylvania, add new energy to the grid, extend the life of three existing nuclear plants, and accelerate new reactor technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;– Joel Kaplan, Chief Global Affairs Officer, Meta&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Supporting New Nuclear Energy With Advanced Technology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the demand for reliable, scalable, and clean energy continues to rise, advanced nuclear technology has the potential to become a key part of the solution. The latest generation of advanced nuclear reactors are designed to be safer — delivering reliable baseload power that can be efficiently added to existing grids, which makes them ideal for supporting America’s evolving power needs. Our agreements with Oklo and TerraPower will help advance this next generation of energy technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These agreements also mean that Oklo and TerraPower have greater business certainty, can raise capital to move forward with these projects, and ultimately add more energy capacity to the grid. Over time, this will be an important tool in ensuring that grids maintain reliability for all customers and ensure stable wholesale electricity prices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TerraPower: Investing in Advanced Nuclear Technology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new Natrium® units capable of generating up to 690 MW of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The agreement also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 GW and targeted for delivery by 2035. At a total of eight potential units, with 2.8 GW of baseload energy generation capacity and an additional 1.2 GW of built-in storage, this agreement is Meta’s largest support of advanced nuclear technologies to date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“To successfully address growing energy demand, we must deploy gigawatts of advanced nuclear energy in the 2030s. This agreement with Meta is designed to support the rapid deployment of our Natrium technology that provides the reliable, flexible, and carbon-free power our country needs,” said Chris Levesque, TerraPower president and CEO. “With our first Natrium plant under development, we have completed our design, established our supply chain, and cleared key regulatory milestones. These successes mean our TerraPower team is well positioned to deliver on this historic multi-unit delivery agreement.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Our partnership with Oklo helps advance the development of entirely new nuclear energy in Pike County, Ohio. This advanced nuclear technology campus — which may come online as early as 2030 — is poised to add up to 1.2 GW of clean baseload power directly into the PJM market and support our operations in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This agreement lays the foundation for constructing multiple Oklo Aurora Powerhouse reactors, which is expected to create thousands of construction and long-term operations jobs and generate new local and state tax revenue through major investments in energy infrastructure. Oklo Aurora powerhouses are based on proven fast-reactor designs with inherently safe systems capable of using both fresh and repurposed fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Meta’s funding commitment in support of early procurement and development activity is a major step in moving advanced nuclear forward,” said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo’s co-founder and CEO. “Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced nuclear powerhouses in Ohio. Today, that vision is becoming a reality through the support of a multi-year effort with Meta; to deliver clean energy and create long-term, high-quality jobs in Ohio.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Vistra: Extending and Expanding Operational Nuclear Energy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many American nuclear power plants need long-term support and require ongoing investment to maintain best-in-class safety and reliability in operations. For example, our first nuclear energy agreement helped extend the life of a nuclear energy plant in Clinton, Illinois for 20 more years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through additional 20-year nuclear energy agreements, we will purchase more than 2.1 GW of energy from two operating Vistra nuclear power plants in Ohio (Perry and Davis-Besse), in addition to the energy from expansions (uprates) at these two Ohio plants and a third Vistra nuclear plant in Pennsylvania (Beaver Valley). All three plants are located in and will continue to deliver power into the PJM grid region, and these expansions will be the largest nuclear uprates supported by a corporate customer in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta’s commitments ensure that these facilities can continue providing reliable power to the regional electricity grid. The new additional uprate capacity at each of them, totaling 433 MW, is expected to come online in the early 2030s — supporting the growing needs in the PJM grid region in the future. This means consumers will benefit from a larger supply of reliable, always-ready power through Meta-supported uprates to the Vistra facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is an exciting collaboration for us at Vistra. We are focused on meeting customer needs, and providing reliable, carbon-free nuclear power is something we’re proud to offer Meta,” said Jim Burke, president and CEO of Vistra. “This agreement is beneficial in many ways — it powers American innovation and AI technology, while allowing us to extend the operational life of these plants, boost the capacity of the nuclear reactors to support the grid, protect existing jobs while creating new ones, and continue investing in the communities where our plants are located. Partnerships like ours are key in moving America forward in both AI and energy leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Supporting Our Energy Future&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today’s announcements are the result of a thorough nuclear RFP process where we learned how we could improve our support of nuclear projects’ development lifecycles and identify specific partner companies to help scale and accelerate the buildout of new nuclear energy production. For more than a decade, we’ve worked with innovative partners to back clean energy projects that support the grid — adding nearly 28 GW of new energy to grids across 27 states. We’re proud to include Oklo, TerraPower, and Vistra on that list and support their work to boost America’s energy leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1968 an obscure Swiss hotel manager published a book entitled Erinnerungen an die Zukunft. An English edition appeared under the title Chariots of the Gods?. The hotel manager’s name was Erich von Däniken. He claimed that human history had been shaped by visitors from outer space, and that human potential had been improved by crossbreeding with these aliens. The proof of these visits, said von Däniken, is clearly visible in the earth’s archaeological record. This article will examine the structure of the argument presented in Chariots of the Gods? rather than the substance of its evidence. Taking such an approach will suggest some general intellectual principles that nonspecialists can use to evaluate any piece of popular archaeological literature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Scholar’s Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to his paperback cover blurbs, von Däniken has sold 7 million copies of Chariots of the Gods?. His total sales, including later books, have passed the 25 million mark in a market extending to 32 countries. Depending on their temperaments, archaeologists are saddened, frightened, or infuriated when they contemplate the fact that he has sold more books about archaeology than any archaeologist who ever lived. His arguments seem self-evidently ridiculous to archaeologists. Is it possible that his readers can take him seriously?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PLAYBOY: When did you become convinced that these theories were true?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VON DÄNIKEN: I guess only in recent years. I wrote Chariots of the Gods? in 1966, so for me it’s an old book. When I wrote it 1 was not at all convinced. By the second book, Gods from Outer Space, I was more certain, but not absolutely. The basic thing is to be convinced that the fundamental theory is right, that we have been visited from outer space and those visitors altered our intelligence by artificial mutation. Of this I have felt certain for the past four years or so (Playboy 1974:56).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If von Däniken is so persuasive that he can convince even himself, his book sales indicate that his version of ancient human history might be the one most widely held by the literate people of this planet. Archaeologists attempting to reclaim prehistory from von Däniken have pointed out that his argument is built on pathetically flawed logic and non-existent evidence, only to be stunned when they find that these shortcomings are conceded and forgiven by his public. He raises so much smoke that many laypersons suspect the fire must be in there somewhere, apparently forgetting that an infinite number of unsubstantial allegations does not constitute proof of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Argument by Assertion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those of us who have grappled with von ‘s arguments have come to realize the truth of an old Army saying: When you’re up to your neck in alligators, it’s very hard to drain the swamp. Assertion after assertion springs from the pages of his books, confounding any archaeologist who would try to address each item responsibly. If we wrestle von Däniken’s myriad alligators one at a time, we will never be able to fight free long enough to drain the swamp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, not all of his alligators can be pinned. A simple pair of photographs (Fig. la, b) can discredit his claim that “we find stone giants belonging to the same style” at both Easter Island, 2300 miles west of the coast of Chile, and Tiahuanaco, in the Bolivian Andes (von Däniken 1971:92). One can demonstrate the logical insignificance of the “petrified excrement, possibly not of human origin” found at Tepe Asiab (1971:28) by pointing out modern examples on any city street. Any one who believes that “it is an absolute mystery to us why the Incas cultivated cotton in Peru in 3000 B.C.” (1971:93) can be taken into The University Museum’s Peruvian Gallery and led up to the case where 4500-year-old cotton fishnet fragments from Huaca Prieta are displayed. Such a visitor might also learn that the Incas did not appear on the South American scene until the 13th century A.D. or later. But how can one disprove that “calculations of the weight of the earth were found” in the Great Pyramid of Khufu in Egypt (1971:77)?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If von Däniken’s theories cannot be demolished by refuting the assertions he uses in lieu of facts, clearly another line of attack is needed. Let’s examine not his evidence, but the logical structure of his evidence. Using this approach we can quickly sort the tangled mass of his assertions into two kinds of argument. There is the “looks-like-a-spacemanto-me” type, and then there is the -science-cannot-explain-this-mystery-so-spacemen-must-be-responsible” type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Palenque Sarcophagus Lid: Maya Ruler or Ancient Astronaut?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s consider the “looks-like-aspaceman-to-me” type of argument by examining one of his most famous cases, the relief of the “rocket-driving god” at Palenque (von Däniken 1971:102). Palenque is a Late Classic Maya site in Chiapas, Mexico. In the caption to his illustration of this scene, von Däniken identifies it as coming from another site, Copan in Honduras; however, in the text he gets its provenience right. The stone relief is carved on the limestone sarcophagus lid of the ruler Pakal, who died on August 31, A.D. 683. In this carving (Fig. 3), von Däniken sees a human figure, appropriately garbed and antennaed, reclining to manipulate the controls of a spacecraft whose thrusters are jetting smoke and flame (1971:100-101).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maya scholars don’t see a spaceship. They see Pakal, the central figure, falling backward into the jaws of the underworld. Pakal teeters on the head of the Sun Monster, who is depicted with a skeletal jaw but a fleshed nose and eyes, suggesting that he is poised halfway between the underworld and the living world, that is, at the moment of sunset. From a point above Pakal’s stomach grows the World Tree of Maya cosmology. This is a tree that stands at the center of the universe like a fireman’s pole, penetrating through the underworld, the middle world of everyday life, and the heavens. The heavens are marked by a Celestial Bird perched on the tree’s topmost branch. Pakal’s sarcophagus lid, then, is a statement of the Maya belief that the death of a king was nourishment for the cosmic order (Schele and Miller 1986).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a 7th century Maya artist’s carving of the death of his king fits a 20th century European’s image of an astronaut flying a rocket, is there a logical basis to consider this fact as evidence for von Däniken’s case? Envision a hypothetical situation. Imagine that a young child comes to you and says, “Look. That cloud looks like a doggie.” Has that child given you any information about clouds? Has he given you information about dogs? Or has he given you information about himself? If von Däniken writes that the sarcophagus lid of Pakal looks like a spaceman, has he told you anything about Pakal? Has he told you anything about spacemen? Or has he told you something about himself? The “looks-like-a-spaceman-to-me” line of argument treats the archaeological record as if it were a Rorschach test, and provides as little evidence about our ancient history as a Rorschach provides about ink and paper or butterflies and dragons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Dehli Pillar: Without a Trace of Rust?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let us turn next to one of the mysteries which, according to von Däniken, “science cannot explain”: “In the courtyard of a temple in Delhi there exists… a column made of welded iron parts that has been exposed to weathering for more than 4,000 years without showing a trace of rust. In addition it is unaffected by sulphur or phosphorus. Here we have an unknown alloy from antiquity staring us in the face” (1971:73).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Delhi Pillar (Fig. 4) is a shaft of wrought iron that weighs 6 tons and stands 22 feet high, but extends only 20 (additional) inches into the earth. According to local tradition, the pillar was dhila, or “loose,” and so the place where it stood was named Dhili. Even so, it has proved stable enough, both architecturally and chemically, to resist the centuries—not 40 centuries, as claimed by von Däniken, but 16. Chiseled into the column’s western side is a six-line dedicatory text in Sanskrit datable to the Gupta Dynasty, in the early 4th century A.D. The inscription calls the pillar the arm of fame of Raja Dhava, a worshipper of the god Vishnu, and likens the letters cut into its shaft to the swordcuts he inflicted upon his enemies (Cunningham 1871:169-175).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Metallurgists analyzed the pillar in 1912 and found that it had been made by hammering 80-pound lumps of red-hot iron together, welding them into a single piece. The metal is composed of 99.72 percent pure iron, 0.1 percent phosphorus, and traces of two elements introduced during the manufacturing process (carbon, from the charcoal fire in which it was forged, and silica, remaining from slag produced when the iron was smelted from its ore). Sulphur is virtually absent, at 0.006 percent (Hadfield 1912).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When present in iron, phosphorus inhibits rust. Recent investigations, however, have concluded that the preservative effect of the phosphorus incorporated within the Pillar was overshadowed by other factors. First, the dry, pure climate of Delhi provided some protection against rust; moreover, heat retention by such a large mass of metal would inhibit any condensation of moisture on its surface during cool nights. Second, the pillar was protected by the presence of a thin layer of scale produced in forging it. Additional protection may have been provided by a coating over the surface, built up by periodic ceremonial applications of ghee (clarified butter) or vegetable oil during the first 500 years of its existence. Finally, there is a natural tendency for a piece of iron to rust at an ever diminishing rate as corrosion products form on its surface and seal it. To close the argument, it is worth mentioning that although the pillar is in remarkably good condition, the lower portion of the shaft has been pitted by rust (Fig. 5; Bardgett and Stanners 1963).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus the mystery that science cannot explain is purely the product of von Däniken’s own sloppy “scholarship.” He doesn’t get the date right, he’s ignorant of the real significance of phosphorus in an iron alloy, he’s oblivious to a century of research by legitimate scientists, and he’s misinformed about the rust. When von Däniken writes that science cannot explain something, he seems to mean that he doesn’t know enough to account for it himself. The problem is summed up by Carl Sagan: “Every time he [von Däniken] sees something he can’t understand, he attributes it to extraterrestrial intelligence, and since he understands almost nothing, he sees evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence all over the planet” (Playboy 1974:151).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Easter Island “Mystery”: The Case of the Missing Facts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far it seems reasonable to state that von Däniken is either incapable of conducting objective research, or too lazy to do so. He can be charged with something worse in his discussion of the colossal stone statues of Easter Island. Carving these 30-foot, 50-ton giants from their quarries and hauling them to their stations overlooking the sea were impressive demonstrations of primitive engineering. Von Däniken tries to set them up as another mystery which science cannot explain:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if people with lively imaginations have tried to picture the Egyptian pyramids being built by a vast army of workers using the “heave-ho” method, a similar method would have been impossible on Easter Island for lack of manpower. Even 2,000 men, working day and night, would not be nearly enough to carve these colossal figures out of the steel-hard volcanic stone with rudimentary tools. (1971:91)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No trees grow on the island, which is a tiny speck of volcanic stone. The usual explanation, that the stone giants were moved to their present sites on wooden rollers, is not feasible. . . . Then who cut the statues out of the rock, who carved them and transported them to their sites? How were they moved across the country for miles without rollers? How were they dressed, polished, and erected? (1971:91)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case, von Däniken is not merely careless or ignorant. Perfectly ordinary answers to these questions are clearly documented with photographs in Thor Heyerdahl’s book on Easter Island, AkuAku. This is not an obscure volume. It appeared as the Book-of-theMonth Club Selection for September of 1958, and remained on the New York Times Best Seller List for the next 30 weeks. Von Däniken must have known of its contents because he specifically mentions Heyerdahl’s archaeological research, and cites Aku-Aku in the bibliography of Chariots of the Gods? (p.155). Thus in order to achieve his objectives, he seems to have been less than honest in setting the evidence before his readers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Aku-Aku Heyerdahl related the results of experiments he conducted in order to determine how the statues were carved, raised, and transported. Using hand-held stone picks, a group of six Easter Islanders chipped the outlines of a giant figure into the rockface of an ancient quarry, splashing the stone with calabashes of water to soften it (Fig. 6). Based on their demonstration, Heyerdahl concluded that two six-man teams, working all day in shifts, could carve a medium-sized, 15-foot statue in about a year’s time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twelve Easter Islanders set a 25-ton statue upright in 18 days using nothing more than three 15-foot wooden levers to pry the giant upward a quarter of an inch at a time; rocks to place under the rising figure; and, when it was high enough off the ground, ropes to topple it into place (Fig. 7). Trees to provide the wooden poles have grown around the crater lake at the southwestern tip of the island since before the first people set foot on Easter Island.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over local protestations that the statues “walked” to their current locations, Heyerdahl demonstrated they could have been simply dragged into position, by roping a 15-ton figure to a crude wooden sledge pulled by 180 people. While his experiment proved that the Easter Islanders had needed no extraterrestrial help with transportation, Heyerdahl himself was not satisfied. Recently he announced the results of further research on this question. Based on the suggestion of a Czech engineer named Pavel Pavel, he found that the upright monumental figures could indeed be made to walk by rocking and twisting them from side to side in the same way that a refrigerator can be “walked” into position.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Arne SkjOlsvold, Archaeological Field Director of the Heyerdahl/Kon-Tiki Museum Expedition to Easter Island, the statues have such a low center of gravity that they can be tilted up to 30 degrees without toppling (personal communication, 1986). Only 24 men and four ropes were needed to move a 10-ton statue. As confirming evidence, the expedition also found a pattern of damage on the bases of Easter Island’s statues that suggests the wear and tear of their long walks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously, von Däniken cannot be faulted for not writing in 1968 about ideas that have only come to light in 1986. He is, however, ac countable for presenting the relevant facts contained in a book that he claims to be familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;An Intellectual Line of Defense&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PLAYBOY: Should the fact that you are a convicted fraud and embezzler influence whether or not people listen to what you have to say?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VON : You know, many people who have been in jail say they were not guilty. I say the same thing. I have never committed fraud or embezzlement, although it is true I have been convicted of those things. I was improperly convicted three times, but each time for the same thing. (Playboy 1974:151).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A reader cannot trust von Däniken: he manufactures data and misrepresents data. Sometimes this is due to his ignorance, and sometimes it appears to be due to a deliberate attempt to mislead. Intellectual consumers must realize that popular scientific literature contains many dangerously defective products, and must consciously take steps to protect themselves. The first line of defense against von Däniken, or any other charlatan, is a healthy skepticism. Readers need to remind themselves that asserting something to be true doesn’t make it true, and that printing the assertion doesn’t make it any truer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A second intellectual tool that belongs in the reader’s defensive repertory is the principle known as Occam’s Razor. It was articulated by William of Occam, an English philosopher who died in the year 1349. He warned, “Never postulate complexity unless it is necessary.” Let us consider an example of what this actually means. Suppose your son or daughter, at the age of about 6, comes home from school in an unacceptably muddy condition. You have the evidence of the child, the mud, and the well-known affinity between the two. You are free to draw your own inferences. The least complex storyline that will connect all the points of evidence is that he or she was playing in a mud puddle and fell in. You ask the child what happened. The child says, “Well, I was playing by a mud puddle, and a dinosaur pushed me in.” Occam’s Razor would suggest that your more economical hypothesis is true, and the one offered by the child is less acceptable intellectually. Now, suppose the child brings home a dinosaur. You now have one more piece of data you have to fit into your explanation. Von Däniken claims to bring home a dinosaur, but his evidence for it is nothing more than his personal assurances that he saw a cloud that looked like one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A third useful philosophical tool is the principle of uniformitarianism, the assumption that the universe was formed by the natural operation of forces that can be observed in action today. A hundred years ago, archaeologists, geologists, and biologists fought hard to establish this principle, using it to explain features of the earth and its peoples that had previously been accounted for through a literal acceptance of the narrative in the Old Testament. Within the context of this article, this way of thinking would urge: “Don’t postulate miracles unless they are necessary.” Like the Roman Catholic Church, we should accept a miracle as such only after our own devil’s advocate has exhausted the natural explanations for it. In the case of the child and the mud and the dinosaur, a uniformitarian analysis would highlight the observable behavior of children in their interaction with mud, and the demonstrable dearth of living dinosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Armed with these three intellectual weapons, a critical reader can test the quality of any piece of popular archaeological or scientific literature. A good healthy skepticism, Occam’s Razor, and uniformitarianism are really nothing more than formal, explicit statements of things that most thoughtful people already know. Taken together, these three principles have another name—common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The books of Erich von Däniken are an affront to common sense. Nevertheless, he and his ilk find widespread acceptance, perhaps because people are eager to believe a good story. At first glance, he seems to be telling us of a glorious history, of wonderful times when our planet was a place of importance in the universe, and our ancestors walked with spacemen or gods or both. The appeal of such a story would fade if readers would consider its depressing implications. It is based on the assumption that our ancestors were uncreative beings who could only be improved by cross-breeding with a better, extraterrestrial stock. It requires one to believe that art and science fell from outer space instead of springing from the human heart and brain. Von Däniken’s history is flawed because he has no respect for his facts, and his fairy tales are flawed because he has no respect for his characters. In his view, the people who went before us were not fully human.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Archaeology is the story of our ties to our ancestors, and its raw material includes every person, family, village, city, and nation that ever existed. We will never know more than a tiny fraction of that story, but the episodes we carefully piece together carry the hallmarks most prized by storytellers: They really happened—and they happened to people like us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Summary: Inspired by the definition of temperature in statistical mechanics and the possibility for it to be below zero, we try sampling LLaMA at . The results are maximally weird.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The notion of temperature comes from statistical mechanics. Consider a system that has states with energies . If the system is in thermal equilibrium, the probability distribution over states is given by the Boltzmann distribution:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The distribution is parameterized by a single number, the temperature . At lower temperatures the lowest-energy states predominate; at higher temperatures there is a more even mix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the last layer of a neural net, we apply the softmax function to the neuron activations to get a vector of probabilities that sum to 1:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait â this is just the Boltzmann distribution, up to a constant![1]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;[1]&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;There's no minus sign in the exponent because while higher-energy states are less likely, larger logits are more likely.&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a language model, temperature is used to define how creative text generations are. For instance, in the zero temperature limit, the model should deterministically generate the most likely token. In the infinite temperature limit, all tokens are equally likely and the model output will be random noise. For an interactive explanation, see here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What would it mean to have a temperature that is below zero? (This isn't the same as the negative Fahrenheit or Celsius temperatures we get on a cold day in Vermont â I mean below zero on an absolute scale like Kelvin).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the equations above, if then the sign of the exponent flips. That means that the states that were previously the least likely are now the most likely, and vice versa. As temperature approaches zero from the negative side, the model output will again be deterministic â but this time, the least likely tokens will be output.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most physical systems have an infinite number of possible states at increasingly higher energy levels. As such, there is no least likely state. So negative temperatures really only make sense in systems with a finite state space. That includes neural nets â there are a finite number of neurons in the last layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, OpenAI models only allow sampling with temperatures between 0.0 and 2.0. So if we want to try this, we need a language model we can run locally. We'll use Meta's LLaMA model with llama.cpp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Below is the function that is used to sample tokens in &lt;code&gt;llama.cpp&lt;/code&gt;, slightly simplified for ease of understanding:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;void llama_sample_temperature(llama_token_data_array * candidates_p, float temp) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i &amp;lt; candidates_p-&amp;gt;size; ++i) {
        candidates_p-&amp;gt;data[i].logit /= temp;
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we can just pass in &lt;code&gt;--temperature -0.001&lt;/code&gt;? Not quite; in &lt;code&gt;examples/main/main.cpp&lt;/code&gt; there is a check that will apply greedy (most-likely) sampling for any temperatures less than or equal to zero. Applying the following diff and recompiling, we're good to go:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;@@ -486,7 +486,7 @@ int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  logits[llama_token_nl()] = nl_logit;

-Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  if (temp &amp;lt;= 0) {

Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  } else {&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will also want to disable repetition penalty, top-k, and top-p sampling. Here's the command we'll run: &lt;code&gt;./main -m models/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.bin --temp -0.001 --repeat-penalty 1.0 --top-k 0 --top-p 1.0 -p "Temperature is a concept"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When running this prompt at , here is the output:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Temperature is a concept that is used to describe the degree of hotness or coldness of a substance. The temperature of a substance is measured by the kinetic energy of its molecules. The higher the temperature of a substance, the more kinetic energy its molecules have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This means that &lt;code&gt;Ð¥ÑÐ¾Ð½Ð¾Ð»Ð¾Ð³Ð¸ÑÐ°&lt;/code&gt; is the least likely token to follow this prompt. After one token, the program seems to hang. Perhaps the LLM is trying to speak an unspeakable sentence?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The generation continues on and on. At first glance it seems random, but in a sense it should be even less comprehensible than a random sequence of tokens! There are repeated words, sure, but the generation is engineered to be as unlikely as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why are certain tokens like &lt;code&gt;Ð¥ÑÐ¾Ð½Ð¾Ð»Ð¾Ð³Ð¸ÑÐ°&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;entferne&lt;/code&gt; repeated? Searching these words, I found this comment by scottviteri on LessWrong. He points out that these are some of the tokens that are closest to the centroid in LLaMA's embedding space. That means that LLaMA has very little idea what these tokens mean. In the case of ChatGPT, tokens near the centroid have anomalous properties, so these tokens are likely to have similar effects on LLaMA. Let's give that a try, at .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLaMA is perfectly capable of repeating most words, even nonsense ones:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human: Repeat the word " antferne".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Assistant: Okay, I will repeat the word " antferne".&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But is incapable of outputting this anomalous token:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human: Repeat the word " entferne".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Assistant: Okay, I will repeat the word "get".&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The anomalous tokens that are the most likely completions at negative temperatures are the least likely completions at positive temperatures, so much so that the model refuses to generate them even in cases where they would be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot has already been said about the absurdly large corner radius of windows on macOS Tahoe. People are calling the way it looks comical, like a child’s toy, or downright insane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Setting all the aesthetic issues aside – which are to some extent a matter of taste – it also comes at a cost in terms of usability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since upgrading to macOS Tahoe, I’ve noticed that quite often my attempts to resize a window are failing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This never happened to me before in almost 40 years of using computers. So why all of a sudden?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that my initial click in the window corner instinctively happens in an area where the window doesn’t respond to it. The window expects this click to happen in an area of 19 × 19 pixels, located near the window corner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the window had no rounded corners at all, 62% of that area would lie inside the window:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But due to the huge corner radius in Tahoe, most of it – about 75% – now lies outside the window:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Living on this planet for quite a few decades, I have learned that it rarely works to grab things if you don’t actually touch them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I instinctively try to grab the window corner inside the window, typically somewhere in that green area, near the blue dot:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And I assume that most people would also intuitively expect to be able to grab the corner there. But no, that’s already outside the accepted target area:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, for example, grabbing it here does not work:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But guess what – grabbing it here does:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So in the end, the most reliable way to resize a window in Tahoe is to grab it outside the corner – a gesture that feels unnatural and unintuitive, and is therefore inevitably error-prone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinese car giant BYD has reportedly been offering LiDAR sensors in upcoming versions of some of its cheapest cars on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to CNC, the latest to be approved versions of both the Seagull, known as the Atto 1 in Australia, and the Dolphin hatchback will come equipped with LiDAR sensors to improve advanced driver assistance system offerings on these cars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this tech, both models are expected to come with 12 cameras, 5 mm wave radars, a dozen ultrasonic sensors as well as the new LiDAR sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These roof-mounted LiDAR sensors have previously been spotted on BYD and other EV makers’ models priced at more than $A25,000, at least in international markets, so seeing them on cars that are priced under that is quite a big step in bringing this technology to the mass market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This also means that BYD has been working quite hard at bringing this tech to these low-cost models given they originally launched with BYD’s autonomous God’s Eye suite last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the addition of the LiDAR, these models could come standard with Navigate on Autopilot (NOA) functionality for highways and city streets, allowing more drivers than ever to experience and use this tech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For comparison, BYD’s Seagull has seen over a million units sold in under 3 years, although it has yet to start deliveries in Australia as the Atto 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that scale and now the model making it to international markets, the tech inside could end up being in dozens of countries in the coming 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here in Australia, the Atto 1 pre-orders opened in November last year, with prices starting under $24,000 confirmed in December.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Atto 1 is available in two variants, the base level Essentials with a 30 kWh battery, as well a top-spec Premium variant with a 43.2 kWh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The small battery delivers a range of around 220 km of WLTP range, while the bigger 43.2 kWh battery pack is good for 310 km of WLTP range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inside, the tech offered is fairly good for its price, but does not feature the camera suite for the latest ADAS version found in China.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently, no BYD product available in the Australian market features LiDAR sensors but that could change with developments such as the upcoming affordable model variants featuring this tech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will watch this space closely as the competition to deliver assisted-driving systems heats up not only in China but also in other markets around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Giving agents access to a sandboxed environment with a shell and a filesystem has been the latest hype when it comes to agentic harnesses. Recent examples of this include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Turso’s AgentFS&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Anthropic’s Agent SDK, which brings Claude Code’s harness to non-coding domains&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vercel rebuilding their text-to-SQL agent on top of a sandbox&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Anthropic’s Agent Skills for filesystem-based progressive disclosure&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The argument for why this is good goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The big labs are doing heavy RL for coding tasks in these kinds of environments. Aligning more closely with such a harness brings free gains from the coding domain to other problem spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beyond that, replacing a bunch of search/write/move/list tools with a single Bash tool reduces the tool space significantly. Agents can chain operations together intuitively. Unix paradigms give you good tool design for free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of that there is more nice patterns that emerge from having a filesystem, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Plan/scratch files: Agents can create temporary files to organize their thoughts, track progress, or store intermediate results. This emerges naturally from having filesystem access, no need to design a separate “notepad” tool.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Long context handling: As conversations grow, you can compact old messages and tool results into files on the filesystem. The agent can re-read them when needed rather than keeping everything in context.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So the advantages are clear. But how do you actually apply this to your domain? This is where things get tricky. Consider two examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A domain with parallels to filesystems: For example an agent for organizing emails. There are folders, items (emails), and you can browse them and move things around.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An existing platform that already looks like a filesystem: For example an agent inside Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you try to fit these into a sandboxed filesystem you might wonder:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When do I copy over the files?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Do I copy over everything?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How do I write back updates that the agent made?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When do I sync edits made by a human?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;How do I show folders/files progressively as the agent progresses? (Particularly useful if you want to lean into the filesystem as a tool to manage long context.)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A reply to a recent post on X from Vercel about building filesystem-based agents puts it well:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This article doesn’t really answer that question though.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;They explain the shape of the filesystem really well, but the missing piece is still the main question for existing apps: how do you actually materialize Postgres + object storage + APIs into that sandbox FS in a practical and scalable way? “Preload files” is hand-wavy without a recommended ingestion/snapshot pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post will show a pattern to close that gap: turning anything into a filesystem with the help of FUSE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;An example: Email agent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make this tangible, let’s build a fictional agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine we’re building an AI-powered email platform, think Gmail but with AI on top. We have our own database storing emails, folders, and contacts. We have a UI that users interact with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we want to add a powerful agent on top of that platform. We could build a simple agent loop with tools like &lt;code&gt;list-emails&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;move-email&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;read-email&lt;/code&gt;, but as we established there’s a more ergonomic approach: put our emails in a filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After some thinking, we come up with the following file layout for the agent’s sandbox:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now comes the problem: we need to bridge the gap from our database to the sandboxed filesystem that the agent uses to consume our data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to turn anything into a FS, enter FUSE&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FUSE stands for Filesystem in Userspace. It’s a framework that lets you implement filesystems outside the kernel, while the kernel makes it look like a ‘real’ filesystem to the rest of Linux. You just write a userland process that implements the actual filesystem logic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A FUSE filesystem needs to implement a small, well-defined interface: &lt;code&gt;lookup&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;readdir&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unlink&lt;/code&gt;, etc. Whenever the OS interacts with the mounted filesystem, operations get forwarded to your userspace implementation. This indirection makes it possible to expose arbitrary data structures as if they were files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are wrappers and bindings for higher-level languages that let you write these filesystems in the language and tech stack of your choice. No need to dive into C :)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Architecture&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coming back to our email agent, here’s how FUSE would fit into a very high-level architecture:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The top row shows the traditional path: users interact with your app through a UI that talks to a backend, which reads and writes to a database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bottom row shows the agent path: the agent runs inside a sandbox and sees a mounted filesystem. When it does &lt;code&gt;ls /workspace/Inbox&lt;/code&gt;, that call hits the FUSE layer, which translates it into a query against the same backend. The agent and your users are looking at the same data through different interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can think of the filesystem as a UI layer for the agent. Just like your frontend decides how to present data to users, your FUSE implementation decides how to present data to the agent. Realistically you’ll have additional tools for actions that don’t map well to filesystem operations (like sending an email), but for browsing, reading, and organizing data, the filesystem abstraction works great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this blog post we’ll keep things simple: the agent loop and FUSE implementation both run inside a Docker container, talking directly to a database. We are going to implement this in Typescript using the fuse-native library. In production you’d want to structure things a bit differently, like running the agent loop outside the sandbox and have your FUSE bindings be only a thin client that calls out to your backend with proper authentication for example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Implementing the filesystem operations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make our data accessible via the filesystem, we need to implement the subset of FUSE operations relevant for our use case. Let’s start with listing directories (&lt;code&gt;readdir&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export async function readdir(path: string, cb: (err: number, names?: string[]) =&amp;gt; void) {
  const [folder] = await db.select().from(foldersTable).where(eq(foldersTable.path, path));

  if (!folder) {
    return cb(Fuse.ENOENT);
  }

  const emailsInFolder = await db.select({
    email: emailsTable,
    sender: contactsTable,
  }).from(emailsTable)
  .leftJoin(contactsTable, eq(emailsTable.sender, contactsTable.id))
  .where(eq(emailsTable.folderId, folder.id));


  const entries = new Set&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;();

  for (const {email, sender} of emailsInFolder) {
    entries.add(`${email.subject} (${sender.email}).eml`);
  }

  const subfolders = await db.select().from(foldersTable).where(like(foldersTable.path, sql`${path}/%`));
  for (const subfolder of subfolders) {
    entries.add(subfolder.path.split("/").pop() || "");
  }

  cb(0, Array.from(entries));
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We match which email folder we’re in based on the filesystem path, list all emails inside that folder, and add any subfolders. Together with implementing &lt;code&gt;getattr&lt;/code&gt; (to get file attributes), this makes listing and navigating the folder tree via &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To choose how email content will be represented we implement &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;export async function read(path: string, fd: number, buf: Buffer, len: number, pos: number, cb: (err: number) =&amp;gt; void) {
  const email = await getEmailById(fd);
  if (!email) {
    return cb(Fuse.ENOENT);
  }
  const content = emailToContent(email);
  const slice = content.slice(pos, pos + len);
  const bytesRead = buf.write(slice);
  cb(bytesRead);
}

export function emailToContent(email: EmailWithSender): string {
  return `From: ${email.senderEmail}
Date: ${email.sentAt.toISOString()}
Subject: ${email.subject}
X-Folder: ${email.folderPath}
X-Starred: ${email.starred}
X-Needs-Action: ${email.needsAction}

${email.body}
`;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a few more operations I implemented like &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mkdir&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;rename&lt;/code&gt; to allow moving email files around and reassigning folder IDs in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On top of that, I introduced the concept of virtual folders—the &lt;code&gt;Starred&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Needs_Action&lt;/code&gt; folders in the layout above. They work like this: if an email has the starred or needsAction flag set, it appears in these folders. Because an email can be both starred and part of an actual folder, the Starred folder contains symlinks to the “actual” files. The agent can unlink these files or create new links to flip attributes on the email. This might be overkill and better covered via regular tools, but I wanted to see how far I could lean into the filesystem abstraction. For this to work, I implemented additional FUSE operations: &lt;code&gt;readlink&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;symlink&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unlink&lt;/code&gt;, and adjusted the existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deciding how to map your domain to a filesystem is really a context engineering challenge in the end. The key is finding the right balance between leveraging familiar filesystem semantics and not over-abstracting to the point where the mapping becomes confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With all the filesystem operations defined, we’re ready to mount it and see it in action. While it’s possible to get this working on a Mac via macFUSE, I chose the easier path and spun up a Docker container and mounted the filesystem there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick demo of navigating the filesystem. As you can see, it looks and works just like regular files.&lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mv&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; all behave as expected. The best part? There’s no risk of anything going out of sync because we read directly from the database. We also only load the things we needed when they are accessed instead of preloading our entire database into a sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Giving the agent access to it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we have the filesystem working, it’s time to hook up an agent and see how it performs. I used the Anthropic Agent SDK to whip up a quick filesystem agent with tools to run Bash, Read, Glob, etc. To give the agent some context about the filesystem, I added the following system prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;You are an email assistant helping the user manage their inbox.

You have access to a filesystem at /workspace representing their email:

- Folders: Inbox, Sent, Orders, Customers, etc.
- Emails: .eml files named "Subject (sender@email.com).eml"
- Filenames contain spaces (from email subjects), so always quote paths in shell commands
- Starred/Needs_Action: contain symlinks to flagged emails

Commands you use internally:
- ls, cat, find → browse emails
- mv → move emails between folders
- ln -s &amp;lt;email&amp;gt; /Starred/ → star an email
- rm /Starred/&amp;lt;email&amp;gt; → unstar an email
- mkdir → create folders

When responding to the user:
- Describe emails by subject and sender, not filenames
- Say "starred" not "created symlink"
- Say "moved to Orders" not "mv to /Orders/"
- Summarize what you found/did in plain language
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s see how it approaches some common user queries:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; which emails do i have in my Inbox?

I'll check your Inbox to see what emails you have.

[Bash] ls -la /workspace/Inbox/

You have 6 emails in your Inbox:

1. **"Missing Documents - Customs"** from carrier-support@airbridge.co (Jan 4)
2. **"PO Confirmation #2026-0038"** from supplierC@fabricdirect.com (Jan 9)
3. **"Partnership Proposal - TrendCircle"** from marketing@trendcircle.io (Jan 7)
4. **"Re: Restock ETA For Red Jackets"** from supplierA@logisticsco.com (Jan 5)
5. **"Shipping Delay Notice"** from supplierA@logisticsco.com (Jan 8)
6. **"Wholesale Inquiry - SilverLeaf Boutique"** from boutique@silverleaf.co (Jan 6)

Would you like me to read any of these emails or help you organize them?
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; find the email about that wholesale inquiry, i need to remember to follow up on it

I'll help you find the wholesale inquiry email. Let me search for it.

[Bash] find /workspace -type f -name "*.eml" -exec grep -l "wholesale" {} \;

Found it! There's a wholesale inquiry from SilverLeaf Boutique (boutique@silverleaf.co) in your Inbox.

Would you like me to:
1. Star it so you can easily find it later to follow up?
2. Move it to a specific folder?
3. Show you the email content?

&amp;gt; show me the email and star it

[Read] /workspace/Inbox/Wholesale Inquiry - SilverLeaf Boutique (boutique@silverleaf.co).eml

[Bash] ln -s "/workspace/Inbox/Wholesale Inquiry - SilverLeaf Boutique (boutique@silverleaf.co).eml" /workspace/Starred/

Here's the email:

**From:** boutique@silverleaf.co
**Date:** January 6, 2026
**Subject:** Wholesale Inquiry - SilverLeaf Boutique

**Message:**
"We're a boutique in Portland and interested in carrying your line. What are your wholesale terms?"

Good news - this email is already starred! It looks like it was already flagged for follow-up. SilverLeaf Boutique is interested in carrying your products and wants to know about your wholesale terms.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; Organize my Inbox

I'll help you organize your inbox. Let me first see what emails you have there.

[Bash] ls -la /workspace/Inbox/

Now let me check what folders you already have set up:

[Bash] ls -d /workspace/*/

Perfect! I can see you have 8 emails in your inbox. Let me organize them into appropriate folders:

[Bash] mv "/workspace/Inbox/Customer Inquiry - Size Chart (emily.wolfe@gmail.com).eml" /workspace/Customers/
[Bash] mv "/workspace/Inbox/Wholesale Inquiry - SilverLeaf Boutique (boutique@silverleaf.co).eml" /workspace/Customers/
[Bash] mv "/workspace/Inbox/PO Confirmation #2026-0038 (supplierC@fabricdirect.com).eml" /workspace/Orders/
[Bash] mv "/workspace/Inbox/Re: Restock ETA For Red Jackets (supplierA@logisticsco.com).eml" /workspace/Orders/
[Bash] mv "/workspace/Inbox/Shipping Delay Notice (supplierA@logisticsco.com).eml" /workspace/Orders/
Now let me flag the urgent items that need action:
[Bash] ln -s "/workspace/Inbox/Last Call: VAT Filing Deadline (gov-tax@tradeportal.gov).eml" /workspace/Needs_Action/
[Bash] ln -s "/workspace/Inbox/Missing Documents - Customs (carrier-support@airbridge.co).eml" /workspace/Needs_Action/

Good - those urgent items are already flagged. Now let me check if the partnership proposal might be something to consider:

[Bash] cat "/workspace/Inbox/Partnership Proposal - TrendCircle (marketing@trendcircle.io).eml"

Let me create a folder for business opportunities and move the partnership proposal there:

[Bash] mkdir -p /workspace/Business_Opportunities &amp;amp;&amp;amp; mv "/workspace/Inbox/Partnership Proposal - TrendCircle (marketing@trendcircle.io).eml" /workspace/Business_Opportunities/

Let me verify your inbox is now organized:

[Bash] ls /workspace/Inbox/

Perfect! I've organized your inbox. Here's what I did:

**Moved to Customers folder (2 emails):**
- Customer Inquiry - Size Chart from emily.wolfe@gmail.com
- Wholesale Inquiry - SilverLeaf Boutique from boutique@silverleaf.co

**Moved to Orders folder (3 emails):**
- PO Confirmation #2026-0038 from supplierC@fabricdirect.com
- Re: Restock ETA For Red Jackets from supplierA@logisticsco.com
- Shipping Delay Notice from supplierA@logisticsco.com

**Moved to new Business_Opportunities folder (1 email):**
- Partnership Proposal - TrendCircle from marketing@trendcircle.io

**Left in Inbox (2 urgent items - already flagged):**
- Last Call: VAT Filing Deadline from gov-tax@tradeportal.gov ⚠️
- Missing Documents - Customs from carrier-support@airbridge.co ⚠️

The two remaining emails in your inbox are urgent items that need your immediate attention - they're already flagged in your Needs_Action folder.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s pretty cool to see how the agent just navigates through the filesystem given the task and a minimal system prompt. We didn’t spend any time on tool design. We just mapped our domain to a filesystem and got intuitive tool behavior for free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Outlook&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find the full implementation on GitHub: https://github.com/Jakob-em/agent-fuse to play around with yourself. I also might write a follow up to this post about evaling this approach vs a traditional agent loop to see if this way of building agents brings any measurable gains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general there is a lot more potential for virtual filesystems for context engineering. You could include old conversations as files on the filesystem, or make old tool call results appear as files after compacting context. The possibilities are endless, and as long as coding agents remain relevant, this way of designing context will only get more ergonomic for models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My prediction is that one of the many sandbox providers will come up with a nice API on top of this that lets you do something like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;new Agent({
    tool: [...]
	sandbox: {
        filesystem: {
            '/emails': (folder) =&amp;gt; listEmails(folder),
            '/old_conversations': () =&amp;gt; listOldConversations(),
        }
	 }
    }
})
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No worrying about FUSE, the sandbox, where things are executed, etc. This will be a huge differentiator and make virtual filesystems easily accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: I am in San Francisco right now and, in an extraordinary coincidence, I stumbled across two of the people whose work I mention in this article! Very grateful to John Bradshaw for chatting about reaction prediction and Gina El Nesr for chatting about molecular simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A second note: while here in SF, I will be co-hosting an event on Friday, Jan 16th, from 6-9pm, w/ Tamarind Bio! It will be at Southern Pacific Brewing, here is the link to the invite. You should come by!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two memories that I have to imagine are particularly heartwarming for any parent. One, seeing their child for the first time, and two, gleefully showing photographs of that child to an older version of that child, shouting, look how small you used to be! So small! Do you know how hard I worked to take care of you? You were so difficult! But it’s okay, because you were so, so tiny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will do something similar to this today. This blog has been operating for the exceptionally long period of 1.7~ years, which means I finally have blog posts that I wrote back in 2024 to resurface, dust off, and proudly present back to you, giving you an update on how things have shifted in the 1~ years since they were written.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will do this for three articles, back when my cover images were stranger:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s fun looking back at these three in particular, because they all feel intellectually significant. All of them were, essentially, predictions of where the future in a specific subfield of bio-ML may go. The first was the first time I’d ever seriously engaged in the small-molecule design space, the second for the molecular dynamics space, and the third for what are durable startup plays. Each one required multiple conversations with multiple people, many of whom I’d talked to the first time ever, and some I continue talking to today. Nostalgic!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But why do this at all? It would be easy to write confidently about the future and then quietly memory-hole the predictions when they don’t pan out, which, to be clear, there’s nothing wrong with and I likely will do many times. This is a blog, nobody cares that much. Still, it is worth doing this purely because it forces me to wrap my head around what has changed since I last covered something, not merely everything that is new and exciting. This is a little boring, but it does feel an important muscle to flex for the same reason that it is important to do your A-B-C’s every few months; just making sure you’re still capable of accomplishing the fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for format: for each article, I’ll briefly recap the original thesis, look at what has actually happened since, and render some kind of verdict as to what went right/wrong. I’ll also attach a tl;dr at the top of each section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Generative ML in chemistry is bottlenecked by synthesis&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;tl;dr: I was correct in a contrived sense. Arbitrary molecular synthesis is still hard and the models still aren’t perfect at telling you good synthesis routes for whatever they produce. But what has changed is a lot more money has flowed into making synthesis better outright, and, much more importantly, the space of ‘easily synthesizable molecules’ has slowly expanded from ~40B to ~80B, and will likely continue to climb. At a certain point, who cares about what is outside of that? Is it actually bottlenecking anyone?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in September 2024, I wrote an article arguing that generative ML in chemistry is bottlenecked by synthesis being slow, costly, or outright impossible. The thesis was not original in the slightest, and was clowned upon in the r/chemistry subreddit for being something that was so patently obvious that how could someone possibly have written 4,400~ words over it. This was very rude, but sadly, they were not wrong. It is pretty obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;by Jordan Fulghum, January 2026&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your home server's new sysadmin: Claude Code&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have flirted with self-hosting at home for years. I always bounced off it - too much time spent configuring instead of using. It just wasn't fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That changed recently. The reason is simple: CLI agents like Claude Code make self-hosting on a cheapo home server dramatically easier and actually fun.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the first time I would recommend it to normie/software-literate people who never really wanted to sign up to become a sysadmin and stress about uptime of core personal services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three things converged:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Shift&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Why it matters&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Cheap, capable mini PCs&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;You can buy a silent, low-power Linux box for less than a weekend trip&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Tailscale&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Secure networking without port forwarding or networking brain damage&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Claude Code&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;You no longer need to remember Docker syntax, Compose quirks, or config formats&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last one is the real unlock.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of Googling "docker compose vaultwarden caddy reverse proxy" and stitching together five blog posts from 2021, I just let Claude figure out (up to you how much you care to really understand the technical details!).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I previously ran my Plex server on an M1 Mac mini, which was great, but as I wanted to add more services I found myself running a lot of resource-hungry VMs (via UTM) and it was getting complicated anytime the Mac rebooted. So, I picked up a Beelink Mini N150. It is small, quiet, and just barely sips power. I paid around $379 for the device and another few hundred USD for 8TB in NVMe SSD. It's pretty wild how accessible these mini PCs have become in recent years!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the entire workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Step&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Install Linux&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Flash USB, install Ubuntu Server (I picked 22.04 LTS)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Install Tailscale&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Get it on your private network to make your life easier&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;SSH in&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;From my laptop, anywhere&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Install Claude Code&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;On the server itself&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ask for what I want&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Go get a coffee&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the part that surprised me. I've been using Claude Code and other agentic CLIs for my day-to-day development, but as others are realizing, they are generalized computer agents and native to the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I installed Claude Code directly on the Linux box. Then I asked it things like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't copy-paste YAML from the internet or have to do deep googling. I just asked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I focused on things I already used, but wanted more control over - effectively starting to knock down the walled garden around my core services like passwords, photos, media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Service&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;What it replaces or does&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Vaultwarden&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Bitwarden, but self-hosted and fast&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Plex&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Media server - PSA get Plex Pass to unlock hardware-accelerated transcoding&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="2"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Immich&lt;/cell&gt;

      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;ReadDeck&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Read-it-later. Honestly blown away by this one!&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each one lives in its own container.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can access everything from my phone, laptop, and tablet like it is local.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When something goes down, I get an email. When it comes back up, another email. No pager duty, no complex alerting rules. Just a simple ping that tells me if I need to care.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vaultwarden was kinda the "okay, this can work" moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a Bitwarden-compatible server written in Rust. Lightweight, reliable, and you can use the existing Bitwarden clients (like native apps and browser extensions). You can even set it as the default password manager on iOS, at the OS level!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once that was running, I exported my passwords from iCloud/Keychain, imported them easily into Vaultwarden, and haven't looked back since.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That alone justified the box.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Immich is a serious Google Photos replacement. I thought I'd have to compromise and flinched a bit when I installed it. But nope, it's good. Mobile apps. Face recognition via a local (but slow) machine learning thread. Timeline and map view. Automatic uploads from your photo roll.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the kind of thing that used to feel fragile and half-baked when self-hosted. It does not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mozilla killed Pocket. I needed a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I took a bet on ReadDeck. The UI is genuinely good. Clean typography, nice reading experience, good mobile support. It always remembers where I stopped reading and takes me right there. I even set up a shortcut that allows me to save an article for later right from mobile Firefox. Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is exactly the kind of thing self-hosting is perfect for. A small, personal tool that you actually use every day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lazydocker is a terminal UI for Docker. It shows you all your containers, logs, stats, and lets you restart or shell into anything with a few keystrokes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have been a huge fan of Lazygit for some time. I think it's one of the best UIs I've ever used. So I was excited to learn that Lazydocker is basically that, but for monitoring Docker containers. No memorizing &lt;code&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt; flags or grepping through logs. Just SSH in, type &lt;code&gt;lazydocker&lt;/code&gt;, and everything is right there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a fuller picture, Glances shows everything at once: CPU, memory, disk, network, and all running containers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is 13 services running on a $379 mini PC, using about 4 GB of RAM and almost no CPU. The N150 is not a powerhouse, but it does not need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This does not feel like "running a server."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The feeling of ownership is powerful, but a bit hard to describe. I think you just have to try it, and I hope you get a strong feeling of independence like I have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When something breaks, I SSH in, ask the agent what is wrong, and fix it. When I want to add something new, I describe it in plain English.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am spending time using software, learning, and having fun - instead of maintaining it and stressing out about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is for people who:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If that is you, I really think this is the year to try self-hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the first time, I would say this is not just viable. It is fun.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Hi HN!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;My name's Robert Escriva. I got my PhD from Cornell's Computer Science department back in 2017. And three years ago I had a psychotic episode that irreversibly shook up my world.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Since then I've been applying a skill I learned in grad school---namely, debugging distributed and complex systems---to my own mind.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;What I've found I've put into a [book (pdf)](https://rescrv.net/engineering-schizophrenia.pdf) on engineering, my particular schizophrenic delusions, and how people who suffer as I once did can find a way through the fog to the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is not a healing memoir; it is a guide and a warning for all those who never stopped to ask, "What happens if my brain begins to fail me?"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I am writing because what I've found is not a destination, but a process. It is an ongoing process for me and for people like me. I also believe it is automate-able using the same techniques we apply to machine-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I am looking for others who recognize the stakes of the human mind to engage in discussion on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Happy hacking, Robert&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;The Next Two Years of Software Engineering&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;January 5, 2026&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The software industry sits at a strange inflection point. AI coding has evolved from autocomplete on steroids to agents that can autonomously execute development tasks. The economic boom that fueled tech’s hiring spree has given way to an efficiency mandate: companies now often favor profitability over growth, experienced hires over fresh graduates, and smaller teams armed with better tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a new generation of developers is entering the workforce with a different calculus: pragmatic about career stability, skeptical of hustle culture, and raised on AI assistance from day one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What happens next is genuinely uncertain. Below are five critical questions that may shape software engineering through 2026, with two contrasting scenarios for each. These aren’t really predictions, but lenses for preparation. The goal is a clear roadmap for handling what comes next, grounded in current data and tempered by the healthy skepticism this community is known for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;1. The Junior developer question&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bottom line: Junior developer hiring could collapse as AI automates entry-level tasks, or rebound as software spreads into every industry. Both futures require different survival strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The traditional pathway of “learn to code, get junior job, grow into senior” is wobbling. A Harvard study of 62 million workers found that when companies adopt generative AI, junior developer employment drops by about 9-10% within six quarters, while senior employment barely budges. Big tech hired 50% fewer fresh graduates over the past three years. As one engineer cynically put it: ~”Why hire a junior for $90K when an AI coding agent costs less?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn’t just AI. Macro factors like rising interest rates and post-pandemic corrections hit around 2022, before AI tools became widespread. But AI has accelerated the trend. A single senior engineer with AI assistance can now produce what used to require a small team. Companies are quietly not hiring juniors more than they’re firing anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The flip scenario: AI unlocks massive demand for developers across every industry, not just tech. Healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, and finance all start embedding software and automation. Rather than replacing developers, AI becomes a force multiplier that spreads development work into domains that never employed coders. We’d see more entry-level roles, just different ones: “AI-native” developers who quickly build automations and integrations for specific niches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Bureau of Labor Statistics still projects ~15% growth in software jobs from 2024 to 2034. If businesses use AI to expand output rather than strictly cut headcount, they’ll need humans to seize the opportunities AI creates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The long-term risk of the pessimistic scenario is often overlooked: today’s juniors are tomorrow’s senior engineers and tech leaders. Cut off the talent pipeline entirely and you create a leadership vacuum in 5-10 years. Industry veterans call this the “slow decay”: an ecosystem that stops training its replacements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What to do about it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Junior developers: Make yourself AI-proficient and versatile. Demonstrate that one junior plus AI can match a small team’s output. Use AI coding agents (Cursor/Antigravity/Claude Code/Gemini CLI) to build bigger features, but understand and explain every line if not most. Focus on skills AI can’t easily replace: communication, problem decomposition, domain knowledge. Look at adjacent roles (QA, DevRel, data analytics) as entry points. Build a portfolio, especially projects integrating AI APIs. Consider apprenticeships, internships, contracting, or open source. Don’t be “just another new grad who needs training”; be an immediately useful engineer who learns quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior developers: Fewer juniors means more grunt work landing on your plate. Lean on automation for routine tasks, but don’t do everything yourself. Set up CI/CD, linters, and AI-assisted testing to catch basic issues. Mentor unofficially through open source or coaching colleagues in other departments. Be frank with management about the risks of all-senior teams. If junior demand rebounds, be ready to onboard effectively and delegate in ways that use AI. Your value is in multiplying the whole team’s output, not just your own code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;2. The Skills question&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bottom line: Core programming skills could atrophy as AI writes most code, or become more critical than ever as human developers focus on oversight. The coming years determine whether we trade understanding for speed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;84% of developers now use AI assistance regularly. For many, the first instinct when facing a bug or new feature isn’t to write code from scratch, but to compose a prompt and stitch together AI-generated pieces. Entry-level coders are skipping the “hard way”: they might never build a binary search tree from scratch or debug a memory leak on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The skillset is shifting from implementing algorithms to knowing how to ask the AI the right questions and verify its output. The first rung of the ladder now demands prompting and validating AI rather than demonstrating raw coding ability. Some senior engineers worry this produces a generation who can’t code well independently, a kind of deskilling. AI-generated code introduces subtle bugs and security vulnerabilities that less-experienced developers might miss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The counter-scenario: as AI handles the routine 80%, humans focus on the hardest 20%. Architecture, tricky integrations, creative design, edge cases: the problems machines alone can’t solve. Rather than making deep knowledge obsolete, AI’s ubiquity makes human expertise more important than ever. This is the “high-leverage engineer” who uses AI as a force multiplier but must deeply understand the system to wield it effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If everyone has AI coding agent access, what distinguishes great developers is knowing when the AI is wrong or suboptimal. As one senior engineer put it: “The best software engineers won’t be the fastest coders, but those who know when to distrust AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Programming shifts: less typing boilerplate, more reviewing AI output for logical errors, security flaws, and mismatches with requirements. Critical skills become software architecture, system design, performance tuning, and security analysis. AI can produce a web app quickly, but an expert engineer ensures the AI followed security best practices and didn’t introduce race conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developer discourse in 2025 was split. Some admitted they hardly ever write code “by hand” and think coding interviews should evolve. Others argued that skipping fundamentals leads to more firefighting when AI’s output breaks. The industry is starting to expect engineers to bring both: AI speed and foundational wisdom for quality.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What to do about it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Junior developers: Use AI as a learning tool, not a crutch. When AI coding agents (Cursor/Antigravity/Claude Code/Gemini CLI) suggest code review why it works, identify weaknesses. Occasionally disable your AI helper and write key algorithms from scratch. Prioritize CS fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, complexity, memory management. Implement projects twice, once with AI, once without, and compare. Learn prompt engineering and tool mastery. Train yourself in rigorous testing: write unit tests, read stack traces without immediately asking AI, get comfortable with debuggers. Deepen complementary skills AI can’t replicate: system design, user experience intuition, concurrency reasoning. Show you can both crank out solutions with AI and tackle thorny issues when it fails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior developers: Position yourself as the guardian of quality and complexity. Sharpen your core expertise: architecture, security, scaling, domain knowledge. Practice modeling systems with AI components and think through failure modes. Stay current on vulnerabilities in AI-generated code. Embrace your role as mentor and reviewer: define where AI use is acceptable and where manual review is mandatory (payment or safety code). Lean into creative and strategic work; let the junior+AI combo handle routine API hookups while you decide which APIs to build. Invest in soft skills and cross-domain knowledge. Stay current on new tools and best practices. Double down on what makes a human developer indispensable: sound judgment, system-level thinking, and mentorship.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3. The Role question&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bottom line: The developer role could shrink into limited auditing (overseeing AI-generated code) or expand into a pivotal orchestrator position designing and governing AI-driven systems. Either way, adding value means more than just coding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extremes here are stark. In one vision, developers see their creative responsibilities diminished. Rather than building software, they mostly audit and babysit AI outputs. AI systems (or “citizen developers” using no-code platforms) handle production; human developers review auto-generated code, check for errors, bias, or security issues, and approve deployments. Maker becomes checker. The joy of code creation replaced by the anxiety of risk management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are reports of engineers spending more time evaluating AI-generated pull requests and managing automated pipelines, less time crafting code from scratch. Programming feels less like creative problem-solving and more like compliance. As one engineer lamented: “I don’t want to end up as a code janitor, cleaning up what the AI throws over the wall.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The alternative future is far more interesting: developers evolve into high-level orchestrators, combining technical, strategic, and ethical responsibilities. AI “workers” mean human developers take on an architect or general contractor role, designing the overall system, deciding which tasks go to which AI or software component, weaving solutions from many moving parts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A CEO of a low-code platform articulated this vision: in an “agentic” development environment, engineers become “composers,” orchestrating ensembles of AI agents and software services. They won’t write every note themselves, but they define the melody: architecture, interfaces, how agents interact. This role is interdisciplinary and creative: part software engineer, part system architect, part product strategist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The optimistic take: as AI handles rote work, developer roles shift toward higher-value activities by necessity. Jobs may become more interesting. Someone has to decide what the AI should build, verify the product makes sense, and continuously improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which way it goes may depend on how organizations choose to integrate AI. Companies that see AI as labor replacement might trim dev teams and ask remaining engineers to keep automations running. Companies that see AI as a way to amplify their teams might keep headcounts similar but have each engineer deliver more ambitious projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What to do about it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Junior developers: Seek opportunities beyond just writing code. Volunteer for test case writing, CI pipeline setup, or application monitoring: skills aligned with an auditor/custodian role. Keep your creative coding alive through personal projects so you don’t lose the joy of building. Develop a systems mindset: learn how components communicate, what makes APIs well-designed. Read engineering blogs and case studies of system designs. Familiarize yourself with AI and automation tools beyond code generation: orchestration frameworks, AI APIs. Improve communication skills, written and verbal. Write documentation as if explaining to someone else. Ask senior colleagues not just “Does my code work?” but “Did I consider the right things?” Prepare to be verifier, designer, and communicator, not just coder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior developers: Lean into leadership and architectural responsibilities. Shape the standards and frameworks that AI and junior team members follow. Define code quality checklists and ethical AI usage policies. Stay current on compliance and security topics for AI-produced software. Focus on system design and integration expertise; volunteer to map data flows across services and identify failure points. Get comfortable with orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, Airflow, serverless frameworks, agent orchestration tools). Double down on your role as technical mentor: more code reviews, design discussions, technical guidelines. Hone your ability to quickly assess someone else’s (or something’s) code and give high-level feedback. Develop product and business sense; understand why features get built and what customers care about. Shadow a product manager or join customer feedback sessions. Protect your creative passion through prototypes, hackathons, or emerging tech research. Evolve from coder to conductor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;4. The Specialist vs. Generalist question&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bottom line: Narrow specialists risk finding their niche automated or obsolete. The fast-changing, AI-infused landscape rewards T-shaped engineers: broad adaptability with one or two deep skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given how quickly models, tools and frameworks rise and fall, betting your career on a single technology stack is risky. A guru in a legacy framework might suddenly find themselves in less demand when a new AI tool handles that tech with minimal human intervention. Developers who specialize narrowly in “a single stack, framework or product area” might wake up to find that area declining or redundant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of COBOL developers, Flash developers, or mobile game engine specialists who didn’t pivot when the industry moved. What’s different now is the pace of change. AI automation can make certain programming tasks trivial, undercutting roles that revolved around those tasks. A specialist who only knows one thing (fine-tuning SQL queries, slicing Photoshop designs into HTML) could find AI handling 90% of that work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hiring managers chase the newest niche. A few years ago everyone wanted cloud infrastructure specialists; now there’s a surge in AI/ML engineers. Those who specialized narrowly in yesterday’s technology feel stalled as that niche loses luster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The opposite outcome is specialization in a new form: the “versatile specialist” or T-shaped developer. Deep expertise in one or two areas (the vertical stroke), broad familiarity with many others (the horizontal stroke). These engineers become the “glue” in multidisciplinary teams; they communicate with specialists of other stripes and fill gaps when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Companies no longer want developers who are either too shallow or too narrowly focused; they want a strong core competency plus ability to work across the stack. Part of the reason is efficiency: a T-shaped engineer can often solve problems end-to-end without waiting on handoffs. Part is innovation: cross-pollination of knowledge leads to better solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI tools actually augment generalists more, making it easier for one person to handle multiple components. A back-end engineer can rely on AI help to create a reasonable UI; a front-end specialist can have AI generate server boilerplate. An AI-rich environment lets people operate more broadly. Meanwhile, deep specialists might find their niche partly automated with no easy way to branch out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nearly 45% of engineering roles now expect proficiency in multiple domains: programming plus cloud infrastructure knowledge, or front-end plus some ML familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What to do about it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Junior developers: Establish a broad foundation early. Even if hired for a specific role, peek outside that silo. If you’re doing mobile, learn backend basics; if you’re doing front-end, try writing a simple server. Learn the deployment process and tools like Docker or GitHub Actions. Identify one or two areas that genuinely excite you and go deeper: this becomes your vertical expertise. Brand yourself as a hybrid: “full-stack developer with cloud security focus” or “frontend developer with UX expertise.” Use AI tools to learn new domains quickly; when you’re a novice in backend, have ChatGPT generate starter API code and study it. Build the habit of continuous re-skilling. Participate in hackathons or cross-functional projects to force yourself into generalist mode. Tell your manager you want exposure to different parts of the project. Adaptability is a superpower early in your career.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior developers: Map your skill graph: what are you expert in, what related domains have you only touched superficially? Pick one or two adjacent domains and commit to becoming conversant. If you’re a back-end database specialist, get comfortable with a modern front-end framework or learn ML pipeline basics. Do a small project in your weak area with AI assistance. Integrate your deep expertise with new contexts; if you specialize in web app performance, explore how those skills apply to ML inference optimization. Advocate for or design your role to be more cross-functional. Volunteer to be the “integration champion” for projects touching multiple areas. Mentor others to spread skills around while picking up something from them in return. Update your resume to reflect versatility. Use your experience to identify patterns and transferable knowledge. Become the T-shaped role model: deep in your specialty (giving authority and confidence) but actively stretching horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;5. The Education question&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bottom line: Will a CS degree remain the gold standard, or will faster learning paths (bootcamps, online platforms, employer training) overtake it? Universities may struggle to keep up with an industry that changes every few months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A four-year computer science degree has long been the primary ticket into software roles. But that tradition is being questioned.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One future: universities remain important but struggle to stay relevant. Degrees stay the default credential, but programs lag behind rapidly evolving needs, hampered by slow curriculum update cycles and bureaucratic approval processes. Students and employers feel academia is disconnected from industry, teaching theory or outdated practice that doesn’t translate to job skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recent grads report never learning about cloud computing, modern DevOps, or AI tooling during their degree. If universities demand high time and financial investment while delivering low-relevance education, they risk being seen as expensive gatekeepers. But many companies still require a bachelor’s degree out of inertia, so the burden shifts to students to fill the gap with bootcamps, online courses, and self-taught projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Student loan debt is enormous, and companies spend billions training new grads because those grads lack skills needed in the workplace. Universities might add an AI ethics class here, a cloud computing elective there, but by the time they implement something, industry tools have moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The disruptive scenario: traditional education gets increasingly replaced by new systems. Coding bootcamps, online certifications, self-taught portfolios, employer-created training academies. Many high-profile employers (Google, IBM) have dropped degree requirements for certain technical roles. In 2024, nearly 45% of companies planned to eliminate bachelor’s degree requirements for at least some positions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bootcamps have matured. They produce grads who get hired at top companies alongside CS grads. These programs are shorter (12-week intensive) and focus on practical skills: current frameworks, cloud services, teamwork. The hiring currency is shifting toward live portfolios, micro-credentials, and verified skills. A strong GitHub portfolio or recognized certification can bypass degree requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Employer-driven education is emerging: companies creating their own training pipelines or partnering with bootcamps. Some big tech companies have started internal “universities” for non-traditional candidates. AI itself offers new ways to learn: AI tutors, interactive coding sandboxes, personalized instruction outside university settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A modular ecosystem of learning is far more accessible than an expensive four-year degree. A kid in a country without strong CS universities can take the same Coursera courses and build the same portfolio as someone in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What to do about it:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aspiring/junior developers: If in a traditional CS program, don’t rely on it exclusively. Augment coursework with real-world projects: build a web app, contribute to open source. Seek internships or co-ops. If your curriculum misses hot topics, learn them through online platforms. Earn industry-recognized certifications (GCP, AWS, Azure) to signal practical knowledge. If self-teaching or in a bootcamp, focus on a compelling portfolio: at least one substantial project with good documentation. Be active in the developer community: contribute to open source, write technical posts. Network through LinkedIn, meetups, dev events. Get an experienced developer to vouch for you. Keep learning continuously; the half-life of technical skills is short. Use AI as your personal tutor. Prove your skills in concrete ways: portfolio, certification, and ability to talk intelligently about your work will open doors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior developers and leaders: Your credential alone won’t carry you forever. Invest in continuous education: online courses, workshops, conferences, certifications. Validate your skills in new ways; be prepared for interviews that assess current competency through real problems. Maintain side projects with new tech. Reassess job requirements: do you really need a new hire to have a CS degree, or do you need certain skills and learning ability? Push for skills-first hiring to widen your talent pool. Support internal training programs or apprenticeship-style roles. Champion mentorship circles for junior devs without formal backgrounds. Engage with academia and alternatives: advisory boards, guest lectures, feedback on curriculum gaps. Reflect this in your own career growth: real-world achievements and continuous learning matter more than additional degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Through-Line&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These scenarios aren’t mutually exclusive. Reality will draw elements from all of them. Some companies will reduce junior hiring while others expand it in new domains. AI will automate routine coding while raising standards for the code humans touch. Developers might spend mornings reviewing AI outputs and afternoons crafting high-level architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The consistent thread: change is the only constant. By keeping a finger on technology trends (and skepticism around them), you avoid being caught off-guard by hype or doom. By updating skills, diversifying abilities, and focusing on uniquely human aspects (creativity, critical thinking, collaboration) you remain in the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether the future brings a coding renaissance or a world where code writes itself, there will always be demand for engineers who think holistically, learn continuously, and drive technology toward solving real problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best way to predict the future is to actively engineer it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;This game is a single 13 KiB file that runs on Windows, Linux and in the Browser.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not that long ago I became aware of Justine Tunneyâs cosmopolitan libc project. Itâs a toolkit that allows you to compile C source code into a single binary that runs natively on multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, various flavours of BSD, even including booters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, back then the project didnât seem to support GUI interfaces and produces quite swollen binaries. Hence I decided to take a stab at a similar (simpler? harder? up to you to decide) challenge: create a video game (&amp;lt;16 KiB) that runs natively on Windows, Linux and in the Browser, all from a single source file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Gameâ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Itâs a pretty standard Snake game with the same rules and interface on all platforms. You control a snake that grows longer as it eats food, and the goal is to avoid running into walls. The snake is controlled using either the arrow keys or WASD keys. It can be terminated via &lt;code&gt;ESC&lt;/code&gt; (if permissible by the platform), reset via &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;, and paused via &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;. Spacebar starts the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The game keeps track of your score. Each piece of food eaten increases your score by 10 points, except yellow fruit (which spawns with a 15% chance) that gives you 20 points. Fruit spawns at a fixed rate and despawns after a certain time if not eaten. The despawn timer is proportional to the speed of the snake at the time of spawning, which itself is proportional to the snakeâs length.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once ten fruit are eaten, the game proceeds to the next level, randomizing the wallsâ layout. The maze is created as to ensure that there is always a path from the snakeâs head to any piece of food. The initial placement of the snake is also randomized, but always in a position that has at least five empty tiles in the direction the snake is facing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download the game here (13,772 bytes).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Polyglotâ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I implemented the game three times in total: once in C for the i686 Visual C platform using WinAPI, once in C for the x86_64 Linux platform using clang and X11, and once in JavaScript for the browser using HTML5 Canvas. Each implementation is around 3-5 KiB in size when compiled/minified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Windows implementation was produced using a compressing script that prepends a decompressing stub. This stub has a quite unusual PE header that has many freely controllable bytes after the &lt;code&gt;MZ&lt;/code&gt; signature. This allows us to place a shell script there that skips over the remainder of the file, rendering the (valid) PE executable runnable on Windows while also making the entire file a valid shell script, that will do (thus far) nothing on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the PE file is so awkward, we rely on Windowsâ apphelp mechanism. Without compatibility mode, executing for the first time will yield the message:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;âThe application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000005). Click OK to close the application.â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which should disappear after re-running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Linux implementation was produced using a similar approach; we use &lt;code&gt;lzma&lt;/code&gt; for decompression and a small shell dropper that extracts the compressed ELF64 binary and runs it, skipping over the head and the tail of the file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The HTML version is also packed and abuses the fact that browsers will happily process all the benign garbage at the start of the file before reaching the actual HTML content. Then we make it invisible/unobtrusive through a bit of CSS magic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we concatenate all three files together in such an order that each platform will pick the correct part of the file to execute. The final file is exactly 13,312 bytes in size.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An experiment testing how different personality archetypes respond to identical dilemmas. I used zodiac signs as the personality framework (not that I believe in them) since they're widely recognized and have well-documented characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;12 AI agents were given personality traits commonly attributed to zodiac signs. All agents used the same LLM (Gemini 3 Flash Preview) for consistency — only the personality descriptions differed. Each agent answered the same YES/NO questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal was to see if distinct patterns emerge purely from different personality frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project was vibe coded to play dilemma games with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Presented 10 dilemmas to all 12 zodiac agents. Here's how they responded:&lt;/p&gt;
