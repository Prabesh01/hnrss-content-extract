    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;All press releases&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Remembering Lou Gerstner&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following is the text of an email sent today to all IBM employees by Chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IBMers,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am saddened to share that Lou Gerstner, IBM’s Chairman and CEO from 1993 to 2002, passed away yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lou arrived at IBM at a moment when the company’s future was genuinely uncertain. The industry was changing rapidly, our business was under pressure, and there was serious debate about whether IBM should even remain whole. His leadership during that period reshaped the company. Not by looking backward, but by focusing relentlessly on what our clients would need next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of Lou’s earliest signals as CEO has become part of IBM lore. Early on, he stopped a long internal presentation and said, simply, “Let’s just talk.” The message was clear: less inward focus, more real discussion, and much closer attention to customers. That mindset would define his tenure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lou believed one of IBM’s central problems was that we had become optimized around our own processes, debates, and structures rather than around client outcomes. As he later put it, the company had lost sight of a basic truth of business: understanding the customer and delivering what the customer actually values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That insight drove real change. Meetings became more direct. Decisions were grounded more in facts and client impact than in hierarchy or tradition. Innovation mattered if it could translate into something clients would come to rely on. Execution in the quarter and the year mattered, but always in service of longer-term relevance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lou made what may have been the most consequential decision in IBM’s modern history: to keep IBM together. At the time, the company was organized into many separate businesses, each pursuing its own path. Lou understood that clients didn’t want fragmented technology—they wanted integrated solutions. That conviction shaped IBM’s evolution and reestablished our relevance for many of the world’s largest enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lou also understood that strategy alone would not be enough. He believed lasting change required a shift in culture—in how people behave when no one is watching. What mattered was what IBMers valued, how honestly they confronted reality, and how willing they were to challenge themselves and each other. Rather than discard IBM’s long-standing values, he pushed the company to renew them to meet the demands of a very different era.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have my own memory of Lou from the mid-1990s, at a small town hall with a few hundred people. What stood out was his intensity and focus. He had an ability to hold the short term and the long term in his head at the same time. He pushed hard on delivery, but he was equally focused on innovation: doing work that clients would remember, not just consume.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lou stayed engaged with IBM long after his tenure ended. From my first days as CEO, he was generous with advice—but always careful in how he gave it. He would offer perspective, then say, “I’ve been gone a long time—I’m here if you need me.” He listened closely to what others were saying about IBM and reflected it back candidly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That neutral, experienced voice mattered to me, and I was fortunate to learn from Lou on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lou was direct. He expected preparation. He challenged assumptions. But he was deeply committed to building a company that could adapt—culturally as much as strategically—without losing its core values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lou’s impact extended well beyond IBM. Before joining the company, he had already built an extraordinary career—becoming one of the youngest partners at McKinsey &amp;amp; Company, later serving as president of American Express and CEO of RJR Nabisco. After IBM, he went on to chair The Carlyle Group and devoted significant time and resources to philanthropy, particularly in education and biomedical research. A native of Long Island, NY, Lou earned his undergraduate degree from Dartmouth and an MBA from Harvard, and he remained deeply devoted to his family throughout his life. Lou was preceded in death by his son Louis Gerstner III.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will hold a celebration in the new year to reflect on Lou’s legacy and what his leadership enabled at IBM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My thoughts are with Lou’s wife Robin, his daughter Elizabeth, his grandchildren and extended family, as well as his many friends, colleagues, and people around the world who were shaped by his leadership and his work.&lt;lb/&gt; Media contact:&lt;lb/&gt; IBM Press Room&lt;lb/&gt; ibmpress@us.ibm.com &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This week has seen the announcement by the Trump Administration that they are going to be building "battleships", a subject that is well within my beat, so I figured I would take the time to start by saying that these are nothing of the sort. Defining the battleship is slightly tricky, but the best version I have is that it is a large, gun-armed armored warship. This proposal is certainly large, but it doesn't really classify as gun-armed, in that the guns are clearly secondary weapons, and there's been no discussion of armor at all. So whatever these are, they aren't battleships. Their closest cousin is the Soviet Kirov class, which likewise are somewhat hard to classify, but in the finest tradition of the USN, I'm going to go with "Large Missile Cruiser" for these. But the fact that they're being called by the wrong name, while personally extremely annoying, is just the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, a look at the announced specs, as given above. The dimensions are somewhat large given the displacement, as they're a pretty close match for Iowa, which is 50%+ heavier at full load, although they're also not too far from the Alaskas, of roughly the same displacement. The length might make sense if they were going for nuclear power, because a very long hull would minimize power requirements, but it seems that it's IEP instead. But then we get to armament, and things get weird. It starts with the new ship-launched nuclear cruise missile that Trump has been pushing since his first term. This is basically a replacement for the nuclear Tomahawk, and whatever the logic for or against such a program might be, there's the problem that I'm pretty sure there's no need to have this new "battleship" to use the missile. Details on the missile are very sketchy, but given that the base program is targeted at submarines, it probably can just go in the VLS with everything else. If it can't that's a requirements problem, and we should change those instead of spending money on this thing. I'm sure the crews will love it, too, given the need to guard the VLS all the time to avoid letting anyone know if there are actually nukes aboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, there are cells for Conventional Prompt Strike, which is the current hypersonic weapon that they're pushing. It's not in service yet, and I'm skeptical how much real value it will deliver. I'm also not entirely sure how many missiles will actually be aboard. Zumwalt recently got four tubes in place of her forward gun, each of which carries three missiles, and I could see either four tubes/12 missiles or 12 tubes/36 missiles, with the latter maybe making more sense given the size of the ship. The graphic provided by the Navy (below) is curiously unhelpful about this, almost like it was put together by someone who doesn't understand any of this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then there's 128 cells of VLS, which is obviously the main armament of any surface warship in this day and age. Now, this is almost exactly the same number of VLS cells carried by a Ticonderoga class cruiser on 10,000 tons,1 which raises a fair number of questions about the efficiency of the design relative to a slightly stretched Burke or any number of proposed designs that would be half the size of this thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The secondary armament is even worse. It starts with a railgun, which has become one of the perennial "next generation" weapons that never seems to get anywhere. I remember reading about how cool they were going to be almost 20 years ago, and over the last few years, the program seems to have been basically cancelled. The problem is that if you make an electrical explosion, it's sort of hard to stop it from eroding the rails, and nobody has been able to get a "barrel life" long enough to justify sticking it on a ship, even after investigating some rather amusing systems to change the rails in the field. The 5" guns are fine, although putting them both forward is a bit odd, and I'm a big fan of lasers. The tertiary armament is even weirder. RAM makes sense as a backup for something like this, but the number of 30 mm guns is a bit odd given that they're basically for shooting and drones and small boats, and you already have lasers for that. But better safe than sorry. Then there's ODIN, which is a laser-based dazzler system. And I'm sorry, but if you are going to put more lasers on, why not put on more full-size lasers? They can also dazzle things you don't want to shoot down. ODIN was developed for cases where you didn't have the power or (probably) integration to want a full-powered laser, but that isn't a problem here. And then you have nebulous "counter UxS systems", which certainly hit current buzzwords, but otherwise leave us with no idea what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the whole, it's pretty clearly a grab-bag of stuff that sounded cool, thrown together without any real attempt to explain how is this better spending an equivalent amount of money on Burkes or on the DDG(X) program, which was going to come in around 15,000 tons, and which this is allegedly supposed to replace. Apparently, a lot of this is driven because Trump thinks that modern ships are ugly, and should look good. And I'm not entirely in disagreement with him on that. I love a beautiful ship as much as anyone, but I also strive to keep my aesthetic judgements separate from my policy judgements. I also think that there's some value in having good-looking ships when you're doing port visits and the like, and have even toyed with a "cheap capital ship" to be able to gain some of the benefits I discussed for the Iowas in the 1980s. But that would not have been billed as the future of the Navy, more an interesting side project, and I'm far from sure it would actually be a good use of our limited defense budget.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We've seen a similarly casual approach to procurement policy with the replacement for Constellation. SecNav Phelan has announced that it will be a minimum-change version of the National Security Cutter design, with a flexible mission module slot added on and maybe RAM, in hopes of getting in the water more quickly. Now, they might actually be able to make "getting a ship launched by 2028" on this one, particularly if they're able to reuse components from the cutter Friedman (WMSL-760), which was cancelled back in July, with an unclear amount of work already done. But the result will be something more much like the "minimum viable warship"/Type 31 than a true multi-role frigate, and we should be careful not to confuse the two. In particular, even if the mission module slots get filled with VLS carrying, say, ESSM, the ship does not have the sort of radar necessary to be considered a serious air defense asset on the modern battlefield. I gamed this out in Command: Modern Operations, which doubles as a mid-grade military simulation tool. Both the new ship, apparently designated FF(X) and FFG-62 handled a salvo of 8 conventional C-802-type sea-skimming missiles without too much trouble. But then I upped the threat to NSM and things changed radically. FFG-62 picked them up at 18.5 nm, just inside the radar horizon, and began firing at about 15 nm, with none of the missiles getting closer than 9.3 nm. The NSC-based design, with its much worse radar, didn't pick them up until 3.7 nm, when it was too late to do anything other than a single RAM and a few ineffective shots from Phalanx and the 57 mm gun. NSC also has no onboard sonar system, although one based on the LCS version might be adaptable for use from the mission deck, at an obvious cost in air defense capability. But it's "An American Design from an American Shipyard", so we're going to build it anyway, instead of more Constellations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am also bothered by the name. Not Defiant, which is a fine name for a warship, even if lacking in any particular heritage in the USN. But calling the ships the Trump class is... Look, I've been banging on about this for some time, and naming things after someone who is not only alive but in office is just gross. Also, a complete misunderstanding of how class names work in the American tradition. The British sometimes will pick a theme name, but we just take the first-ordered ship of the class,2 and use that. So even if this does end up getting into the water, it will probably be as the Defiant class. And I'm not hopeful for that happening. This is pretty clearly a very early design, intended to cater to someone whose understanding of naval matters comes entirely from vague memories of Victory at Sea3 and various yachts. It's going to take years to turn it into something we can build, and its fate past 2028 is going to depend on whoever ends up winning that election, a subject I'm not competent to speculate on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design is also pushing the limits of "steel is cheap and air is free", a doctrine I am usually a fierce partisan of. I think that view is pretty straightforwardly true when you're talking about putting 4,000 tons of combat systems in a 6,000 ton hull. But at some point, other factors start to take over. There's a least a little bit of wisdom in the Type 42 view that if you have extra space, people will try to install stuff in it. I was also worried about drydocking, but apparently, pretty much every drydock we have that supports DDGs also can handle LHDs, which are about the same size as this thing. More importantly, even if this ship was considerably more capable than DDG(X), which it mostly isn't, it can only be in one place at a time, and we have a lot of commitments. A ship in the wrong place isn't all that much better than no ship at all, so there are reasons to want numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this entire thing is silly. This is a ludicrously overgrown destroyer/cruiser (so far as those are separate things these days) without even a figleaf of justification for its size. And even if there was some justification for the size, it definitely isn't a battleship. Also, on a personal note, I would really appreciate it if the Administration stopped dropping significant naval news on the weeks of major holidays, because it adds something to my plate that I would rather not have to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1 Those carried 122, because they were built with the strikedown crane, which cost 3 cells in each of the forward and aft clusters. And yes, that was a fairly tight design, so you'd really want a bit more tonnage for that many cells. ⇑&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2 There's actually a slight difference between the USN and RN here. The Americans take the first ship by hull number, while the British tend to pick the first-completed ship, so the Colorado class is known as the Maryland class in British sources because Maryland completed first. ⇑&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3 To be clear, I am not slamming Victory at Sea, which is an excellent series that I highly recommend. But it is perhaps not the best way to understand modern naval policy. ⇑&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;1. Introduction¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Purpose and Target Audience¶&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First and foremost, a couple important terms:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Software-Defined Radio (SDR):&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a concept it refers to using software to perform signal processing tasks that were traditionally performed by hardware, specific to radio/RF applications. This software can be run on a general-purpose computer (CPU), FPGA, or even GPU, and it can be used for real-time applications or offline processing of recorded signals. Analogous terms include “software radio” and “RF digital signal processing”.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a thing (e.g., “an SDR”) it typically refers to a device that you can plug an antenna into and receive RF signals, with the digitized RF samples being sent to a computer for processing or recording (e.g., over USB, Ethernet, PCI). Many SDRs also have transmit capabilities, allowing the computer to send samples to the SDR which then transmits the signal at a specified RF frequency. Some embedded-style SDRs include an onboard computer.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-2"&gt;Digital Signal Processing (DSP):&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-2"&gt;The digital processing of signals; in our case, RF signals.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This textbook acts as a hands-on introduction to the areas of DSP, SDR, and wireless communications. It is designed for someone who is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Interested in using SDRs to do cool stuff&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Good with Python&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Relatively new to DSP, wireless communications, and SDR&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A visual learner, preferring animations over equations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Better at understanding equations after learning the concepts&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Looking for concise explanations, not a 1,000 page textbook&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An example is a Computer Science student interested in a job involving wireless communications after graduation, although it can be used by anyone itching to learn about SDR who has programming experience. As such, it covers the necessary theory to understand DSP techniques without the intense math that is usually included in DSP courses. Instead of burying ourselves in equations, an abundance of images and animations are used to help convey the concepts, such as the Fourier series complex plane animation below. I believe that equations are best understood after learning the concepts through visuals and practical exercises. The heavy use of animations is why PySDR will never have a hard copy version being sold on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This textbook is meant to introduce concepts quickly and smoothly, enabling the reader to perform DSP and use SDRs intelligently. It’s not meant to be a reference textbook for all DSP/SDR topics; there are plenty of great textbooks already out there, such as Analog Device’s SDR textbook and dspguide.com. You can always use Google to recall trig identities or the Shannon limit. Think of this textbook like a gateway into the world of DSP and SDR: it’s lighter and less of a time and monetary commitment, when compared to more traditional courses and textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To cover foundational DSP theory, an entire semester of “Signals and Systems”, a typical course within electrical engineering, is condensed into a few chapters. Once the DSP fundamentals are covered, we launch into SDRs, although DSP and wireless communications concepts continue to come up throughout the textbook.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code examples are provided in Python. They utilize NumPy, which is Python’s standard library for arrays and high-level math. The examples also rely upon Matplotlib, which is a Python plotting library that provides an easy way to visualize signals, arrays, and complex numbers. Note that while Python is “slower” than C++ in general, most math functions within Python/NumPy are implemented in C/C++ and heavily optimized. Likewise, the SDR API we use is simply a set of Python bindings for C/C++ functions/classes. Those who have little Python experience yet a solid foundation in MATLAB, Ruby, or Perl will likely be fine after familiarizing themselves with Python’s syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Description&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In March 2026, I will be Mockito maintainer for 10 years (nearly a third of my whole life). Looking ahead, I decided that a decade milestone is a good moment to pass on maintainership to other folks. In the coming months until March, I will spend time ensuring a smooth transition in maintainership.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this issue I list several considerations why I made the decision. Communication and discussion of plans for future maintainership will be somewhere else, most likely in a separate GitHub issue. Stay tuned for that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Energy drain because of JVM agent change&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you might know, Mockito 5 shipped a breaking change where its main artifact is now an agent. That's because starting JVM 22, the previous so-called "dynamic attachment of agents" is put behind a flag. This change makes sense from a security point-of-view and I support it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the way this was put forward to Mockito maintainers was energy draining to say the least. Mockito is probably the biggest user of such an agent and is often looked at for inspiration by other projects. As such, Mockito often pioneers on supporting JVM features, built on a solid foundation with ByteBuddy. Modules was such a feature that took months of hard work by Rafael to figure out, including providing feedback to JVM maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately such a collaborative way of working was not the case when discussing agents. To me, it felt like the feature was presented as a done deal because of security. While dynamic attachment is problematic in many ways, no alternative solutions were proposed. That's okay, as Mockito pioneers on these solutions, yet in this case I felt we were left alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My personal take is that folks involved with the change severely underestimated the societal impact that it had. The fact that proper build support is non-existent to this day shows that agents are not a priority. That's okay if it isn't a priority, but when it was communicated with Mockito I perceived it as "Mockito is holding the JVM ecosystem back by using dynamic attachment, please switch immediately and figure it out on your own".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, the fact that I (and others) are volunteers doing their best for the project, is important to understand the societal impact. When you put individuals under pressure, who do this work in their own time out of goodwill, things crumble. It's commonly joked about with XKCD's on the fact that the whole open source world relies on a couple of individuals. That couldn't be more true in this situation, where the collaborative system collapses when too much pressure is put on individual folks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This saga planted the seed to reconsider my position as maintainer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Kotlin as the future and odd one out&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's undeniable that Kotlin as a language has grown in popularity in recent years. While Mockito maintains several flavors for JVM languages, these packages typically include sugar that makes integration nicer. In all cases, mockito-core remains the place where functionality is implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this model doesn't nicely apply to Kotlin. Where almost all JVM languages work similarly under the hood, Kotlin often does things differently. This means that in several places in mockito-core, there are separate flows dedicated to Kotlin. Most often that's a direct result of Kotlin doing (in my opinion) shenanigans on the JVM that the JVM never intended to support, yet was able to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even within Kotlin itself, features don't work consistently. Suspend functions are the most well-known example. As such, Mockito code becomes more spaghetti, it's API sometimes fully duplicated just to support a core Kotlin language feature and overall less maintainable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I fully understand the reasons that developers enjoy the feature richness of Kotlin as a programming language, its underlying implementation has significant downsides for projects like Mockito. Quite frankly, it's not fun to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To me, a future where Kotlin becomes more predominant is not a future that makes me hopeful I can keep on dedicating energy to Mockito.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Alternative open source activities&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have always been a fan of open source work and have contributed to hundreds of projects in all these years. Mockito is my most important project, but I have also consistently worked on others. In recent months, I have rediscovered the joy of programming by working on Servo. It's a web engine written in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I need to choose how I want to spend my 2 hours of evening time in a given week, I rarely preferred Mockito in the last year. In the past, Mockito was my go-to and I enjoyed it a lot. Nowadays, Servo and related projects provide significantly more enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Justifying why I needed to work on Mockito becomes difficult when (because of the above reasons) it feels like a chore. Volunteering work shouldn't feel like a chore, at least not for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Summing it up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you have read, these three factors combined led me to the decision. The first point explains why I started to doubt my position, the second point why I am not hopeful for things to change in a good way and the third point how I found enjoyment in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While these points had impact on me as maintainer, my hypothesis is that it doesn't apply to others in the same way. I know others are eager to work on Kotlin support for example. That's why I concluded that a decade is enough time to have helped Mockito forward. Now it's time for somebody else to take over, as I believe that's in the best interest of Mockito as a project. Because ultimately that's why I chose to become maintainer in the first place: I believed that with my work, I could improve Mockito for millions of software engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those wondering: yes I wholeheartedly advise everyone to take on a volunteering task such as maintaining an open source project. It was an honour and privilege to do so and I thank those that I enjoyed working with.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;MongoBleed explained simply&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;CVE-2025-14847 allows attackers to read any arbitrary data from the database's heap memory. It affects all MongoDB versions since 2017, here's how it works:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MongoBleed, officially CVE-2025-14847, is a recently-uncovered extremely sensitive vulnerability affecting basically all versions of MongoDB since ~2017.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a bug in the zlib1 message compression path in MongoDB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It allows an attacker to read off any uninitialized heap memory, meaning anything that was allocated to memory from a previous database operation could be read.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bug was introduced in 20172. It is dead-easy to exploit - it only requires connectivity to the database (no auth needed). It is fixed as of writing, but some EOL versions (3.6, 4.0, 4.2) will not get it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;MongoDB Basics&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s get a few basics out of the way before we explain the bug:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;MongoDB uses its own TCP wire protocol instead of e.g HTTP. This is standard for databases, especially ones chasing high performance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mongo uses the BSON format for messages3. It’s basically binary json but with some key optimizations. We will talk about one later because it is essential to the exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mongo doesn’t have endpoints or RPCs. It only uses a single op code called OP_MSG.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The OP_MSG command contains a BSON message. The contents of the message denote what type of request it is. Concretely, it’s the first field of the message that marks the request type. 4&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The request can be compressed. In that case, an OP_COMPRESSED message is sent which wraps the now-compressed OP_MSG BSON.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The request then looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;     OP_COMPRESSED message
┌────────────────────────────┐
│ standard header (16 bytes) │
├────────────────────────────┤
│ originalOpcode (int32)     │
│ uncompressedSize (int32)   │
│ compressorId (int8)        │
│ compressed OP payload      │
└────────────────────────────┘&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critically, the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;uncompressedSize&lt;/code&gt;field denotes how large the payload is once it’s uncompressed.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Exploit Part 1&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first part of the exploit is to get the server to wrongfully think that an overly-large OP_MSG is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An attacker can send a falsefully large &lt;code&gt;`uncompressedSize`&lt;/code&gt; field, say 1MB5, when in reality the underlying message is 1KB uncompressed. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will make the server allocate a 1MB buffer in memory to decompress the message into. This is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The critical bug here is that, once finished decompressing, the server does NOT check the actual resulting size of the newly-uncompressed payload.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, it trusts the user’s input and uses that as the canonical size of the payload, even if it got a different number.6&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is an in-memory representation of the BSON message which looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[ 1KB of REAL DATA |      999KB of UNREFERENCED HEAP GARBAGE       ]
                   ↑                                               ↑
        actual length (1KB)                     user input length (1MB)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Unreferenced Heap Garbage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like in every programming language, when a variables in the code goes out of scope, the runtime marks the memory it previously took up as available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In most modern languages, the memory gets zeroed out. In other words, the old bytes that used to take up the space get deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In C/C++, this doesn’t happen. When you allocate memory via &lt;code&gt;`malloc()`&lt;/code&gt;, you get whatever was previously there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since Mongo is writen in C++, that unreferenced heap garbage part can represent anything that was in memory from previous operations, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cleartext passwords and credentials&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Session tokens / API keys&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Customer data and PII&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Database configs and system info&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Docker paths and client IP addresses&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[ REAL BSON DATA | password: 123 | apiKey: jA2sa | ip: 219.117.127.202 ]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Exploit Part 2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that the server has wrongfully allocated some potentially-sensitive data to the input message, the only thing left for the attacker is to somehow get the server return the data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;BSON&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As mentioned, BSON is Mongo’s way of serializing JSON. As mentioned on its site, it was designed with efficiency in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;3. Efficient&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Encoding data to BSON and decoding from BSON can be performed very quickly in most languages due to the use of C data types.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;C Strings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;C famously uses null-terminated strings7. A null-terminated string means that a null byte is used to mark the end of the string:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;char* s = "hello"
// in memory, this is represented as an array of characters with the last element being the null terminator: h e l l o \0&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way such strings get parsed is very simple - the deserializer reads every character until it finds a null terminator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Malicious BSON Input&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you recall, I said earlier that the first field of the BSON message denotes what type of “RPC” the command is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As such, the first thing a server does when handling an incoming message over the wire is… parse the first field!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because fields are strings, and strings are null-terminated CStrings, the deserializing logic in the MongoDB server parses the field until the first null terminator found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An attacker can send a compressed, invalid BSON object that does NOT contain a null terminator. This forces the server to continue scanning through foreign data in the wrongly-allocated memory buffer until it finds the first null terminator (\0)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Conceptual
[ REAL DATA |             UNREFERENCED HEAP GARBAGE                 ]
# Practical Example
[ { "a      | password: 123\0 | apiKey: jA2sa | ip: 219.117.127.202 ]&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the first null terminator is right after the password, the server would now think that the first field of the BSON is:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"a      | password: 123"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Obviously that is an invalid BSON field, so the server responds with an error to the client. In order to be helpful, the response contains an error message that shows which field was invalid:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "ok": 0,
  "errmsg": "invalid BSON field name 'a      | password: 123'",
  "code": 2,
  "codeName": "BadValue"
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boom. The attacker successfully got the server to leak data to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any serious attacker would then run this over and over again, thousands of time a second, until they believe they’ve scanned the majority of the database’s heap. They can then repeat this ad infinitum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;💥 Impact&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Ease of Exploitation - “Pre-Auth”&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The impact of this is particularly nasty, because the request-response parsing cycle happens before any authentication can be made. This makes sense, since you cannot begin to authenticate a request you still haven’t deserialized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This allows any attacker to gain access to any piece of potentially-sensitive data. The only thing they need is internet access to the database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exposing your database to the internet is a practice that’s heavily frowned upon8. At the same time, Shodan shows that there are over 213,000 publicly-accessible Mongo databases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Eight Years of Vulnerability (handled badly)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PR that introduced the bug was from May 2017. This means that, roughly from version 3.6.0, any publicly-accessible MongoDB instance has been vulnerable to this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is unknown whether the exploit was known and exploited by actors prior to its disclosure. Given the simplicity of it, I bet it was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of the exploit’s disclosure, which happened on 19th of December, it has been a race to patch the database.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sifting through Git history, it seems like the fix was initially committed on the 17th of December. Interestingly enough, it was only merged a full 5 days after - on the 22nd of December (1-line fix btw).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That beig said, MongoDB 8.0.17 containing the fix was released on Dec 19, consistent with the CVE publish data. But JIRA activity shows that patches went out on the 22nd of December.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because there’s no official timeline posted, members of the community like me have to guess. As of writing, 10 days later in Dec 28, 2025, Mongo have still NOT properly addressed the issue publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They only issued a community disclosure of the CVE a full five days after the publication of it. It is then, on the 24th of December, that they announced that all of their database instances in their cloud service Atlas were fully patched.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe this implies that all Atlas databases exposed to the internet were vulnerable to this issue for almost a week. By default, Atlas databases use an IP allowlist for connectivity. But users could configure it to allow connections from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mongo says that they haven’t verified exploitation so far:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“at this time, we have no evidence that this issue has been exploited or that any customer data has been compromised”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. Ease of Mitigation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mitigation is admittedly very easy, you have one of two choices:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Update to the newest patch&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Disable zlib network compression&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found the latter wasn’t circulated a lot in online talk, but I understand is just as good as a short-term mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A bit of Drama?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tech lead for Security at Elastic coined the name MongoBleed by posting a Python script that acts as a proof of concept to exploiting the vulnerability: https://github.com/joe-desimone/mongobleed&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is particularly interesting, because despite being different systems, Mongo competes with Elastic on Vector Search, Text Search and Analytical use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The exploit allows attackers to read arbitrary heap data, including user data, plaintext passwords, api keys/secrets, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It is performed by leveraging a simple, malformed zlib-compressed request.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;MongoDB versions from 2017-2025 are vulnerable to this exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rough timeline:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;June 1, 2017: Commit introducing the bug gets merged.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dec 17, 2025: Code for the fix is written (original commit date).&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dec 19, 2025: CVE officially published.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dec 22, 2025: Code with the fix is merged.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dec 24, 2025: MongoDB announce the patch, say all Atlas databases are patched.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On Dec 24th, MongoDB reported they have no evidence of anybody exploiting the CVE. Given the fact this exploit lived on for ~8 years, and their honey-pot cloud service Atlas took a full 5 days to patch since the official CVE publish date… I find that hard to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;MongoDB have not apologized yet.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are over 213k+ potentially vulnerable internet-exposed MongoDB instances, ensuring that this exploit is web scale:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other Reads You May Like:&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;zlib is a library for compression. It uses the DEFLATE algorithm under the hood, but produces results in a specific wire format to ease sending such data over the wire. (e.g includes metadata like flags, checksums, etc)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the PR that introduced it. I’m not aware of Mongo’s public review practices, but it appears as if nobody explicitly reviewed the change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They actually created it. There’s a very good site for it - https://bsonspec.org/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weird, I know. Here are examples of different commands, just so you get a sense:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Insert a document into the users table&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "insert": "users",
  "documents": [{ "name": "alice", "age": 30 }]
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Delete users with&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;inactive=true&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
  "delete": "users",
  "deletes": [ { "q": { "inactive": true }, "limit": 0 }]
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Check the server’s status&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{ "serverStatus": 1 }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m making this number up. There is probably some limit on the server side as to how large a request can be - perhaps 1MB is too large.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is the line (pre-fix): https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blame/b2f3ca9c996ba409e7d48601fca16c28fd58b774/src/mongo/transport/message_compressor_zlib.cpp#L83&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;`output` &lt;/code&gt;is the large memory buffer that was allocated earlier&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The code, instead, ought to return the referenced &lt;code&gt;`length`&lt;/code&gt; field, as that gets updated with the actual length that was seen post-compression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has been the cause of many security issues in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most common comment I saw online is that you “deserved it” if you exposed your DB to the wild. 😁&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Software engineers should be a little bit cynical&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of my readers call me a cynic when I say things like “you should do things that make your manager happy” or “big tech companies get to decide what projects you work on”. Alex Wennerberg put the “Sean Goedecke is a cynic” case well in his post Software Engineers Are Not Politicians. Here are some excerpts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I have no doubt that [Sean’s] advice is quite effective for navigating the upper levels of an organization dedicated to producing a large, mature software product. But what is lost is any sort of conception of value. Is it too naive to say that engineers are more than “tools in a political game”, they are specialized professionals whose role is to apply their expertise towards solving meaningful problems?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The irony is that this kind of thinking destroys a company’s ability to actually make money … the idea that engineers should begin with a self-conception of doing what their manager tells them to is, to me, very bleak. It may be a good way to operate smoothly within a bureaucratic organization, and of course, one must often make compromises and take direction, but it is a bad way to do good work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can see why people would think this way. But I love working in big tech companies! I do see myself as a professional solving meaningful problems. And I think navigating the organization to put real features or improvements in the hands of users is an excellent way - maybe the best way - to do good work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why do I write such cynical posts, then? Well, I think that a small amount of cynicism is necessary in order to think clearly about how organizations work, and to avoid falling into the trap of being overly cynical. In general, I think good engineers ought to be a little bit cynical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The idealist view is more cynical than idealists think&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One doctrinaire “idealist” view of software engineering goes something like this. I’m obviously expressing it in its most lurid form, but I do think many people believe this more or less literally:1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We live in a late-stage-capitalist hellscape, where large companies are run by aspiring robber barons who have no serious convictions beyond desiring power. All those companies want is for obedient engineering drones to churn out bad code fast, so they can goose the (largely fictional) stock price. Meanwhile, end-users are left holding the bag: paying more for worse software, being hassled by advertisements, and dealing with bugs that are unprofitable to fix. The only thing an ethical software engineer can do is to try and find some temporary niche where they can defy their bosses and do real, good engineering work, or to retire to a hobby farm and write elegant open-source software in their free time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you write it all out, I think it’s clear to see that this is incredibly cynical. At the very least, it’s a cynical way to view your coworkers and bosses, who are largely people like you: doing a job, balancing a desire to do good work with the need to please their own bosses. It’s a cynical way to view the C-staff of a company. I think it’s also inaccurate: from my limited experience, the people who run large tech companies really do want to deliver good software to users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s idealistic only in the sense that it does not accept the need for individual software engineers to compromise. According to this view, you never need to write bad software. No matter how hard the company tells you to compromise and just get something out, you’re morally required to plant your feet and tell them to go to hell. In fact, by doing so, you’re taking a stand against the general degeneration of the modern software world. You’re protecting - unsung, like Batman - the needs of the end-user who will never know you exist.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can certainly see the appeal of this view! But I don’t think it’s an idealistic appeal. It comes from seeing the world as fundamentally corrupted and selfish, and believing that real positive change is impossible. In other words, I think it’s a cynical appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The cynical view is more idealistic than idealists think&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t see a hard distinction between engineers being “tools in a political game” and professionals who solve meaningful problems. In fact, I think that in practice almost all meaningful problems are solved by playing political games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are very few problems that you can solve entirely on your own. Software engineers encounter more of these problems than average, because the nature of software means that a single engineer can have huge leverage by sitting down and making a single code change. But in order to make changes to large products - for instance, to make it possible for GitHub’s 150M users to use LaTeX in markdown - you need to coordinate with many other people at the company, which means you need to be involved in politics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is just a plain fact that software engineers are not the movers and shakers in large tech organizations. They do not set the direction of the company. To the extent that they have political influence, it’s in how they translate the direction of the company into specific technical changes. But that is actually quite a lot of influence!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Large tech companies serve hundreds of millions (or billions) of users. Small changes to these products can have a massive positive or negative effect in the aggregate. As I see it, choosing to engage in the messy, political process of making these changes - instead of washing your hands of it as somehow impure - is an act of idealism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think the position of a software engineer in a large tech company is similar to people who go into public service: idealistically hoping that they can do some good, despite knowing that they themselves will never set the broad strokes of government policy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, big-tech software engineers are paid far better, so many people who go into this kind of work in fact are purely financially-motivated cynics. But I’m not one of them! I think it’s possible, by doing good work, to help steer the giant edifice of a large tech company for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Cynicism as inoculation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cynical writing is like most medicines: the dose makes the poison. A healthy amount of cynicism can serve as an inoculation from being overly cynical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don’t have an slightly cynical explanation for why engineers write bad code in large tech companies - such as the one I write about here - you risk adopting an overly cynical one. For instance, you might think that big tech engineers are being deliberately demoralized as part of an anti-labor strategy to prevent them from unionizing, which is nuts. Tech companies are simply not set up to engage in these kind of conspiracies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a slightly cynical explanation for why large tech companies sometimes make inefficient decisions - such as this one - you risk adopting an overly cynical one. For instance, you might think that tech companies are full of incompetent losers, which is simply not true. Tech companies have a normal mix of strong and weak engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Idealist writing is massively over-represented in writing about software engineering. There is no shortage of books or blog posts (correctly) explaining that we ought to value good code, that we ought to be kind to our colleagues, that we ought to work on projects with positive real-world impact, and so on. There is a shortage of writing that accurately describes how big tech companies operate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, cynical writing can harm people: by making them sad, or turning them into bitter cynics. But idealist writing can harm people too. There’s a whole generation of software engineers who came out of the 2010s with a factually incorrect model of how big tech companies work, and who are effectively being fed into the woodchipper in the 2020s. They would be better off if they internalized a correct model of how these companies work: not just less likely to get into trouble, but better at achieving their own idealist goals2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;edit: this post got some traction on Hacker News, with many comments. Some commenters said that it’s incoherent to say “what I do is good, actually” when my employer is engaged in various unethical activity. Fair enough! I’m not actually giving an ethical defence of working for Microsoft here - it’s just not what the post is about - but I’m happy to accept a drive-by scolding here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some other commenters challenged my claim that C-staff want to deliver good software by pointing out that they’re not willing to trade off their personal success to do so. Sure, I agree with that. The kind of person willing to sacrifice their career for things doesn’t typically make it to a C-level position. But it’s not always zero-sum. Good software makes money for software companies, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also saw two commenters link this as an example of big tech companies actually being engaged in conspiracies against their employees. I’m not convinced. Companies are structurally set up to collude on salaries, but they’re not set up to deliberately make their employees sad - they just don’t have that kind of fine-grained control over the culture! To the extent they have any control, they try to make their employees happy so they’ll work for less money and not leave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’m strawmanning here - I’ve seen many people make all of these points in the past, and I suspect at least some readers will be genuinely nodding along to the following paragraph. If you’re one of those readers (or if you only agree with about 50%), consider doing me a favor and emailing me to let me know! If I don’t get any emails I will probably rewrite this.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some concrete details on this, see my post How I influence tech company politics as a staff software engineer. Also, if you’re interested, I wrote a much less well-developed version of this post right at the start of 2024, called Is it cynical to do what your manager wants?.&lt;/p&gt;↩&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can't design software you don't work on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only the engineers who work on a large software system can meaningfully participate in the design process. That’s because you cannot do good software design without an intimate understanding of the concrete details of the system. In other words, generic software design advice is typically useless for most practical software design problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is generic software design? It’s “designing to the problem”: the kind of advice you give when you have a reasonable understanding of the domain, but very little knowledge of the existing codebase. Unfortunately, this is the only kind of advice you’ll read in software books and blog posts. Engineers love giving generic software design advice for the same reason that all technical professionals love “talking shop”. However, you should be very careful about applying generic advice to your concrete day-to-day work problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/quote&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Unity's Mono problem: Why your C# code runs slower than it should&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Execution of C# code in Unityâs Mono runtime is slow by todayâs standards, much slower than you might expect! Our game runs 2-3x faster on modern .NET compared to Unityâs Mono, and in a few small benchmarks I measured speedups of up to 15x. Iâve spent some time investigating whatâs going on and in this article I will present my findings and why everyone should want Unityâs .NET modernization to become production-ready as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How did we get here&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unity uses the Mono framework to run C# programs and back in 2006 it was one of the only viable multi-platform implementations of .NET. Mono is also open-source, allowing Unity to do some tweaks to better suit game development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An interesting twist happened nearly 10 years later. In 2014, Microsoft began open-sourcing .NET (notably .NET Core later that year) and in June 2016, .NET Core 1.0 shipped with official cross-platform support. Since then, the .NET ecosystem gained momentum and lots of improvements have been made, including the Roslyn compiler platform, a new JIT (just-in-time compiler), performance improvements, more features, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2018, Unity engineers discussed that they are working on porting the engine to .NET CoreCLR, the multi-platform version of Common Language Runtime (CLR), a component that runs .NET programs. Their main motivations behind this project were performance and convergence. In their post they said:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;...CoreCLR could be great for Unity game developers, as it will provide a significant boost in performance, by an order of 2x to 5x compare to the Mono runtime sometimes up to x10 on some workload!&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, now itâs the end of 2025 and we still canât run games on CoreCLR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The performance gap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We donât hear about the performance gap between Mono and .NET much, likely because it is not possible to run games written for Unity under modern .NET. But we can still do a direct comparison with code that does not depend on Unity directly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our game has a unique architecture â we strictly separate the game simulation code (business logic) from rendering. So much so that the simulation code does not depend on Unityâs libraries and can be compiled and run under any .NET version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One day I was debugging an issue in map generation and it was time-consuming because it was taking over 2 minutes to start a game. To make debugging faster, Iâve written a unit test, hoping to cut down on the turn-around time since Unity takes 15+ seconds just to crunch new DLLs and reload the domain before the game can be launched and it also initializes rendering stuff that I did not care about. When I ran the test, it finished in 40 seconds. I was quite surprised that it was more than 3x faster, so I started digging deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long story short, Figure 1 shows traces from a profiler showing the difference between the game launching in Unity running under Mono vs. a unit test running under .NET.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that all shown benchmarks are using either Unity 6.0 or .NET 10.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So our benchmark shows that loading a save file, generating a map, and initializing the simulation takes 100 seconds in Unity/Mono but only 38 seconds in .NET. This result alone is already something that may raise eyebrows and has real consequences of how you may want to approach debugging and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also know from experience with Unity that Release mode running as a standalone executable (without the Unity editor) is much faster, so I decided to test that next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;.NET vs. Mono in standalone Release mode&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Debug mode slowness is not great, but even non-optimized C++ code can be slow. To compare the real performance gap between Mono and .NET, letâs run the same benchmark as above but in release mode, standalone executable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First up: Unity. Iâve run our deploy script to get an optimized executable and run it directly. Unsurprisingly, optimized standalone executable is beating Unity editor by a big margin, more than 3x faster. Next, the same code running under .NET in Release mode. Figure 2 shows the results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yep. 12 seconds. Itâs actually mind-boggling how much work is being done in these 12 seconds and when I saw this for the first time, I was not only shocked, but also impressed. Just so you know, a 4k Ã 4k map is being generated using all available threads out of hundreds of combined noise functions in like 3 seconds. Figure 3 shows the trace expanded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are interested in seeing the actual x86 assembly generated by Mono and .NET JITs, see the Extras section at the end of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see from the presented benchmarks, Mono is massively behind .NET in terms of performance. This is primarily due to differences in runtime optimizations and JIT that generates unoptimized assembly. The actual speedup surely depends on the code itself, but from my research, 1.5-3x speedup of C# execution is very likely for most projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are a game developer using Unity, or even a player, you can now understand that CoreCLR would be a massive boost to performance of games and even the Unity editor. Unfortunately, for the past 8 years, Unity leadership was more interested in âother thingsâ and did not give .NET modernization the attention it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some view .NET modernization as support for new language features in C#, but that is just a cherry on top. New C# adds some handy features, but the new JIT can deliver multi-x speedups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this year's Unite conference, Unity announced that CoreCLR is still ongoing but it wonât be production ready in 2026. The good news is that it now seems to be on the Unity 6.x roadmap, and not left for later versions as suggested by 2024âs Unite presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, CoreCLR is not just new JIT and C#, it unlocks broader and better-optimized support for things like Span&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;-style APIs, hardware intrinsics, and newer SIMD paths that devs cannot use these days. These features could add another multiplier to the performance gains for some classes of code. For example, our map generator heavily uses 2D and 3D simplex noise. I bet that having access to new runtime features in CoreCLR could speed up the map generation by another 2x.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unity has a technology called Burst that automatically converts marked C# methods to optimized native assembly via the LLVM compiler. This sounds neat as it can avoid the poor JIT performance, but the downside is that Burst has strict limitations on what can be converted and supports only subset of C#. I believe that CoreCLR with modern JIT will have very similar performance characteristics to Burst. I am curious what would happen in a universe where Unity invested all the time and effort in CoreCLR support and high-performance C#, instead of developing and maintaining Burst.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another interesting consequence of CoreCLR support is the ability to pre-compile the .NET intermediate assembly to machine code using ahead-of-time compilation (AOT). AOT can further improve startup time and is essential on platforms where JIT is restricted (notably iOS). Nowadays, Unity solves this with IL2CPP that takes the intermediate code and compiles it to C++ which is then optimized and compiled to native assembly. However, according to RichardFine (Unity staff), using CoreCLR AOT is not planned and IL2CPP is here to stay:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;AOT for IL2CPP is completely independent of AOT for CoreCLR (which we have no plans to adopt anyway). GC behaviour on IL2CPP improves when we upgrade the GC there, itâs not really affected by CoreCLR at all.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, CoreCLR wonât magically fix every bottleneck in a Unity game, but it does fix many of the code generation inefficiencies and allows writing higher-performance code. The benchmark presented in this article is meant to illustrate that modern .NET has spent years squeezing more work into fewer CPU cycles, and Unity users are largely locked out of those gains today.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Unity can deliver production-ready CoreCLR support, it wonât just mean ânewer C#â. It will mean faster runtime performance, faster iteration times, more performance headroom, no domain reload, better GC behavior, and maybe even more managed code and less native code. Until then, the gap will remain an invisible tax on every Unity project that leans on managed code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâm cheering for you, Unity devs, CoreCLR for the win!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Extras: Comparison of x86 assembly&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have actually dug much deeper into the performance aspects of Mono vs .NET but for the sake of this article not being too long, here is a brief summary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Code listing 1 shows the testing code. It does some basic summing of custom structs that are wrappers around ints. This is an interesting example because Mono is very bad at inlining and simplifying expressions, even obvious ones, and we have plenty of structs like these in our code base (e.g. Quantity, MechPower, Tile2i, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;static class Program { static void Main() { Console.WriteLine(RunTest(int.MaxValue)); } public static TestStruct RunTest(int iterations) { TestStruct value1 = new TestStruct(iterations % 2); TestStruct value2 = new TestStruct(iterations % 7); TestStruct value3 = new TestStruct(iterations % 13); TestStruct result = default; for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; iterations; ++i) { result += value1 + value2; result += value1 + value3; } return result; } } readonly struct TestStruct { public readonly int Value; public TestStruct(int value) { Value = value; } public static TestStruct operator +(TestStruct lhs, TestStruct rhs) { return new TestStruct(lhs.Value + rhs.Value); } public override string ToString() =&amp;gt; Value.ToString(); }&lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To obtain assembly code, Iâve compiled the code in Release mode and ran it as a standalone executable. Then, I attached a debugger to the running process. An easy way to find this loop was to make it long/infinite and just break the program at any time, it would end up in that loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, letâs take a look at .NET. Here is the x64 assembly of the for-loop section of the code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;add r8d,edx add edx,r10d 00007FFDEC338E88: mov r10d,r8d add r9d,r10d mov r10d,edx add r9d,r10d inc ecx cmp ecx,eax jl 00007FFDEC338E88&lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; In both cases, the full loop of &lt;code&gt;int.MaxValue&lt;/code&gt; iterations took around 750 ms on my machine.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; This looks neat. Even if you donât read assembly, you can see that there are two add instructions, one decrement, and one jump. It seems that the JIT hoisted the invariant sums &lt;code&gt;a = value1 + value2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b = value1 + value3&lt;/code&gt; out of the loop and then just accumulates them.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I also tested x86 assembly, and it looks very similar:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1 2 3 4 5 6 7 &lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;082E18D0: lea ebx,[esi+edi] add eax,ebx lea ebx,[esi+edx] add eax,ebx dec ecx jne 082E18D0&lt;/quote&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the loop direction was reversed, counting down. This saves one instruction as comparison to zero and conditional jump can be done as one instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now letâs look at Monoâs x64 assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
      &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;quote&gt;1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 &lt;/quote&gt;

        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; As you can see just from the number of instructions, this code will run way slower. The full loop of &lt;code&gt;int.MaxValue&lt;/code&gt; iterations took around 11500 ms, thatâs ~15x slower.
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the assembly you can see the four add instructions in the loop, the âinefficientâ increment + comparison + jump (instead of decrement + conditional jump), and most importantly a sea of mov instructions, which are just memory copies from inefficient inlining of the struct fields. Basically Mono is just tossing values around memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have also tested assembly compiled in Debug mode running in the Unity editor and itâs even worse. The full loop takes 67 seconds (67000 ms)! In Unity Editor, the JIT likely switches to far less optimized codegen and includes additional checks/sequence-point overhead, which balloons runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Takeaway: modern .NETâs JIT can scalarize tiny value types and hoist invariant work so the hot loop becomes a handful of register ops, while Mono often fails to do so and ends up shuffling values through memory, exactly the kind of gap that shows up as slowdowns in real simulation-heavy code.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why I Disappeared&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;My week with minimal internet in a remote island chain&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m writing this on my flight back from a weeklong trip to the Galapagos Islands, where for the first time in years I was largely without access to the Internet. For someone as congenitally online as I am, this at first seemed a curse. It turned out to be far from that and has me questioning a lot of what I thought I knew about media, politics and, well, people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My Galapagos excursion took place on a boat with over a dozen other travelers. They were young and older, professors and small business owners (even an Army colonel!), Republicans and Democrats, from big cities and small towns. People from wildly different backgrounds readily shared sunscreen, snacks, even life advice. And while it wasn’t partisan, it also wasn’t apolitical: issues like the outrageous cost of housing, healthcare and childcare came up. Yet absent was the political vitriol that the national security state says necessitates a new domestic war on terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contrary to the national security threat machine’s picture of a country at war with itself, we all got along so swimmingly that the idea of a civil war or anything like it struck me as laughable, as did the notion that the statistically insignificant number of politically-motivated killings, though real, said anything at all about the vast majority of real-world Americans. I say ‘real-world’ to distinguish from the Internet, where anonymity and disembodied reality can lead to people saying things they never would in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Galapagos are unique because its extreme remoteness has insulated various species from outside predators, providing Charles Darwin a controlled setting to observe and later theorize evolution. That same remoteness — in my case from the constant intravenous drip of the internet and social media for the first time in maybe my entire adult life — left me with the staggering realization that what passes for news is mostly just noise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where Darwin prized the islands for its incubation of remarkably distinct animal lineages, I too benefited from the bewitching remoteness of the Galapagos. During the brief, intermittent moments that I had time to check the news (rather than living through it moment by moment), I realized how utterly forgettable and meaningless most of it was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Not watching every twist and turn about, say, the latest Epstein transparency failure, I noticed how little these news cycles ultimately produce — a very different picture than the 24/7 cycle creates. When I saw that Washington media had dogpiled Trump’s chief of staff Susie Wiles for offering some mildly critical remarks about Elon Musk and other administration figures, it occurred to me that no one would give a shit about or even remember any of this a week from now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I came away shocked and sad at how much the media traffics in fake urgency as a result of its quest for the click. Combine that with national security’s constant drumbeat of civil war, disinformation, terrorism, violence, and the threat from within and you can see why people disengage from the news. It’s not they don’t care, lack “media literacy,” or any of the usual explanations. They look at the hurricane of sensational headlines and aren’t sure what they’re supposed to do with any of it or if they should even believe it. And they’re right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When another traveler on the boat, an academic, remarked that she didn’t really follow the news, it occurred to me that if even a very intelligent, well-educated and thoughtful person feels this way, the media has a much deeper problem than supposedly lazy audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None of this is to say that there isn’t important news out there. But as with evolution, change is usually more gradual, like the shifting of tectonic plates, than the 24/7 cycle suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most striking features of Galapagos is its record number of “endemic” species, or those that can only be found in this one place. That’s why the islands have an almost otherworldly feeling with such unique creatures as the giant Galapagos tortoise, the blue-footed booby, and the Galapagos penguin. The takeaway here is that sometimes evolution requires insulation from outside forces. And if I’m honest, as much as I love social media, it makes it difficult to develop the intellectual equivalent of Galapagos’ delicate species because these gargantuan apps foster a ruthless competition for your attention that becomes a race to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other words, social media is such a free-for-all of attention-grabbing stunts that it’s hard to see through the blizzard of posts to what actually matters — which is supposed to be the whole point of journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What the incentives for now, now, now creates is a perverse system of survival of the dumbest. Just take a look at the insane number of hoax Epstein documents and allegations swirling around social media right now. A doctored video of Jeffrey Epstein committing suicide in his cell has generated millions of views on X alone, despite the hoax clip having first circulated in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I return to celebrate Christmas, I realize that I didn’t really miss much during my week without social media. What passes for the news though, at its breakneck speed, zooms here and there, initially making it feel like I missed so much, that it’s all so overwhelming, that I can’t possibly keep up and should instead retreat to my family and friends, my reading, my hobbies, my team, my town. Nothing encourages me to be involved. And though I know that those in charge don’t have everything under control, don’t have a plan, and are grossly committed to survival of the fittest, I also am reminded that they love it this way. The blizzard of false urgency leaves us, the public, confused — just how the elite like it. We are prey.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But I have a plan. In this next year I’ll be focusing more on stories that actually matter instead of chasing the flash-in-the-pan ephemera that nobody remembers the next week. And most importantly, I’m also going to create my own island, by launching a new kind of website apart from Substack and the social media maelstrom. My dream is to create a home for news that is truly endemic to the site — that you can’t find anywhere else — by incubating stories that evince the kind of uniqueness as the magical creatures of the Galapagos.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yale School of Medicine (YSM) scientists have discovered a molecular difference in the brains of autistic people compared to their neurotypical counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition associated with behavioral differences including difficulties with social interaction, restrictive or intense interests, and repetitive movements or speech. But it’s not clear what makes autistic brains different.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, a new study in The American Journal of Psychiatry has found that brains of autistic people have fewer of a specific kind of receptor for glutamate, the most common excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. The reduced availability of these receptors may be associated with various characteristics linked to autism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We have found this really important, never-before-understood difference in autism that is meaningful, has implications for intervention, and can help us understand autism in a more concrete way than we ever have before,” says James McPartland, PhD, Harris Professor of Child Psychiatry and Psychology in the Child Study Center at YSM and the study’s co-principal investigator.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What an unprocessed photo looks like:&lt;/head&gt;(Photography)&lt;p&gt;Here’s a photo of a Christmas tree, as my camera’s sensor sees it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not even black-and-white, it’s gray-and-gray. This is becuase while the ADC’s output can theoretically go from 0 to 16382, the actual data doesn’t cover that whole range:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real range of ADC values is ~2110 to ~136000. Let’s set those values as the white and black in the image:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vnew = (Vold - Black)/(White - Black)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much better, but it’s still more monochromatic then I remember the tree being. Camera sensors aren’t actually able to see color: They only measure how much light hit each pixel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a color camera, the sensor is covered by a grid of alternating color filters:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s color each pixel the same as the filter it’s looking through:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This version is more colorful, but each pixel only has one third of it’s RGB color. To fix this, I just averaged the values each pixel with it’s neighbors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying this process to the whole photo gives the lights some color:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the image is still very dark. This is because monitors don’t have as much dynamic range as the human eye, or a camera sensor: Even if you are using an OLED, the screen still has some ambient light reflecting off of it and limiting how black it can get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also another, sneakier factor causing this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our perception of brightness is non-linear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If brightness values are quantized, most of the ADC bins will be wasted on nearly identical shades of white while every other tone is crammed into the bottom. Because this is an inefficient use of memory, most color spaces assign extra bins to darker colors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of this, if the linear data is displayed directly, it will appear much darker then it should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both problems can be solved by applying a non-linear curve to each color channel to brighten up the dark areas… but this doesn’t quite work out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of this green cast is caused by the camera sensor being intrinsically more sensitive to green light, but some of it is my fault: There are twice as many green pixels in the filter matrix. When combined with my rather naive demosaicing, this resulted in the green channel being boosted even higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In either case, it can fixed with proper white-balance: Equalize the channels by multipling each one with a constant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, because the image is now non-linear, I have to go back a step to do this. Here’s the dark image from before with all the values temporarily scaled up so I can see the problem:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;… here’s that image with the green taken down to match the other channels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;… and after re-applying the curve:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is really just the bare minimum: I haven’t done any color calibration, the white balance isn’t perfect, there’s lots of noise that needs to be cleaned up…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, applying the curve to each color channel accidentally desaturated the highlights. This effect looks rather good — and is what we’ve come to expect from film — but it’s has de-yellowed the star. It’s possible to separate the luminance and curve it while preserving color. On it’s own, this would make the LED Christmas lights into an overstaturated mess, but combining both methods can produce nice results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For comparison, here’s the image my camera produced from the same data:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far from being an “unedited” photo: there’s a huge amount of math that’s gone into making an image that nicely represents what the subject looks like in person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing that happens when you adjust the contrast or white balance in editing software that the camera hasn’t done under the hood. The edited image isn’t “faker” then the original: they are different renditions of the same data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, replicating human perception is hard, and it’s made harder when constrained to the limitations of display technology or printed images. There’s nothing wrong with tweaking the image when the automated algorithms make the wrong call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Memory loss: As AI gobbles up chips, prices for devices may rise&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Memory loss: As AI gobbles up chips, prices for devices may rise&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The world has a memory problem, thanks to artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The explosion in AI-related cloud computing and data centers has led to so much demand for certain types of memory chips that now there's a shortage. The imbalance is expected to start affecting prices of all sorts of products powered by technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I keep telling everybody that if you want a device, you buy it now," said Avril Wu, a senior research vice president at TrendForce, a Taiwan-based consultancy that tracks markets for computer components. "I myself bought an iPhone 17 already,"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chips are known as RAM, or random access memory, and are crucial to making sure that things like smartphones, computers and game consoles run smoothly. Chips allow you to keep multiple tabs open in browsers, for instance, or watch videos without them being choppy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wu said TrendForce's data indicates that demand for RAM chips exceeds supply by 10% – and it's growing so fast that manufacturers are having to shell out a lot more to buy them each month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wu said this quarter alone, they're paying 50% more than the previous quarter for the most common type of RAM, known as DRAM – dynamic random access memory. And if producers want the chips sooner, they're paying two to three times more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wu expects DRAM prices to rise another 40% in the coming quarter, and she doesn't expect the prices to go down in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How AI is gobbling up memory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI data centers require huge amounts of memory to accompany their cutting-edge graphics processing unit (GPU) microprocessors that train and operate AI models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"AI workloads are built around memory," said Sanchit Vir Gogia, CEO of the tech advisory firm Greyhound Research.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What's more, AI companies are spending billions of dollars constructing data centers at warp speed around the world. It's the reason why Gogia says the demand for these chips isn't just a cyclical blip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"AI has changed the nature of demand itself," he said. "Training and inference systems require large, persistent memory footprints, extreme bandwidth, and tight proximity to compute. You cannot dial this down without breaking performance."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;More chips for AI means fewer chips for other products&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Idaho-based Micron Technology is one of the world's top makers of RAM and it's benefited from this increase in demand. It reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings last week on the back of higher memory chip prices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the company expected the market to remain strong, as the AI boom continues apace. "We believe that the aggregate industry supply will remain substantially short of the demand for the foreseeable future," he said on a webcast after the earnings report.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chipmakers like Micron have shifted production to meet as much of the lucrative AI-related demand for high-end memory as they can, according to analysts. That translates into fewer chips for other segments of the market – personal computers, mobile phones, games and consumer products like TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that means higher costs. Dell Technologies Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke noted the higher costs on an earnings call on Nov. 25. For PC's, he said "I don't see how this will certainly not make its way into the customer base."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Analysts say there is no short-term fix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tech consultant Wu said the memory chip industry faces a significant bottleneck. By the end of 2026, she said, chip makers will have maxed out how much they can expand production in their current facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She said the next new factory expected to come online is being built by Micron in Idaho. The company says it will be operational in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expect suppliers to keep raising prices for the foreseeable future, Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turn on the tap, and water flows without a second thought. But deep beneath New York City, hundreds of feet below street level, workers are finishing a project that’s been under construction for more than half a century — a massive water tunnel that will help keep that simple act possible for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tunnel No. 3, as it’s known, is one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in the city’s history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When complete, it will ensure New Yorkers continue to receive clean water from upstate reservoirs — some more than 125 miles away — while allowing long-overdue maintenance on the city’s two older tunnels, built in 1917 and 1936.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;City Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Rohit Aggarwala and DEP Portfolio Manager Lauren D’Attile recently took an elevator nearly 800 feet down to see the progress for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s not quite as far down as the Empire State Building is tall, but it’s getting there,” Aggarwala said during the 10-minute descent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Down below, flashlights cut through the darkness as water dripped from the rock walls. Workers stood in waterproof boots along the cool, damp concrete — the result of decades of digging, drilling and sealing off bare rock to create a watertight tunnel system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“When this tunnel was originally constructed, it was built by a tunnel boring machine, which is a very large piece of equipment with cutter heads on the front,” said D’Attile. “We drill the tunnel and after that we line that bare rock with a couple of feet of concrete — so that’s what you’re seeing now, because this tunnel is complete.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Construction on Tunnel No. 3 began in 1970.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Bronx and Manhattan already receive water from it, and the final phase — extending service to Brooklyn and Queens — is expected to be completed by 2032.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The project started in 1970, it will be finished in 2032 — that’s 62 years to build this thing,” Aggarwala said. “But a project like this is going to serve New York for two, three hundred years, who knows how much longer than that. Seems worth it. Totally worth it. It’s what makes the city work because we are constantly investing in our future.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it’s complete, the DEP will finally be able to take the older tunnels offline for repairs — a step city engineers have waited decades to take.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above ground, New Yorkers will keep turning on their faucets, washing dishes, and filling glasses — rarely thinking about the billion gallons of water flowing through the underground arteries that make city life possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Slaughtering Competition Problems with Quantifier Elimination&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;22 Dec 2021 - Tags: sage , featured&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anytime I see questions on mse that ask something “simple”, I feel a powerful urge to chime in with “a computer can do this for you!”. Obviously if you’re a researching mathematician you shouldn’t waste your time with something a computer can do for you, but when you’re still learning techniques (or, as is frequently the case on mse, solving homework problems), it’s not a particularly useful comment (so I usually abstain). The urge is particularly powerful when it comes to the contrived inequalities that show up in a lot of competition math, and today I saw a question that really made me want to say something about this! I still feel like it would be a bit inappropriate for mse, but thankfully I have a blog where I can talk about whatever I please :P So today, let’s see how to hit these problems with the proverbial nuke that is quantifier elimination!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want this to be a fairly quick post, so I won’t go into too much detail. The gist is the following powerful theorem from model theory:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tarski-Seidenberg Theorem1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If $\varphi$ is any formula of the form&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;$p(\overline{x}) = 0$, for $p \in \mathbb{R}[\overline{x}]$&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;$p(\overline{x}) \lt 0$, for $p \in \mathbb{R}[\overline{x}]$&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;combinations of the above using $\lor$, $\land$, $\lnot$, $\to$&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;combinations of the above using $\exists$ and $\forall$&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then $\varphi$ is equivalent to a formula without quantifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m legally required to give the following example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The formula $\exists x . a x^2 + bx + c = 0$ (which has a quantifier) is equivalent to the formula $b^2 - 4ac \geq 0$&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a more complicated example, we have&lt;/p&gt;\[\forall x . \exists y . (x &amp;gt; 0 \to ax + by + xy &amp;gt; c)\]&lt;p&gt;is equivalent to&lt;/p&gt;\[b \geq 0 \ \lor \ c + ab \lt 0\]&lt;p&gt;Of course, this means if we want to know whether the above formula really is true for some choice of $a,b,c \in \mathbb{R}$, we can just plug into this quantifier free formula and check!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, you might be wondering: “How did you find this quantifier free expression?”, and the answer is, of course, sage! Sage has interfaces with a lot of pre-existing software, and for us the relevant interface is to QEPCAD, which will actually do quantifier elimination for us!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get started, you have to make sure you have qepcad installed in a way that sage can access. You’ll want to run &lt;code&gt;sage -i qepcad&lt;/code&gt; just in case
(it wasn’t installed for me).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, let’s see how we eliminated quantifiers from the “more complicted example” above!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yup. It’s that easy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in reading more about this, you should check out the documentation, but I’m also going to give a handful of examples in the next section2!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So then, let’s slaughter some competition problems3!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the problem that made me write this post in the first place (here is the mse link again)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let $a,b \geq 0$ with $a^4 + b^4 = 17$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prove $15(a+b) \geq 17 + 14 \sqrt{2ab}$&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t given to us as polynomials, but of course it’s easy for us to fix that by rewriting it as&lt;/p&gt;\[(15(a+b) - 17)^2 \geq 14^2 \cdot 2ab\]&lt;p&gt;then we simply ask sage4:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can extend this too. The asker conjectures that $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$ are the only choices of $(a,b)$ for which we get equality. As a bonus, we can check this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we see that these really are the only points where equality holds!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take another example I remember seeing recently (the original mse link is here):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let $x,y,z$ be positive real numbers. Show&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\(\left ( x + \frac{1}{x} \right ) \left ( y + \frac{1}{y} \right ) \left ( z + \frac{1}{z} \right ) \geq \left ( x + \frac{1}{y} \right ) \left ( y + \frac{1}{z} \right ) \left ( z + \frac{1}{x} \right )\)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, we cannot plug this into sage directly, because it’s not a polynomial inequality. But multiplying through by $xyz$ on both sides solves that issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and even though the asker doesn’t mention it, one thing that Steele makes very clear in the (excellent) book The Cauchy-Schwarz Masterclass is that whenever working with a new inequality, we should ask where it’s sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we ask sage!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out this inequality is sharp at infinitely many points, so instead of asking for the list of all points, we ask for a geometric description of the solution set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, this admits some simplification, since we know that $x = y$ by the second line. I’ll leave it to you to figure out exactly what set this is if you’re interested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an exercise, you should be on the lookout for places to use this tool!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next time somebody is asking about some wacky inequality, or really any question about sets definable by polynomial (in)equations in $\mathbb{R}^n$, you should think about whether you can slaughter the problem without much thought by asking a computer!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a more concrete exercise to show the flexibility of this method, pick your favorite theorem in euclidean geometry. Rephrase it using coordinates, then ask sage if it’s true!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a very concrete exercise, can you do this with Ptolemy’s Theorem?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, if you find yourself using this, definitely come back and let me know! I would love to hear about places where this comes up in the wild!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also also, if you have other (possibly surprising) uses for sage or other programs that automatically answer ceretain problems, definitely let me know! This is one of the parts of mathematical logic that I get most geeky about!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See you next time ^_^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a cute thought exercise, you should try to provide geometric meaning to this claim. It’s telling us that if you take the solution set of polynomial inequations, then project from $\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$ down to $\mathbb{R}^n$, the resulting set is still definable by polynomial inequations!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This should sound somewhat miraculous, and it’s worth trying out some&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, by the end of the post, you’ll have all the tools you need in order to work out some examples on your own ^_^. ↩&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are $\sim \star \sim$ bonus quantifiers $\sim \star \sim$ built into QEPCAD! For instance, we can ask for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;“there exist exactly 5 $x$ so that $\varphi(x)$” (and obviously there’s nothing special about $5$)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;“there exist infinitely many $x$ so that $\varphi(x)$”&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;“the set of $x$ so that $\varphi(x)$ is a connected set”&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;and while these aren’t going to be useful for the purposes of this post, I still wanted to mention them! ↩&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that I’m currently treating this like a kind of party trick, but being able to ask a computer whether an implication between polynomial inequalities is true (and being able to find a counterexample if it isn’t) is super useful in practice! In fact, André Platzer at CMU crucially uses this machinery in order to automatically prove that robots will not bump into each other (etc.). See, for instance, his book Logical Foundations of Cyber-Physical Systems, as well as the accompanying lectures on youtube. ↩&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some reason typing this out wasn’t working for me, but using the constructors directly got things going… There’s probably something to do with the parsing that I don’t understand, and this isn’t too much of a hassle! ↩&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;Foo is bad, and bar is better; here is why ...&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or, at least, be very careful about writing such things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why? Because inevitably, somebody will respond: ‘wait, I was confused, but I think I’ve figured it out: what you’re calling a “bar” I know as a “frobnicated foo”’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A frobnicated foo is obviously a type of foo. So writing things like that alienates a core part of your audience: the people who have strong opinions on frobnicated foos and thing they’re great. That is, the people who agree with you. But they will be put off when they read that foos are bad, and it will be difficult to win them back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Often, when people try to solve a problem, they employ a particular approach. This approach is prone to problems; here is why an alternate approach does not run into those problems.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Names are difficult, and people frequently disagree on their meanings. Replace pesky names with descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And absolute statements (‘foo is always better than bar’) are quite strong, and require an equally strong defense. It’s not necessary to explicitly state an absolute, even if you think it holds. ‘It might be better to use bar than foo sometimes’ is easier to defend than ‘bar is better than foo’, and it’s usually more true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If somebody already knows what a foo is, isn’t it redundant, even patronising, to make them read a description of the problems foo solves and how it solves them? It can be, but it doesn’t have to be. The purpose of a description in this case isn’t just to be a definition-in-place-of-a-name. It’s to frame the problem, in a way that sets up the rest of your argument, and helps people avoid preconceptions they may have about related names. Your argument should be made in reference to your specific framing of the problem, not just in reference to the things that you expect people to know about foos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providing context to your argument also means that it can be read and understood by more people, making it more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simply spewing negativity into the void is not a good enough reason to publish a complaint. There is enough negativity in the world as is. A complaint should have a good reason for existing. In particular, if that reason is to convince people that they should agree with you, then an overly acerbic tone may be unhelpful. And empathy always helps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

You will still forget things, but significantly less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;GSM&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://github.com/bpwhelan/GameSentenceMiner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game Sentence Miner (GSM) is an all-in-one toolkit to turn any visual media into Anki flashcards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the overlay to directly look words up (using Yomitan) in your game, anime, or manga without needing to go to another website to look it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create flashcards in one click with the real audio used, and a gif of what happened on screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyse your statistics to help you learn to read better, over 30+ graphs and extensive goal planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best of all? It's 100% free, works offline, and works for many other languages – not just Japanese!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GSM can take in text from anywhere, create statistics based on it and enhance your Anki cards with gifs + audio along with an overlay dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason you'll see it come up a lot... It's a well loved tool, and for good reason!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GSM's main problem is the barrier to entry can be high, it's got a lot of features and many settings. Thankfully the author has created many, many blog posts and YouTube videos on how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Best Phone Apps&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🏆Renshuu - Overall Winner&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renshuu wins the best app of 2025!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's like Duolingo but better in every way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can work out your level and adjust the difficulty of words or sentences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It gives you varied practice. Writing kanji, flipping flashcards, and fun games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for an easy app to replace the Green Owl™️ but actually be somewhat effective, this is it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Best Android Apps&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's split this up into two, IOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🏆Jidoujisho - Overall Android Winner&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an everything-in-one kinda app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Supports Ankidroid&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Dictionary lookups similar to Yomitan&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Watch videos or listen to audio, and make flashcards from them&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Read books and make flashcards from them&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Read Manga!&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Play video games, visual novels etc.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Instantly look up the lyrics of the song you're listening to, and make flashcards&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do not have access to a computer, this is perhaps the best app to do everything on Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But! It does require some time to setup and learn how it all works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Poe&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poe is Yomitan for Android&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It supports Anki, native audio and pitch accent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote more about this here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;iOS&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let's look at the options on IOS, albeit limited options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🏆Manabi Reader - Overall IOS Winner&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manabi Reader is a way to read on IOS, similar to Jidoujisho but with less features. Not their fault, mostly IOS has a lot of walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can look words up in dictionaries and send things to Anki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See breakdown of sentences, how many words in a sentence do you know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read books and webpages and get full comprehension statistics about that page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also look up words using OCR or by pasting the text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author is working on a bunch of new features as they told me:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some exclusive behind the scenes screenshots of the new Manabi Reader, coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Shiori Reader&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is another "look things up and make anki cards" app, but this time it focusses on reading books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Best Anki Decks&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we've talked so much about Anki, one of the big questions people have who begun using it is "what decks do I use?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🏆Kaishi - Overall Best Anki Deck&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the definitive Anki deck for people just getting into learning Japanese with Anki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is that this teaches the most common words found in media, not necessarily the words you'll come across ordering food in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you finish this deck you then know enough Japanese to read books / immerse. You will still struggle, but it won't be as bad as starting from 0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Japanese Proper Nouns&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have problems reading city names? What about names of people?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proper nouns Anki deck is designed to teach you all the important proper nouns you'll encounter, and then pretty much every proper noun ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Best Anki Notetypes&lt;/head&gt;&lt;quote&gt;"okay bee, I finished Kaishi. I want to use Yomitan to make my own Anki deck but it wants a note type... what do I use?"&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hear you say! probably....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🏆Kiku&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiku came out swinging towards the end of 2025 as the go to Anki note type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other note types were static, but Kiku harnessed the power of Javascript in Anki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;View similar Kanji, and view other flashcards that you made that use that kanji!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you come across a word used in a really nice context, but you already have a flashcard for it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want to make another flashcard because you love this context, but it's just not possible without duplicating them or deleting your old card 🫠&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiku solves this by allowing you to have multiple contexts in one card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Anki card themes come in either light mode or dark mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiku has over 35 themes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiku also has a settings page and a plugins system to really customise it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a bullet pointed list of my favourite features:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fade out the front of the card after 3 seconds, encouraging you to answer faster.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Blur images which are tagged NSFW&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Only blur them between 9 - 5pm workdays... In case you want to see said images when you're at home :)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Display extra fields, such as SentenceTranslation.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Randomise the font, so you learn the word in any font not just the main one you use.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Add external links to your cards to easily see the card in Jisho, Nadeshiko etc.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Hover over Kanji in your cards and see it broken down.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Lapis&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lapis is made by the same person who made Kaishi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's very similar to Kiku but without all the fancy features (Kiku is based on Lapis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want a less Javascript heavy card, this is great!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Best Anki Addons&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you use Anki, another common question people have is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;What Anki addons can I use to maximise it?&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🏆Priority reorder&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you make Anki cards, they kinda go into a semi random order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every word in Japanese is equally important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migaku, who ran an analysis on Netflix found these statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you select a word at random, there is a 10% chance that word is one of these three:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;50% chance it will be one of 45 words:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Words are repeated, often. Just learning the top 1500 words or so means you can understand 80% of all words in a show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore it makes sense to learn your Anki cards in the order of most frequent first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priority Reorder does this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all media is equal. One Piece has a lot of pirate talk, but you won't find that in other media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't it be cool to learn the most frequent words in One Piece if your goal is to watch it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priority reorder does that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, you have a short term memory. Flashcards you made today will stick better than flashcards made 50 days ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't it be cool to also prioritise recently made flashcards that appear frequently in One Piece?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priority Reorder does this!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't it be cool to mine words that have a high frequency?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Kanji Grid&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking to take the JLPT or similar and wondering "god, do I really know all the kanji in that exam?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or wanting to just see how you progress in terms of Kanji?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kanji Grid addon is for you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1610304449&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Local Audio Server&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an addon that works with Yomitan or similar tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It lets you listen to native audio in Yomitan, and even add that to your Anki cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes a bit to set up, but once you do you don't have to mess with it. You can now have native audio on all of your Anki cards!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Best paid solution&lt;/head&gt;&lt;quote&gt;This is all too much setup! I wish there was some sort of company I could pay to do this all for me&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to worry, there is!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🏆Migaku&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migaku is an all-in-one solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They aim to do everything mentioned here already, albeit imperfectly and for a price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have courses which teach you the top 1500 words, Kanji and grammar designed to help you immerse as soon as possible similar to Kaishi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have their own SRS alternative to Anki, so you don't need addons etc to make anything work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can watch Netflix and look up all the words you want. They'll even highlight good words you should make flashcards out of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can tell you how much of a specific video you know in terms of words, what is your expected comprehension of it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Read books&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Watch videos locally&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Study Netflix / YouTube videos&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Generate subtitles if none exist&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for an alright solution to learning Japanese and you don't mind spending money, in my opinion this is it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me personally, messing with tools is one of my little joys so I don't mind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Best for Games:&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese games are the greatest, let's look at options to learn Japanese from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only real option is to use OCR, which is a fancy word to mean "the computer will read the text on the screen and give you the sentence so you can copy it / look it up".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🏆Game Sentence Miner - Winner of Best For Games&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;After winning overall earlier, it does make sense that game sentence miner is the best for games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you setup OCR, you can then setup the overlay to be able to look words up directly in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes around 1 second to go from "text appearing on screen" to "being able to look up the text".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a GPU it could be even less time, around 0.5 seconds or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://github.com/AuroraWright/owocr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can then click the plus icon to make a flashcard, and GSM will make it all in the background. You don't have to constantly switch between enjoying a game and making flashcards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Meikipop&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a really fast OCR that works anywhere on Windows, Linux or Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's super simple to setup and use, and it works similar to GSM's "hover over the word to see the meaning"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only downside is that you can't mine to Anki with it, however it is extremely simple to use, fast, and works on anything on your screen (even Windows settings) so for that reason it's winning second place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Yomininja&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yomininja is another tool similar to GSM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It uses OCR to scan the screen and lets you look things up:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a lot simpler than GSM, but in my opinion it's not as pretty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GSM doesn't highlight boxes red by default, and you can hover over the words and see the definition above them as you read it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Yomininja there's this extra box on the side you have to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to mention the fact that GSM lets you easily make flashcards with the audio and a gif from the game itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Yomininja is extremely easy to use and a fan favourite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Best for visual novels&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🏆GSM - Best for Visual Novels&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;GSM is really, really good for visual media on a computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to visual novels, we can use texthookers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A texthooker grabs this text and gives it to you, letting you look things up without OCR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll talk more about this next!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texthookers work with the overlay just like OCR does with games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's explore an under-rated feature in GSM, as our next tool will have this too – stats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GSM has over 35 charts related to statistics about everything you read, designed to help you answer questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Do I read better in the morning or evening?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Do I read faster reading horror or slice of life?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Do I play more games or visual novels? Which one is better for me in terms of learning?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Am I improving?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;JL&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;JL is an alternative Japanese dictionary program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It works really, really well for visual novels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote extensively about it here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in short:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;It's really fast&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It has amazing features specifically for Japanese&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It requires a texthooker and is Windows only :(&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like how you can put the textbox over the visual novel, which lets you do something similar to GSM's overlay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JL also has some stats:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even more excitedly they have stats on how many times you looked up a word, something that no other dictionary app has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Best texthookers&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texthookers are lil programs that "hook" into visual novels or some games, take the text on your screen and give it to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are faster and more accurate than OCR, but sometimes awkward to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🏆LunaTranslator&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;By far the best texthooker out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It works on everything I try in terms of visual novels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can hook emulated devices such as PSP, PS2, and the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you find a "bad" hook (one that has a lot of junk) there's a million things you can do to make it more normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like filtering out curly braces, filtering out non Japanese text etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this doesn't help you, you can even write a Python file to preprocess the text!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of this, Luna supports much more than just hooking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;OCR&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Speech Recognition (it listens to the sound the game is making, and tries to turn those sounds into sentences)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;You can install Yomitan and use it similarly to JL (it wont overlay like GSM does though)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are some rumours that the author has stolen the code of other people and rebranded it as their own (I have not found evidence of this, please let me know in the comments if you have proof).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. The license is MIT. Legally you're allowed to take the code and not credit. But, morally it's right to credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. The work is transformative, they took code in one language and rewrote it to work with C++ for Luna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Agent (talked about next) also has its own drama. It's not open source, and it encrypts the Nintendo Switch hooks to prevent competition from getting them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, it's really confusing and messy. Decide for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, when writing code people often tell you what has changed since the last release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Luna author does not do this, it's kind of confusing to figure out what's been added or removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led to people not trusting them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of this, it supports a lot. Like translation, yomitan, Japanese parsing etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led to someone forking the code and creating their own version, removing all of this and keeping just the hooking part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Agent&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agent is a much simpler texthooking program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has a database of hooks, and you click on the game or visual novel you want to play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You then have a perfect hook, it's not dirty and works first time without much issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that it doesn't have hooks for all games and visual novels, yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chen's Textractor&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen's textractor works similarly to Luna and Agent, closer to Luna in the sense that you find the hook yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's most similar to Textractor (it's a fork) which is an older texthooking program, so many people love this as its similar to what they already use and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Texthooking Pages&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's say you want to use Yomitan to mine from games / visual novels without GSM / JL or Yomininja etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yomitan is browser only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to take the text from OCR / Texthooking and place it onto a webpage to look up words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's some opinions about these, so let's list the most popular ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🏆Kizuna&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kizuna is a texthooking paged based on another one by Renji.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everytime your texthooker receives a line of text, it sends it to this page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here you can use Yomitan to look up words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kizuna is special because it's a social texthooking page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It records characters read and time spent per visual novel:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you can create "rooms" with your friends to compare your stats together and motivate each other:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's three main downsides are that it is focused primarily on Japanese visual novels, it's not open source and it doesn't let you export your data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Renji's Texthooking Page&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renji's page inspired Kizuna's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a simple texthooking page that can be downloaded and ran entirely locally, with its source code published online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks pretty much exactly the same:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people use Renji's because it's lightweight and has many settings to allow you to configure things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe too many settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Renji's texthooker is open source it is often bundled into other software like Game Sentence Miner which has added a few specific features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Kizuna has stats, Renji's does not other than characters read and time spent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author, Renji, actually suggests people use GameSentenceMiner for stats with their texthooker:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ExStatic&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed in the previous paragraph someone mentioned ExStatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is another texthooking page but with a lot more stats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in terms of functionality of the page itself, it's lacking somethings that Renji's has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, many people use ExStatic as an easy way to get beautiful stats. It is open source and can be run entirely locally, without an internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other stat apps form opinions, like what is Japanese? Do English letters count? Like does the T in "Ｔシャツ" count?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By giving you raw data, you can decide for yourself what counts and change the stats at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only ExStatic, Renji's and GSM support storing raw lines of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;best for manga&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🏆Mokuro + Mokuro Reader - Joint 1st&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mokuro is a file format for manga. It's basically a HTML overlay over a bunch of Manga images that let you look up the words in that manga panel using Yomitan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does this by OCRing the manga to generate this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mokuro Reader is the app that lets you read these files:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main problem with this is finding manga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to find a way to buy the manga, get the raw images, and process it. There are less than legal ways to do this, but I won't talk about that here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can store all of your manga in the cloud along with progress etc and easily read from any device (you can read from any device, and use Yomitan on Android if you want to mine):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you read manga, since it is in the browser, you can use Yomitan to look things up:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For reading it has some cool features, like a night mode to block out blue light to make night reading easier:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a million other minor settings to alter how you read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course it also has Anki support. Make a word card using Yomitan and then&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Double click the screen to grab an image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's even stats!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the manga itself you can see how long it'd take to read your current volume:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stats are visually appealing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With cool per volume / series data:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My main complaints are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;The stats are precomputed, it does not store your raw data. This means if you change your mind about something (like I don't want to count English letters, I don't want to count repeated things like aaaaaa, or I want to set my AFK timer to be lower) it's impossible to change.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;You have to use Mokuro'd manga, which is very hard to find and painful to convert if you don't have a powerful computer.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🏆MangaTan - Joint 1st&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;MangaTan was born out of anger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anger at Mokuro files being terrible to create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anger at current manga websites shoving 10 ads / second down your throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hear it from the creator:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;We can just drag and drop light novels into ttsu, hook into visual novels with ease, or load up anime with subtitles in ASB or Memento.&lt;lb/&gt;But manga? Manga has always been the exception.&lt;lb/&gt;The process often meant needing a high-end GPU just to run tools like Mokuro, and then waiting for it to finish&lt;lb/&gt;And don't get me started with those terrible websites that use the worst hosts in existence.&lt;lb/&gt;Who doesn't miss the old days of simply reading manga in bed? Before we were hardcore weebs, we didn't have to deal with our tenth ad on a limited 100kbit-speed-limited hoster while using Tachiyomi. But you can cast aside that&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it was Mokuro (the converter) vs Mangatan, Mangatan would win. I once spent 27 hours converting a single volume of manga into Mokuro.... and the OCR sucked. A lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mangatan aims to get rid of all the painpoints of Mokuro:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;You don't have to spend 20+ hours converting manga to mokuro files&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Or searching for Mokuro files across the web&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;It works with over 1200+ sites, the second a new volume of manga is released you can read it 🥳&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The setup requires some computer skills but once its done, it works alright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.exe&lt;/code&gt;, which would make Mangatan extremely easy to use.&lt;p&gt;Update: After I joined their Discord thread and talked about this, there is now a one-click&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.exe&lt;/code&gt; you can use!&lt;p&gt;Mangatan is my favourite. I don't want to update this, as it happened after my imaginary award show. But future readers: use Mangatan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use this fork https://github.com/KolbyML/Mangatan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time you load a page it will OCR it and let you look things up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can even crop images to send to Anki:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's very lightweight once its running. All it does is OCR the manga and crop images for anki cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the author themselves:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also a bunch of settings, for example you can use your own OCR server if you want:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like setting the colour to purple and font colour to black, as it makes it look nicer to me:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no stats, but in this case it's a good thing. Mangatan is extremely lightweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also works on Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;GSM&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also use GSM's OCR to read manga if you so wish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up the OCR, and then open the overlay and you can create flashcards etc similar to how Mangatan does it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GSM even has stats for manga:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because GSM stores the raw data, you can also use it to calculate how many times you've seen a kanji, or search to see the first time you encountered a word or kanji. You can do anything you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the downsides are that GSM isn't made for manga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it takes a screenshot, it can't crop the manga like Mokuro does (due to it being built for games / full screen things).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at this Anki card:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The image has black bars around it, whereas if it was cropped it would not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you already have a good GSM setup, it makes sense to use this. But if you want a really good manga setup, maybe this isn't so good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also not as automatic as Mangatan, if you want nice stats you need to tell GSM you're reading something new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mangatan can only use Suwayomi whereas GSM can OCR any type of manga. But, Suwayomi has all the manga already so it's not that much of an improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, GSM does not work on Android unlike Mokuro Reader and Mangatan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Best Video Players&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people get into learning Japanese because of anime, so now let's talk about the best video players out there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🏆Migaku&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being a paid for product, I believe Migaku offers the best service for watching videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly let's look at this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migaku shows you an estimated comprehension score for the video you want to watch. It uses the frequency of the words and your known words to calculate this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not as simple as "you know these words, you don't know these" – it uses an algorithm to work out the average frequency of words you do and don't know and uses that to calculate how hard a media is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example if the words you don't know are very high frequency, it will be a lower difficulty than a video with a bunch of words you don't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the show doesn't have subtitles, you can also generate them using the top bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migaku has about a million different presets for you to watch videos, or you can make your own:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as keyboard shortcuts so you don't even have to use a mouse:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the UI is too cluttered you can just hide everything apart from this tab:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migaku will highlight words in good sentences to mine with high frequency, and you can even tell it to include a lil single definition under the word to help you read the sentence:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migaku works on Netflix and Disney+, but all of these screenshots use their local player. This is just a DVD I'm playing 😃&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its main downside is that it costs money, but I believe Migaku is easily the best video player out there in terms of features and ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But... It does cost money and do you really need those extra features? It's up to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ASB Player&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASB Player is the GOAT of free video players for Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's offline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It works with Netflix, YouTube etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It extracts subtitles from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can mine from it just like Migaku.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's really not much to it. It plays videos well, has great subtitle support and lets you mine from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is why it's so good and well loved, it does one thing and does it well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, compared to Migaku it is missing a few features some people may want:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Ability to generate subtitles&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Highlighting words you should mine&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you don't care for those features, ASB Player is great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I haven't tried this, it sounds cool. I would love gifs of anime scenes on my Anki cards 😄&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update 2: I tried this. The ASB Player websocket is for controlling the player, not for subtitles ☹️&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;but you can use MPV with MPV Web Socket (which does do subtitles) to get pretty gifs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However you need to download files locally and sync the subtitles which is a bit of a pain....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Yomine&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yomine is a relatively new player in the field, and not actually a video player but something that supports video players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use their words:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;A Japanese vocabulary mining tool designed to help language learners extract and study words from subtitle files. It integrates with ASBPlayer and MPV for timestamp navigation, ranks terms by frequency, and supports Anki integration to filter out known words.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it's kinda of like the Migaku "you should mine this word" feature, but for ASB Player and free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It basically extracts all the words from a video, checks to see if you have them in Anki and sorts them by a frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this you can then click a button to mine that word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some interesting ways people use it, which may not be obvious:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;If you saw a word you want to mine, but you were too busy to mine it you can use Yomine to search your favourite anime etc to find the word and mine it later on.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If you want to play a video game or visual novel, you could download a Let's Play of it and generate a comprehension score or pre-mine words you need to know.&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;This is different than downloading Anki decks from Jiten and friends, because it's specifically words you need to know.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Also you get to watch a Let's Play which is like double immersion points 😯&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Using GSM to generate a Long Play (basically a large &lt;code&gt;mp4&lt;/code&gt;recording of a game you're playing with a subtitles file), loading it into Yomine and mining all the words you didn't mine during that playthrough. Useful if you want to play now, mine later.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Best Websites&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let's look at some of the best websites out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🏆Jiten&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jiten is a website that stores thousands of Japanese media and tells you a rough difficulty for them, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They support all sorts of media, not just visual novels or anime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Jiten you can upload a list of vocaburary you know (syncs with Anki and other tools):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jiten can then rank how many words in the media you know, and tell you a personalised coverage score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something I like to do is find visual novels with &amp;gt;80% external rating (external rating == reviews on vndb, anilist etc) which I have &amp;gt;80% coverage for (meaning I will understand most of it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you've found a piece of media you like hit "statistics" and see a cool graph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in this anime to understand 95% of it you just need to know the most frequency 1944 words that appear in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand 99%, you need to know an extra 3200ish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning 1944 of the words in this anime seems great, but how do we actually learn them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No worries, Jiten lets you download Anki decks with the exact freq order of that show. Learn the words you need to know for the media you want to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If doing premade Anki decks isn't your thing, download the "occurrences" dictionary to get a frequency list you can use in Yomitan to tell you how often a word appears in the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That way I can mine high frequent words in shows I want to watch, without watching them yet. Almost like I'm prepping for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jiten also has a dictionary you can use. Search a word to see its frequency, and all the media that word is in:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of dictionaries, you can download global frequency lists on Jiten too:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, Jiten has a lot of data and every single week it is improving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Yokubi - Morg Grammar Guide&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have spent any amount of time in Japanese spaces online you may have heard of "Morg". Especially on Discord or Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's a really nice guy who knows a lot about grammar and wants to help you learn Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year he took it upon himself to improve the Sakubi grammar guide, and ended up writing Yokubi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a really succinct grammar guide designed to get you immersing ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Best for books&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;🏆LumieReader&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lumie Reader came out hitting this year with a single premise:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;What if we made ttsu but good?&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's entirely offline, very fast and supports a lot of features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has some features over other readers like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Bookmarks&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Extensive statistics for reading&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Cloud sync (this is the biggest one)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Social features, like sharing what you are reading&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can tell I don't read books can't ya...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year has been amazing for Japanese learning tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to give back to the community but don't want to code, many of these devs have donation links listed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's your favourite tool?

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;You can make up HTML tags:&lt;/head&gt;(Programming)&lt;p&gt;Instead of writing HTML like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class=cool-thing&amp;gt;
Hello, World!
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;… you can write HTML like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;cool-thing&amp;gt;
Hello, World!
&amp;lt;/cool-thing&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;… and CSS like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cool-thing {
	display: block;
	font-weight: bold;
	text-align: center;
	filter: drop-shadow(0 0 0.5em #ff0);
	color: #ff0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Browsers handle unrecognized tags by treating them as a generic element, with no effect beyond what’s specified in the CSS. This isn’t just a weird quirk, but is standardized behavior. If you include hyphens in the name, you can guarantee that your tag won’t appear in any future versions of HTML.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you should use descriptive built-in tags if they exist, if it’s a choice between &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;, making up your own tag provides better readability then using a bunch of class names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example, if you have a bunch of nested tags:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class=article&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div class=article-header&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div class=article-quote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div class=quote-body&amp;gt;
... a bunch more HTML ...
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good luck trying to insert something inside of “article-heading” but after “article-quote” on the first try. This problem vanishes if you use descriptive tag names — no &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; counting required:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;main-article&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;article-header&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;article-quote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;quote-body&amp;gt;
... a bunch more HTML ...
&amp;lt;/quote-body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/article-quote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!-- here! --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/article-header&amp;gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;AI Data Centers Demand More Than Copper Can Deliver&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Radio and terahertz links could be better, faster, and cheaper&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In data-center terms, scaling out involves linking computers, while scaling up packs more GPUs into a computer, challenging copper’s physical limits.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Copper cables face a phenomenon at high data rates at high data rates that necessitate wider wires and more power, complicating a data center’s dense connections.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Point2 and AttoTude propose radio-based cables, offering longer reach, lower power consumption, and narrower cables than copper, without the cost and complexity of optics.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Startups aim to directly integrate radio cables with GPUs, easing cooling needs and enhancing data-center efficiency.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How fast you can train gigantic new AI models boils down to two words: up and out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In data-center terms, scaling out means increasing how many AI computers you can link together to tackle a big problem in chunks. Scaling up, on the other hand, means jamming as many GPUs as possible into each of those computers, linking them so that they act like a single gigantic GPU, and allowing them to do bigger pieces of a problem faster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two domains rely on two different physical connections. Scaling out mostly relies on photonic chips and optical fiber, which together can sling data hundreds or thousands of meters. Scaling up, which results in networks that are roughly 10 times as dense, is the domain of much simpler and less costly technology—copper cables that often span no more than a meter or two.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This article is part of our special report Top Tech 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the increasingly high GPU-to-GPU data rates needed to make more powerful computers work are coming up against the physical limits of copper. As the bandwidth demands on copper cables approach the terabit-per-second realm, physics demands that they be made shorter and thicker, says David Kuo, vice president of product marketing and business development at the data-center-interconnect startup Point2 Technology. That’s a big problem, given the congestion inside computer racks today and the fact that Nvidia, the leading AI hardware company, plans an eightfold increase in the maximum number of GPUs per system, from 72 to 576 by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We call it the copper cliff,” says Kuo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The industry is working on ways to unclog data centers by extending copper’s reach and bringing slim, long-reaching optical fiber closer to the GPUs themselves. But Point2 and another startup, AttoTude, advocate for a solution that’s simultaneously in between the two technologies and completely different from them. They claim the tech will deliver the low cost and reliability of copper as well as some of the narrow gauge and distance of optical—a combination that will handily meet the needs of future AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their answer? Radio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later this year, Point2 will begin manufacturing the chips behind a 1.6-terabit-per-second cable consisting of eight slender polymer waveguides, each capable of carrying 448 gigabits per second using two frequencies, 90 gigahertz and 225 GHz. At each end of the waveguide are plug-in modules that turn electronic bits into modulated radio waves and back again. AttoTude is planning essentially the same thing, but at terahertz frequencies and with a different kind of svelte, flexible cable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both companies say their technologies can easily outdo copper in reach—spanning 10 to 20 meters without significant loss, which is certainly long enough to handle Nvidia’s announced scale-up plans. And in Point2’s case, the system consumes one-third of optical’s power, costs one-third as much, and offers as little as one-thousandth the latency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to its proponents, radio’s reliability and ease of manufacturing compared with those of optics mean that it might beat photonics in the race to bring low-energy processor-to-processor connections all the way to GPU, eliminating some copper even on the printed circuit board.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What’s wrong with copper?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, what’s wrong with copper? Nothing, so long as the data rate isn’t too high and the distance it has to go isn’t too far. At high data rates, though, conductors like copper fall prey to what’s called the skin effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 1.6-terabit-per-second e-Tube cable has half the area of a 32-gauge copper cable and has up to 20 times the reach. Point2 Technology&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The skin effect occurs because the signal’s rapidly changing current leads to a changing magnetic field that tries to counter the current. This countering force is concentrated at the middle of the wire, so most of the current is confined to flowing at the wire’s outer edge—the “skin”—which increases resistance. At 60 hertz—the mains frequency in many countries—most of the current is in the outer 8 millimeters of copper. But at 10 GHz, the skin is just 0.65 micrometers deep. So to push high-frequency data through copper, the wire needs to be wider, and you need more power. Both requirements work against packing more and more connections into a smaller space to scale up computing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To counteract the skin effect and other signal-degrading issues, companies have developed copper cables with specialized electronics at either end. With the most promising, called active electrical cables, or AECs, the terminating chip is called a retimer (pronounced “re-timer”). This IC cleans up the data signal and the clock signal as they arrive from the processor. The circuit then retransmits them down the copper cable’s typically eight pairs of wires, or lanes. (There is a second set for transmitting in the other direction.) At the other end, the chip’s twin takes care of any noise or clock issues that accumulate during the journey and sends the data on to the receiving processor. Thus, at the cost of electronic complexity and power consumption, an AEC can extend the distance that copper can reach.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don Barnetson, senior vice president and head of product at Credo, which provides network hardware to data centers, says his company has developed an AEC that can deliver 800 Gb/s as far as 7 meters—a distance that’s likely needed as computers hit 500 to 600 GPUs and span multiple racks. The first use of AECs will probably be to link individual GPUs to the network switches that form the scale-out network. This first stage in the scale-out network is important, says Barnetson, because “it’s the only nonredundant hop in the network.” Losing that link, even momentarily, can cause an AI training run to collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even if retimers manage to push the copper cliff a bit farther into the future, physics will eventually win. Point2 and AttoTude are betting that point is coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Terahertz radio’s reach&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AttoTude grew out of founder and CEO Dave Welch’s deep investigations into photonics. A cofounder of Infinera, an optical telecom–equipment maker purchased by Nokia in 2025, Welch developed photonic systems for decades. He knows the technology’s weaknesses well: It consumes too much power (about 10 percent of a data center’s compute budget, according to Nvidia); it’s extremely sensitive to temperature; getting light into and out of photonics chips requires micrometer-precision manufacturing; and the technology’s lack of long-term reliability is notorious. (There’s even a term for it: “link flap.”)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Customers love fiber. But what they hate is the photonics,” says Welch. “Electronics have been demonstrated to be inherently more reliable than optics.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fresh off Nokia’s US $2.3 billion purchase of Infinera, Welch asked himself some fundamental questions as he contemplated his next startup, beginning with “If I didn’t have to be at [an optical wavelength], where should I be?” The answer was the highest frequency that’s achievable purely with electronics—the terahertz regime, 300 to 3,000 GHz.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You start with passive copper, and you do everything you can to run in passive copper as long as you can.” —Don Barnetson, Credo&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So Welch and his team set about building a system that consists of a digital component to interface with the GPU, a terahertz-frequency generator, and a mixer to encode the data on the terahertz signal. An antenna then funnels the signal into a narrow, flexible waveguide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for the waveguide, it’s made of a dielectric at the center, which channels the terahertz signal, surrounded by cladding. One early version was just a narrow, hollow copper tube. Welch says that the second-generation cable—made up of fibers only about 200 µm across— points to a system with losses down to 0.3 decibels per meter—a small fraction of the loss from a typical copper cable carrying 224 Gb/s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Welch predicts this waveguide will be able to carry data as far as 20 meters. That “happens to be a beautiful distance for scale-up in data centers,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, AttoTude has made the individual components—the digital data chip, the terahertz-signal generator, the circuit that mixes the two—along with a couple generations of waveguides. But the company hasn’t yet integrated them into a single pluggable form. Still, Welch says, the combination delivers enough bandwidth for at least 224 Gb/s transmission, and the startup demonstrated 4-meter transmission at 970 GHz last April at the Optical Fiber Communications Conference, in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Radio’s reach in the data center&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Point2 has been aiming to bring radio to the data center longer than AttoTude has. Formed nine years ago by veterans of Marvell, Nvidia, and Samsung, the startup has pulled in $55 million in venture funding, most notably from computer cables and connections maker Molex. The latter’s backing “is critical, because they’re a major part of the cable-and-connector ecosystem,” says Kuo. Molex has already shown that it can make Point2’s cable without modifying its existing manufacturing lines, and now Foxconn Interconnect Technology, which makes cables and connectors, is partnering with the startup. The support could be a big selling point for the hyperscalers who would be Point2’s customers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia’s GB200 NVL72 rack-scale computer relies on many copper cables to link its 72 processors together.NVIDIA&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each end of the Point2 cable, called an e-Tube, consists of a single silicon chip that converts the incoming digital data into modulated millimeter-wave frequencies and an antenna that radiates into the waveguide. The waveguide itself is a plastic core with metal cladding, all wrapped in a metal shield. A 1.6-Tb/s cable, called an active radio cable (ARC), is made up of eight e-Tube cores. At 8.1 millimeters across, that cable takes up half the volume of a comparable AEC cable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of operating at RF frequencies is that the chips that handle them can be made in a standard silicon foundry, says Kuo. A collaboration between engineers at Point2 and the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, reported this year in the IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, used 28-nanometer CMOS technology, which hasn’t been cutting edge since 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The scale-up network market&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As promising as their tech sounds, Point2 and AttoTude will have to overcome the data-center industry’s long history with copper. “You start with passive copper,” says Credo’s Barnetson. “And you do everything you can to run in passive copper as long as you can.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The boom in liquid cooling for data-center computing is evidence of that, he says. “The entire reason people have gone to liquid cooling is to keep [scaling up] in passive copper,” Barnetson says. To connect more GPUs in a scale-up network with passive copper, they must be packed in at densities too high for air cooling alone to handle. Getting the same kind of scale-up from a more spread-out set of GPUs connected by millimeter-wave ARCs would ease the need for cooling, suggests Kuo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, both startups are also chasing a version of the technology that will attach directly to the GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nvidia and Broadcom recently deployed optical transceivers that live inside the same package as a processor, separating the electronics and optics by micrometers rather than centimeters or meters. Right now, the technology is limited to the network-switch chips that connect to a scale-out network. But big players and startups alike are trying to extend its use all the way to the GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both Welch and Kuo say their companies’ technologies could have a big advantage over optical tech in such a transceiver-processor package. Nvidia and Broadcom—separately—had to do a mountain of engineering to make their systems possible to manufacture and reliable enough to exist in the same package as a very expensive processor. One of the many challenges is how to attach an optical fiber to a waveguide on a photonic chip with micrometer accuracy. Because of its short wavelength, infrared laser light must be lined up very precisely with the core of an optical fiber, which is only around 10 µm across. By contrast, millimeter-wave and terahertz signals have a much longer wavelength, so you don’t need as much precision to attach the waveguide. In one demo system it was done by hand, says Kuo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pluggable connections will be the technology’s first use, but radio transceivers co-packaged with processors are “the real prize,” says Welch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
