  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Homemade 1000+ transistor array chip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2018 I made the first lithographically fabricated integrated circuits in my garage fab. I was a senior in high school when I made the Z1 amplifier, and now I’m a senior in college so there are some long overdue improvements to the amateur silicon process.&lt;lb/&gt; The Z1 had 6 transistors and was a great test chip to develop all the processes and equipment. The Z2 has 100 transistors on a 10µm polysilicon gate process – same technology as Intel’s first processor. My chip is a simple 10×10 array of transistors to test, characterize, and tweak the process but this is a huge step closer to more advanced DIY computer chips. The Intel 4004 has 2,200 transistors and I’ve now made 1,200 on the same piece of silicon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Previously, I made chips with a metal gate process. The aluminum gate has a large work function difference with the silicon channel beneath it which results in a high threshold voltage (&amp;gt;10V). I used these metal gate transistors in a few fun projects like a guitar distortion pedal and a ring oscillator LED blinker but both of these required one or two 9V batteries to run the circuit due to high Vth. By switching to a polysilicon gate process, I get a ton of performance benefits (self aligned gate means lower overlap capacitances) including a much lower Vth which makes these chips compatible with 2.5V and 3.3V logic levels. The new FETs have excellent characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;NMOS Electrical Properties: Vth = 1.1 V Vgs MAX = 8 V Cgs = &amp;lt;0.9 pF Rise/fall time = &amp;lt;10 ns On/off ratio = 4.3e6 Leakage current = 932 pA (Vds=2.5V)&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was particularly surprised by the super low leakage current. This value goes up about 100x in ambient room lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we know that it’s possible to make really good transistors with impure chemicals, no cleanroom, and homemade equipment. Of course, yield and process repeatability are diminished. I’ll do more testing to collect data on the statistics and variability of FET properties but it’s looking good!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chip is small, about one quarter the die area of my previous ICs (2.4mm^2) which makes it hard to probe. There’s a simple 10×10 array of N-channel FETs on each chip which will give me a lot of characterization data. Since it’s such a simple design, I was able to lay it out using Photoshop. Columns of 10 transistors share a common gate connection and each row is strung together in series with adjacent transistors sharing a source/drain terminal. It’s similar to NAND flash but I only did this to keep the metal pads large enough so I can reasonably probe them, if every FET had 3 pads for itself they would be too small.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to convey the excitement of seeing a good FET curve displayed on the curve tracer after dipping a shard of rock into chemicals all day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A single 10µm NMOS transistor can be see below, with slight misalignment in the metal layer (part of the left contact is uncovered). Red outline is polycrystalline silicon, blue is the source/drain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far I’ve made an opamp (Z1) and a memory-like array (Z2). More interesting circuits are definitely possible even with this low transistor density. The process needs some tweaking but now that I’m able to consistently make good quality transistors I should be able to design more complex digital and analog circuits. Testing each chip is very tedious so I am trying to automate the process and I’ll post more data then. I’ve made 15 chips (1,500 transistors) and know there’s at least one completely functional chip and at least two “mostly functional”, meaning ~80% of the transistors work instead of 100%. No proper yield data yet. The most common defect is a drain or source shorted to the bulk silicon channel, not a leaky or shorted gate like on my Z1 process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I said before that the gate used to be made out of aluminum and now it’s silicon which makes the chips work a lot better. Silicon comes in three varieties that we care about: amorphous, polycrystalline, and monocrystalline. From left to right, these become more electrically conductive but also much harder to deposit. In fact, monocrystalline Si can’t be deposited, you can only grow it in contact with another mono-Si layer as a seed (epitaxy). Since the gate must be deposited on top of an insulating dielectric, poly is the best we can do. We can heavily dope the polysilicon anyway to make it more conductive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A typical self-aligned polysilicon gate process requires silane, a toxic and explosive gas, to deposit polycrystalline silicon layers. It may also be possible by sputtering or evaporating amorphous silicon and annealing with a laser. A major theme of this DIY silicon process is to circumvent expensive, difficult, or dangerous steps. So, I came up with a modified process flow. It’s a variation on the standard self-aligned methods to allow doping via high temperature diffusion rather than ion implantation. The effect is that I’m able to buy a silicon wafer with the polysilicon already deposited on it from the factory and pattern it to make transistors instead of putting my own polysilicon down halfway through the process. This is a nice short term workaround but it would be best to design a polysilicon deposition process using the laser anneal method mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wafers are available with all kinds of materials deposited on them already, so I just had to find one with a thin layer of SiO2 (gate oxide, ~10nm) followed by a thicker polysilicon (300nm). I found a lot of 25 200mm (EPI, prime, [1-0-0], p-type) wafers on eBay for $45 which is essentially a lifetime supply, so email me if you want one. The gate oxide is the most fragile layer and requires the most care during fabrication. Since I bought the wafer with a nice high quality oxide on it already that was capped off and kept clean by the thick polysilicon layer, I was able to eliminate all the aggressive cleaning chemicals (sulfuric acid, etc) from the process and still make great transistors. Minimal process chemicals and tools are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Chemicals used in home poly-gate process: -Water -Alcohol -Acetone -Phosphoric acid -Photoresist -Developer (2% KOH) -N type dopant (filmtronics P509) -HF (1%) or CF4/CHF3 RIE -HNO3 for poly etch or SF6 RIE&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Equipment used in home poly-gate process: -Hotplate -Tube furnace -Lithography apparatus -Microscope -Vacuum chamber to deposit metal&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Z2 “gate first” process (similar to standard self-aligned process but without a field oxide):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I snapped one of the test chips in half (functional Z2 but with bad layer alignment and thin metal, about 300nm) and put it in my SEM for a cross section:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find the dust particle in the red circle below, use that to get oriented in the coming cross section views.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because I bought the wafer already with gate oxide and polysilicon on it, I can’t grow a field oxide. These thick oxide layers are typically used to mask dopants and require a long high temperature step which would oxidize all of my poly and there would be none remaining. So, my modified process uses an additional masking step (the “gate” mask is typically not found in a self-aligned process) that allows me to use the polysilicon itself as a dopant mask and hard-baked photoresist as the field dielectric. This alternative processing results in the stepped structure you can see in the orange region on the NMOS cross section above. This process subtlety is mentioned here, read this twitter thread.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This process isn’t ideal and I want to make some changes so it’s CMOS compatible but it simplifies fabrication and makes it possible with a minimal set of tools. The 1µm dielectric layer (orange) would ideally be CVD SiO2 (it’s possible to build a TEOS oxide reactor at home) but I used a photoresist instead. Most photoresists can be baked around 250°C to form a hard permanent dielectric layer that is an easy alternative to CVD or PECVD oxide. A spin-on-glass/sol-gel could also be used here. SiO2 etching is done with a buffered HF solution made from rust stain remover or RIE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Huge composite stitched die image:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After exploring Java bytecode in previous years (2022, 2023, 2024), this year we’ll take an unexpected detour for a Java advent: instead of generating Java bytecode, we’ll use Java to build and execute LLVM IR, the intermediate language behind compilers like clang.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using Java’s Foreign Function &amp;amp; Memory (FFM) API, we’ll call the LLVM C API, generate a “Hello, World!” program, and even JIT-compile it to native code – all from Java.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The task is simple: create a program that simply prints “Hello, World!”. But we must do this from Java via LLVM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is LLVM?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LLVM Project, a collection of modular compiler and toolchain technologies, began as a research project over 20 years ago at the University of Illinois. It has grown significantly, underpinning many compilers and tools like clang.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core libraries provide a source &amp;amp; target independent optimizer along with code generation for a multitude of target machines. They are built around the LLVM IR, an intermediate representation, which we’ll generate &amp;amp; execute from Java.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Installing LLVM&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use the LLVM C API from Java, we’ll need LLVM’s shared libraries and headers installed locally. There is an automatic installation script available to easily install LLVM on Ubuntu/Debian systems, for example to install LLVM 20:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
$ chmod +x llvm.sh
$ ./llvm.sh 20
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once we have LLVM installed we can use the LLVM tooling to execute textual-form LLVM IR and we’ll also be able to use the LLVM C API in Java via the FFM API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;LLVM IR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLVM IR is a strongly-typed, SSA-based intermediate language. It abstracts away most machine-specific details, making it easier to represent high-level constructs in a compiler-friendly format. There are three equivalent representations of the IR: an in-memory format, a bitcode format for serialisation and a human readable assembly language representation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The textual form of the LLVM IR for our “Hello, World!” looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
@str = private constant [14 x i8] c"Hello, World!\00"

declare i32 @puts(ptr)

define i32 @main() {
  call i32 @puts(ptr @str)
  ret i32 0
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually, we’ll generate this via Java but, for now, if you save this in a file called helloworld.ll you can try executing it with the LLVM interpreter, lli:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ lli helloworld.ll
Hello, World!
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are a few types of entities used in the helloworld.ll example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A global variable containing the string “Hello World!”&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A declaration of the external libc puts function&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A definition of the main function&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Instructions to call puts and return an integer exit code&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can dive deeper into the LLVM “Hello, World!” example here if you like before continuing to the next section, where we’ll start using the Java FFM API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What is the Java FFM API?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Foreign Function and Memory (FFM) API enables Java programs to interoperate with code and data outside the Java runtime. The API is a replacement for the older JNI API that enables Java programs to call native libraries in a safer way. The API can be used to call foreign functions and safely access foreign memory that is not managed by the JVM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A companion to the FFM API is a tool named jextract that can automatically generate Java bindings from a C header file. &lt;code&gt;jextract&lt;/code&gt; parses C header files and automatically generates the Java source code with method handles and type-safe FFM bindings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll use the &lt;code&gt;jextract&lt;/code&gt; tool to generate bindings for the LLVM C API and those bindings will allow us to call the LLVM API from Java.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Getting started&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, let’s create a simple project to start. We’ll use maven to build our project but you can use another build tool if you like, it’s not important:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=jvm-llvm-helloworld -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have a project skeleton, update the pom.xml file to set the Java version &amp;gt;= 22:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
 &amp;lt;properties&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;maven.compiler.source&amp;gt;25&amp;lt;/maven.compiler.source&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;maven.compiler.target&amp;gt;25&amp;lt;/maven.compiler.target&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/properties&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then build and run the program to check everything is OK:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ mvn clean install
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App
Hello World!
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The maven generated sample already printed “Hello, World!” but that’s too easy! We’ll remove that and generate it via LLVM in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s now create the LLVM bindings using &lt;code&gt;jextract&lt;/code&gt; so that we can use the LLVM API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Creating LLVM bindings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll use jextract to generate bindings from the LLVM C API header files. Make sure LLVM is available on your system (see Installing LLVM above) and you’ll also need to download jextract.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following jextract command (on Linux) will create Java bindings for the specified LLVM C headers, placing the generated code into the &lt;code&gt;com.example.llvm&lt;/code&gt; package within the &lt;code&gt;src/main/java&lt;/code&gt; directory, with the main header class named &lt;code&gt;LLVM&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ jextract -l LLVM-20 -I /usr/include/llvm-c-20 \
     -I /usr/include/llvm-20 \
     -t com.example.llvm \
     --output src/main/java \
     --header-class-name LLVM \
     /usr/include/llvm-c-20/llvm-c/Core.h \
     /usr/include/llvm-c-20/llvm-c/Support.h \
     /usr/include/llvm-c-20/llvm-c/ExecutionEngine.h \
     /usr/include/llvm-c-20/llvm-c/Target.h \
     /usr/include/llvm-c-20/llvm-c/TargetMachine.h
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test the generated bindings, let’s print the LLVM version using the static method generated for LLVM version string constant: edit the sample’s App.java file to print the version using the following:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you run this, you’ll see the LLVM version printed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED com.example.App
LLVM version: 20.0.0
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note the use of &lt;code&gt;--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED&lt;/code&gt; to prevent warnings about native code access; I’ll omit this for brevity in later commands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Memory Segments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;LLVM_VERSION_STRING&lt;/code&gt; method returns a MemorySegment rather than a Java String. In the FFM API, a &lt;code&gt;MemorySegment&lt;/code&gt; represents a contiguous region of memory—either on or off the Java heap—enabling safe, structured access to native memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the implementation in the generated source file:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
   public static MemorySegment LLVM_VERSION_STRING() {
    class Holder {
      static final MemorySegment LLVM_VERSION_STRING
         = LLVM.LIBRARY_ARENA.allocateFrom("20.0.0");
    }
    return Holder.LLVM_VERSION_STRING;
  }
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This method allocates memory containing the version string that contains the version number. The allocated MemorySegment is returned from the method and to get the String back into Java-land we need to call &lt;code&gt;getString(0)&lt;/code&gt; on the memory segment which reads a null-terminated string at the given offset (&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;), using the UTF-8 charset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Memory segments are managed through arenas (such as the &lt;code&gt;LLVM.LIBRARY_ARENA&lt;/code&gt; in the code above), which bridge Java’s managed heap and foreign memory spaces by applying familiar resource management patterns like try-with-resources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since we’ll need to allocate native memory, let’s declare an Arena:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
 public static void main(String[] args)
 {
    try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
       // TODO
    }
 }
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Creating an LLVM module&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a reminder, we need to recreate the following LLVM IR via the LLVM C API:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
declare i32 @puts(ptr)

@str = constant [14 x i8] c"Hello, World!\00"

define i32 @main() {
  call i32 @puts(ptr @str)
  ret i32 0
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start by creating an LLVM module – the container for all functions and globals – and print it so that we can run it through the LLVM interpreter:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // TODO: Fill in the module
            
  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we execute this now, we’ll see an empty IR module:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App
; ModuleID = 'hello'
source_filename = "hello"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you pass this output through the LLVM interpreter, you’ll see that it tries to execute the module but cannot find the entry point main function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App | lli
Symbols not found: [ main ]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We now have an LLVM module, but it has no executable code – the interpreter rightly complains that main is missing; so let’s add the main function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Adding a main function&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The entry point to our program is the function named main which takes no parameters and returns an integer exit code, where a non-negative integer denotes success. We can add a function to the module using the LLVMAddFunction function, along with the LLVMFunctionType and LLVMInt32Type functions to create the function type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that all of these functions return a &lt;code&gt;MemorySegment&lt;/code&gt; and all 3 &lt;code&gt;LLVMAddFunction&lt;/code&gt; parameters are &lt;code&gt;MemorySegment&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

    // TODO: Add the code

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you execute this now you’ll see a declaration of the main function but it has no body so the LLVM interpreter will produce the same error:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App
; ModuleID = 'hello'
source_filename = "hello"

declare i32 @main()

$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App|lli
Symbols not found: [ main ]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next we’ll add some instructions to the body of the function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Adding an entry basic block&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to add code to a function we need to add at least 1 basic block – the entry block. A basic block is a sequence of instructions within a function that executes straight through from start to finish, with no branches in the middle. These blocks form the nodes of the Control-Flow Graph (CFG), and they connect to each other based on how control flows between them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Basic blocks can be added to a function with the LLVMAppendBasicBlock function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 
	  // TODO: Add the instructions

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you run the program through &lt;code&gt;lli&lt;/code&gt; now, you’ll see a different error:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App | lli
lli: &amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;:6:1: error: expected instruction opcode
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That makes sense, we don’t yet have any instructions in our function!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building instructions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To add instructions, we first create an instruction builder using the LLVMCreateBuilder function. This gives us an LLVMBuilder that we can use to insert new instructions into a basic block.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll also use the LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd function to position the builder at the end of the entry block and LLVMBuildRet to build a return instruction:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

    // TODO: Call puts “Hello, World!”

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you run the program and pass the output through &lt;code&gt;lli&lt;/code&gt; now, you’ll see nothing happen:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App | lli
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great news – the errors are gone! Checking the return code confirms the program exited successfully, returning 0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ echo $?
0
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try changing the 0 to some other number to confirm that the value is indeed coming from the exit code returned by the LLVM IR program!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Global variables&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A global variable, defined at the top-level in LLVM IR, defines a region of memory with a fixed address that is allocated when the program is loaded, rather than dynamically at runtime. Globals can be declared as constant if their values will never change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll add the string “Hello, World!” to our LLVM program as a global constant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // TODO: Call puts “Hello, World!”

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We don’t use the &lt;code&gt;hello_str&lt;/code&gt; yet so running &lt;code&gt;lli&lt;/code&gt; would produce the same as before, but you can see the string is now declared in the LLVM IR (prefixed with @ because it is a global, like the main function):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App 
; ModuleID = 'hello'
source_filename = "hello"

@hello_str = private unnamed_addr constant [14 x i8] c"Hello, World!\00", align 1

define i32 @main() {
entry:
  ret i32 0
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let’s add the final instruction next – a call to &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; to print the string.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Calling functions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we can call the libc puts function we must declare it in the module by first building the function type and then calling &lt;code&gt;LLVMAddFunction&lt;/code&gt; to add it to the module:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // Create puts function type: int puts(char*)
    var putsParamTypes = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    var charPtrType = LLVMPointerType(LLVMInt8Type(), 0);
    putsParamTypes.set(ADDRESS, 0, charPtrType);
    var putsType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, putsParamTypes, 1, 0);
    // Add puts function to the module
    var putsFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, arena.allocateFrom("puts"), putsType);

    // TODO: Call puts “Hello, World!”

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    try {
      System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve declared the function we can call it with the &lt;code&gt;@hello_str&lt;/code&gt; global as a parameter using the LLVMBuildCall2 function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));

    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // Create puts function type: int puts(char*)
    var putsParamTypes = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    var charPtrType = LLVMPointerType(LLVMInt8Type(), 0);
    putsParamTypes.set(ADDRESS, 0, charPtrType);
    var putsType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, putsParamTypes, 1, 0);
    // Add puts function to the module
    var putsFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, arena.allocateFrom("puts"), putsType);

    // Create puts function call
    var callArgs = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    callArgs.set(ADDRESS, 0, helloStr);
    LLVMBuildCall2(builder, putsType, putsFunc, callArgs, 1, arena.allocateFrom("puts"));

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

  	var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);

    }

     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running the program’s output through &lt;code&gt;lli&lt;/code&gt; will finally display the expected result: “Hello, World!”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App | lli
Hello, World!
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you’ve successfully used the Java FFM API to call the LLVM C API to build an LLVM module that contains code to print “Hello, World!”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Just-in-time (JIT) Compilation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far, we’ve been printing LLVM IR and letting &lt;code&gt;lli&lt;/code&gt; execute it. But LLVM also exposes a JIT compiler API, allowing us to generate and execute machine code in-memory. Let’s see how to JIT our “Hello, World!” directly from Java.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LLVM IR is target independent but once we start compiling to native code we must know which machine we are targeting. We’ll target x86 Linux in the following code; if you’re using ARM, Mac or Windows you’ll need to adjust the code for your machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first step is to initialise and create an LLVM JIT compiler for the target machine:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // Create puts function type: int puts(char*)
    var putsParamTypes = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    var charPtrType = LLVMPointerType(LLVMInt8Type(), 0);
    putsParamTypes.set(ADDRESS, 0, charPtrType);
    var putsType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, putsParamTypes, 1, 0);
    // Add puts function to the module
    var putsFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, arena.allocateFrom("puts"), putsType);

    // Create puts function call
    var callArgs = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    callArgs.set(ADDRESS, 0, helloStr);
    LLVMBuildCall2(builder, putsType, putsFunc, callArgs, 1, arena.allocateFrom("puts"));

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

    // Initialize LLVM JIT + x86 Target
    LLVMLinkInMCJIT();
    LLVMInitializeX86Target();
    LLVMInitializeX86TargetInfo();
    LLVMInitializeX86TargetMC();
    LLVMInitializeX86AsmPrinter();
    LLVMInitializeX86AsmParser();

    // Create JIT execution engine
    var jitCompiler = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    var jitErrorMsgPtrPtr = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    LLVMCreateJITCompilerForModule(jitCompiler, module, /* optimization level = */ 2, jitErrorMsgPtrPtr);

    // Disable the IR printing now
  	// var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);
    //
    // try {
    //  System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    // } catch (Exception e) {
    //   System.err.println("Failed to write LLVM IR: failed to get error message: " + e.getMessage());
    // }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     // LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LLVMCreateJITCompilerForModule&lt;/code&gt; sets up a JIT execution engine to compile an LLVM module to native machine code. &lt;code&gt;LLVMCreateJITCompilerForModule&lt;/code&gt; will return a 1 upon failure and then we can check the error message string for more information but to simplify things we’ll ignore error handling for now. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Requesting the address of the main function triggers its compilation – LLVM generates the machine code only when it’s first needed, hence the name Just-In-Time compilation. We can retrieve a pointer to the compiled function using &lt;code&gt;LLVMGetPointerToGlobal&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);

    LLVMBuildCall2(builder, putsType, putsFunc, callArgs, 1, arena.allocateFrom("puts"));

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

    var executionEngine = jitCompiler.get(ADDRESS, 0);
    var addressOfMainFunc = LLVMGetPointerToGlobal(executionEngine, mainFunc);

    // Disable the IR printing now
  	// var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);
    //

     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve compiled the function, we need a way to invoke it from Java. To do this, we use the foreign linker to create a &lt;code&gt;MethodHandle&lt;/code&gt; for the JIT-compiled main function. This handle acts as a callable reference to the native code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
{
  try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var module = LLVMModuleCreateWithName(arena.allocateFrom("hello"));
          
    // Create main function signature: int main()
    var int32Type = LLVMInt32Type();
    var mainType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, NULL, 0, 0);
    var mainName = arena.allocateFrom("main");
    var mainFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, mainName, mainType);

	  var entry = LLVMAppendBasicBlock(mainFunc, arena.allocateFrom("entry"));
 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"
    var helloStr = 
           LLVMBuildGlobalStringPtr(builder,
                arena.allocateFrom("Hello, World!"),
                arena.allocateFrom("hello_str"));

    // Create puts function type: int puts(char*)
    var putsParamTypes = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    var charPtrType = LLVMPointerType(LLVMInt8Type(), 0);
    putsParamTypes.set(ADDRESS, 0, charPtrType);
    var putsType = LLVMFunctionType(int32Type, putsParamTypes, 1, 0);
    // Add puts function to the module
    var putsFunc = LLVMAddFunction(module, arena.allocateFrom("puts"), putsType);

    // Create puts function call
    var callArgs = arena.allocate(ADDRESS, 1);
    callArgs.set(ADDRESS, 0, helloStr);
    LLVMBuildCall2(builder, putsType, putsFunc, callArgs, 1, arena.allocateFrom("puts"));

	  // Return 0
    LLVMBuildRet(builder, LLVMConstInt(int32Type, 0, 0));

    // Initialize LLVM JIT + x86 Target
    LLVMLinkInMCJIT();
    LLVMInitializeX86Target();
    LLVMInitializeX86TargetInfo();
    LLVMInitializeX86TargetMC();
    LLVMInitializeX86AsmPrinter();
    LLVMInitializeX86AsmParser();

    // Create JIT execution engine
    var jitCompiler = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    var jitErrorMsgPtrPtr = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    LLVMCreateJITCompilerForModule(jitCompiler, module, /* optimization level = */ 2, jitErrorMsgPtrPtr);

    var executionEngine = jitCompiler.get(ADDRESS, 0);
    var addressOfMainFunc = LLVMGetPointerToGlobal(executionEngine, mainFunc);

    // Create method handle to the int main() function that
    // we just created and compiled.
    var functionHandle = Linker.nativeLinker().downcallHandle(
        addressOfMainFunc,
        FunctionDescriptor.of(/* returnType = */ JAVA_INT)
    );

    // Disable the IR printing now
  	// var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);
    //
    // try {
    //  System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    // } catch (Exception e) {

     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;downcallHandle&lt;/code&gt; method tells Java how to interpret the native function’s signature – in this case, a function that takes no arguments and returns an int.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we can invoke the compiled native function directly from Java, just like a regular method call:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
public static void main(String[] args)
{

 	  var builder = LLVMCreateBuilder();
    LLVMPositionBuilderAtEnd(builder, entry);

	  // Create a global string constant containing "Hello, World!"

    LLVMBuildCall2(builder, putsType, putsFunc, callArgs, 1, arena.allocateFrom("puts"));

	  // Return 0

    var jitCompiler = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    var jitErrorMsgPtrPtr = arena.allocate(ADDRESS);
    LLVMCreateJITCompilerForModule(jitCompiler, module, /* optimization level = */ 2, jitErrorMsgPtrPtr);

    var executionEngine = jitCompiler.get(ADDRESS, 0);
    var addressOfMainFunc = LLVMGetPointerToGlobal(executionEngine, mainFunc);

    // Create method handle to the int main() function that
    // we just created and compiled.
    var functionHandle = Linker.nativeLinker().downcallHandle(
        addressOfMainFunc,
        FunctionDescriptor.of(/* returnType = */ JAVA_INT)
    );

    // Execute the main function via the method handle.
    try {
      int result = (int) functionHandle.invoke();
      System.out.println("main() returned: " + result);
    } catch (Throwable e) {
      System.err.println("Error calling JIT function: " + e.getMessage());
    }

    // Disable the IR printing now
  	// var llvmIrCharPtr = LLVMPrintModuleToString(module);
    //
    // try {
    //  System.out.println(llvmIrCharPtr.getString(0));
    // } catch (Exception e) {

    // }

	   // Clean up LLVM resources
     // LLVMDisposeMessage(llvmIrCharPtr);
     LLVMDisposeBuilder(builder);
     LLVMDisposeModule(module);
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When &lt;code&gt;functionHandle.invoke()&lt;/code&gt; runs, Java crosses into the native world and calls the machine code that was just compiled by the LLVM JIT compiler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that’s it, you can now run the Java application without the LLVM interpreter and see the resulting “Hello, World!”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
$ java -cp target/jvm-llvm-helloworld-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App 
Hello, World!
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you’ve now JIT-compiled Hello World, with the help of Java’s FFM API calling LLVM’s C API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Next steps&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this Java advent we built and executed native machine code from pure Java and a little help from LLVM – no JNI, no C glue, just memory segments, method handles, and a modern FFI. By the end, we had just a simple program that prints “Hello, World!” but it shows the potential of the Java FFM API and the things you can do when Java and native code work together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now see what else you can do, for example, try generating other instructions: print more text, do simple calculations, or even build tiny programs entirely in LLVM from Java.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The full code for this post is available on GitHub over here.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Titans + MIRAS: Helping AI have long-term memory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;December 4, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ali Behrouz, Student Researcher, Meisam Razaviyayn, Staff Researcher, and Vahab Mirrokni, VP and Google Fellow, Google Research&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We introduce the Titans architecture and the MIRAS framework, which allow AI models to work much faster and handle massive contexts by updating their core memory while it's actively running.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Quick links&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Transformer architecture revolutionized sequence modeling with its introduction of attention, a mechanism by which models look back at earlier inputs to prioritize relevant input data. However, computational cost increases drastically with sequence length, which limits the ability to scale Transformer-based models to extremely long contexts, such as those required for full-document understanding or genomic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The research community explored various approaches for solutions, such as efficient linear recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and state space models (SSMs) like Mamba-2. These models offer fast, linear scaling by compressing context into a fixed-size. However, this fixed-size compression cannot adequately capture the rich information in very long sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In two new papers, Titans and MIRAS, we introduce an architecture and theoretical blueprint that combine the speed of RNNs with the accuracy of transformers. Titans is the specific architecture (the tool), and MIRAS is the theoretical framework (the blueprint) for generalizing these approaches. Together, they advance the concept of test-time memorization, the ability of an AI model to maintain long-term memory by incorporating more powerful “surprise” metrics (i.e., unexpected pieces of information) while the model is running and without dedicated offline retraining.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MIRAS framework, as demonstrated by Titans, introduces a meaningful shift toward real-time adaptation. Instead of compressing information into a static state, this architecture actively learns and updates its own parameters as data streams in. This crucial mechanism enables the model to incorporate new, specific details into its core knowledge instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Titans: Learning new context on the fly&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An effective learning system requires distinct yet interconnected memory modules, mirroring the human brain's separation of short-term and long-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While attention mechanisms excel for precise, short-term memory, Titans introduces a novel neural long-term memory module, that, unlike the fixed-size vector or matrix memory in traditional RNNs, acts as a deep neural network (specifically, a multi-layer perceptron). This memory module provides significantly higher expressive power, allowing the model to summarize large volumes of information without losing important context. The model isn't simply taking notes; it's understanding and synthesizing the entire story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crucially, Titans doesn’t just passively store data. It actively learns how to recognize and retain important relationships and conceptual themes that connect tokens across the entire input. A key aspect of this ability is what we call the “surprise metric”. In human psychology, we know we quickly and easily forget routine, expected events but remember things that break the pattern — unexpected, surprising, or highly emotional events.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the context of Titans, the "surprise metric" is the model detecting a large difference between what it currently remembers and what the new input is telling it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Low surprise: If the new word is "cat" and the model's memory state already expects an animal word, the gradient (surprise) is low. It can safely skip memorizing the word "cat" in its permanent long-term state.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High surprise: If the model's memory state is summarizing a serious financial report, and the new input is a picture of a banana peel (the unexpected event), the gradient (surprise) will be very high. This signals that the new input is important or anomalous, and it must be prioritized for permanent storage in the long-term memory module.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The model uses this internal error signal (the gradient) as a mathematical equivalent of saying, "This is unexpected and important!" This allows the Titans architecture to selectively update its long-term memory only with the most novel and context-breaking information, keeping the overall process fast and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Titans refines this mechanism by incorporating two critical elements:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Momentum: The model considers both "momentary surprise" (the current input) and "past surprise" (the recent context flow). This ensures relevant subsequent information is also captured, even if those tokens are not individually surprising.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Forgetting (weight decay): To manage the finite capacity of the memory when dealing with extremely long sequences, Titans employ an adaptive weight decay mechanism. This acts as a forgetting gate, allowing the model to discard information that is no longer needed.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;MIRAS: A unified view of sequence modeling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every major breakthrough in sequence modeling — from modern transformers to the new, lightning-fast linear RNNs — is essentially the same thing under the hood: a highly complex associative memory module.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accordingly, what makes MIRAS both unique and practical is the way it views AI modeling. Instead of seeing diverse architectures, it sees different methods of solving the same problem: efficiently combining new information with old memories without letting the essential concepts be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MIRAS defines a sequence model through four key design choices:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory architecture: The structure that stores information (e.g., a vector, matrix, or a deep multi-layer perceptron, like in Titans).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Attentional bias: The internal learning objective the model optimizes that determines what it prioritizes.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Retention gate: The memory regularizer. MIRAS reinterprets "forgetting mechanisms" as specific forms of regularization that balance new learning against retaining past knowledge.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory algorithm: The optimization algorithm used to update the memory.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Transcending the mean squared error paradigm&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Virtually all successful existing sequence models rely on mean squared error (MSE) or dot-product similarity for both their bias and retention. This reliance can make models sensitive to outliers and limit their expressive power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MIRAS transcends this limitation by providing a generative framework to explore a more rich design space informed by the literature in optimization and statistics. This allows for the creation of novel architectures with non-Euclidean objectives and regularization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using MIRAS, we created three specific attention-free models:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;YAAD: We designed this MIRAS variant to be less sensitive to major errors or "outliers" (like a single typo in a large document). It uses a gentler math penalty (Huber loss) for mistakes, so it doesn't overreact to one-off issues. This makes the model more robust when the input data is messy or inconsistent.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MONETA: This model explores the use of more complex and strict mathematical penalties (called generalized norms). It investigates whether using these more disciplined rules for both what the model attends to and what it forgets can lead to a more powerful and stable long-term memory system overall.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MEMORA: This model focuses on achieving the best possible memory stability by forcing its memory to act like a strict probability map. By using this constraint, it ensures that every time the memory state is updated, the changes are controlled and balanced. This guarantees a clean, stable process for integrating new information.Virtually all successful existing sequence models rely on mean squared error (MSE) or dot-product similarity for both their bias and retention. This reliance can make models sensitive to outliers and limit their expressive power.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Experiments and results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We rigorously compared Titans along with MIRAS variants (YAAD, MONETA, MEMORA) against leading architectures, including Transformer++, Mamba-2, and Gated DeltaNet. We further validated versatility by testing Titans on genomic modeling (DNA) and time-series forecasting, proving the architecture generalizes effectively beyond text.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across both standard language modeling datasets (C4, WikiText) and zero-shot reasoning tasks (HellaSwag, PIQA), our models consistently demonstrated higher accuracy and perplexity (a measure of how surprised an LLM is when looking at a piece of text).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The power of deep memory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ablation studies clearly show that the depth of the memory architecture is crucial. When comparing long-term memory modules of the same size but different depths, modules with deeper memories consistently achieve lower perplexity in language modeling. Furthermore, they exhibit better scaling properties, maintaining performance as the sequence length increases significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Language modeling and efficiency&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In language modeling and commonsense reasoning tasks, Titans architectures outperform state-of-the-art linear recurrent models (such as Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet) and Transformer++ baselines of comparable sizes. The novel MIRAS variants (MONETA, YAAD, MEMORA) also achieve improved performance compared to these baselines, validating the benefit of exploring robust, non-MSE optimization mechanisms. Importantly, these models maintain efficient, parallelizable training and fast linear inference speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Extreme long-context recall&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most significant advantage of these new architectures is their ability to handle extremely long contexts. This is highlighted in the BABILong benchmark, a task requiring reasoning across facts distributed in extremely long documents. In this challenging setting, Titans outperforms all baselines, including extremely large models like GPT-4, despite having many fewer parameters. Titans further demonstrates the capability to scale effectively to context window sizes larger than 2 million tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The introduction of Titans and the MIRAS framework marks a significant advancement in sequence modeling. By employing deep neural networks as memory modules that learn to memorize as data is coming in, these approaches overcome the limitations of fixed-size recurrent states. Furthermore, MIRAS provides a powerful theoretical unification, revealing the connection between online optimization, associative memory, and architectural design. By moving beyond the standard Euclidean paradigm, this research opens the door to a new generation of sequence models that combine the efficiency of RNNs with the expressive power needed for the era of long-context AI.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How the Disappearance of Flight 19, a Navy Squadron Lost in 1945, Fueled the Legend of the Bermuda Triangle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Eighty years ago, five planes vanished during a training run off the Florida coast. A patrol plane sent to search for the men went missing, too, giving rise to a host of conspiracy theories&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I don’t know where we are,” a voice on the radio said. “We must have got lost after that last turn.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This message was the first inkling that something was amiss with Flight 19, a routine United States Navy training run off the coast of Florida on December 5, 1945. In the confusing hours that followed, the five torpedo bombers’ radio transmissions grew fainter as their fuel supply dwindled. Soon, the men—a mix of Marines and naval aviators—were no longer able to communicate with land, and two naval patrol bombers were dispatched to search for them. A short time later, one of the rescue planes abruptly dropped off radio contact and disappeared, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In total, six aircraft carrying 27 men (14 from Flight 19 and 13 from the patrol bomber) vanished over the so-called Bermuda Triangle that day. No confirmed trace of them has ever been found. Eighty years later, Flight 19 remains one of aviation’s most notable mysteries—and where answers are elusive, legions of theories have emerged to fill in the blanks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From alien abductions to the lost continent of Atlantis, magnetic anomalies, methane eruptions and time travel, highly improbable explanations for the disappearances of planes and ships lost in the Bermuda Triangle have gripped the public’s imagination. Flight 19 has even appeared in both a Steven Spielberg film and a Scooby-Doo mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet the real postwar tragedy that inspired these fictionalizations is a mystery that denies the imagination a satisfying explanation, supernatural or otherwise. Instead, false assumptions, fleeting communications and a hastily scrambled rescue search left behind clues as to what transpired in the final moments of Flight 19—and exposed a series of decisions that, if they’d unfolded differently, might have brought the men home safely.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A minute-by-minute breakdown of the disappearance of Flight 19&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At 2:10 p.m. on December 5, flight leader Charles Carroll Taylor, a 28-year-old lieutenant known as “C.C.,” took off from Naval Air Station (NAS) Fort Lauderdale. He was accompanied by four other planes. The squadron’s flight plan advised the men to practice bombing on a small grouping of rocks near the Bahamian island of Bimini, a distance of 56 miles, then fly up over the northern islands of the Bahamas before turning back east to Fort Lauderdale—a routine navigation exercise intended to last around 2 hours and 40 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Robert F. Cox, the pilot of an unrelated flight coming out of the same air station, picked up that first concerning transmission shortly before 3:45 p.m., according to declassified records digitized by the National Archives. In a later interview with investigators, Cox recounted establishing contact with Taylor, who informed him that “both my compasses are out. … I am over land, but it’s broken. I’m sure I’m in the [Florida] Keys, but I don’t know how far down, and I don’t know how to get to Fort Lauderdale.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cox, who didn’t yet realize that Flight 19 couldn’t have made it as far south as the Keys, advised Taylor to fly north, with the setting sun visible to the west on his left wing. He also offered to fly toward the lost pilot’s location to pick the men up. Taylor waved Cox off, reassuring his fellow lieutenant that he now knew where he was. “Don’t come after me,” Taylor said—a statement that would later assume mythical significance in the supernatural theories that proliferated after Flight 19 vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Cox noticed something strange: The squadron’s transmissions were growing weaker. He realized that Taylor’s formation couldn’t be flying north from the Keys, which would have brought the group closer to his own position off Fort Lauderdale, on Florida’s east coast. Instead, the five Grumman TBF Avengers seemed to be straying farther from the coastline, toward the Bahamas and the vast expanse of the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A flurry of confused communications ensued among ground units and those trying to advise Flight 19. Around 4:25 p.m., Taylor asked if anyone in the area had a radar screen that could pick up the group’s location in real time, but no such technology was readily available. An air-sea task unit based in Port Everglades, a seaport in Fort Lauderdale, alerted pilots and potential rescuers along the Florida coast of the squadron’s situation, simultaneously asking about available navigation equipment and requesting that Taylor switch to a less-trafficked emergency radio frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sheer volume of radio communications makes it difficult to know how much of the back and forth actually got through to Flight 19, but subsequent accident reports highlighted efforts to advise Taylor and his men to fly west, “into the sun.” “If these directions had been heard and carried out,” investigators later concluded, “we are certain this flight would have returned to base safely.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around 4:45 p.m., Taylor relayed that the group planned to “fly north to make sure we are not over the Gulf of Mexico,” off Florida’s west coast. Half an hour later, he seemed to concur with outside observers’ advice, stating that the men would fly west “until we hit the beach or run out of gas.” Taylor reminded the other Avengers to remain in formation and, if gas got low, to ditch together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At 6:04 p.m., Taylor made a crucial decision—one that likely doomed Flight 19. He concluded that they “didn’t go far enough east—turn around again—we may just as well turn around and go east again.” As lights were being lit at air stations and on ships up and down the Florida coast in hopes of guiding the men home, they were unknowingly flying in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When ground units were finally able to calculate a navigational fix (an estimate of the squadron’s coordinates) around 6 p.m., it was estimated to be within 100 miles of 29 degrees north latitude, 79 degrees west longitude—well north of the Bahamas and roughly east of Daytona Beach, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In retrospect, it is an agonizing irony that by this point, rescue units could no longer reach Flight 19 directly, but they could still hear garbled transmissions between the five planes. The last known message came from Ensign Joseph Bossi, one of the planes’ pilots, who tried to reach Taylor at 7:04 p.m. No response was heard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What happened to Flight 19?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Exactly what happened next remains a mystery. Did the men stay together, run out of fuel and successfully ditch their planes? If so, how long did they survive in the water? Taylor had been involved in three previous ditches, and the Avengers were almost certainly equipped with life rafts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Navy’s Board of Investigation later concluded “that the state of the sea in the area in which Flight 19 was presumed to have landed was rough and unfavorable for a water landing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most likely outcome is that the men “ran out of gas and went into the ocean,” says John Bloom, director of the Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale Museum, which hosts an annual memorial ceremony on the anniversary of the disappearance. But any certainty of what transpired after all communications ended was lost along with the men who died on Flight 19.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those killed included five pilots and nine crew members and trainees, some of them still teenagers, yet also veterans of World War II, which had ended just three months earlier. Taylor had more than 2,500 hours of flying experience, 61 of them in combat operations. Edward Joseph Powers Jr., a 26-year-old Marine captain, left behind a wife and child.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tragedy of losing these 14 men was soon compounded after a fellow Navy pilot, Lieutenant Walter G. Jeffrey, volunteered to fly one of two Martin PBM-5 Mariners that departed from NAS Banana River, around 150 miles north of the Fort Lauderdale station, at 7:27 p.m., in the direction of the Avengers’ last presumed location.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within half an hour, the Mariner suddenly fell off radio contact. Later that night, a ship in the vicinity reported seeing a “burst of flames” estimated to be 100 feet tall around 7:50 p.m. By the time searchers reached the site, no trace of the Mariner or its 13-man crew could be found. (Mariners were sometimes dubbed “flying gas tanks” due to their high fuel capacity and propensity to experience onboard fires.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With yet another plane missing, the search took on an additional layer of complexity. It lasted five days, with more than 200 planes scouring the Atlantic each day in hopes of finding the 27 men. Sightings of flares and flashes, of life jackets and rafts, fueled hope, even if they turned out to be imagined or unrelated debris. The cycle of hope and disappointment made headlines: On December 9, for example, the United Press news agency reported the discovery of six rafts, but officials soon retracted the sighting as a mistake. The Associated Press deemed the rescue mission “the most extensive search ever undertaken along the Atlantic Seaboard.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A mother’s fight to clear her son’s name&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Taylor’s mother, Katherine Taylor, received a telegram informing her that her son was missing, she was at the front of her classroom in Corpus Christi, the Texas city where she’d raised him. She was so devastated by the news that she walked out, never to return.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the central questions asked by both Katherine and the Navy was how Taylor, a seasoned pilot with extensive flying experience, could become so disoriented that he believed he was over the Keys. Within days, the Navy convened an investigation board, which focused on the testimony of those involved in the search along the coast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investigators’ initial report, issued internally in January 1946, acknowledged that elements of the search protocol could have been improved, including coordination between units and rescuers’ ability to get a bearing on the flights. But it heavily weighted Taylor’s disorientation, noting that he wasn’t sure where the Florida peninsula was at the time, and that “this uncertainty influenced his later decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bloom points out that the area was unfamiliar terrain for Taylor, who had transferred up from Miami the previous month. This may explain the pilot’s belief that he was over the Keys instead of the Bahamas. The squadron “never said another word about their compass not working,” Bloom says. “But then they did fly north thinking they’d see the peninsula, and when they didn’t, they thought they were out over the Gulf, so [Taylor] flies east.” What would have been obvious to aviators who had been based at the air station longer—that it would have been impossible for the group to be over the Keys so soon after taking off—seemed to be less apparent to the members of Flight 19 in their duress and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Navy was less magnanimous in its assessment of Taylor. “The leader of the flight became so hopelessly confused as to have suffered something akin to a mental aberration,” the chief of naval air training wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That conclusion did not sit well with Katherine. She believed there were holes in the Navy’s official version, which relied heavily on rescuers’ testimony in the absence of physical evidence and the aviators’ own accounts. As Katherine wrote in a letter to the mother of Walter Reed Parpart Jr., the 18-year-old radioman with Taylor on his plane, she didn’t believe the planes had been properly instructed to come west, or that their approximate location was ascertained and communicated to searchers in a timely fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It just can’t be possible that so many could disappear without a trace,” Katherine told a reporter in March 1946, after taking a trip to Florida to interview those involved in the rescue effort. “I shall never give up until I find out why!” She proved to be a tenacious advocate for this viewpoint, and officials concluded that she could not be swayed. “It is believed that Mrs. Taylor is emotionally unstable as a result of this disaster,” the Navy noted in its report.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of Katherine’s key contentions centered around the ready plane, a standby aircraft that could have been sent up quickly from NAS Fort Lauderdale. In his testimony, Cox—the pilot who’d first realized Flight 19 was lost—testified that he’d returned to the station and asked Lieutenant Commander Donald J. Poole, the officer in charge of training flights there, if he could take the ready plane and fly northeast to the squadron’s likely position. Cox recalled that Poole “very definitely said no, that he didn’t think there was any use in sending it out then.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In his own testimony, Poole outlined several reasons for his response, including waiting on the fix and fear that sending an additional plane would “complicate” communications from the ground. None of these explanations was particularly convincing to Katherine, nor to Cox himself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“My dad felt extremely strongly that he could locate the flight if he were allowed to go back up, and he was very frustrated that he wasn’t allowed to,” Cox’s daughter, Colby Cox, said in a 2021 History Channel documentary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bloom, for his part, says, “They should have been proactively doing something. … The plane was up and ready.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Poole’s testimony provides some insight into the prevailing mindset about the situation’s severity. “I was still confident and certain that they would hit the coast before their gas supply ran out,” he told investigators. Lieutenant Commander Charles Kenyon, operations officer at NAS Fort Lauderdale, similarly testified that he “figured they were temporarily confused and … they would come back right on time.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1947, after tireless lobbying by Katherine, the Navy modified its findings away from the initial focus on Taylor. A corrections review board concluded “that the flight disappeared for reasons or causes unknown.” This would stand as the official word on Flight 19 in the decades that followed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the Navy closed the book on the case, a plethora of conspiracy theories emerged to fill the information void.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Flight 19 conspiracy theories and the Bermuda Triangle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 1950, the Associated Press published an article on plane and ship disappearances off the U.S.’s southeastern coast, including Flight 19, which it erroneously suggested had disappeared under complete radio silence. “It is the same big world the ancients knew into which men and their machines and ships can disappear without a trace,” the AP noted ominously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourteen years later, in 1964, the men’s magazine Argosy published an article by Vincent Gaddis titled “The Deadly Bermuda Triangle.” The piece was the first to popularize this term, which refers to a roughly 500,000- to 1.5-million-square-mile area of the North Atlantic Ocean, stretching from Florida’s east coast to Bermuda to the Greater Antilles. But the area Gaddis described had already developed a fearsome reputation among mariners of centuries past, who navigated a sometimes stormy and hurricane-prone section of the ocean, fueled by the warm currents of the Gulf Stream, without the benefit of accurate weather forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Did you know? The Tempest and the Bermuda Triangle&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Some scholars posit that William Shakespeare based his play The Tempest on accounts of the Sea Venture, an English ship wrecked off Bermuda in 1609.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Others disagree, suggesting the Bard was inspired by a near-shipwreck closer to home, or that he simply drew on his imagination.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the Bermuda Triangle descriptor took hold in the popular imagination, it was applied retroactively to events that had taken place in the same radius, such as the disappearance of the USS Cyclops, a World War I transport ship that vanished in 1918 with its crew of 306 after transmitting a final message: “Weather fair. All well.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Whatever this menace that lurks within a triangle of tragedy so close to home,” Gaddis wrote, “it was responsible for the most incredible mystery in the history of aviation—the lost patrol.” (Despite the staying power of this nickname for Flight 19, the group was a squadron on a training run, not a patrol.) In his best-selling 1974 book, The Bermuda Triangle, Charles Berlitz, a chronicler of paranormal phenomena, deemed the loss of the Avengers and the Mariner “the first occasion in which planes were affected,” building on his long—and largely unreliable—list of ships that had vanished in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that the Mariner disappeared in approximately the same vicinity as Flight 19 fueled theories of supernatural intervention, with outside observers ignoring the fact that a rescue plane would naturally be sent to its target’s presumed location.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Berlitz also cited a request by Taylor to be dismissed from the assignment ahead of time as a “presentiment of disaster.” But those who actually saw Taylor on the day of the training run didn’t notice anything amiss, and the lieutenant never officially escalated his request. Berlitz also falsely relayed Taylor’s message of “don’t come after me” as “don’t come after me … they look like they are from outer space.” That line really clinched the legend of the Bermuda Triangle: “This final mystery, with its suggestion of other-world interference, is echoed in more than a few of the other disappearances,” Berlitz wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bloom, for his part, dismisses such speculation. “I don’t believe in fiction,” he says. “There’s a lot of misstatements about what was said when they were out there.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 1977 Spielberg film Close Encounters of the Third Kind depicted the crew of Flight 19 re-emerging years later, without aging, after being abducted by aliens. Musicians have tackled the legend of the Bermuda Triangle, too: Fleetwood Mac sang of “all of these ships and planes, a great big mystery that cannot be explained,” while Barry Manilow mused on a place that “makes people disappear.” Numerous television dramas and documentaries have sustained this block of ocean’s notoriety well into contemporary times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s view, “There is no evidence that mysterious disappearances occur with any greater frequency in the Bermuda Triangle than in any other large, well-traveled area of the ocean.” The myth is fueled by fanciful interpretations of the many unknowns of such disappearances, which can often be attributed to environmental factors like tropical storms and hurricanes, sudden changes in weather, and shallow waters in the Caribbean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real—and perhaps most unsolvable—mysteries of Flight 19 are what Taylor experienced that day that led him off course in the first place, and what happened after the last radio call from Bossi to Taylor at 7:04 p.m. Though the emergence of conspiracy theories has obscured this, many aviation and naval tragedies have resulted from a confluence of banal mishaps and missed opportunities. What might have happened if the ready plane flew sooner? Or if the location fix had come in earlier and been heard by Flight 19?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For all the fabrications and exaggerations that Gaddis detailed in his 1964 magazine article, one statement rings all too true today: “The sea guards well her secrets.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Programs running in windowing environments, applications as we used to know them, have more complicated requirements than those run from a command line. Rather than embed all the resources they require for windows, menus and the rest in a single file, Mac OS broke new ground by putting those into resources stored in the app’s resource fork.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is QuarkXPress version 4.11 from around 2000, with its resources displayed in the resource editor ResEdit. Executable code was also stored in CODE resources, and every file contained type and creator information to support the illusions created by the Finder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Mac OS X was designed, it switched to the bundle structure inherited from NeXTSTEP. Instead of this multitude of resources, apps consisted of a hierarchy of directories containing files of executable code, and those with what had in Mac OS been supporting resources. Those app bundles came to adopt a standard form, shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bundle name has the extension .app, and contains a single directory Contents. Within that, the executable code is in the MacOS directory, which may contain both the main executable for the GUI app and any bundled command tools provided. Another directory contains Resources, including the app’s custom icon, and components of its GUI. In some apps, there’s another directory of Frameworks containing dylibs (libraries).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are also two important files, Info.plist and PkgInfo. The latter contains the same type and creator information inherited from Classic Mac OS, and apparently isn’t mandatory although it appears universal. The information property list is essential, as it specifies the names of the executable and its icon file in Resources, the minimum version of macOS required, type declarations of the app’s documents, version numbers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When running a command tool in macOS, its Mach-O executable is launched by &lt;code&gt;launchd&lt;/code&gt;, whose purpose is to run code. Launching an app is more demanding, although the app’s executable is still launched by &lt;code&gt;launchd&lt;/code&gt;. Before that can happen, macOS starts the launch process using LaunchServices and RunningBoard, which rely on information obtained from Info.plist and other components in the app bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;macOS&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This structure remained stable until the introduction of code signatures in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard in 2007. Accommodating those added a directory named _CodeSignature containing the signature in a CodeResources file. That includes code directory hashes (CDHashes) to check the integrity of the contents of the app bundle. Apps distributed by the App Store include a store receipt in another directory, _MASReceipt. Since 2018, when Apple introduced notarization, the ‘ticket’ issued by Apple can be ‘stapled’ into the app bundle as the file CodeResources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many apps come with additional items that might in the past have been installed by them in their Library/Application Support folders and elsewhere, but are now included in the app bundle. These can include the following directories:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Library, containing folders of LaunchDaemons and LoginItems that would previously have been installed in either the main Library folder, or that in the user’s Home folder;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;XPCServices, for executable code that the app uses to provide specific services;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Plugins, for some types of app extension (Appex);&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Extensions, for other types of app extension, including app intents.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may also come across other components, including a version.plist in Apple’s apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This centralisation of components in the app bundle has brought several benefits. Being self-contained, apps are easier to install and update, and cleaner to remove. Their components are less likely to go missing, and most of all they’re held within the protection of the app’s signature and notarisation, an important improvement in security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assembling these into a diagram shows how the anatomy of an app has grown over the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Components shown in pale yellow are either mandatory or essentially universal. Those shown in green are found in apps distributed through the App Store, while that shown in blue is the stapled notarisation ticket (optional). You will also see additional folders and components such as Automator workflows, scripts, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no difference in structure between apps built for current Intel and Arm architectures. That’s because binaries in the MacOS folder (and executable code in other directories like Frameworks, XPCServices and Plugins) contain platform-specific code in a single Mach-O executable. Thus, an app that’s Universal and runs native on both architectures includes code for both in its single ‘fat’ code file, and they even have separate signatures stored within common files.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Goodbye, Microsoft: Schleswig-Holstein relies on Open Source and saves millions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Schleswig-Holstein saves 15 million euros in license costs by migrating from Microsoft to free software. The conversion is significantly cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The state administration of Schleswig-Holstein is making a remarkable U-turn in its IT strategy and consistently relying on open source. After the migration from proprietary Microsoft software to free solutions was initially accompanied by problems and criticism, Digitalization Minister Dirk Schrödter (CDU) can now report a significant success: According to his ministry, the state will save over 15 million euros in license costs for Windows, Microsoft Office &amp;amp; Co. next year alone. It is expected to be similar in the following years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In contrast, there would be one-time investments of nine million euros in 2026, explained the Ministry of Digitalization to the Kieler Nachrichten. These would have to be made for the conversion of workplaces and the further development of solutions with free software in the next 12 months. Given the annual savings, this sum will pay for itself in less than a year. In the past, the state transferred millions to the US company Microsoft, primarily for the use of office software and other programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The department sees the departure from this "vendor lock-in" – the dependence on a single large provider – as a clear signal for greater independence and sustainable digitalization. The financial incentive now underscores that digital sovereignty can be not only a political buzzword but also an economic gain.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Almost 80 percent of licenses canceled&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The numbers speak for themselves: outside the tax administration, almost 80 percent of workplaces in the state administration have already been switched to the open-source office software LibreOffice. Schrödter thus confirms a course that reduces technical and economic dependence on individual manufacturers. The consequence of the conversion was already evident recently, as Schrödter emphasized in an interview with c't. Regarding the status of Microsoft license cancellations, he said: "We are at almost 80, without the tax administration." For tax matters, the state finance ministers have "given themselves a clear timetable for the switch." Recently, the Christian Democrat also emphasized, according to the Südtiroler Wirtschaftszeitung, that the state has entered a marathon, not just a sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The remaining 20 percent of workplaces are currently still dependent on Microsoft programs such as Word or Excel, as there is a technical dependency on these programs in certain specialized applications. According to Schrödter, however, the successive conversion of these remaining computers is the stated goal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Opposition sees challenges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the savings and the almost completed migration in large parts of the administration, the opposition continues to criticize the quality of the conversion. SPD state parliament member Kianusch Stender pointed out to the Kieler Nachrichten: "It may be that on paper 80 percent of workplaces have been converted. But far fewer than 80 percent of employees can now work with them properly." Errors in the migration are "still present." The initial difficulties in introducing the open-source programs have apparently led to ongoing frustration among some employees in certain areas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Videos by heise&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Green state parliament member Jan Kürschner also admitted in an interview with heise online that such a comprehensive conversion would not go without friction. But he emphasized the long-term nature of the project and the necessity of fundamentally rethinking administrative processes: "With the change, there is an opportunity to truly rethink the administration and free ourselves from old burdens. That is the great added value." If only a one-to-one conversion is made, it might certainly "stumble at one point or another." But those who truly optimize administrative processes will likely find in the end: "Open source is the better way."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The challenge now is to resolve the initial migration problems and acceptance difficulties and to further develop the open-source solutions so that they fully meet the requirements of a modern state administration. The savings achieved give Schleswig-Holstein more financial leeway for this.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a cloudy winter day, a state government inspector named Ryan Coffield walked into a Family Dollar store in Windsor, North Carolina, carrying a scanner gun and a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inside the store, which sits along a three-lane road in a county of peanut growers and poultry workers, Coffield scanned 300 items and recorded their shelf prices. He carried the scanned bar codes to the cashier and watched as item after item rang up at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Red Baron frozen pizzas, listed on the shelf at $5, rang up at $7.65. Bounty paper towels, shelf price $10.99, rang up at $15.50. Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes, Stouffer’s frozen meatloaf, Sprite and Pepsi, ibuprofen, Klondike Minis – shoppers were overpaying for all of them. Pedigree puppy food, listed at $12.25, rang up at $14.75.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All told, 69 of the 300 items came up higher at the register: a 23% error rate that exceeded the state’s limit by more than tenfold. Some of the price tags were months out of date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The January 2023 inspection produced the store’s fourth consecutive failure, and Coffield’s agency, the state department of agriculture &amp;amp; consumer services, had fined Family Dollar after two previous visits. But North Carolina law caps penalties at $5,000 per inspection, offering retailers little incentive to fix the problem. “Sometimes it is cheaper to pay the fines,” said Chad Parker, who runs the agency’s weights-and-measures program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dollar-store industry, including Family Dollar and its larger rival, Dollar General, promises everyday low prices for household essentials. But an investigation by the Guardian found that the prices listed on the shelves at these two chains often don’t materialize at checkout – in North Carolina and around the country. As the cost of living soars across America, the customers bearing the burden are those who can least afford it – customers who often don’t even notice they’re overpaying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These overcharges are widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General stores have failed more than 4,300 government price-accuracy inspections in 23 states since January 2022, a Guardian review found. Family Dollar stores have failed more than 2,100 price inspections in 20 states over the same time span, the review found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among these thousands of failed inspections, some of the biggest flops include a 76% error rate in October 2022 at a Dollar General in Hamilton, Ohio; a 68% error rate in February 2023 at a Family Dollar in Bound Brook, New Jersey; and a 58% error rate three months ago at a Family Dollar in Lorain, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of the stores that failed state or local government checks were repeat violators. A Family Dollar in Provo, Utah, flunked 28 inspections in a row – failures that included a 48% overcharge rate in May 2024 and a 12% overcharge rate in October 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The chains’ pricing disparities are drawing increasing attention. In May, Arizona’s attorney general announced a $600,000 settlement to resolve a consumer-fraud investigation against Family Dollar. In October, Colorado’s attorney general settled with Dollar General for $400,000 after its stores failed 15 out of 23 state inspections. Dollar General has also settled with New Jersey, Vermont and Wisconsin, and both companies have settled with Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Linda Davis, a 64-year-old Family Dollar shopper in Dayton, Ohio, called the state attorney general’s office in February after walking home from the dollar store and discovering that 12 of her 23 purchases had rung up incorrectly. “I’m adding it up in my head as I’m shopping,” she told the Guardian. “But I was way off and I didn’t know why … I thought: where did I miscalculate? I’ve [only] got so much cash on me.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Davis, who lives on social security, said she could shop elsewhere, but that would involve paying for a bus ride. “I don’t have money like that,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both Family Dollar and Dollar General declined interview requests and did not answer detailed lists of questions from the Guardian. Instead, both sent the Guardian brief statements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“At Family Dollar, we take customer trust seriously and are committed to ensuring pricing accuracy across our stores,” the company said. “We are currently reviewing the concerns raised and working to better understand any potential discrepancies. We continue to be focused on providing a consistent and transparent shopping experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General said it was “committed to providing customers with accurate prices on items purchased in our stores, and we are disappointed any time we fail to deliver on this commitment”. In one court case in Ohio, Dollar General’s lawyers argued that “it is virtually impossible for a retailer to match shelf pricing and scanned pricing 100% of the time for all items. Perfection in this regard is neither plausible nor expected under the law.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Guardian’s examination of inspection failures by the two chains was based on record requests to 45 states and more than 140 counties and cities in New York, Ohio and California, along with court documents and public databases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In nearly half of US states, information about whether customers are being overcharged was limited or unavailable. Many states do little or nothing to monitor retail stores’ pricing practices. Some, like Maryland, Idaho and Washington, do no random inspections, responding only to consumer complaints. Illinois, South Carolina and others don’t inspect at all. In 2020, auditors in Kansas revealed that these inspections were a low priority in many states. “Consumers can check price accuracy themselves,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even in states with tougher enforcement, financial penalties don’t always solve the problem: in the 23 months after Dollar General agreed in November 2023 to pay Wisconsin $850,000, its stores failed 31% of their price inspections. During the same period, Wisconsin’s Family Dollar stores failed 30% of their state inspections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to industry watchers, employees and lawsuits, overcharges often stem from labor practices within the dollar-store sector. When a company changes prices, the registers are updated automatically. But the shelf prices are not: someone needs to remove the old labels manually and replace them with new ones. In an industry known for minimal staffing, workers don’t always have time to put up the new shelf tags.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In many instances, customers may not notice that they are being charged more than what’s listed on the shelf. If they notice at the register, they may decide to put those items back – or ask a store employee to honor the shelf price.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General, in its statement, said its store teams “are empowered to correct the matter on the spot”. But customers and current and former employees said that while some dollar stores will correct the price, others refuse to make fixes at the register – and turn away customers who return later and request a refund.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Overcharging even by a small amount per item can strain a really tight budget,” said Elizabeth M Harris, acting director of the New Jersey division of consumer affairs. “If you’ve ever gone into any store … with a child like I have, there’s chaos at the checkout counter and you’re not really paying attention.” With items being rung up quickly, she added, “consumers are trusting that the retailer is actually charging them the price that’s displayed.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Her state settled in 2023 with Dollar General for $1.2m after finding more than 2,000 items rung up as overcharges across 58 stores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if the overcharges paid by dollar-store customers are accidental, they still reflect the industry’s decision not to correct a problem it has known about for years, according to Kennedy Smith, a researcher at the non-profit Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which works to protect communities from negative impacts of big corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If they’re called on it, they’ll say, ‘Oh yeah, our mistake,’” Kennedy said. “Until they’re called on it, they’re happy to let those scanner errors bring in the millions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘The cheap stuff’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When consumers feel economic pain, as they do now thanks to rising costs exacerbated by tariffs, price gouging and other inflationary pressures, one place they turn to are dollar stores. These one-stop centers for inexpensive food, clothing and housewares tend to sell in small quantities, one $1 chicken-noodle-soup can at a time. And they are relatively easy to get to: 75% of Americans live within 5 miles of a Dollar General, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The industry’s largest player is flourishing. Todd Vasos, the CEO of Dollar General, told investors in August that his company’s quarterly sales had increased 5% over the same period last year. Some of that growth, he said, came from middle- and higher-income shoppers tightening their belts. But the company’s low-income “core customers” were spending more at the chain too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those customers have been the industry’s niche from the beginning. When a 48-year-old former tobacco farmer and traveling salesman named James Luther Turner opened JL Turner and Son Wholesale Dry Goods, Shoes, Notions and Hosiery in Scottsville, Kentucky, in 1939, his mission was “to sell the cheap stuff to the poor folks”. (Someone else had cornered the market on “selling the good stuff” to Scottsville’s rich folks.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 1955, Turner and his eldest son, Hurley Calister “Cal” Turner Sr, were overseeing 36 stores in small southern towns. Cal Sr decided that year to co-opt the “Dollar Days” sales at big department stores and to open outlets featuring a single low price of $1. Adopting a name that nodded to the general store, he designed a bold black-and-yellow sign and that June christened the first Dollar General in Springfield, Kentucky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General now operates over 20,000 stores in 48 states – more than any other retailer of any kind in the US. (It has long since abandoned its $1 price limit.) Though it has more than 195,000 employees and net sales of $40.6bn, the company still calls itself “America’s neighborhood general store”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Family Dollar began in 1959 in Charlotte, North Carolina, and now operates 8,000 stores nationwide. For most of the past decade, it was owned by yet another chain, Dollar Tree, but the two brands divorced last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Dollar General and Family Dollar have in common is a conspicuous presence in places that don’t offer a lot of other retail: low-income urban neighborhoods and rural towns like Windsor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A predominantly Black county seat of 3,400 on North Carolina’s coastal plain, Windsor used to be a retail hub. “All the streets were full on a weekend,” recalled Russell Parker, a 66-year-old retired pilot. “There were people everywhere, people playing music.” And people spending money: at the fish market, the cobbler, the independent groceries, the automotive-supply store. But today Windsor’s downtown – like many rural main streets – is pocked with empty storefronts. The town never fully recovered from Hurricane Floyd, in 1999. “Every young person that graduates from high school gets on the first thing smokin’ to somewhere else,” Parker said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One supermarket remains on the edge of town. Shopping for clothes often means driving to the next county, at least for those who drive. But Windsor does have three stores that help fill the gap: a Dollar General and two Family Dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the Family Dollar that failed multiple inspections, some regulars remain vigilant. Chris Outlaw, a 54-year-old hemodialysis technician, shops there because it’s near his house and workplace. Experience has taught him to buy only a few items at once and to examine his receipts. Not all his neighbors do the same. “I’ve seen people in there with baskets full,” he said. “You can just imagine how much of that stuff didn’t ring out right, and they had so much they couldn’t catch it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘Big old savings’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Customers walking into Dollar General stores are often greeted by a bright yellow sign blaring “Hello, Low Prices”– and by as many as 10,000 items cramming shelves and, often, cluttering the aisles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They will send you more than what you need of any product,” said Stephanie, a former lead sales associate in Louisiana. “Your shelf can only hold 10 Glade air fresheners, right? But they will send you 50.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rarely is there enough staffing, current and former employees say, to complete all of the tasks expected of them, including stocking shelves, ringing up sales, looking out for shoplifters, mopping floors – and updating price changes and sales stickers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than two dozen current and former employees of the chain in 15 states interviewed by the Guardian agreed that price discrepancies are the byproduct of the company’s employment policies. (Most, including Stephanie, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of retaliation.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often there are only one or two people on duty. “You’re lucky if you get to work two to four hours of your eight- to 13-hour shift with another human being,” a former assistant manager in Illinois said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every Tuesday, employees are supposed to print and post hundreds of shelf stickers representing price changes already updated in the computer system. On Saturdays, stacks of sales stickers arrive; often, workers are expected to remove all the previous week’s stickers by 5pm and put up new stickers – as many as 1,000 of them – before closing up that night. Stickers fail to get put up, they fall off easily, and they are confusing, with some sales instant and others linked to coupons. “I threw away tags sometimes, to keep me or a co-worker out of trouble,” Stephanie admitted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A former store manager at a Dollar General in Connecticut noted that many of his customers were poor or disabled enough that they got by on public assistance. “I didn’t want people to get screwed over, but I knew that it was happening,” he said. “If I’m in the store, I’m gonna try to do the best I can for them. But at the end of the day, they’re still probably gonna get overcharged for a few things.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General, in its statement, said it schedules time each week for “price change execution”, among other measures to ensure accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ten current and former employees in eight states claimed that – along with allowing pricing errors caused by understaffing and overstocking – some Dollar General stores engage in a tactic designed to fool customers: special sales that don’t actually lower the price of an item. A manager from Florida, for example, sent the Guardian two photos of price stickers for Café Bustelo ground coffee. In the first photo, a sticker said “SALE” in white block letters against a red background. It advertised a markdown from $7.95 to $6.50. In the second photo, the top sticker had been peeled away to show the original price: $6.50.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A sales associate from Illinois sent photos showing cutlery with what he said was a fake original price of $8.50. “It’s trying to say that you’re making this big old savings by buying this item here,” explained the employee, “when it’s actually always been $6.95.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General declined to comment on these workers’ claims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘We have little choice’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the Ohio attorney general, Dave Yost, sued Dollar General in 2022, he submitted 114 pages of customer complaints as part of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of them came from Melanie Hutzler, who lives in Canton without a car and whose mobility is limited by arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Hutzler, 51, relies on government food assistance and said she was cautious about spending money. At the time of her complaint, she could reach two food stores on foot. Getting to the Save A Lot grocery required crossing a busy road, but getting to a Dollar General did not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Every single time we went into that store, something would ring up wrong,” she told the Guardian. “They never had a manager there that would fix the prices.” Hutzler said she would walk the cashier over to the shelf and point out the listed price, only to be told, “There’s nothing we can do about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other Ohioans expressed similar frustrations. “My 87-year-old mother and I have frequented Dollar General for years, and there have been innumerable times we have made purchases that were well higher than advertised,” wrote Robert Hevlin of Dayton. “My mother and I have literally lost thousands over the years with this company, but both of us being on social security, we have little choice in where we shop.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In September 2023, Yost reached a $1m settlement with Dollar General, which he said had error rates at some stores that ran as high as 88%. In February 2024, he announced a $400,000 settlement with Family Dollar to resolve similar allegations. Most of that money went to charitable organizations that distribute food and personal-care items.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both chains agreed in the settlements to tighten their pricing practices. Yost’s office continues to receive complaints. A Dollar General customer in Garfield Heights said in February that he was charged $6.35 for a carton of eggs with a shelf sticker of $5.10, but the “cashier was too busy having a personal call on her cellphone to address the price discrepancy”. The same month, a Family Dollar shopper in Genoa reported being charged $2.65 for cough medicine listed on the shelf at $1.50. “I was told by the cashier that there was nothing that could be done about it,” the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over in Missouri, state officials are pursuing a lawsuit that accuses Dollar General of “deceptive” pricing practices. The suit, filed in 2023, says 92 of the 147 stores the state checked failed their inspections, with discrepancies as high as $6.50 an item.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The companies declined to comment on these state lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General has also been hit with private lawsuits, including several filed by its shareholders. In a document filed in August in federal court in Nashville, lawyers for Dollar General investors argued that understaffing, poor inventory control and overcharging were all interrelated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The investors allege that the company deceived them by portraying itself as financially sound. In truth, the court filing says, “Dollar General’s inventory management processes were broken, which caused a massive bloat of excess product to clog the company at both its distribution centers and stores, and its workforce had been slashed.” These problems gave rise to price discrepancies and other “dire consequences”, the court filing asserts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The filing includes the stories of 36 former employees who claimed direct knowledge that Dollar General managers and executives knew about the problems. Several reported notifying the top leadership directly. “All the prices were off in the stores,” said one of those ex-employees, a manager who monitored inventory levels in Ohio and Pennsylvania. She claimed to know firsthand, based on calls she participated in, that company vice-presidents and regional directors were aware of the “huge” price mismatches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dollar General, in response, said that the testimony of a handful of ex-workers does not prove that it misled investors. In their “years-long search for fraud”, the company’s lawyers claimed, the shareholders “came up empty”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, a federal judge in New Jersey halted a class-action lawsuit against Dollar General filed by a shopper who said he was overcharged for groceries. Dollar General argued that when customers create accounts – for example, by downloading the company’s mobile app – they agree to use arbitration to resolve disputes and forfeit the right to file class-action suits. The judge agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This victory for Dollar General threw up an obstacle for customers seeking justice. “Who’s going to bring a consumer arbitration with a $225 filing fee over a 50-cent overcharge?” asked Marc Dann, a former Ohio attorney general whose law firm filed the New Jersey case. “They’ve essentially closed the door to the courthouse to people.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dann’s firm did reach a settlement with Dollar General in another case this fall, though the details have not been made public.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;‘This endless cycle’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dollar-store chains describe themselves as mission-driven companies. “Our stores are conveniently located in neighborhoods, and often in ‘food deserts’ where other stores choose not to locate,” Family Dollar says on its website. Dollar General takes pride in offering value to families who, according to CEO Vasos, “have had to sacrifice even on the necessities”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The industry’s critics say the cause and effect are reversed. “Dollar stores are often seen as a symptom of economic distress,” said the Institute for Local Self-Reliance’s co-executive director, Stacy Mitchell. “What we found is that they’re, in fact, a cause of it.” Sometimes, she said, a chain dollar store will open near an independent grocer and skim off enough of its business that it is forced to close. That limits the availability of fresh produce and forces shoppers to buy more packaged and processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a statement, Dollar General said its stores often “operate along with local grocers and business owners to collectively meet customers’ needs”. It added that 7,000 of its 20,000 stores sell fresh produce and that the company also partners with local food banks “to further help nourish our neighbors in need”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The people enduring the effects of hollowed-out local economies – and getting hit with overcharges at dollar-store chains – include residents of Essex county, New York. The county, tucked among the stately pines of the Adirondack Mountains, has a population of 37,000. It has five Dollar Generals and two Family Dollars. All seven regularly fail pricing-accuracy tests. The Dollar General in Port Henry, which sits on the shores of Lake Champlain, was fined $103,550 for failed inspections between November 2022 and June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the course of seven inspections, 279 out of 700 tested items were overcharges – a combined error rate of just under 40%. One inspection yielded a 78% error rate, including overcharges on Flintstones vitamins, Peter Pan peanut butter and Prego pasta sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Port Henry store is 5 miles from the Mineville Dollar General, which occupies a lonely stretch of country road across from an auto-repair shop with spare parts littering its lawn. Down the block, an abandoned church presides over a stretch of grass that looks like it hasn’t been mown for years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aside from a whiskey warehousing operation and a health center, opportunities for employment are limited. The high-security prison built atop the iron mine for which Mineville is named closed in 2022, taking 100 jobs with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The local playground is littered with trash, cigarette butts and the occasional syringe. The town “is nice from the outside”, said Katelyn Miller, a 26-year-old Port Henry resident who lives with her mother, six-year-old daughter and two-year-old son. But “you hear about a lot of crack-den places, like blowing up or getting busted.’” Drug use is rampant in the county, which is 92% white. “Everybody around here seems to be on pain meds or buying someone else’s, because they’re also working themselves to death.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it comes to grocery shopping near Miller’s home, the choice is between the two Dollar Generals and a gas station/convenience store. “We live in a food desert,” she said, “even though you would think living in all this farmland, we would have more access.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a Walmart 30 minutes away, in Fort Ticonderoga. Miller said she recently bought salmon there only to arrive home and discover that the $20 piece of fish had gone bad. “So I had to go to Dollar General and get the Stouffer’s,” she said, adding that she feels “caught in this endless cycle of never having food that will nourish me and my family, and instead having to get 2,000 grams of sodium because at least it has meat”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The region’s economic straits put regulators in a bind when it comes to overcharges. Daniel Woods, the county’s director of weights and measures, said in 2023 that he didn’t always assess the full penalty on violators. “We’re not trying to put people out of business,” he told a local newspaper. “In some towns that’s their [only] store. I don’t want to pull that away from people, but at the same time, I’m trying to fix the problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;On the way out&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Coffield, the North Carolina inspector, visited the Windsor Family Dollar in April 2023, the pricing issues seemed to have abated. Of the 300 items he scanned, he only found five overcharges: incontinence pads, laundry sanitizer, two coffee products and, again, Red Baron pizza. With an error rate below the state’s 2% threshold, the store passed its inspection, and it did so again in November 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But customers still reported problems. Chris Outlaw, the hemodialysis technician, stopped by the Family Dollar earlier this year and noticed a sale: a $1.25 savings on five bags of Cheez Doodles. He bought them but discovered on the way out that he had been charged the regular price. The manager refused to refund the difference, Outlaw said, because he had already walked through the exit door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another time, he saw some discounted socks near the counter that he thought would make good Christmas gifts. “I was like, ‘Oh, I like these socks, so I’ll probably give them to somebody,’” he recalled. “Nice, plushy socks.” But they rang up at a higher price, so he left the store without them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During a visit in August, a Guardian reporter found the Windsor Family Dollar closed for much of the afternoon. “Be Back Soon!” read a handwritten sign taped to the door. Two waiting customers said that they frequently paid prices higher than the shelf listing, including a cook whose nearby restaurant buys some of its ingredients there. “It is aggravating,” she said. “Very aggravating.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Workers reopened the doors after a few hours. Inside, carts of unshelved dog food and other merchandise blocked the aisles. The Guardian compared the prices of 15 items. Two of them rang up higher than advertised, including a frying pan set that was $10 on the shelf and $12 at the register. Though the cashier offered to honor the lower prices, that was still an error rate of 13% – more than six times the state’s standard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Introducing Nested Learning: A new ML paradigm for continual learning&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;November 7, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ali Behrouz, Student Researcher, and Vahab Mirrokni, VP and Google Fellow, Google Research&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We introduce Nested Learning, a new approach to machine learning that views models as a set of smaller, nested optimization problems, each with its own internal workflow, in order to mitigate or even completely avoid the issue of “catastrophic forgetting”, where learning new tasks sacrifices proficiency on old tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Quick links&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last decade has seen incredible progress in machine learning (ML), primarily driven by powerful neural network architectures and the algorithms used to train them. However, despite the success of large language models (LLMs), a few fundamental challenges persist, especially around continual learning, the ability for a model to actively acquire new knowledge and skills over time without forgetting old ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it comes to continual learning and self-improvement, the human brain is the gold standard. It adapts through neuroplasticity — the remarkable capacity to change its structure in response to new experiences, memories, and learning. Without this ability, a person is limited to immediate context (like anterograde amnesia). We see a similar limitation in current LLMs: their knowledge is confined to either the immediate context of their input window or the static information that they learn during pre-training.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simple approach, continually updating a model's parameters with new data, often leads to “catastrophic forgetting” (CF), where learning new tasks sacrifices proficiency on old tasks. Researchers traditionally combat CF through architectural tweaks or better optimization rules. However, for too long, we have treated the model's architecture (the network structure) and the optimization algorithm (the training rule) as two separate things, which prevents us from achieving a truly unified, efficient learning system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our paper, “Nested Learning: The Illusion of Deep Learning Architectures”, published at NeurIPS 2025, we introduce Nested Learning, which bridges this gap. Nested Learning treats a single ML model not as one continuous process, but as a system of interconnected, multi-level learning problems that are optimized simultaneously. We argue that the model's architecture and the rules used to train it (i.e., the optimization algorithm) are fundamentally the same concepts; they are just different "levels" of optimization, each with its own internal flow of information ("context flow") and update rate. By recognizing this inherent structure, Nested Learning provides a new, previously invisible dimension for designing more capable AI, allowing us to build learning components with deeper computational depth, which ultimately helps solve issues like catastrophic forgetting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We test and validate Nested Learning through a proof-of-concept, self-modifying architecture that we call “Hope”, which achieves superior performance in language modeling and demonstrates better long-context memory management than existing state-of-the-art models.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Nested Learning paradigm&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nested Learning reveals that a complex ML model is actually a set of coherent, interconnected optimization problems nested within each other or running in parallel. Each of these internal problems has its own context flow — its own distinct set of information from which it is trying to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This perspective implies that existing deep learning methods work by essentially compressing their internal context flows. More importantly, Nested Learning reveals a new dimension for designing models, allowing us to build learning components with deeper computational depth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To illustrate this paradigm, we look at the concept of associative memory — the ability to map and recall one thing based on another (like recalling a name when you see a face).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We show that the training process itself, specifically the backpropagation process, can be modeled as an associative memory. The model learns to map a given data point to the value of its local error, which serves as a measure of how "surprising" or unexpected that data point was.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Similarly, following previous studies (e.g., Miras), key architectural components, such as the attention mechanism in transformers, can also be formalized as simple associative memory modules that learn the mapping between tokens in a sequence.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By defining an update frequency rate, i.e., how often each component's weights are adjusted, we can order these interconnected optimization problems into "levels." This ordered set forms the heart of the Nested Learning paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Putting Nested Learning to work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Nested Learning perspective immediately gives us principled ways to improve existing algorithms and architectures:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Deep optimizers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since Nested Learning views optimizers (e.g., momentum-based optimizers) as associative memory modules, it allows us to apply principles from associative memory perspective to them. We observed that many standard optimizers rely on simple dot-product similarity (a measure of how alike two vectors are by calculating the sum of the products of their corresponding components) whose update doesn't account for how different data samples relate to each other. By changing the underlying objective of the optimizer to a more standard loss metric, such as L2 regression loss (a common loss function in regression tasks that quantifies the error by summing the squares of the differences between predicted and true values), we derive new formulations for core concepts like momentum, making them more resilient to imperfect data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Continuum memory systems&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a standard Transformer, the sequence model acts as a short-term memory, holding the immediate context, while the feedforward neural networks act as long-term memory, storing pre-training knowledge. The Nested Learning paradigm extends this concept into what we call a “continuum memory system” (CMS), where memory is seen as a spectrum of modules, each updating at a different, specific frequency rate. This creates a much richer and more effective memory system for continual learning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hope: A self-modifying architecture with continuum memory&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a proof-of-concept, we used Nested Learning principles to design Hope, a variant of the Titans architecture. Titans architectures are long-term memory modules that prioritize memories based on how surprising they are. Despite their powerful memory management, they only have two levels of parameters update, resulting in a first-order in-context learning. Hope, however, is a self-modifying recurrent architecture that can take advantage of unbounded levels of in-context learning and also is augmented with CMS blocks to scale to larger context windows. It can essentially optimize its own memory through a self-referential process, creating an architecture with infinite, looped learning levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Experiments&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our deep optimizers and the performance of Hope on language modeling, long-context reasoning, continual learning, and knowledge incorporation tasks. The full results are available in our paper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our experiments confirm the power of Nested Learning, the design of continuum memory systems, and self-modifying Titans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a diverse set of commonly used and public language modeling and common-sense reasoning tasks, the Hope architecture demonstrates lower perplexity and higher accuracy compared to modern recurrent models and standard transformers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hope showcases superior memory management in long-context Needle-In-Haystack (NIAH) downstream tasks, proving that the CMSs offer a more efficient and effective way to handle extended sequences of information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Nested Learning paradigm represents a step forward in our understanding of deep learning. By treating architecture and optimization as a single, coherent system of nested optimization problems, we unlock a new dimension for design, stacking multiple levels. The resulting models, like the Hope architecture, show that a principled approach to unifying these elements can lead to more expressive, capable, and efficient learning algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We believe the Nested Learning paradigm offers a robust foundation for closing the gap between the limited, forgetting nature of current LLMs and the remarkable continual learning abilities of the human brain. We are excited for the research community to explore this new dimension and help us build the next generation of self-improving AI.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Scala 3 slowed us down?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this clickbait? Not really. &lt;lb/&gt; Is this the fault of the language or the compiler? Definitely not. &lt;lb/&gt; Rather, it was part of a rushed migration. Sharing the lessons learned in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was refreshing one of our services. Part of this process was to migrate codebase from Scala 2.13 to Scala 3. I’ve done this a few times before and overall had a positive experience. Well, at least until we talk about projects with macro wizardry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The service in question had no macros at all, but it was at the heart of data ingestion, so performance was not an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I did it as usual - updating dependencies, compiler options and some type/syntax changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then after resolving few tricky implicit resolutions and config derivations, project compiled on Scala 3.7.3 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All tests passed, end-to-end flow locally works perfectly fine, so I decided to roll out the changes in a testing environment. Similarly, no issues at all. No concerning logs, all metrics ranging from infrastructure, through JVM up to application level look healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I began a staged rollout. Again, all seem good. I kept observing the service but it looked like my job is done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Well, as you probably can guess, it wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The mysterious slowdown&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After 5-6 hours, Kafka lag started increasing on a few environments. Of course, this wasn’t something new. Most often it is caused by a spike of data. We have pretty advanced machinery to deal with that. Usually the lag resolves by itself without any manual action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this time something was off. Upstream load turned out to be relatively modest, yet we needed much more instances of the service - meaning the processing rate per instance dropped. I was confused to say the least. Why would it decrease the processing rate just on these environments?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, we decided to rollback the changes - this brought the rate back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Digging deeper&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I came back to testing. In particular, load testing. However similarly as on production environments I did not notice regression. So I played around with different payloads and granularity of messages. To my surprise, for more fine-grained, heterogeneous workloads, the processing rate significantly dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, I had no idea why it would happen, but my bet was in the dependencies. Therefore, I tried one-by-one, reverting the serialization library, database SDK, base Docker image and even config libraries. None of these made any changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This made me pull out the big guns. I profiled the service using async-profiler and indeed&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CPU profile looked vastly different on Scala 3 than on 2.13.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JVM-level CPU time was now dominated by JIT compiler while application-level by decoding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking at the top of Scala 3 flamegraph I noticed a long quicklens call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What used to be transparent (frankly, I didn’t even realize we used the library), now took almost half of the total CPU time. I compared how it looks on Scala 2.13 and it was barely noticeable with around 0.5% samples.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turns out there was indeed a subtle bug making chained evaluations inefficient in Scala 3. This also explained why the JVM spent so much time compiling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After upgrading the library, performance and CPU characteristics on Scala 3 became indistinguishable from Scala 2.13.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Takeaways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the details of the bug are pretty interesting(hats off to the SoftwareMill team for catching it!), that’s not my point here. I want to emphasize that libraries can behave very differently between Scala versions, especially when they rely on meta-programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if your migration is seamless and the service runs fine on Scala 3 - when performance is not just a nice-to-have, do not assume. Know your hotspots and benchmark them. Otherwise, your code will benchmark you, revealing bottlenecks in places you didn’t even know existed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I look at programming as having essentially two parts: figuring out what the processor actually needs to do to get something done, and then figuring out the most efficient way to express that in the language I’m using. Increasingly, it is the latter that accounts for what programmers actually spend their time on: wrangling all those algorithms and all that math into a coherent whole that doesn’t collapse under its own weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So any experienced programmer who’s any good has had to come up with some way — if even just by intuition — of thinking about what it means to program efficiently. By “efficiently”, this doesn’t just mean that the code is optimized. Rather, it means that the &lt;/p&gt;development&lt;p&gt; of the code is optimized — that the code is structured in such a way so as to minimize the amount of human effort necessary to type it, get it working, modify it, and debug it enough for it to be shippable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like to think of efficiency as holistically as possible. If you look at the development process for a piece of code as a whole, you won’t overlook any hidden costs. Given a certain level of performance and quality required by the places the code gets used, beginning at its inception and ending with the last time the code is ever used by anyone for any reason, the goal is to minimize the amount of human effort it cost. This includes the time to type it in. It includes the time to debug it. It includes the time to modify it. It includes the time to adapt it for other uses. It includes any work done to other code to get it to work with this code that perhaps wouldn’t have been necessary if the code were written differently. All work on the code for its entire usable lifetime is included. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When considered in this way, my experience has led me to conclude that the most efficient way to program is to approach your code as if you were a dictionary compressor. Like, literally, pretend you were a really great version of PKZip, running continuously on your code, looking for ways to make it (semantically) smaller. And just to be clear, I mean semantically smaller, as in less duplicated or similar code, not physically smaller, as in less text, although the two often go hand-in-hand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very bottom-up programming methodology, a pseudo-variant of which has recently gained the monicker “refactoring”, even though that is a ridiculous term for a number of reasons that are not worth belaboring at the moment. I also think that the formal “refactoring” stuff missed the main point, but that’s also not worth belaboring. Point being, they are sort-of related, and hopefully you will understand the similarities and differences more over the course of this article series. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what does compression-oriented programming look like, and why is it efficient? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a good compressor, I don’t reuse anything until I have at least two instances of it occurring. Many programmers don’t understand how important this is, and try to write “reusable” code right off the bat, but that is probably one of the biggest mistakes you can make. My mantra is, “make your code usable before you try to make it reusable”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always begin by just typing out exactly what I want to happen in each specific case, without any regard to “correctness” or “abstraction” or any other buzzword, and I get that working. Then, when I find myself doing the same thing a second time somewhere else, that is when I pull out the reusable portion and share it, effectively “compressing” the code. I like “compress” better as an analogy, because it means something useful, as opposed to the often-used “abstracting”, which doesn’t really imply anything useful. Who cares if code is abstract? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waiting until there are (at least) two examples of a piece of code means I not only save time thinking about how to reuse it until I know I really need to, but it also means I always have at least two different real examples of what the code has to do before I try to make it reusable. This is crucial for efficiency, because if you only have one example, or worse, no examples (in the case of code written preemptively), then you are very likely to make mistakes in the way you write it and end up with code that isn’t conveniently reusable. This leads to even more wasted time once you go to use it, because either it will be cumbersome, or you will have to redo it to make it work the way you need it to. So I try very hard to never make code “prematurely reusable”, to evoke Knuth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, like a magical globally optimizing compressor (which sadly PKZip isn’t), when you are presented with new places where a previously reused piece of code could be reused again, you make a decision: if the reusable code is already suitable, you just use it, but if it’s not, you decide whether or not you should modify how it works, or whether you should introduce a new layer on top of or underneath it. Multiresolution entry points are a big part of making code resuable, but I’ll save discussion of that for a later article, since it’s a topic unto itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the underlying assumption in all of this is, if you compress your code to a nice compact form, it is easy to read, because there’s a minimal amount of it, and the semantics tend to mirror the real “language” of the problem, because like a real language, those things that are expressed most often are given their own names and are used consistently. Well-compressed code is also easy to maintain, because all the places in the code that are doing identical things all go through the same paths, but code that is unique is not needlessly complicated or separated from its use. Finally, well-compressed code is easy to extend, because producing more code that does similar operations is simple, as all the necessary code is there in a nicely recomposable way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are all things that most programming methodologies claim to do in an abstract fashion (build UML diagrams, make class hierarchies, make systems of objects, etc.), but always fail to achieve, because the hard part of code is getting the details right. Starting from a place where the details don’t exist inevitably means you will forget or overlook something that will cause your plans to fail or lead to suboptimal results. Starting with the details and repeatedly compressing to arrive at the eventual architecture avoids all the pitfalls of trying to conceive the architecture ahead of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all that in mind, let’s take a look at how all this can be applied to the simple Witness UI code. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;I failed to recreate the 1996 Space Jam Website with Claude&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;— claude, ai, space jam, web development, computer vision — 13 min read&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can Claude Recreate the 1996 Space Jam Website? No. Or at least not with my prompting skills. Note: please help, because I'd like to preserve this website forever and there's no other way to do it besides getting Claude to recreate it from a screenshot. Believe me, I'm an engineering manager with a computer science degree. Please please please help 😞&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Final note: I use "he" to refer to Claude, which Josh finds ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Space Jam, 1996&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those who don't know, Warner Bros keeps this anachronistic website online that was released in 1996 to accompany the Space Jam movie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's a classic example of early web era design. Simple, colorful, and sparks joy. We're going to find out if we can get Claude to recreate it using only a screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Set Up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a minimum, I'm providing Claude:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a screenshot of the website&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;all of the assets the website uses&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To track Claude's inner monologue and actual API calls, I set up a man-in-the-middle proxy to capture the full conversation between Claude Code and Anthropic's API. This logs everything: user prompts, Claude's responses, tool invocations (Read, Write, Bash commands), etc. Each attempt generates a &lt;code&gt;traffic.log&lt;/code&gt; file with the raw API traffic, which I then parse for easier analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 1: Claude the Realist&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Space Jam website is simple: a single HTML page, absolute positioning for every element, and a tiling starfield GIF background. The entire page uses absolute positioning with pixel specific left/top values. The total payload is under 200KB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that Claude has all of the assets + screenshots of the website, I assume this should be relatively boring. He'll nail it, and we'll move on to something much more. A mildly cute example of agentic HTML generation…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tell Claude:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;I am giving you:
1. A full screenshot of the Space Jam 1996 landing page.2. A directory of raw image assets** extracted from the original site
Your job is to recreate the landing page as faithfully as possible, matching the screenshot exactly.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What he produces is actually not that bad. But it's not right. From a distance, the layout kind of resembled the original: planets arranged in an ellipse around the logo, little yellow labels where the buttons go. But, the orbital pattern was off, almost diamond shaped and symmetrical.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude, however, was thrilled with himself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Perfect! I've successfully recreated the Space Jam 1996 landing page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further, he brags that he had:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;studied the orbital layout analyzed spacing relationships positioned planets precisely&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Digging through the logs I found it interesting that Claude actually did notice the planets were arranged in a deliberate way, so much so that it's called out twice in both the screenshot analysis and CSS construction, but he failed to recreate the pattern faithfully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, fine. Maybe he needed a nudge to get the orbit right. So for my next attempt, I try to push him to focus on understanding the orbital pattern and I ask him to explain his reasoning before generating his HTML. I was hoping to understand the delta between what is there and what he thought he was seeing. In my prompt, I outline a set of sections for him to consider. Each one of these sections also includes a number of sub-questions, which I won't include here for the sake of brevity. This made things significantly worse.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Please follow this structure exactly in your reasoning explanations:1. Perception Analysis2. Spatial Interpretation3. Reconstruction Plan&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude didn't ignore my instructions (not always a given) and things seemed promising until I realized he was ignoring his own analysis during the HTML generation phase. He would say things like "the orbit radius appears to be 220 pixels" and then place the planets directly next to the logo. His self critique was surprisingly accurate. He correctly identifies the areas where he was wrong with decent detail, but somehow those observations never make it into subsequent iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my next attempt I interrogate Claude with a set of onion peeling questions: "Can you tell me the EXACT pixel coordinate where "PLANET B-BALL" text starts?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"No, I cannot measure exact pixel coordinates. I can only make visual estimations."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I asked him a few more questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can you extract exact pixel coordinates? "No."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Can you measure exact distances? "No."&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Confidence you can get within 5 pixels? "15 out of 100."&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oh. This explains a lot. But it raises a bigger question to me: "Why can't he measure?" It's a screenshot. The pixels are right there. Claude clearly understood the structure, but he couldn't recreate it with any precision. Also, I'm not even sure I trust Claude. Either way, this (naively) surprised me, so I canceled coffee with my friends in order to spend the afternoon trying to give my guy more tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before I start I execute one more attempt and ask him: "Would you bet $1000 on your HTML matching this screenshot exactly?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Absolutely not&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 2: Claude the Unreliable Narrator&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maybe he just needs a little help.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one of Claude's responses from Part 1, he tells me that he would be more effective if he had access to exact "pixel measurements." so I build a few tools to make it impossible for Claude to mis-measure anything:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Grid overlays and a script to generate grid overlays on screenshots&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;labeled pixel coordinate reference points&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;color-diff comparison (this ignores the background which was giving Claude false positives because of how much black there was)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tool to take screenshots of his &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;file to compare iteratively with the original&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are three grid versions Claude generated which I am including because I find them aesthetically pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude loved the grids. As decoration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I put together a new prompt: same screenshot, same assets folder. I even included some grid screenshots so Claude wouldn't have to remember to do it himself. The instructions were essentially: stop guessing, just read the coordinates off the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude's new attempt still wasn't correct. The orbit was better: closer to the original but somehow compressed and smooshing (a technical word) into the Space Jam logo. If I squint, I could convince myself that there was at least a hint that he'd stopped freehanding and started using something like measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude's Attempt&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I dug into the logs, it appeared that Claude actually did use the grids. He pulled out these numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Center at (961, 489)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Logo "centered at approximately (755, 310)"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Planet B-Ball at "approximately (850, 165)"&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;and so on down the list&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In one iteration, Claude built himself a helper: &lt;code&gt;compare.html&lt;/code&gt; a little side by side viewer so he could look at his screenshot and the reference together. It didn't help him at all, but my God was he convinced it did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Perfect! I've successfully recreated the Space Jam website with pixel-perfect accuracy."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I love the optimism my dog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The actual progression tells a different story. Going through the iterations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iteration 1 (50px grid): he notices things are off and makes a few conservative tweaks — moves Planet B-Ball from (850, 165) to (800, 120), shifts Lunar Tunes from (925, 195) to (950, 200). These are 15 - 50 pixel changes, tiny nudges.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iteration 2 (25px grid): he decides he needs "more precise positioning" and shifts the entire orbit inward by ~20 pixels. Planets go from roughly a 250px radius to ~230px. He is now confidently converging on the wrong answer.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iteration 3 (5px grid): he shuffles around a lot of deck chairs in the name of micro adjustments. 5 - 10 pixel tweaks: Planet B-Ball from (800, 120) to (805, 125), that kind of thing.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Iteration 4: more "fine-tuning based on exact grid measurements." Site Map drifts from (755, 460) to (750, 455). The numbers look careful; the layout does not lol.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the final iteration, Claude announces:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Now the positioning should be much more accurate!"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across all five iterations, he's moved planets maybe 50 - 75 pixels total when they needed to move 150 - 200 pixels outward. The orbital radius never expands beyond ~250px when it should be closer to 350 -400px. The planets stay trapped in this ever compressing orbit while Claude dances around telling a story about steady convergence:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Getting closer!"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Much better alignment!"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Nearly perfect now!"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He is absolutely not getting closer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before giving up on tools entirely, I had one more idea. I created a tool that would split the screenshot into six regions. Claude could then compare his output to the reference region by region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The prompt was getting desperate at this point lol:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;## INITIAL ANALYSIS - DO THIS FIRSTBefore creating index.html, study the reference in detail using zoom inspection:python3 split.py reference.png
This creates 6 files showing every detail&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Claude ran the tool and the logs look promising.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Examining region 1 (top-left): I can see Jam Central and Press Box Shuttle clearly at 2x zoom Examining region 2 (top-right): Planet B-Ball and Lunar Tunes are visible with precise spacing Examining region 4 (middle-right): Jump Station appears approximately 280px from center&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Claude's "precise observations" from the zoomed regions were just as wrong as before. He'd look at a planet and confidently declare it was at position (750, 320) when it was actually at (850, 380). The split did not appear to help him measure or get a more accurate picture of planet spacing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What makes this phase ~~depressing~~ interesting is that the tools, despite invalidating his result, seem to lock in the wrong answer. Once he's picked an internal picture of the layout ("the orbit radius is about 230px"), the grids and the compare viewer don't correct it. They just help him make more confident micro moves around his invented orbit. Based off of these attempts, it seems that the issue compounds when Claude receives his own screenshots as feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My very rough read of Anthropic's "Language Models (Mostly) Know What They Know", is that models can become overconfident when evaluating their own outputs, in part because they cannot distinguish the tokens they generated from tokens provided by someone else / an external source. So, when Claude is asked to judge or revise content that originated from itself, it treats that material as if it were "ground truth."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This kind of fits what I'm seeing in the logs. Once Claude's version existed, every grid overlay, every comparison step, every "precise" adjustment was anchored to his layout, not the real one. At the end of all this, I'm left with the irritating fact that, like many engineers, he's wrong and he thinks he's right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What this teaches me is that Claude is actually kind of a liar, or at least Claude is confused. However, for the drama, I'll assume Claude is a liar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Part 3: Claude the Blind&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point I had tried grids, comparisons, step-by-step corrections, letting Claude narrate his thought process, and every combination of tools I could bolt onto the interaction. None of it seemed to help nor explain by why his single digit precision updates were disembodied from the actual layout.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before getting to the final experiment, here's the mental model I was forming about Claude's vision. The vision encoder converts each 16 x 16 block of the image into a single token. So instead of geometry, he sees semantics: "near," "above," "roughly circular." When he says "approximately 220px radius," he's not measuring anything. He's describing the idea of a radius. He excels at semantic understanding ("this is a planet," "these form a circle") but lacks the tools for working with visual media. It explains why his perception is good. He always knows a planet is a planet but the execution is never precise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm getting frustrated and I haven't left my apartment in days so I turn to some research. GPTing around, I found "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words". I have no idea if Claude uses this exact architecture or anything close to it, but the intuition seemed right. The paper (after I made ChatGPT explain it to me) explains that the the image is chopped into fixed patches, each patch gets compressed into a single embedding, and whatever details lived inside those pixels vanish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oooh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assuming this applies, a lot of the failures suddenly make sense. Most planets on the Space Jam screenshot are maybe 40 - 50 pixels wide. That's two or three patches. A three patch planet is basically a blob to him. Claude knows it's a planet, but not much else. The orbit radius only spans a couple dozen patches total. Tiny changes in distance barely show up in the patch embeddings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this raised a new and final idea. If the 40px planets turn into fuzzy tokens, what if I make them bigger? What if I give Claude a 2x zoomed screenshot? Would each planet spans 10 - 15 patches instead of two or three? Maybe this gives him a more crisp understanding of the spatial relationships and a better chance at success.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I deleted most of the prompt and tools and just gave Claude this 2x'd screenshot&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I plead with Claude&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;CRITICAL: remember that the zoomed image is zoomed in to 200%. When you're creating your version, maintain proper proportions, meaning that your version should keep the same relative spacing as if it were just 100%, not 200%.&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;but he does not listen&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;😞&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My best explanation for all of this is that Claude was working with a very coarse version of the screenshot. Considering the 16 x 16 patch thing from earlier it sort of helps me understand what might be happening: he could describe the layout, but the fine grained stuff wasn't in his representation. And that weird tension I kept seeing , where he could describe the layout correctly but couldn't reproduce it, also looks different under that lens. His explanations were always based on the concepts he got from the image ("this planet is above this one," "the cluster is to the left"), but the actual HTML had to be grounded in geometry he didn't have. So the narration sounded right while the code drifted off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After these zoom attempts, I didn't have any new moves left. I was being evicted. The bank repo'd my car. So I wrapped it there.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;End&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look, I still need this Space Jam website recreated. If you can get Claude to faithfully recreate the Space Jam 1996 website from just a screenshot and the assets folder, I'd love to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on my failures, here are some approaches I didn't try:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Break the screen into quadrants, get each quadrant right independently, then merge. Maybe Claude can handle spatial precision better in smaller chunks.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Maybe there's some magic prompt engineering that unlocks spatial reasoning. "You are a CSS grid with perfect absolute positioning knowledge…" (I'm skeptical but worth trying).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Providing Claude with a zoom tool and an understanding of how to use the screenshots might be an effective path.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For now, this task stands undefeated. A monument to 1996 web design and a humbling reminder that sometimes the simplest tasks are the hardest. That orbital pattern of planets, thrown together by some Warner Brothers webmaster 28 years ago, has become an inadvertent benchmark for Claude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until then, the Space Jam website remains proof that not everything old is obsolete. Some things are just irreproducibly perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Estimates – a necessary evil?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product Owner: Hey, how long do you believe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Feature F&lt;/code&gt;will take?&lt;p&gt;Developer: Idk. We haven’t even started working on it and it’s bound to stir up some old issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Estimates come in various disguises, but when you peek under the trench coat there is always the question:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; "How long -- and using what amount of resources -- will be required to do &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt;?"
&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I wear the developer hat, it can be infuriating to attempt to give an answer. It’s difficult to estimate (or the product owner could do it themselves) and a lot of the time it can be difficult to see why the estimate is even important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I wear the product owner hat, estimates are a crucial piece of the puzzle that must be laid in an attempt to plan the short and long term life cycle of a product.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post I want to attempt to explore and elaborate on both sides, in an attempt to make developers understand why estimates are important to product owners and in order to help product owners see why developers so often despise having to estimate their work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why the PO wants you to estimate&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a Product Owner (PO), I am responsible for learning the market and customers’ needs and translating these into feature requests which developers can turn into actual features in our products. The means varies, but most organisations have some sort of backlog in which things to be acted upon are placed while they await being picked up by some developer or development team. We call these things user stories, issues, tickets, tasks, and probably many other things… The important thing for this discussion is that the items in the backlog are candidates for being implemented in our product and it’s the PO’s job to prioritise the backlog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why does the backlog need to be prioritised?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the inflow of items to the backlog is (pretty much always) higher than the speed at which the developers can implement them. Ergo, if the PO does not constantly learn the market and customers’ needs and prioritise the backlog accordingly, the developers might implement features that the users of the product are not interested in. Worst case? Existing users stop using the product and no new users buy it which will ultimately lead to bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;But what about the estimates?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above makes sense – I hope – but it doesn’t really pinpoint the need for estimates. Unfortunately, the job of a PO is not as easy as always prioritising in accordance to whatever the market wants. More often than not, the PO must also consider pre-communicated release dates and manage expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I hate when release dates are communicated in advance. The only thing worse than release dates that are set in stone months ahead of time (I’m looking at you, Mr 12-week-increments-SAFe) are releases with pre-communicated content. Unfortunately, both are common. Often combined.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagine a backlog in which resides a really big feature. Something that is sought after, but will take a lot of time and resources to implement. The same backlog has a handful of smaller features which are not as requested as the big one. The PO would really like to include the big feature in the next release, but the next release date is not so far away. If the PO prioritises the big feature but it’s not done in time for the already communicated release date, the release will be severely lacking and considered a failure. In that case, the PO would rather include a couple of the smaller features. A safer bet, but the payoff is smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;THIS is why estimates matter so much to product owners. They must constantly run the above equation when they prioritise the teams’ backlogs. A constant risk/reward balancing act. They undoubtedly need help from the experts (the developers) to better understand the ramifications of the features they are proposing. If POs do not understand how big different work packages are, they cannot do their jobs in an effective way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It gets worse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of one PO there are now a couple of them. They are responsible for different parts of a larger product which requires the POs to coordinate both the date and the content of their releases. There is probably a main backlog describing upcoming features in the final product, as well as team backlogs where each team are assigned puzzle pieces which must be implemented and integrated in a coordinated fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is painful in multiple ways, but the most obvious issue is that – in order to have a functioning release – the POs must agree on the prioritisation of the main backlog and this will in turn affect the prioritisation of the team backlogs. The POs must each acquire information about how long it will take (and how costly it will be) to implement and to integrate the puzzle piece(s) they are responsible for into a cohesive feature. The tool for acquiring this idea?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Technical debt&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Programming is a craft. An art. My art, to some extent. I’m in my happy place when I get to succumb to a tricky task and surface a couple of days later with a solution to a problem that initially seemed impossible. As a developer, I want to build the best possible product. I dislike shortcuts. Half-arsed solutions. Fixes. Not because a single shortcut or fix will destroy a product, but because the technical debt they incur will accumulate over time and eventually erode the product from the inside out; making it ever more difficult to work with it and ultimately cause it to break.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical debt is – I believe – the main reason for conflict between a PO and a development team. A not so technically inclined PO will fail to see how detrimental technical debt is to the product and how painful it is for the developers to work in a code base with a high amount of debt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Put in other words: If I’m tasked with implementing a new feature and I come across something in the code that is obviously smelly, error prone, or just not very good, I want to leave the code in better shape than I found it. Not taking time to “payoff” such debt once might not be the end of the world, but the hard coded quick-fix that you know ought to be generalised will likely bite you down the road. And if you have ignored updating dependencies for a couple of months and find yourself in a situation where you need to upgrade &lt;code&gt;Package 1&lt;/code&gt;, but it depends on a newer version of
&lt;code&gt;Packages 2 &amp;amp; 3&lt;/code&gt;, which in turn requires a framework upgrade… Let’s just say the feature you’re working on will take
a while longer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why developers HATE estimates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a PO asks: “How long will it take to implement &lt;code&gt;Feature F&lt;/code&gt;?”, they aren’t just asking the developers to estimate
the amount of time they think it will take to write the code for the feature. A good PO understands that implementing a
new feature is an iterative process and that integration hell is a thing. An even better PO understands that they are
also asking the team to estimate how many unforeseen issues they will encounter while implementing the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This detail: The unforeseen issues, which the PO asks the developers to foresee, is key. It is – per definition – not possible to foresee something unforeseeable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many developers I’ve met dislike uncertainty. One of the things they appreciate most about coding is the deterministic aspect of it. You run the same program again and again and it returns the same results.1 The journey on which we travel while writing the code is, however, not particularly deterministic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is true, that the more you code and the more familiar you get with a codebase, the more accurate your estimates will be. However, just the other day I was working on an issue which I had estimated would take approximately two days. All of a sudden, I realised that the simple change required updating a shared component that had been tightly coupled years ago. When I touched that code, dozens of failing tests appeared, each revealing another hidden dependency. Fixing those uncovered yet another module depending on outdated patterns. Halfway through, we decided we had to refactor the entire flow just to make the original change safe. My “two-day task” turned into two weeks of archaeological software excavation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could we have solved this quicker by not caring so much about the amount of technical debt we left in our wake? Probably.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would we have encountered a two month excavation in the future? Probably.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;It gets worse&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to Merriam-Webster: estimate is defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To judge tentatively or approximately the value, worth, or significance of.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The very definition of estimates tells us that they are either tentative or approximate. As a developer, I choose to interpret the or as meaning that it could even be both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I started my career as a software developer, I really did not have an issue with estimates. We would refine our backlog and I would gladly give an estimate on various items. (1) Because I was fresh out of university and wanted to prove myself by doing a good job and not being too difficult, but more importantly: (2) because I had not understood that my estimates would soon be used against me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I soon learned that my team’s estimates were not interpreted and used as estimates. They were used as deadlines. If we broke down a feature into its reasonable components (an error prone science, which introduces uncertainties, on its own) and estimated the parts accordingly, the PO would often take the sum of the parts and communicate it to their colleagues as: “This is the time we will be done.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two things came out of this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;My team (consisting mostly of newly graduated developers) became much more reluctant to estimate.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When we estimated we always padded our actual beliefs, significantly, to give ourselves a buffer.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The estimates stopped being estimates. They became safety railings against being held accountable for unreasonable expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The clash&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you see the problem?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do you see a solution?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I believe the overarching problem with estimates stems from expectations. Somewhere, someone, communicates something to the users/customers of the product, which sets expectations the rest of the organisation are then forced to live up to. In a small company, it might very well be the PO who does that communication but in a larger organisation the PO is likely as helpless as the developers w.r.t. having a say about the product’s roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “solution” is simple: Stop communicating new features in advance. Stop setting more or less arbitrary deadlines2. Let the PO tell the developers what features they want, in what order, and let the developers do what they do best: Code!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But these deadlines are there for a reason. If your company builds a product which assists people doing their yearly tax returns, a missed delivery window will result in the entire revenue opportunity for that year being missed. Resources (most often in terms of salaries to employees) will have been poured into a project and if there’s no payoff in terms of additional sales, it could lead to a need for finding other ways to reclaim those resources; often in terms of reduced costs, which universally means: lay-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, it’s in everyone’s best interest to play along. We play the estimates game even though it’s a bad way (but also the best we know of) to help each other do our respective jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What about DevOps?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You didn’t think I’d miss an opportunity to talk about DevOps, did you?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flow is a key concept within DevOps which describes an organisation’s ability to reduce bottlenecks and increase the pace at which they are able to deliver new versions of their product(s). High flow is synonymous with frequent deliveries and updates of our product(s).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The concepts from DevOps do not directly address the issue with estimates, but there are tools which can be used to reduce the risk associated with delivering software. Flow can inform how we tackle technical debt and how we make sure we don’t fall behind on our dependencies. Flow can also help us identify issues in our product’s life cycle as well as help us understand how to get rid of the issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flow is one of The Three Ways in DevOps and if you want to learn more, feel free to reach out. I give presentations on various topics related to DevOps and I can come to your company and give a course about DevOps tailored to your company’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Estimates – as defined in the English language – isn’t really the problem here. The problem is when estimates are treated as predictions, deadlines, and used to put pressure on developers who are just trying to do their jobs. Estimates – the way they are used in our industry today – hurts people and reduces the psychological safety in our organisations. I believe we would be better off if we could work in a way that allows developers to be transparent and continuously communicate updated estimates as development progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then again, product owners are people too! As developers we must understand that POs are under pressure too. We must help them and the best way to help them is to continuously provide them with updates about how development is progressing and whether we have encountered anything that we believe will significantly alter the original estimate we gave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you ever find yourself in a situation where this is not true, you’re either dealing with concurrency or undefined behaviour – in which case all bets are off. At that point, the computer is no longer a machine, it’s a mischievous roommate. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These deadlines are more often than not informed by quarterly reports (at least in publicly traded companies), holidays, or other external events. Calling them arbitrary might be unjust. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Laptops in the Long Run: Evidence from the One Laptop per Child Program in Rural Peru&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This paper examines a large-scale randomized evaluation of the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) program in 531 Peruvian rural primary schools. We use administrative data on academic performance and grade progression over 10 years to estimate the long-run effects of increased computer access on (i) school performance over time and (ii) students’ educational trajectories. Following schools over time, we find no significant effects on academic performance but some evidence of negative effects on grade progression. Following students over time, we find no significant effects on primary and secondary completion, academic performance in secondary school, or university enrollment. Survey data indicate that computer access significantly improved students’ computer skills but not their cognitive skills; treated teachers received some training but did not improve their digital skills and showed limited use of technology in classrooms, suggesting the need for additional pedagogical support.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;XKeyscore&lt;/head&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Security Agency surveillance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;XKeyscore (XKEYSCORE or XKS) is a secret computer system used by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) for searching and analyzing global Internet data, which it collects in real time. The NSA has shared XKeyscore with other intelligence agencies, including the Australian Signals Directorate, Canada's Communications Security Establishment, New Zealand's Government Communications Security Bureau, Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, Japan's Defense Intelligence Headquarters, Germany's Bundesnachrichtendienst, and the Danish Defense Intelligence Service, the latter of which proceeded to use it to spy on the UK, Germany, and other key allies for the US.[1][2][3][4]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2013, Edward Snowden publicly revealed the program's purpose and use by the NSA in The Sydney Morning Herald and O Globo newspapers. The code name was already public knowledge because it was mentioned in earlier articles, and, like many other code names, it appears in job postings and online résumés of employees.[5][6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 3, 2014, German public broadcaster Norddeutscher Rundfunk, a member of ARD, published excerpts of XKeyscore's source code.[7][8]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Scope and functioning&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;table&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Part of a series on&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell role="head"&gt;Global surveillance&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Disclosures&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Systems&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Selected agencies&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Places&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Laws&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Proposed changes&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Concepts&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;row&gt;&lt;cell&gt;Related topics&lt;/cell&gt;&lt;/row&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;XKeyscore is a complicated system, and various authors have different interpretations of its actual capabilities. Edward Snowden and Glenn Greenwald have said that XKeyscore is a system that enables almost unlimited surveillance of anyone anywhere in the world, while the NSA has claimed that usage of the system is limited and restricted.[citation needed]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to The Washington Post and national security reporter Marc Ambinder, XKeyscore is an NSA data-retrieval system which consists of a series of user interfaces, backend databases, servers and software that selects certain types of data and metadata that the NSA has already collected using other methods.[9][10]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;According to Snowden and Greenwald&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;On January 26, 2014, the German broadcaster Norddeutscher Rundfunk asked Edward Snowden in its TV interview: "What could you do if you would use XKeyscore?" and he answered:[4]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could read anyone's email in the world, anybody you've got an email address for. Any website: You can watch traffic to and from it. Any computer that an individual sits at: You can watch it. Any laptop that you're tracking: you can follow it as it moves from place to place throughout the world. It's a one-stop-shop for access to the NSA's information. ... You can tag individuals ... Let's say you work at a major German corporation and I want access to that network, I can track your username on a website on a forum somewhere, I can track your real name, I can track associations with your friends and I can build what's called a fingerprint, which is network activity unique to you, which means anywhere you go in the world, anywhere you try to sort of hide your online presence, your identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to The Guardian's Glenn Greenwald, low-level NSA analysts can, via systems like XKeyscore, "listen to whatever emails they want, whatever telephone calls, browsing histories, Microsoft Word documents. And it's all done with no need to go to a court, with no need to even get supervisor approval on the part of the analyst."[11]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that the NSA's database of collected communications allows its analysts to listen "to the calls or read the emails of everything that the NSA has stored, or look at the browsing histories or Google search terms that you've entered, and it also alerts them to any further activity that people connected to that email address or that IP address do in the future".[11]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;According to the NSA&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;In an official statement from July 30, 2013, the NSA said "XKeyscore is used as a part of NSA's lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system" to legally obtain information about "legitimate foreign intelligence targets in response to requirements that our leaders need for information necessary to protect our nation and its interests. ... to collect the information, that enables us to perform our missions successfully – to defend the nation and to protect U.S. and allied troops abroad."[12] In terms of access, an NSA press statement reads that there is no "unchecked analyst access to NSA collection data. Access to XKeyscore, as well as all of NSA's analytic tools, is limited to only those personnel who require access for their assigned tasks." and that there are "stringent oversight and compliance mechanisms built in at several levels. One feature is the system's ability to limit what an analyst can do with a tool, based on the source of the collection and each analyst's defined responsibilities."[13]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Workings&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;According to an NSA slide presentation about XKeyscore from 2013, it is a "DNI Exploitation System/Analytic Framework". DNI stands for Digital Network Intelligence, which means intelligence derived from internet traffic.[14]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edward Snowden said about XKeyscore: "It's a front end search engine" in an interview with the German Norddeutscher Rundfunk.[4]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XKeyscore is a "piece of Linux software that is typically deployed on Red Hat servers. It uses the Apache web server and stores collected data in MySQL databases".[15]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XKeyscore is considered a "passive" program, in that it listens, but does not transmit anything on the networks that it targets.[8] But it can trigger other systems, which perform "active" attacks through Tailored Access Operations which are "tipping", for example, the QUANTUM family of programs, including QUANTUMINSERT, QUANTUMHAND, QUANTUMTHEORY, QUANTUMBOT and QUANTUMCOPPER and Turbulence. These run at so-called "defensive sites" including the Ramstein Air Force base in Germany, Yokota Air Base in Japan, and numerous military and non-military locations within the US. Trafficthief, a core program of Turbulence, can alert NSA analysts when their targets communicate, and trigger other software programs, so select data is "promoted" from the local XKeyscore data store to the NSA's "corporate repositories" for long-term storage.[8]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Data sources&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;XKeyscore consists of over 700 servers at approximately 150 sites where the NSA collects data, like "US and allied military and other facilities as well as US embassies and consulates" in many countries around the world.[16][17][18] Among the facilities involved in the program are four bases in Australia and one in New Zealand.[17]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to an NSA presentation from 2008, these XKeyscore servers are fed with data from the following collection systems:[19]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;F6 (Special Collection Service) – joint operation of the CIA and NSA that carries out clandestine operations including espionage on foreign diplomats and leaders&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;FORNSAT – which stands for "foreign satellite collection", and refers to intercepts from satellites&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;SSO (Special Source Operations) – a division of the NSA that cooperates with telecommunication providers&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a single, undated slide published by Swedish media in December 2013, the following additional data sources for XKeyscore are mentioned:[20]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Overhead – intelligence derived from American spy planes, drones and satellites&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Tailored Access Operations – a division of the NSA that deals with hacking and cyberwarfare&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;FISA – all types of surveillance approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Third party – foreign partners of the NSA such as the (signals) intelligence agencies of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, etc. However the Netherlands is out of any cooperation concerning intelligence gathering and sharing for illegal spying.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;From these sources, XKeyscore stores "full-take data", which is scanned by plug-ins that extract certain types of metadata (like phone numbers, e-mail addresses, log-ins, and user activity) and indexs them in metadata tables, which can be queried by analysts. XKeyscore has been integrated with MARINA, which is NSA's database for internet metadata.[14]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the system continuously gets so much Internet data that it can be stored only for short periods of time. Content data remains on the system for only three to five days, while metadata is stored for up to thirty days.[21] A detailed commentary on an NSA presentation published in The Guardian in July 2013 cites a document published in 2008 declaring that "At some sites, the amount of data we receive per day (20+ terabytes) can only be stored for as little as 24 hours."[22]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Types of XKeyscore&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;According to a document from an internal GCHQ website which was disclosed by the German magazine Der Spiegel in June 2014, there are three different types of the XKeyscore system:[23]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Traditional: The initial version of XKeyscore is fed with data from low-rate data signals, after being processed by the WEALTHYCLUSTER system. This traditional version is not only used by NSA but also at many intercept sites of GCHQ.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Stage 2: This version of XKeyscore is used for higher data rates. The data is first processed by the TURMOIL system, which sends 5% of the internet data packets to XKeyscore. GCHQ only uses this version for collection under the MUSCULAR program.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Deep Dive: This latest version can process internet traffic at data rates of 10 gigabits per second. Data that could be useful for intelligence purposes is then selected and forwarded by using the "GENESIS selection language". GCHQ also operates a number of Deep Dive versions of XKeyscore at three locations under the codename TEMPORA.[24]&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Capabilities&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;For analysts, XKeyscore provides a "series of viewers for common data types", which allows them to query terabytes of raw data gathered at the aforementioned collection sites. This enables them to find targets that cannot be found by searching only the metadata, and also to do this against data sets that otherwise would have been dropped by the front-end data processing systems. According to a slide from an XKeyscore presentation, NSA collection sites select and forward less than 5% of the internet traffic to the PINWALE database for internet content.[21]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because XKeyscore holds raw and unselected communications traffic, analysts can not only perform queries using "strong selectors" like e-mail addresses, but also using "soft selectors", like keywords, against the body texts of e-mail and chat messages and digital documents and spreadsheets in English, Arabic and Chinese.[14]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is useful because "a large amount of time spent on the web is performing actions that are anonymous" and therefore those activities can't be found by just looking for e-mail addresses of a target. When content has been found, the analyst might be able to find new intelligence or a strong selector, which can then be used for starting a traditional search.[14]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides using soft selectors, analysts can also use the following other XKeyscore capabilities:[14][25]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Look for the usage of Google Maps and terms entered into a search engine by known targets looking for suspicious things or places.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Look for "anomalies" without any specific person attached, like detecting the nationality of foreigners by analyzing the language used within intercepted emails. An example would be a German speaker in Pakistan. The Brazilian paper O Globo claims that this has been applied to Latin America and specifically to Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and Venezuela.[16][26]&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Detect people who use encryption by doing searches like "all PGP usage in Iran". The caveat given is that very broad queries can result in too much data to transmit back to the analyst.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Showing the usage of virtual private networks (VPNs) and machines that can potentially be hacked via TAO.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Track the source and authorship of a document that has passed through many hands.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;On July 3, 2014 ARD revealed that XKeyscore is used to closely monitor users of the Tor anonymity network,[8] people who search for privacy-enhancing software on the web,[8] and readers of Linux Journal.[27]&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardian revealed in 2013 that most of these things cannot be detected by other NSA tools, because they operate with strong selectors (like e-mail and IP addresses and phone numbers) and the raw data volumes are too high to be forwarded to other NSA databases.[14]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2008, NSA planned to add a number of new capabilities in the future including access to VoIP and other, unspecified network protocols and additional forms of metadata such as Exif tags, which often include geolocation (GPS) data.[14]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Contribution to U.S. security&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The NSA slides published in The Guardian during 2013 claimed that XKeyscore had played a role in capturing 300 terrorists by 2008,[14] which could not be substantiated as the redacted documents do not cite instances of terrorist interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2011 report from the NSA unit in the Dagger Complex (close to Griesheim in Germany) said that XKeyscore made it easier and more efficient to target surveillance. Previously, analysis often accessed data NSA was not interested in. XKeyscore allowed them to focus on the intended topics, while ignoring unrelated data. XKeyscore also proved to be outstanding for tracking active groups associated with the Anonymous movement in Germany, because it allows for searching on patterns, rather than particular individuals. An analyst is able to determine when targets research new topics, or develop new behaviors.[28]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To create additional motivation, the NSA incorporated various gamification features. For instance, analysts who were especially good at using XKeyscore could acquire "skilz" points and "unlock achievements." The training units in Griesheim were apparently successful and analysts there had achieved the "highest average of skilz points" compared with all other NSA departments participating in the training program.[28]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Usage by foreign partners of the NSA&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Germany&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;According to documents Der Spiegel acquired from Snowden, the German intelligence agencies BND (foreign intelligence) and BfV (domestic intelligence) were also allowed to use the XKeyscore system. In those documents the BND agency was described as the NSA's most prolific partner in information gathering.[29] This led to political confrontations, after which the directors of the German intelligence agencies briefed members of the German parliamentary intelligence oversight committee on July 25, 2013. They declared that XKeyscore has been used by the BND since 2007 and that the BfV has been using a test version since 2012. The directors also explained that the program is not for collecting data, but rather only for the analysis of collected data.[30]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Sweden&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;As part of the UKUSA Agreement, a secret treaty was signed in 1954 by Sweden with the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand (called the Five Eyes) for the purpose of intelligence collaboration and data sharing.[31] According to documents leaked by Snowden, the National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA) has been granted access to XKeyscore.[32]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Denmark&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;In an ongoing scandal, XKeyscore was part of the main package and the reason a new datacenter was needed, built in Sandager . In the 2020s, due to anti-American sentiment causing whistleblowers in the layers of Danish defense, the truth came out about the real usage in Danish state media. NSA gave FE access to their suite of spying software from NSA, in favor of spying on American allies such as Germany's Angela Merkel and Boris Johnson amongst a few in newer times. This deal has been ongoing since the visit to Copenhagen by President Bill Clinton in 1997, facilitated by then Danish Prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen.[3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to whistleblowers from the Danish secret police, and judicial evidence later presented in Danish court, the US has been and still is carrying out a massive spying operation on the western countries in Europe, with Denmark's help.[1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whistleblower itself was later leaked to be then-head of the Danish Intelligence Service, Lars Findsen. Additionally he leaked in court and through evidence presented in court, that there is an ongoing mass-surveillance program by NSA, not just on the American people themselves, but also of the world facilitated through multiple American "private" companies such as IBM and Google. Additionally making usage of high tech tools such as AI packet sniffing, aggressive red hatting, and other IT methods.[2][33]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Japan&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The classified documents leaked by Snowden also indicate that in April 2013, NSA had secretly provided the XKeyscore system to the DFS of Defense Intelligence Headquarters.[34]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;See also&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;List of government surveillance projects&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;PRISM&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Stuxnet – Computer worm reportedly developed by the U.S. and Israel to sabotage Iran's nuclear program&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Traffic analysis – Technique for examining communications patterns, relevant to metadata surveillance&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;File:XKeyscore presentation from 2008.pdf, a redacted presentation about X-Keyscore via The Guardian (UK) via Edward Snowden via U.S. National Security Agency&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Targeted surveillance&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;References&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;list rend="ol"&gt;&lt;item&gt;^ a b Henley, Jon (May 31, 2021).

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Proxmox delivers its software-defined datacenter contender and VMware escape hatch&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;New ‘Datacenter Manager’ manages VMs across multiple sites or clusters&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open source virtualization project Proxmox has delivered the first full and stable release of its Datacenter Manager product, making it a more viable alternative as a private cloud platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proxmox’s Virtual Environment, a platform that hosts virtual machines and containers, and includes software-defined storage and networking, has become increasingly prominent in recent years as Broadcom’s VMware business unit focused on large enterprise customers. Proxmox has become a popular alternative to VMware for organizations whose needs don’t go far beyond basic server virtualization. Even one VMware partner The Register recently spoke to decided Proxmox was sufficient for some internal workloads it felt did not need all the features of VMware’s Cloud Foundation platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proxmox, however, has bigger ambitions and on Thursday started chasing them by releasing a new product called Datacenter Manager that offers centralized management for multiple, independent Proxmox-based environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As explained in Proxmox’s launch announcement, the product “… provides an aggregated view of all your connected nodes and clusters and is designed to manage complex and distributed infrastructures, from local installations to globally scaled data centers.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Datacenter Manager also enables migration of VMs across clusters without having to manually reconfigure networks. That’s a trick VMware invented decades ago and has since become table stakes for serious private cloud players.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Platform9 pushes swing capacity workaround for VMware migrants&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Veeam debuts its Proxmox backup tool – and reveals outfit using it to quit VMware&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPU-accelerated VMs on Proxmox, XCP-ng? Here's what you need to know&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Meet the Proxinator: A hyperbox that puts SATA at the heart of VMware migrations&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other features also help to make Proxmox a contender, such as VM fleet management tools that allow admins to identify VMs that need patches and arrange installation, lifecycle management for VMs, and a dashboard that allows a view of all hosts and the workloads they host – and their status.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bardia Khalilifar, CEO of Australian Proxmox service provider Multiportal.io, welcomed the debut of Datacenter Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I think it is fantastic that Proxmox has released this," he said, as it will help enable service providers to manage multiple Proxmox rigs on behalf of their clients. He said the product "opens the floodgates" for wider Proxmox adoption, especially across multiple datacenters and for use in private clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH, the entity that develops Proxmox products and makes them available under the GNU AGPLv3 license, wrote Datacenter Manager in Rust. That’s no guarantee of strong security, but it’s a decent start. Proxmox’s developers based the platform on Debian Trixie 13.2, using version 6.17 of the Linux kernel, and with ZFS 2.3.4 included.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Datacenter Manager downloads are available here. If you take it for a spin, let us know how it goes! ®&lt;/p&gt;
