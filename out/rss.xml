  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sex trafficking on Meta platforms was both difficult to report and widely tolerated, according to a court filing unsealed Friday. In a plaintiffs’ brief filed as part of a major lawsuit against four social media companies, Instagram’s former head of safety and well-being Vaishnavi Jayakumar testified that when she joined Meta in 2020 she was shocked to learn that the company had a “17x” strike policy for accounts that reportedly engaged in the “trafficking of humans for sex.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You could incur 16 violations for prostitution and sexual solicitation, and upon the 17th violation, your account would be suspended,” Jayakumar reportedly testified, adding that “by any measure across the industry, [it was] a very, very high strike threshold.” The plaintiffs claim that this testimony is corroborated by internal company documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The brief, filed by plaintiffs in the Northern District of California, alleges that Meta was aware of serious harms on its platform and engaged in a broad pattern of deceit to downplay risks to young users. According to the brief, Meta was aware that millions of adult strangers were contacting minors on its sites; that its products exacerbated mental health issues in teens; and that content related to eating disorders, suicide, and child sexual abuse was frequently detected, yet rarely removed. According to the brief, the company failed to disclose these harms to the public or to Congress, and refused to implement safety fixes that could have protected young users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Meta has designed social media products and platforms that it is aware are addictive to kids, and they’re aware that those addictions lead to a whole host of serious mental health issues,” says Previn Warren, the co-lead attorney for the plaintiffs in the case. “Like tobacco, this is a situation where there are dangerous products that were marketed to kids,” Warren adds. “They did it anyway, because more usage meant more profits for the company.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following allegations against Meta come from the brief filed in an unprecedented multidistrict litigation. More than 1,800 plaintiffs—including children and parents, school districts, and state attorneys general—have joined together in a suit alleging that the parent companies behind Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and YouTube “relentlessly pursued a strategy of growth at all costs, recklessly ignoring the impact of their products on children’s mental and physical health,” according to their master complaint. The newly unsealed allegations about Meta are just one small part of the sprawling suit. (TIME filed a motion to intervene in the case to ensure public access to court records; the motion was denied.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs’ brief, first reported by TIME, purports to be based on sworn depositions of current and former Meta executives, internal communications, and company research and presentations obtained during the lawsuit’s discovery process. It includes quotes and excerpts from thousands of pages of testimony and internal company documents. TIME was not able to independently view the underlying testimony or research quoted in the brief, since those documents remain under seal.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;But the brief still paints a damning picture of the company’s internal research and deliberations about issues that have long plagued its platforms. Plaintiffs claim that since 2017, Meta has aggressively pursued young users, even as its internal research suggested its social media products could be addictive and dangerous to kids. Meta employees proposed multiple ways to mitigate these harms, according to the brief, but were repeatedly blocked by executives who feared that new safety features would hamper teen engagement or user growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We strongly disagree with these allegations, which rely on cherry-picked quotes and misinformed opinions in an attempt to present a deliberately misleading picture," a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to TIME. "The full record will show that for over a decade, we have listened to parents, researched issues that matter most, and made real changes to protect teens – like introducing Teen Accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with controls to manage their teens’ experiences. We’re proud of the progress we’ve made and we stand by our record.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the years since the lawsuit was filed, Meta has implemented new safety features designed to address some of the problems described by plaintiffs. In 2024, Meta unveiled Instagram Teen Accounts, which defaults any user between 13 and 18 into an account that is automatically private, limits sensitive content, turns off notifications at night, and doesn’t allow messaging from unconnected adults. “We know parents are worried about their teens having unsafe or inappropriate experiences online, and that’s why we’ve significantly reimagined the Instagram experience for tens of millions of teens with new Teen Accounts,” a Meta spokeswoman told TIME in June. “These accounts provide teens with built-in protections to automatically limit who’s contacting them and the content they’re seeing, and teens under 16 need a parent’s permission to change those settings. We also give parents oversight over their teens’ use of Instagram, with ways to see who their teens are chatting with and block them from using the app for more than 15 minutes a day, or for certain periods of time, like during school or at night.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And yet the plaintiffs’ brief suggests that Meta resisted safety changes like these for years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The brief quotes testimony from Brian Boland, Meta’s former vice president of partnerships who worked at the company for 11 years and resigned in 2020. “My feeling then and my feeling now is that they don’t meaningfully care about user safety,” he allegedly said. “It’s not something that they spend a lot of time on. It’s not something they think about. And I really think they don’t care.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After the plaintiffs’ brief was unsealed late Friday night, Meta did not immediately respond to TIME’s requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some of the most notable allegations from the plaintiffs’ omnibus brief:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Allegation: Meta had a high threshold for "sex trafficking" content—and no way to report child sexual content&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite Instagram’s “zero tolerance” policy for child sexual abuse material, the platform did not offer users a simple way to report child sexual abuse content, according to the brief. Plaintiffs allege that Jayakumar raised the issue multiple times when she joined Meta in 2020, but was told it would be too difficult to address. Yet Instagram allowed users to easily report far less serious violations, like “spam,” “intellectual property violation” and “promotion of firearms,” according to plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jayakumar was even more shocked to learn that Instagram had a disturbingly high tolerance for sex trafficking on the platform. According to the brief, she testified that Meta had a “17x” strike policy for accounts that reportedly engaged in the “trafficking of humans for sex,” meaning it would take at least 16 reports for an account to be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Meta never told parents, the public, or the Districts that it doesn’t delete accounts that have engaged over fifteen times in sex trafficking,” the plaintiffs wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Meta spokesperson disputed this allegation to TIME, saying the company has for years removed accounts immediately if it suspects them of human trafficking or exploitation and has made it easier over time for users to report content that violates child-exploitation policies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Allegation: Meta "lied to Congress" about its knowledge of harms on the platform&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For years, plaintiffs allege, Meta’s internal research had found that teenagers who frequently use Instagram and Facebook have higher rates of anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In late 2019, according to the brief, Meta designed a “deactivation study,” which found that users who stopped using Facebook and Instagram for a week showed lower rates of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Meta halted the study and did not publicly disclose the results, stating that the research study was biased by the “existing media narratives around the company.” (A Meta spokesperson told TIME that the study was initially conceived as a pair of one-weeks pilots, and researchers declined to continue it because it found that the only reductions in feelings of depression, anxiety, and loneliness were among people who already believed Facebook was bad for them.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least one Meta employee was uncomfortable with the implications of this decision: “If the results are bad and we don’t publish and they leak,” this employee wrote, according to the brief, “is it going to look like tobacco companies doing research and knowing cigs were bad and then keeping that info to themselves?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Indeed, in December 2020, when the Senate Judiciary Committee asked the company in a set of written questions whether it was “able to determine whether increased use of its platform among teenage girls has any correlation with increased signs of depression” and “increased signs of anxiety,” the company offered only a one-word answer: “No.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To the plaintiffs in the case, the implication is clear: “The company never publicly disclosed the results of its deactivation study. Instead, Meta lied to Congress about what it knew.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Allegation: The company knew Instagram was letting adult strangers connect with teenagers&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For years Instagram has had a well-documented problem of adults harassing teens. Around 2019, company researchers recommended making all teen accounts private by default in order to prevent adult strangers from connecting with kids, according to the plaintiffs’ brief. Instead of implementing this recommendation, Meta asked its growth team to study the potential impact of making all teen accounts private. The growth team was pessimistic, according to the brief, and responded that the change would likely reduce engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 2020, the growth team had determined that a private-by-default setting would result in a loss of 1.5 million monthly active teens a year on Instagram. The plaintiffs’ brief quotes an unnamed employee as saying: “taking away unwanted interactions… is likely to lead to a potentially untenable problem with engagement and growth.” Over the next several months, plaintiffs allege, Meta’s policy, legal, communications, privacy, and well-being teams all recommended making teen accounts private by default, arguing that the switch “will increase teen safety” and was in line with expectations from users, parents, and regulators. But Meta did not launch the feature that year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Safety researchers were dismayed, according to excerpts of an internal conversation quoted in the filing. One allegedly grumbled: “Isn’t safety the whole point of this team?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Meta knew that placing teens into a default-private setting would have eliminated 5.4 million unwanted interactions a day,” the plaintiffs wrote. Still, Meta didn’t make the fix. Instead, inappropriate interactions between adults and kids on Instagram skyrocketed to 38 times that on Facebook Messenger, according to the brief. The launch of Instagram Reels allegedly compounded the problem. It allowed young teenagers to broadcast short videos to a wide audience, including adult strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read More: The AG Putting Big Tech On Trial.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An internal 2022 audit allegedly found that Instagram’s Accounts You May Follow feature recommended 1.4 million potentially inappropriate adults to teenage users in a single day. By 2023, according to the plaintiffs, Meta knew that they were recommending minors to potentially suspicious adults and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until 2024 that Meta rolled out default privacy settings to all teen accounts. In the four years it took the company to implement their own safety recommendations, teens experienced billions of unwanted interactions with strangers online. Inappropriate encounters between teens and adults were common enough, according to the brief, that the company had an acronym for them: “IIC,” or “inappropriate interactions with children.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Meta spokesperson said the company has defaulted teens under 16 to private accounts since 2021, began defaulting teens under 18 into private accounts with the introduction of its Teen Accounts program, and has taken steps to protect users from online predators.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Allegation: Meta aggressively targeted young users&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta feared young users would abandon Facebook and Instagram for their competitors. Acquiring and keeping young users became a central business goal. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg suggested that “teen time spent be our top goal of 2017,” according to a company executive quoted in the brief. That has remained the case, plaintiffs allege; internal company documents from 2024 stated that “acquiring new teen users is mission critical to the success of Instagram.” (A Meta spokesperson said time spent on its platforms is not currently a company goal.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta launched a campaign to connect with school districts and paid organizations like the National Parent Teacher Association and Scholastic to conduct outreach to schools and families. Meanwhile, according to the brief, Meta used location data to push notifications to students in “school blasts,” presumably as part of an attempt to increase youth engagement during the school day. As one employee allegedly put it: “One of the things we need to optimize for is sneaking a look at your phone under your desk in the middle of Chemistry :)”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Though Meta aggressively pursued young users, it may not have known exactly how old those new users were. Whistleblower Jason Sattizahn recently testified to Congress that Meta does not reliably know the age of its users. (Meta pushed back on Sattizahn’s testimony, saying in a statement to NBC that his claims were “nonsense” and “based on selectively leaked internal documents that were picked specifically to craft a false narrative.”) In 2022, according to the plaintiffs’ brief, there were 216 million users on Meta platforms whose age was “unknown.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Federal law requires social media platforms to observe various data-privacy safeguards for users under 13, and Meta policy states that users under 13 are not allowed on its platforms. Yet the plaintiffs’ court filing claims Meta knew that children under 13 used the company’s products anyway. Internal research cited in the brief suggested there were 4 million users under 13 on Instagram in 2015; by 2018, the plaintiffs claim, Meta knew that roughly 40% of children aged 9 to 12 said they used Instagram daily.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs allege that this was a deliberate business strategy. The brief describes a coordinated effort to acquire young users that included studying the psychology and digital behavior of “tweens” and exploring new products designed for “users as young as 5-10.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Internally, some employees expressed disgust at the attempt to target preteens. “Oh good, we’re going after &amp;lt;13 year olds now?” one wrote, according to the brief. “Zuck has been talking about that for a while...targeting 11 year olds feels like tobacco companies a couple decades ago (and today). Like we’re seriously saying ‘we have to hook them young’ here.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Allegation: Meta's executives initially shelved efforts to make Instagram less toxic for teens&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To combat toxic “social comparison,” in 2019 Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri announced a new product feature that would “hide” likes on posts. Meta researchers had determined that hiding likes would make users “significantly less likely to feel worse about themselves,” according to the plaintiffs’ brief. The initiative was code-named Project Daisy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But after a series of tests, Meta backtracked on Project Daisy. It determined the feature was “pretty negative to FB metrics,” including ad revenue, according to the plaintiffs’ brief, which quotes an unnamed employee on the growth team insisting: “It’s a social comparison app, fucking get used to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A similar debate took place over the app’s beauty filters. Plaintiffs claim that an internal review concluded beauty filters exacerbated the “risk and maintenance of several mental health concerns, including body dissatisfaction, eating disorders, and body dysmorphic disorder,” and that Meta knew that “children are particularly vulnerable.” Meta banned beauty filters in 2019, only to roll them back out the following year after the company realized that banning beauty filters would have a “negative growth impact,” according to the plaintiffs’ brief.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other company researchers allegedly built an AI “classifier” to identify content that would lead to negative appearance comparison, so that Meta could avoid recommending it to vulnerable kids. But Mosseri allegedly killed the project, disappointing developers who “felt like they had a solution” to “a big problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Allegation: Meta doesn't automatically remove harmful content, including self-harm content&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Meta developed AI tools to monitor the platforms for harmful content, the company didn’t automatically delete that content even when it determined with “100% confidence” that it violated Meta’s policies against child sexual-abuse material or eating-disorder content. Meta’s AI classifiers did not automatically delete posts that glorified self-harm unless they were 94% certain they violated platform policy, according to the plaintiffs’ brief. As a result, most of that content remained on the platform, where teenage users often discovered it. In a 2021 internal company survey cited by plaintiffs, more than 8% of respondents aged 13 to 15 reported having seen someone harm themselves, or threaten to do so, on Instagram during the past week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read More: ‘Everything I Learned About Suicide, I Learned On Instagram.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Meta spokesperson said the company reports more child sexual-abuse material than any other service and uses an array of tools to proactively find that content, including photo and video-matching technologies as well as machine learning. The spokesperson said human reviewers assess content flagged before it is deleted to ensure it violates policies, prevent mistakes that could affect users, and maintain the integrity of the company's detection databases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Allegation: Meta knew its products were addictive, but publicly downplayed the harms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The addictive nature of the company’s products wasn’t a secret internally. “Oh my gosh yall IG is a drug,” one of the company’s user-experience researchers allegedly wrote to a colleague. “We’re basically pushers.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta does not officially study addiction to its products, plaintiffs allege; it studies “problematic use.” In 2018, company researchers surveyed 20,000 Facebook users in the U.S. and found that 58% had some level of “problematic use”—55% mild, and 3.1% severe. But when Meta published an account of this research the following year, only the smaller number of users with “severe” problematic use was mentioned. “We estimate (as an upper bound) that 3.1% of Facebook users in the U.S. experience problematic use,” wrote the researchers. The other 55% of users are not mentioned anywhere in the public report.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs allege that Meta’s safety team proposed features designed to lessen addiction, only to see them set aside or watered down. One employee who helped develop a “quiet mode” feature said it was shelved because Meta was concerned that this feature would negatively impact metrics related to growth and usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Around the same time, another user-experience researcher at Instagram allegedly recommended that Meta inform the public about its research findings: “Because our product exploits weaknesses in the human psychology to promote product engagement and time spent,” the researcher wrote, Meta needed to “alert people to the effect that the product has on their brain.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meta did not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This story has been updated to reflect additional comments from Meta.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that MacOS Tahoe can generate and use secure-enclave backed SSH keys! This replaces projects like https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretive&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is a shared library &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib&lt;/code&gt; that traditionally has been used to add smartcard support
to ssh by implementing &lt;code&gt;PKCS11Provider&lt;/code&gt; interface. However since recently it also implements &lt;code&gt;SecurityKeyProivder&lt;/code&gt;
which supports loading keys directly from the secure enclave! &lt;code&gt;SecurityKeyProvider&lt;/code&gt; is what is normally used to talk to FIDO2 devices (e.g. &lt;code&gt;libfido2&lt;/code&gt; can be used to talk to your Yubikey). However you can now use it to talk to your Secure Enclave instead!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head class="px-3 py-2"&gt;recording.mov&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See &lt;code&gt;man sc_auth&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;man ssh-keychain&lt;/code&gt; for all the options&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To create a Secure Enclave backed key that requires biometrics, run the following command and press TouchID:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;% sc_auth create-ctk-identity -l ssh -k p-256-ne -t bio
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can confirm that the key was create with the &lt;code&gt;list-ctk-identities&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;arian@Mac ssh-keychain % sc_auth  list-ctk-identities       
Key Type Public Key Hash                          Prot Label Common Name Email Address Valid To        Valid 
p-256-ne A71277F0BC5825A7B3576D014F31282A866EF3BC bio  ssh   ssh                       23.11.26, 17:09 YES
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also supports listing the ssh key fingerprints instead:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;% sc_auth  list-ctk-identities -t ssh
Key Type Public Key Hash                                    Prot Label Common Name Email Address Valid To        Valid

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keys can be deleted with&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;% sc_auth delete-ctk-identity -h &amp;lt;Public Key Hash&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can "download" the public / private keypair from the secure enclave using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;% ssh-keygen -w /usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib -K -N ""
Enter PIN for authenticator: 
You may need to touch your authenticator to authorize key download.

% cat id_ecdsa_sk_rk.pub

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can just use the empty string for PIN. For some reason &lt;code&gt;openssh&lt;/code&gt; always asks for
it even if the authenticator in question does not use a PIN but a biometric.
Note that the "private" key here is just a reference to the FIDO credential. It does
not contain any secret key material. Hence I'm specifiyng &lt;code&gt;-N ""&lt;/code&gt; to skip an encryption
passphrase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now if you copy this public key to your authorized keys file, it should work!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;% ssh-copy-id -i id_ecdsa_sk_rk localhost
% ssh -o SecurityKeyProvider=/usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib localhost
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of downloading the public/private keypair to a file you can also directly make the keys available to &lt;code&gt;ssh-agent&lt;/code&gt;. For this you can use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;% ssh-add -K -S /usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib
Enter PIN for authenticator:

% ssh-copy-id localhost
% ssh -o SecurityKeyProvider=/usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib localhost
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SecurityKeyProvider&lt;/code&gt; can be configured in &lt;code&gt;.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt; but I recommend setting
&lt;code&gt;export SSH_SK_PROVIDER=/usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;.zprofile&lt;/code&gt; instead as
that environment variable gets picked up by &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ssh-add&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ssh-keygen&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means you can just do:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ssh-add -K
ssh my-server
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ssh-keygen -K
ssh -i id_ecdsa_rk_sk my-server
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to ssh into your server&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's also an exportable variant where the private key is encrypted using the secure enclave as opposed to generated on the secure enclave. This is might be considered less secure but is convenient for key backup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;% sc_auth create-ctk-identity -l ssh-exportable -k p-256 -t bio

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Published on 6TH NOVEMBER 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fran Sans is a display font in every sense of the term. It’s an interpretation of the destination displays found on some of the light rail vehicles that service the city of San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I say some because destination displays aren’t consistently used across the city’s transit system. In fact, SF has an unusually high number of independent public transit agencies. Unlike New York, Chicago or L.A., which each have one, maybe two, San Francisco and the greater Bay Area have over two dozen. Each agency, with its own models of buses and trains, use different destination displays, creating an eclectic patchwork of typography across the city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among them, one display in particular has always stood out to me: the LCD panel displays inside Muni’s Breda Light Rail Vehicles. I remember first noticing them on a Saturday in October on the N-Judah, heading to the Outer Sunset for a shrimp hoagie. This context is important, as anyone who’s spent an October weekend in SF knows this is the optimal vibe to really take in the beauty of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What caught my eye was how the displays look mechanical and yet distinctly personal. Constructed on a 3×5 grid, the characters are made up of geometric modules: squares, quarter-circles, and angled forms. Combined, these modules create imperfect, almost primitive letterforms, revealing a utility and charm that feels distinctly like the San Francisco I’ve come to know.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This balance of utility and charm seems to show up everywhere in San Francisco and its history. The Golden Gate’s “International Orange” started as nothing more than a rust-proof primer, yet is now the city’s defining colour. The Painted Ladies became multicoloured icons after the 1960s Colourist movement covered decades of grey paint. Even the steepness of the streets was once an oversight in city planning but has since been romanticised in films and on postcards. So perhaps it is unsurprising that I would find this same utility and charm in a place as small and functional as a train sign.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To learn more about these displays, I visited the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency’s (SFMTA) Electronics Shop at Balboa Park. There, technician Armando Lumbad had set up one of the signs. They each feature one large LCD panel which displays the line name, and twenty-four smaller ones to display the destination. The loose spacing of the letters and fluorescent backlighting gives the sign a raw, analogue quality. Modern LED dot-matrix displays are far more efficient and flexible, but to me, they lack the awkwardness that makes these Breda signs so delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Armando showed me how the signs work. He handed me a printed matrix table listing every line and destination, each paired with a three-digit code. On route, train operators punch the code into a control panel at the back of the display, and the LCD blocks light on specific segments of the grid to build each letter. I picked code 119, and Armando entered it for me. A few seconds later the panels revealed my own stop: the N-Judah at Church &amp;amp; Duboce. There in the workshop, devoid of the context of the trains and the commute, the display looked almost monolithic, or sculptural, and I have since fantasised whether it would be possible to ship one of these home to Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Looking inside of the display, I found labels identifying the make and model. The signs were designed and manufactured by Trans-Lite, Inc., a company based in Milford, Connecticut that specialised in transport signage from 1959 until its acquisition by the Nordic firm Teknoware in 2012. After lots of amateur detective work, and with the help from an anonymous Reddit user in a Connecticut community group, I was connected with Gary Wallberg, Senior Engineer at Trans-Lite and the person responsible for the design of these very signs back in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learning that the alphabet came from an engineer really explains its temperament and why I was drawn to it in the first place. The signs were designed for sufficiency: fixed segments, fixed grid, and no extras. Characters were created only as destinations required them, while other characters, like the Q, X, and much of the punctuation, were never programmed into the signs. In reducing everything to its bare essentials, somehow character emerged, and it’s what inspired me to design Fran Sans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I shared some initial drawings with Dave Foster of Foster Type who encouraged me to get the font software Glyphs and turn it into my first working font. From there, I broke down the anatomy of the letters into modules, then used them like Lego to build out a full set: uppercase A–Z, numerals, core punctuation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some glyphs remain unsolved in this first version, for example the standard @ symbol refuses to squeeze politely into the 3×5 logic. Lowercase remains a question for the future, and would likely mean reconsidering the grid. But, as with the displays themselves, I am judging Fran Sans as sufficient for now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting up close to these signs, you’ll notice Fran Sans’ gridlines are simplified even from its real‑life muse, but my hope is that its character remains. Specifically: the N and the zero, where the unusually thick diagonals close in on the counters; and the Z and 7, whose diagonals can feel uncomfortably thin. I’ve also noticed the centre of the M can scale strangely and read like an H at small sizes, but in fairness, this type was never designed for the kind of technical detail so many monospaced fonts aim for. Throughout the process I tried to protect these unorthodox moments, because to me, they determined the success of this interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fran Sans comes in three styles: Solid, Tile, and Panel, each building in visual complexity. The decision to include variations, particularly the Solid style, was inspired by my time working at Christopher Doyle &amp;amp; Co. There, we worked with Bell Shakespeare, Australia’s national theatre company dedicated to the works of William Shakespeare. The equity of the Bell Shakespeare brand lies in its typography, which is a beautiful custom typeface called Hotspur, designed and produced by none other than Dave Foster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often, brand fonts are chosen or designed to convey a single feeling. Maybe it’s warmth and friendliness, or a sense of tech and innovation. But what I’ve always loved about the Bell typeface is how one weight could serve both Shakespeare’s comedies and tragedies, simply by shifting scale, spacing, or alignment. Hotspur has the gravity to carry the darkness of Titus Andronicus and the roundness to convey the humour of Much Ado About Nothing. And while Fran Sans Solid is technically no Hotspur, I wanted it to share that same versatility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further inspiration for Fran Sans came from the Letterform Archive, the world’s leading typography archive, based in San Francisco. Librarian and archivist Kate Long Stellar thoughtfully curated a research visit filled with modular typography spanning most of the past century. On the table were two pieces that had a significant impact on Fran Sans and are now personal must-sees at the archive. First, Joan Trochut’s Tipo Veloz “Fast Type” (1942) was created during the Second World War when resources were scarce. Tipo Veloz gave printers the ability to draw with type, rearranging modular pieces to form letters, ornaments and even illustrations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, Zuzana Licko’s process work for Lo-Res (1985), an Emigre typeface, opened new ways of thinking about how ideas move between the physical and the digital and then back again. Seeing how Lo-Res was documented through iterations and variations gave the typeface a depth and richness that changed my understanding of how fonts are built. At some point I want to explore physical applications for Fran Sans out of respect for its origins, since it is impossible to fully capture the display’s charm on screen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back at the SFMTA, Armando told me the Breda vehicles are being replaced, and with them their destination displays will be swapped for newer LED dot-matrix units that are more efficient and easier to maintain. By the end of 2025 the signs that inspired Fran Sans will disappear from the city, taking with them a small but distinctive part of the city’s voice. That feels like a real loss. San Francisco is always reinventing itself, yet its charm lies in how much of its history still shows through. My hope is that Fran Sans can inspire a deeper appreciation for the imperfections that give our lives and our cities character. Life is so rich when ease and efficiency are not the measure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;"Good engineering management" is a fad&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I get older, I increasingly think about whether I’m spending my time the right way to advance my career and my life. This is also a question that your company asks about you every performance cycle: is this engineering manager spending their time effectively to advance the company or their organization?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confusingly, in my experience, answering these nominally similar questions has surprisingly little in common. This piece spends some time exploring both questions in the particularly odd moment we live in today, where managers are being told they’ve spent the last decade doing the wrong things, and need to engage with a new model of engineering management in order to be valued by the latest iteration of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’d be more interested in a video version of this, here is the recording of a practice run I gave for a talk centered on these same ideas (slides from talk).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Good leadership is a fad&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I started my software career at Yahoo in the late 2000s, I had two 1:1s with my manager over the course of two years. The first one came a few months after I started, and he mostly asked me about a colleague’s work quality. The second came when I gave notice that I was leaving to join Digg. A modern evaluation of this manager would be scathing, but his management style closely resembled that of the team leader in The Soul of A New Machine: identifying an important opportunity for the team, and navigating the broader organization that might impede progress towards that goal. He was, in the context we were working in, an effective manager.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compare that leadership style to the expectations of the 2010s, where attracting, retaining, and motivating engineers was emphasized as the most important leadership criteria in many organizations. This made sense in the era of hypergrowth, where budgets were uncapped and many companies viewed hiring strong engineers as their constraint on growth. This was an era where managers were explicitly told to stop writing software as the first step of their transition into management, and it was good advice! Looking back we can argue it was bad guidance by today’s standards, but it aligned the managers with the leadership expectations of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then think about our current era, that started in late 2022, where higher interest rates killed zero-interest-rate-policy (ZIRP) and productized large language models are positioned as killing deep Engineering organizations. We’ve flattened Engineering organizations where many roles that previously focused on coordination are now expected to be hands-on keyboard, working deep in the details. Once again, the best managers of the prior era–who did exactly what the industry asked them to do–are now reframed as bureaucrats rather than integral leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In each of these transitions, the business environment shifted, leading to a new formulation of ideal leadership. That makes a lot of sense: of course we want leaders to fit the necessary patterns of today. Where things get weird is that in each case a morality tale was subsequently superimposed on top of the transition:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In the 2010s, the morality tale was that it was all about empowering engineers as a fundamental good. Sure, I can get excited for that, but I don’t really believe that narrative: it happened because hiring was competitive.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In the 2020s, the morality tale is that bureaucratic middle management have made organizations stale and inefficient. The lack of experts has crippled organizational efficiency. Once again, I can get behind that–there’s truth here–but the much larger drivers aren’t about morality, it’s about ZIRP-ending and optimism about productivity gains from AI tooling.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The conclusion here is clear: the industry will want different things from you as it evolves, and it will tell you that each of those shifts is because of some complex moral change, but it’s pretty much always about business realities changing. If you take any current morality tale as true, then you’re setting yourself up to be severely out of position when the industry shifts again in a few years, because “good leadership” is just a fad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this summer, I also gave a presentation at the YCombinator CTO summit on this specific topic of the evolution of engineering management. You can watch a recorded practice run of that talk on YouTube as well, and see the slides.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Self-development across leadership fads&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you accept the argument that the specifically desired leadership skills of today are the result of fads that frequently shift, then it leads to an important followup question: what are the right skills to develop in to be effective today and to be impactful across fads?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having been and worked with engineering managers for some time, I think there are eight foundational engineering management skills, which I want to personally group into two clusters: core skills that are essential to operate in all roles (including entry-level management roles), and growth skills whose presence–or absence–determines how far you can go in your career.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The core skills are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Execution: lead team to deliver expected tangible and intangible work. Fundamentally, management is about getting things done, and you’ll neither get an opportunity to begin managing, nor stay long as a manager, if your teams don’t execute.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Examples: ship projects, manage on-call rotation, sprint planning, manage incidents&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Team: shape the team and the environment such that they succeed. This is not working for the team, nor is it working for your leadership, it is finding the balance between the two that works for both.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Examples: hiring, coaching, performance management, advocate with your management&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ownership: navigate reality to make consistent progress, even when reality is difficult Finding a way to get things done, rather than finding a way that it not getting done is someone else’s fault.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Examples: doing hard things, showing up when it’s uncomfortable, being accountable despite systemic issues&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Alignment: build shared understanding across leadership, stakeholders, your team, and the problem space. Finding a realistic plan that meets the moment, without surprising or being surprised by those around you.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Examples: document and share top problems, and updates during crises&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The growth skills are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Taste: exercise discerning judgment about what “good” looks like—technically, in business terms, and in process/strategy. Taste is a broadchurch, and my experience is that broad taste is an somewhat universal criteria for truly senior roles. In some ways, taste is a prerequisite to Amazon’s Are Right, A Lot.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Examples: refine proposed product concept, avoid high-risk rewrite, find usability issues in team’s work&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Clarity: your team, stakeholders, and leadership know what you’re doing and why, and agree that it makes sense. In particular, they understand how you are overcoming your biggest problems. So clarity is not, “Struggling with scalability issues” but instead “Sharding the user logins database in a new cluster to reduce load.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Examples: identify levers to progress, create plan to exit a crisis, show progress on implementing that plan&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Navigating ambiguity: work from complex problem to opinionated, viable approach. If you’re given an extremely messy, open-ended problem, can you still find a way to make progress? (I’ve written previously about this topic.)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Examples: launching a new business line, improving developer experience, going from 1 to N cloud regions&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Working across timescales: ensure your areas of responsibility make progress across both the short and long term. There are many ways to appear successful by cutting corners today, that end in disaster tomorrow. Success requires understanding, and being accountable for, how different timescales interact.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Examples: have an explicit destination, ensure short-term work steers towards it, be long-term rigid and short-term flexible&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having spent a fair amount of time pressure testing these, I’m pretty sure most effective managers, and manager archetypes, can be fit into these boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Self-assessing on these skills&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s no perfect way to measure anything complex, but here are some thinking questions for you to spend time with as you assess where you stand on each of these skills:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Execution&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;When did your team last have friction delivering work? Is that a recurring issue?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;What’s something hard you shipped that went really, really well?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;When were you last pulled onto solving a time-sensitive, executive-visible project?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Team&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Who was the last strong performer you hired?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Have you retained your strongest performers?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;What strong performers want to join your team?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Which peers consider your team highly effective?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;When did an executive describe your team as exceptional?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ownership&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;When did you or your team overcome the odds to deliver something important? (Would your stakeholders agree?)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;What’s the last difficult problem you solved that stayed solved (rather than reoccurring)?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;When did you last solve the problem first before addressing cross-team gaps?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Alignment&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;When was the last time you were surprised by a stakeholder? What could you do to prevent that reoccuring?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;How does a new stakeholder understand your prioritization tradeoffs (incl rationale)?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;When did you last disappoint a stakeholder without damaging your relationship?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;What stakeholders would join your company because they trust you?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Taste&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;What’s a recent decision that is meaningfully better because you were present?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;If your product counterpart left, what decisions would you struggle to make?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Where’s a subtle clarification that significantly changed a design or launch?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;How have you inflected team’s outcomes by seeing around corners?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Clarity&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;What’s a difficult trade-off you recently helped your team make?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;How could you enable them to make that same trade-off without your direct participation?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;What’s a recent decision you made that was undone? How?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Navigating ambiguity&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;What problem have you worked on that was stuck before assisted, and unstuck afterwards?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;How did you unstick it?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Do senior leaders bring ambiguous problems to you? Why?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Working across timescales&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;What’s a recent trade off you made between short and long-term priorities?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;How do you inform these tradeoffs across timescales?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;What long-term goals are you protecting at significant short-term cost?&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most of these questions stand on their own, but it’s worth briefly explaining the “Have you ever been pulled into a SpecificSortOfProject by an executive?” questions. My experience is that in most companies, executives will try to poach you onto their most important problems that correspond to your strengths. So if they’re never attempting to pull you in then either you’re not considered as particularly strong on that dimensions, or you’re already very saturated with other work such that it doesn’t seem possible to pull you in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Are “core skills” the same over time?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While those groupings of “core” and “growth” skills are obvious groupings to me, what I came to appreciate while writing this is that some skills swap between core to growth as the fads evolve. Where execution is a foundational skill today, it was less of a core skill in the hypergrowth era, and even less in the investor era.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the fundamentally tricky part of succeeding as an engineering manager across fads: you need a sufficiently broad base across each of these skills to be successful, otherwise you’re very likely to be viewed as a weak manager when the eras unpredictably end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Stay energized to stay engaged&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “Manage your priorities and energy” chapter in The Engineering Executive’s Primer captures an important reality that took me too long to understand: the perfect allocation of work is not the mathematically ideal allocation that maximizes impact. Instead, it’s the balance between that mathematical ideal and doing things that energize you enough to stay motivated over the long haul. If you’re someone who loves writing software, that might involve writing a bit more than helpful to your team. If you’re someone who loves streamlining an organization, it might be improving a friction-filled process that is a personal affront, even if it’s not causing that much overall inefficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Forty-year career&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly to the question of prioritizing activities to stay energized, there’s also understanding where you are in your career, an idea I explored in A forty-year career.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For each role, you have the chance to prioritize across different dimensions like pace, people, prestige, profit, or learning. There’s no “right decision,” and there are always tradeoffs. The decisions you make early in your career will compound over the following forty years. You also have to operate within the constraints of your life today and your possible lives tomorrow. Early in my career, I had few responsibilities to others, and had the opportunity to work extremely hard at places like Uber. Today, with more family responsibilities, I am unwilling to make the tradeoffs to consistently work that way, which has real implications on how I think about which roles to prioritize over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognizing these tradeoffs, and making them deliberately, is one of the highest value things you can do to shape your career. Most importantly, it’s extremely hard to have a career at all if you don’t think about these dimensions and have a healthy amount of self-awareness to understand the tradeoffs that will allow you to stay engaged over half a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Giving the Jakks Atari Paddle a Spin&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some things I like to talk about on this blog are âpaddleâ games that use a potentiometer to control the player position, and plug-and-play consoles. Oh, and the Atari 2600. Well, it just so happens that Jakks Pacific in 2004 released something that combines both of them: the Atari Paddle. Itâs like they had this blog in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Hardware&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Atari 2600 had a few different types of controllers used with it. The four-way joystick is the most famous, but second to that are probably the paddles. After all, this was an era where Pong could still be a selling point for your game; well, if you dressed it up and called it Video Olympics, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might notice a big difference from the real Atari paddles, though. Not only are there a few more buttons and switches, but thereâs only one! The Atari paddles actually came in pairs you plugged in both to the controller port; paddle games were very much multi-player focused. And yet, when Jakks put out the Atari Paddle, they had both one-player and two-player versions. And I got the one player.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this is mostly fine, it has some interesting implications. For example, in Street Racer above, the left player mostly sits there getting into car crashes. For Pong, a game that they included in addition to Video Olympics, they had to implement a CPU player.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So itâs pretty clear that this thing is not running the original Atari 2600 games. Take a look at the other arcade game included, Warlords, and youâll also realize that this isnât running Atari 2600 hardware at all. There may be a lot of magic in modern 2600 homebrew, but the console just canât put out pixels that small.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;So, what is it?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2004, Atari put out the Atari Flashback 1, designed by Legacy Engineering. Well, they didnât call it the Atari Flashback 1, just the Flashback. Surprisingly for something that looked like an Atari 7800, this machine was based on the ubiquitous NES-on-a-chip (âNOACâ) hardware. Thatâs right; if you can extract the ROMs, you can play their games on, say, a Twin Famicom. Itâs particularly obvious in Yarâs Revenge, with its colorful neutral zone. Hereâs a screenshot I took from the Atari 2600:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And hereâs one from the NOAC port. Notice the NES can not display as many simultaneous colors on a single screen as the Atari 2600; the one advantage of this ancient technology, so the neutral zone is much less varied in color. (However, in motion, aggressive palette-cycling makes this less obvious)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So a lot of people have assumed that the Atari Paddle is also based on NOAC hardware. After all, the NES did have a paddle controller (used for Arkanoid), so thatâs no obstacle. And Warlords in particular does really look like an NES game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But itâs worth noting that this device was made by an entirely different team than the Flashback console; the Flashback was designed by Legacy Engineering, and the Atari Paddle by Digital Eclipse Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But thereâs one other thing that really blows the NOAC theory out of the water. The game select screen. Sorry, youâre just not getting that many colors or detail on Famiclone hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could it be one of the enhanced V.R. Technology NOACs? They did substantially expand the capabilities of the NES architecture. Well, you can actually read their datasheets today, and judging by the dates on them, theyâre from mid-2005 at the earliest; it seems unlikely theyâd be available in time for the Atari Paddleâs release a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, usually Iâd go to MAME and just explain to you what someone there already figured out. But hereâs a surprise: MAME doesnât actually have the Atari Paddle! At least, I couldnât find it. These things are reverse engineered by people, so itâs not surprising that they havenât gotten 100% yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Should we crack it open?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you were expecting anything other than unlabeled epoxy blobs, I donât know what to tell you. This is 2004. Interestingly, unlike some of the other plug and plays Iâve taken apart, this doesnât seem to have any possibility of using a ROM chip either; I guess because of the small size of the PCB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didnât really do a great job maneuvering the PCB to show the back, but the only interesting thing worth noting is the label EL-555A1 with a datecode of 2004.05.08, and that weird sticking-upward PCB in the spot for a DIP chip, labeled EL-555C1. Iâm not sure what this is; an analog-to-digital converter for the paddle, perhaps? Though if you look at the pads on the other side, they seem to go to a missing transistor Q1 and the larger blob. It must do something. If you have the capability to decap these chips, then I may be up for sacrificing this little toy for the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Internet archaeology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The AtariAge Forum, where the Atari experts hang out, has discussed the paddle before. They seem to like the paddle for the cheap toy it is, but the most interesting comment is from user onmode-ky.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;FYI, the system was programmed by Jeff Vavasourâs team at Digital Eclipse Vancouver, using what was described as âpartial emulation.â The underlying hardware seems to have been a Winbond W55x-family microcontroller, which is 65C816-compatible. Years later, after the closure of Digital Eclipse Vancouver, Vavasourâs current Code Mystics studio would develop the first Jakks Pacific plug-n-play game system running entirely via software emulation, their 2011 Taito (âRetro Arcade featuring Space Invadersâ) system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iâm not sure what âpartial emulationâ means. Perhaps some of the 6502 code from the original games was reused? (The 65C816 is backwards compatible) But the Atari 2600âs graphics system is so different from anything else that I have to assume only a small part of the logic could possibly be shared. Still, it sounds plausible enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taking a look at MAME, I found one Winbond-made SoC that used a 65C816 CPU. The âtrkfldchâ core emulates a Winbond BAx-family chipset, used by Konami for the 2007 Track and Field TV Challenge plug-and-play game. I thought about getting one, but itâs one of those floor mat things and it sounded like exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is probably about as far as Iâll get in figuring out whatâs running in this thing without decapping or other more invasive forms of research, unfortunately. Instead, letâs just play some more games.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Lineup&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These screenshots of the menu screen are really muddy, arenât they? That just seems to be how it looks; my guess is the composite encoder here isnât the highest-quality. As for the gameplay, certainly single-player games like Breakout, Super Breakout (different games), Circus Atari, Demons to Diamonds, or Night Driver play how youâd expect, as do Steeplechase and Warlords, which are just stuck in one-player mode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thereâs definitely something odd going on with the rendering of multi-line effects, which are pretty much everywhere on this system. Look at the rendering of the defeated enemies in Demons to Diamonds, for example. These weird patterns seem to be everywhere; in the real game, theyâre skull and crossbones. Theyâre inconsistent on a game-by-game basis, thoughâ the Circus Atari score uses a similar effect and renders fine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is despite the fact that in other games, a high degree of accuracy is made. For example, did you know that Casino on the 2600 was a paddle game? &lt;del&gt;Did you care?&lt;/del&gt; Notice those weird lines on the side; those happen when you call the &lt;code&gt;HMOVE&lt;/code&gt; instruction that loads fine horizontal movement. Theyâre very common in 2600 games and many games donât bother to hide them; you can see them in Demons to Diamonds above too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Night Driver on the 2600 is a first-person racing game that makes its unique perspective by constantly flickering; I canât show you a single screenshot because no single frame renders everything, but try pausing the video below. (Warning: itâs very flickery, and ends with a full-screen color flash. This could cause issues for those with photosensitivity) This effect is recreated faithfully, as are the &lt;code&gt;HMOVE&lt;/code&gt; bars, which you can see during the color flash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One thing you might have noticed about the Atari Paddle is that it seems to be missing a lot of controls. The Atari 2600 didnât just rely on the button on the paddle; it used the many toggles and switches on the console itself to configure the game youâre playing. Well, most of those controls have been moved to software; pressing the large red âmenuâ button brings up a list of commands.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two-player mandatory games are handled different ways. As noted, Street Racer above just gives you a second player who doesnât do anything. Video Olympics (the 2600âs name for Pong) meanwhile seems to give you the same AI from the âarcadeâ version of Pong. Of course, you have a smaller play area, so that will impact difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Must you play Atari today?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Jakks Atari Paddle was released in 2004. Given that the 2600 was released in 1977, and this blog post is being written in 2025, this makes it more or less equivalent to a retro release of the Sega Dreamcast would be today. So thatâs exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall I think the Atari Paddle is about where it should be. If you find one cheap in a bargain bin, it can be fun to play. I think the included 2600 version of Warlords is actually more fun than the included port of the arcade version, and if youâre absolutely desperate for single-player Video Olympics, this might be your only choice. But thereâs no reason to go seeking it out. This, like all of Jakks Pacificâs contemporary releases, is nothing more than a fun novelty. Thatâs all it was meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Thank you to âThe Dudeâ on Bluesky for pointing me to Jeff Vavasourâs own site here. I recommend reading it, lots of nice details on how they reverse engineered the 2600 titles and Jeff even notes that he himself drew the menu screen Atari 2600. Nice!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Rust is a disappointment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used to call myself a Rust hater, but really I was doing it just to compensate for the perceivable fanboyism e.g. Rust tops on stackoverflow surveys as most-loved language. There are many reasons to hate C++, and I hate C++ too. Lots of people were waiting for a better programming language, but got Rust instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are several core problems with Rust:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Its compilation is slow. I mean SLOW. Slower than C++. I know over years Rust became several times faster, but objectively we need it to be two orders of magnitude faster, not just two times.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It’s complex. Just as complex as C++. But C++ had legacy and Rust had not. The complexity of forcing your way through the jungle of &lt;code&gt;Arc&amp;lt;Mutex&amp;lt;Box&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;on every single step directly impacts the quality of the logic being implemented i.e. you can’t see the forest for the trees. Once again, C++ has the same problem, so what’s the point of the language switch in the end?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory safety is not that sacred. In fact, for many applications malfunctioning is better than crashing — particulary in the embedded world where Rust wants to be present. You cannot get 99.999% reliability with Rust — it crashes all the time.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When handling lots of mutable shared state (GUI, DB, stateful services, OS/hardware), the performance of native Rust memory model is subpar, and non-native unsafes just leave you with slow compilation, high complexity, and no memory safety in the end — which makes Rust practically meaningless for heavy mutable state jobs.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;C++ actually sucks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no doubt about it. Undefined behavior (UB) is a fundamental aspec of the language, you don’t simply encounter UB — the whole language is built on UB. You do array indexing and you immediately encounter UB because the language just does not check out of bound access. I want to emphasize that lots of UB-s are not even justified by performance matters — it’s an outright sloppy design of C carried over and amplified in C++. I can go all day long about how C++ sucks:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;implicit type conversions, implicit copies, implicit constructors, implicit object slicing, and pretty much everything implicit;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;function overloading (implicit), particulary considering its omnipresence in STL;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;non-uniform error handling with exceptions as afterthought;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;still #include-ing text files 40 years after C and One Definition Rule barely checked by compilers;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;unsound combination of paradigms (good luck overriding a generic function in descendant classes);&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;SFINAE nuisance as a core mechanism of generic programming;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;T, T&amp;amp;, T*, std::optional&lt;t&gt;, std::unique_ptr&lt;/t&gt;&lt;t&gt;to describe similar things, each broken in its own way. Put a const cherry on top of it.&lt;/t&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So C++ is complex, unsafe, and it’s compiler is slow. How does the Rust (not) fix those issues?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;1. Slow compilation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not a temporary problem — it’s by design. Here one of the designers explains why the Rust development team sacrificed the compilation speed every time:&lt;lb/&gt; https://pingcap.medium.com/the-rust-compilation-model-calamity-1a8ce781cf6c&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rust FAQ explains that there are many efforts to optimize it, like better frontend, MIR, and so on. But MIR effort was started at 2015 and it still fails to significantly quicken the compilation (although it speeds up compiler checks).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it’s impossible to make Rust compile fast. The problem is inherent to all similar generics-heavy languages, like Haskell. Arguably, Rust is closer to Haskell than it is to C++. You can also say it’s close to a template-heavy C++ — and template-heavy C++ code exhibits the same problem of slow compilation.&lt;lb/&gt; When you do &lt;code&gt;for i in 0..limit {}&lt;/code&gt; — you don’t just iterate, you create a range, you create an iterator, you iterate over it — all of it monomorphized to your concrete types and have to be optimized individually (non-optimized Rust code is insanely slow, it’s mostly unusable even for debugging).&lt;lb/&gt; Put a non-optional borrow-checker on top of it — and there you have your insanely slow compiler. And you WILL recompile a lot, because borrow checker is relentless.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;2. Complexity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You just cannot avoid it. You cannot go along like “I’m writing a cold path high-level code, I don’t need performance, I don’t need to go deeper into lifetime handling, I just want to write a high level logic”. You will be forced into the low level nuances every time you write a single line of Rust. There is no garbage collector for Rust and will never be — you will have to semi-manually pack all your data into a tree of ownership. You have to be fluent in ownership, borrowing, traits to write just a few lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I’ve already mentioned, this makes it very hard to write high-level logic in Rust. That’s why many of early Rust adopters actually revert to Node.js and Go for less performance-sensitive services — high complexity combined with slow compilation makes it impractical to write anything complex in sole Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;3. Memory safety&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are two uncompromising things in the Rust fundament: performance and memory safety. I have to argue that Rust designers went wa-a-ay overboard with memory safety. You know the containers are actually implemented with &lt;code&gt;unsafe&lt;/code&gt; functions, because there is just no perfect correctness possible in the Turing machine model — you have to build safe programs from carefully arranged unsafe building blocks. Node.js and Go are considered practically safe language. Rust sacrificed sanity and practicality for memory safety — and gets none of them at the end of the day, it’s still not 100% memory safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now speaking about practicality — lots of use cases just don’t need perfect memory safety. There are ways to implement unsafe programs that still don’t execute remote code or leak secret — they only corrupt user data and act sporadically. If a pacemaker stops — telling a victim “but the memory was not corrupted in the crash” is a weak consolation. We actually had a recent Cloudflare outage caused by a crash on &lt;code&gt;unwrap()&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;lb/&gt; https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s probably the strongest point of my whining: Rust is memory safe and unreliable. The price of memory safety was reliability in addition to the developer’s sanity — that’s why I’m telling the language designers went overboard. They sacrificied core practical quality for an abstract principle of memory safety. Just like Haskell designers sacrificed practicality for purity — that’s why I reiterate on parallels between Rust and Haskell.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;4. Mutable shared state&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s possible, but employing mutable shared state in Rust just makes no sense. You lose most of advantages and are left with all the deficiencies of Rust. Pretty much all of the successful Rust projects are employing shared read-only state, one way data flow, acyclic data structures: rustc compiler, mdbook and pulldown-cmark Markdown tools, Actix and Axum for stateless handlers, append-only blockchains, single-threaded WASM. The model is, once again, very similar to Haskell, which also excels in parsers, stateless handler, mostly-non-interactive CLI tools, and was employed in blockchains.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early prototypes of Rust actually had Software Transactional Memory (STM) as an option for safe concurrency, however, STM has performance penalties and it requires simple but significant runtime support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step into the shared mutable state — and there a memory corruption is not an exception, it’s a rule. You have to handle the corruptions, you cannot simply crash. Borrow checker, ownership? Just useless, you cannot analyze ownership in a cyclic graph without GC-like algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sync/Send, Mutex and reference counting (Arc)? Unfortuantely, those lock or simply mess with CPU caches badly, so they are inefficient for multithreaded communication, at least an intensive one. They are safe, but inefficient. Which kinda destroys the first uncompromising thing in Rust — performance. So, to reiterate, the second you step into the shared mutable state you lose every single advantage of Rust. Which is kinda rational considering that the main concept of Rust was to never employ a shared mutable state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Particulary, GUI is a mutable shared state. Hence we don’t see any big GUI projects in Rust. Zed IDE is still beta for so many years — I can almost feel the pain of the developers hacking their way through the borrow checker jungle just to realize their logic is bug-ridden, and they are yet to implement dozens of other features.&lt;lb/&gt; Big databases, scalable stateful services, operating systems, at least significant Linux modules? Yet to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Summary&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, is the Rust bad or good? It’s neither. It’s a mediocre programming language with thousands of man-month put into its development — this fact alone makes Rust a viable tool, just because you can pick it from the shelf and employ as-is. This blog was generated with Zola, written in Rust — I did not have to write a single line of Rust code to use it. And the Rust is a good fit for Zola SSG because of its non-interactive nature with one-way flow of immutable data. Just, please, don’t run around screaming “we should all switch our development to Rust because it’s the best programming language”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A desktop application for parallel agentic development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;Why parallelize?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here are some specific use cases we enable:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Contextual continuity between relevant changes: &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;e.g. create a workspace for &lt;code&gt;code-review&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;refactor&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;new-feature&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;e.g. create a workspace for &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GPT-5-Pro: use the slow but powerful GPT-5-Pro for complex issues &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Run in the background for hours on end&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The stream will automatically resume after restarts or intermittent connection issues. If the model completes early we will show an indicator.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A/B testing: run multiple workspaces in parallel on the same problem but different approaches, abandon the bad ones.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tangent exploration: launch tangents in &lt;code&gt;mux&lt;/code&gt;away from main work&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Isolated workspaces with central view on git divergence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Multi-model (&lt;code&gt;sonnet-4-*&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;grok-*&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;gpt-5-*&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;opus-4-*&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;VS Code Extension: Jump into mux workspaces directly from VS Code (docs)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Supporting UI and keybinds for efficiently managing a suite of agents&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rich markdown outputs (mermaid diagrams, LaTeX, etc.)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;mux has a custom agent loop but much of the core UX is inspired by Claude Code. You'll find familiar features like Plan/Exec mode, vim inputs, &lt;code&gt;/compact&lt;/code&gt; and new ones
like opportunistic compaction and mode prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Warning&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;mux is in a Preview state. You will encounter bugs and performance issues. It's still possible to be highly productive. We are using it almost exclusively for our own development.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download pre-built binaries from the releases page for macOS and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See the documentation for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See AGENTS.md for development setup and guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A custom implementation of malloc, calloc, realloc, and free in C.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This project implements a memory allocator from scratch using &lt;code&gt;sbrk&lt;/code&gt; for small allocations and &lt;code&gt;mmap&lt;/code&gt; for large allocations. It includes optimizations like block splitting to reduce fragmentation and coalescing to merge adjacent free blocks. Please note that this allocator is not thread-safe. Concurrent calls to malloc/free/realloc will cause undefined behavior. I've also written a blog post (~20 minute read) explaining step by step the process behind writing this memory allocator project, if that's of interest, you can read it here!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;X's new country-of-origin feature shakes MAGA and Democrat circles as many 'US' accounts revealed to be foreign-run&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Elon Musk's X, formerly Twitter, has rolled out a feature where going to the ‘Joined’ tab on one's profile, displays the country of origin for that account.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elon Musk's X, formerly Twitter, has introduced the country of origin feature that seems to have thrown both the MAGA and Democrats' worlds online into chaos. Several profiles online, that had pushed certain narratives are now being found to have been operating from outside the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The social media platform introduced a feature where one can see the country the account is based in. One has to head to an account and click on the date joined tab, which opens up onto a new page. This shows the country where that particular account is being operated from. While the feature was briefly removed after its introduction, it has now been added again, and both sides of the political spectrum are having a field day, calling out each other online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What to know about ‘American’ accounts based out of US&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The accounts being discussed here have pushed agendas within the US, and commented on US politics regularly. Many are also named to echo political movements, like some MAGA accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Also Read | X unveils ‘Chat’: A new messaging platform with video calls and privacy controls to rival WhatsApp&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, these ‘political influencers’ have been found to be based outside the US, raising questions about the motives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One profile going by 'MAGA NATION' with a follower count of over 392,000, is based out of eastern Europe. Similarly, ‘Dark Maga’ a page with over 15,000 followers is based out of Thailand. ‘MAGA Scope’ which boasts over 51,000 followers is actually operated out of Nigeria, and ‘America First’, an account with over 67,000 followers is based out of Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“At this time thousands of MAGA-aligned influencer accounts and large political pages that claim to be based in the U.S. are now being investigated and exposed with many of them traced to India, Nigeria, and other countries,” a news aggregator page on X noted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It wasn't just on the MAGA side. An account going by ‘Ron Smith’ whose bio claims he's a ‘Proud Democrat’ and ‘Professional MAGA hunter’ is operated out of Kenya. The account has over 52,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘Republicans against Trump’ an anti-Donald Trump page on X, which tries to push politics against MAGA, was reportedly operating out of Austria. While the location now shows US, X notes that the account location might not be accurate due to use of VPN. “The Anti-Trump account “Republicans Against Trump” which 1M followed has been identified as a non-American from Austria and is currently using a VPN to hide their location,” a page said, making note of this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;‘Republicans against Trump’ has over 978,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a side note, an account going by ‘Mariana Times’, with over 78,000 followers, which posts pro-Israel content has been found to be based out of India.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People within the MAGA orbit have also reacted to this new feature. Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna wrote on X from her personal account, “All of these pretend “pro-America” accounts that were pushing infighting within Maga are literally foreign grifters. I’m telling you, the foreign opp is real and so are the bot accounts.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alexis Wilkins, FBI director Kash Patel's girlfriend, also added, “I hope that everyone sees, regardless of their specific reason, that the enemy is outside of the house. The people posing as Americans with big American opinions but are actually operating from a basement across the world have one common goal - to destroy the United States. We have our issues, but we really can’t allow them to succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;ISPs more likely to throttle netizens who connect through carrier-grade NAT: Cloudflare&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;When operators see danger, innocent users are dragged down along with bad actors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before the potential of the internet was appreciated around the world, nations that understood its importance managed to scoop outsized allocations of IPv4 addresses, actions that today mean many users in the rest of the world are more likely to find their connections throttled or blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So says Cloudflare, which last week published research that recalls how once the world started to run out of IPv4 addresses, engineers devised network address translation (NAT) so that multiple devices can share a single IPv4 address. NAT can handle tens of thousands of devices, but carriers typically operate many more. Internetworking wonks therefore developed Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT), which can handle over 100 devices per IPv4 address and scale to serve millions of users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s useful for carriers everywhere, but especially valuable for carriers in those countries that missed out on big allocations of IPv4 because their small pool of available number resources means they must employ CGNAT to handle more users and devices. Cloudflare's research suggests carriers in Africa and Asia use CGNAT more than those on other continents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare worried that could be bad for individual netizens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“CGNATs also create significant operational fallout stemming from the fact that hundreds or even thousands of clients can appear to originate from a single IP address,” wrote Cloudflare researchers Vasilis Giotsas and Marwan Fayed. “This means an IP-based security system may inadvertently block or throttle large groups of users as a result of a single user behind the CGNAT engaging in malicious activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Blocking the shared IP therefore penalizes many innocent users along with the abuser.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers also noted “traditional abuse-mitigation techniques, such as blocklisting or rate-limiting, assume a one-to-one relationship between IP addresses and users: when malicious activity is detected, the offending IP address can be blocked to prevent further abuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because CGNAT is more prominent, and more heavily used, in Africa and Asia, they suggested “CGNAT is a likely unseen source of bias on the Internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Those biases would be more pronounced wherever there are more users and few addresses, such as in developing regions. And these biases can have profound implications for user experience, network operations, and digital equity,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Europol cops lean on phone networks, ISPs to dump CGNAT walls that 'hide' cyber-crooks&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Starlink tells the world it has over 150 sextillion IPv6 addresses&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;IETF Draft suggests making IPv6 standard on DNS resolvers - partly to destroy IPv4&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Need cash? Your IPv4 stash can now be collateral for $100M loans&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To test that hypothesis, the pair went looking for CGNAT implementations using traceroute, WHOIS and reverse DNS pointer (PTR) records, and existing lists of VPN and proxy IP addresses. That effort yielded a dataset of labeled IPs for more than 200K CGNAT IPs, 180K VPNs and proxies and close to 900K other IPs relevant to the study of CGNAT. They used that dataset, and Cloudflare’s analysis of bot activity, to analyze whether CGNAT traffic is rate-limited with the same frequency as traffic from un-abstracted IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That effort found indicators of bias, because non-CGNAT IPs are more likely to be bots than CGNAT IPs, but ISPs are more likely to throttle traffic from the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Despite bot scores that indicate traffic is more likely to be from human users, CGNAT IPs are subject to rate limiting three times more often than non-CGNAT IPs,” the pair wrote. “This is likely because multiple users share the same public IP, increasing the chances that legitimate traffic gets caught by customers’ bot mitigation and firewall rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The authors therefore conclude: “Accurate detection of CGNAT IPs is crucial for minimizing collateral effects in network operations and for ensuring fair and effective application of security measures.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They suggest ISPs that run CGNAT get in touch to help the community better understand the challenges of using the tech without introducing bias.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The authors also acknowledge that all these problems would go away if the world just moved to IPv6, and that CGNAT was supposed to tide network operators over until that happened. They also note the old proverb – “Nothing is more permanent than a temporary solution” – as the likely reason CGNAT remains relevant today. ®&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;November 21, 2025 at 07:00 JST&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minuscule airborne plastic particles are spreading to all corners of the planet, penetrating deep into human bodies and sparking alarm among researchers of the relatively new subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Studies are shedding light on the origins, transport mechanisms and impact of these pollutant microplastics, which are too small to be seen with the naked eye.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They have been found in skies above Mount Fuji, in European rain, Arctic snow and within human bodies. These byproducts of human activity could also be fueling extreme weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Marine microplastic pollution has drawn so much attention that the ocean has been assumed as the final destination for microplastics, but recent studies indicate that airborne plastic pollution is spreading at an alarming rate,” said Hiroshi Okochi, a Waseda University professor of environmental chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okochi leads a research team that has been studying airborne microplastics since 2017 and was the first to show that the pollutants had made their way into cloud water.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to studies conducted on how plastic waste is damaging marine creatures and the ocean environment, plastic litter that flows into seas degrades into “marine microplastics,” which measure 5 millimeters or less in particle size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By contrast, few studies are available on “airborne microplastics,” most of which measure less than 2.5 micrometers (0.0025 millimeter) across.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One study published in 2016 found plastics in fiber form in rainwater in Paris, showing that plastic particles were wafting in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okochi’s team in 2023 published a study that showed water in clouds covering the top of Mount Fuji contained 6.7 pieces of microplastics per liter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Airborne microplastics travel in different manners at different altitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the free troposphere, an atmospheric layer extending above an altitude of 2,000 to 2,500 meters, substances are transported intercontinentally over long distances by prevailing westerly winds and other air currents. They are rarely affected by things on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The microplastic particles found above 3,776-meter-tall Mount Fuji where clouds can form were carried far from their sources, Okochi’s team said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;POSSIBLE CAUSE OF TORRENTIAL DOWNPOURS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to one theory, when a large-scale atmospheric depression forms and generates ascending air currents, ground-based and seaborne microplastics are swirled up by the wind and sea spray and carried high up into the skies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once in the free troposphere, strong winds push the microplastics to higher levels and at enormous speeds, polluting the layer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A team of scientists from Germany and Switzerland reported that they had found more than 10,000 pieces of microplastics per liter of snow in the Arctic. They said such microplastics are likely traveling over long distances in the air and being deposited with snow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microplastics may even be inducing cloud formation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clouds naturally form when dust serves as nuclei for water vapor to condense on. Typical ingredients of plastic products, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, naturally repel water.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microplastics, however, change in chemical structure and obtain hydrophilicity, or affinity for water, when they are degraded by ultraviolet rays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That likely facilitates cloud formation through vapor condensation, Okochi said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some experts say microplastics could be causing sudden torrential downpours and other extreme weather phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Studies have also found that microplastics, when degraded by ultraviolet rays, emit greenhouse gases, such as methane and carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PLASTICS ENTERING LUNGS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although plastics have been found in various regions of the human body, it is not yet known what impact the airborne substances have on health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Airborne microplastic particles measuring 1 micrometer (0.001 millimeter) or less in size are believed capable of reaching the alveoli of the lung.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A study conducted in Britain said microplastics were detected in 11 of 13 lung tissue samples from patients who underwent lung surgeries. The highest levels were found in the lowermost region of the lung.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A human breathes more than 20,000 times a day, which adds up to 600 million to 700 million times throughout a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no standard method for measuring airborne microplastics, so estimated amounts being inhaled by humans vary wildly from one research article to another.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okochi said he hopes to develop a unified method for measuring the shapes, types, sizes and concentrations of airborne plastics so researchers across the globe can use it in their observations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We inevitably end up inhaling airborne microplastics without knowing it because the pollution they are causing is invisible,” Okochi said. “So little is clearly known about their possible impact on health and the environment, which is only beginning to be discussed. There should be more fact-finding studies on the matter.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HOPES ON FOREST ADSORPTION&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Airborne microplastics come from various sources, including road dust, tire abrasions, artificial turf and clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Effective measures to reduce exposure include avoiding the use of synthetic fiber clothes and washing clothes in mesh laundry bags to prevent the garments from rubbing together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the larger picture, society could reflect on whether certain plastic products in close surroundings are really necessary or could be replaced with non-plastic materials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For airborne plastics that are too small to be visible, absorption by forests is drawing attention as a hopeful measure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A group of researchers, including Okochi and scientists from Japan Women’s University, found that “konara” oak leaves adsorb airborne plastics through “epicuticular wax,” a coating layer on the leaf surface that defends the tissue from ultraviolet rays and external enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Konara forests in Japan can absorb an estimated 420 trillion pieces of airborne microplastics a year, Okochi said,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His team is now studying the use of fast-growing paulownia trees to fight the airborne microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are hopes this tree variety can address other environmental problems. The trees absorb large volumes of carbon dioxide and can be used to absorb radioactive substances in the soil in Fukushima Prefecture, the site of the 2011 nuclear disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Planting the trees on the roadside could help reduce inhalation by humans,” Okochi said. “We hope to pursue the potential of this new emissions reduction measure using fast-growing paulownia trees to lower the risk of human exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;
