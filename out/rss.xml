    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Can Spinners&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I came up with these little spinning doodads a few years ago around Christmas, and I haven't seen anything like them online, so I'm writing about them here as they are quite fun to make. I've just been calling these things "can spinners" (ChatGPT suggested "twirluminum").&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They remind me a bit of candle carousels that I would see at my grandparents' house, but in this case they are cut from recycled aluminum soda cans and spin on sharpened tips of wire from the heat rising off the lamp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got my family to create their own this year and it was interesting to see the variety of designs they came up with (see the gallery below).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Construction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the spinners shown above are made from sides and bottoms of recycled soda cans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My process usually goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharpen pivot wire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;The spinners need a fine pivot point to sit on with low friction. I used some steel craft wire that was laying around and sharpened it on a bench grinder. Paper clips and sandpaper would probably work too.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cut out blank&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;I've made these from the sides and bottoms of cans. Can sidewalls are much easier to cut and bend, so I'd recommend starting with that. Also be careful with the sharp scraps. I've been jabbed a few times making these.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create the central dimple&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;I usually just use a hard, blunt object like a ballpoint pen or pliers to push a dimple into the aluminum without crushing it. Can bottoms are made from thicker aluminum, so I had to gently tap on the back of the pen with a hammer to make the dimple. It's very easy to accidentally pierce the aluminum so be careful!&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cut out blades and bend into shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Small precision scissors work best to avoid distorting the aluminum and for making fine cuts.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trim and balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Balance the spinner on the pivot wire in your hand. Usually they're lopsided or fall off of their pivot initially, so trim small amounts of material from the outside until they spin well.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attach pivot wire to lamp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Usually I'll just wrap the wire around the lampshade support (apparently this is called a "harp") or sandwich it under the lampshade nut for easy removal.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incandescent bulbs work the best, but even LED bulbs are enough to get the spinners moving after warming up for a few minutes. After a few weeks of spinning, I've noticed the spinners made of thinner sidewall aluminum have very small pinholes from the pivot wire wearing through, but they haven't stopped spinning! The spinners made from can bottoms haven't had this problem yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Gallery&lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Your team's on-call AI engineer&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About Keystone&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're building AI-native error monitoring that automatically investigates production issues and generates code fixes. Think Sentry, but built from the ground up for a world where AI can actually understand your codebase, trace through logs, and tell you exactly what broke and how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're starting here and expanding until we're the default tool for building product, period. Our mission is to free engineers from the drudgery of digging through logs, setting up systems, and debugging- so they can focus on understanding users and designing great products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're in-person in SoMa, San Francisco. We raised a $5.2M seed from True Ventures, Twenty Two Ventures, Pear VC, and Ritual Capital- plus the founders of YC, Dropbox, Supabase, Eight Sleep, Graphite, Resend, RocketMoney, and more. Early design partners include teams at Perplexity and Lovable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About the Role&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You'd be the first engineering hire, working directly with me (the founder) to build the core product. You'll have more ownership and influence over the product, culture, and technical direction than you'd get almost anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example projects:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might be a great fit if you:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stack: TypeScript, React (Next.js), Python, Postgres, Redis, AWS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comp &amp;amp; benefits: Top-of-market salary + significant equity, full health/dental/vision, all meals covered, equipment budget&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To apply: submit an application here on workatastartup.com or email founders [at] withkeystone [dot] com with “Keystone Founding Engineer” in the subject line. I will reply to all such emails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there appears to be a fit, we'll reach to schedule 2-3 short technicals. After, we'll schedule an onsite in our office, where you'll work on a small project, discuss ideas, and get a sense for our in-person culture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phoenix is a new X server, written from scratch in Zig (not a fork of Xorg server). This X server is designed to be a modern alternative to the Xorg server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Current state&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phoenix is not ready to be used yet. At the moment it can render simple applications that do GLX, EGL or Vulkan graphics (fully hardware accelerated) nested in an existing X server. Running Phoenix nested will be the only supported mode until Phoenix has progressed more and can run real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Goals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Simplicity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be a simpler X server than the Xorg server by only supporting a subset of the X11 protocol, the features that are needed by relatively modern applications (applications written/updated in the last ~20 years).&lt;lb/&gt; This includes all software that you use, even old gtk2 applications.&lt;lb/&gt; Only relatively modern hardware (made/updated in the last ~15-20 years) which support linux drm and mesa gbm will be supported, and no server driver interface like the Xorg server. Just like how Wayland compositors work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Security&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be safer than the Xorg server by parsing protocol messages automatically. As it's written in Zig, it also automatically catches illegal behaviors (such as index out of array bounds) when building with the &lt;code&gt;ReleaseSafe&lt;/code&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applications will be isolated from each other by default and can only interact with other applications either through a GUI prompt asking for permission,&lt;lb/&gt; such as with screen recorders, where it will only be allowed to record the window specified or by explicitly giving the application permission before launched (such as a window manager or external compositor).&lt;lb/&gt; This will not break existing clients as clients wont receive errors when they try to access more than they need, they will instead receive dummy data.&lt;lb/&gt; Applications that rely on global hotkeys should work, as long as a modifier key is pressed (keys such as ctrl, shift, alt and super).&lt;lb/&gt; If an application needs global hotkeys without pressing a modifier key then it needs to be given permissions to do so (perhaps by adding a command to run a program with more X11 permissions).&lt;lb/&gt; There will be an option to disable this to make the X server behave like the Xorg server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Improvements for modern technology&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support modern hardware better than the Xorg server, such as proper support for multiple monitors (different refresh rates, VRR - not a single framebuffer for the whole collection of displays) and technology like HDR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Improved graphics handling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No tearing by default and a built-in compositor. The compositor will get disabled if the user runs an external compositor (client application), such as picom or if the client runs a fullscreen application.&lt;lb/&gt; The goal is to also have lower vsync/compositor latency than the Xorg server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;New standards&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New standards will be developed and documented, such as per-monitor DPI as randr properties. Applications can use this property to scale their content to the specified DPI for the monitor they are on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Extending the X11 protocol&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there is a need for new features (such as HDR) then the X11 protocol will be extended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Wayland compatibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some applications might only run on Wayland in the future. Such applications should be supported by either Phoenix supporting Wayland natively or by running an external application that works as a bridge between Wayland and X11 (such as 12to11).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Nested display server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being able to run Phoenix nested under X11 or Wayland with hardware acceleration. This is not only useful for debugging Phoenix but also for developers who want to test their window manager or compositor without restarting the display server they are running.&lt;lb/&gt; Being able to run Phoenix under Wayland as an alternative Xwayland server would be a good option.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Non-goals&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Replacing the Xorg server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Xorg server will always support more features of the X11 protocol and wider range of hardware (especially older ones).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Multiple screens&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple displays (monitors) are going to be supported but not X11 screens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Exclusive access&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GrabServer has no effect in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Endian-swapped client/server&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This can be reconsidered if there is a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Indirect (remote) GLX.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is very complex as there are a lot of functions that would need to be implemented. These days remote streaming options are more efficient. Alternatively a proxy for glx could be implemented that does remote rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Differences between the X11 protocol and Phoenix&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Core protocol&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several parts of the X11 protocol (core) are mandatory to be implemented by an X server, such as many font related operations.&lt;lb/&gt; However these are not going to be implemented in Phoenix, except for the simple ones that applications actually use (such as font operations used for cursors).&lt;lb/&gt; This will not affect applications that users actually use, even if they use old gtk2 applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Strings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strings are in ISO Latin-1 encoding in the X11 protocol unless specified otherwise, however in Phoenix all strings are UTF-8 unless the protocol states that it's not an ISO Latin-1 string.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Installing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
sudo zig build install -p /usr/local -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Uninstalling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zig does currently not support the uninstall command so you have to remove files manually:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo rm /usr/local/bin/phoenix
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building (for development)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;zig build&lt;/code&gt;, which builds Phoenix in debug mode. The compiled binary will be available at &lt;code&gt;./zig-out/bin/phoenix&lt;/code&gt;. You can alternatively build and run with one command: &lt;code&gt;zig build run&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Generate x11 protocol documentation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;zig build -Dgenerate-docs=true&lt;/code&gt;. This will generate &lt;code&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt; files in &lt;code&gt;./zig-out/protocol/&lt;/code&gt;. This generates x11 protocol documentation in the style of the official protocol documentation. The documentation is automatically generated from the protocol struct code.
Note that the generated documentation feature is a work-in-progress.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dependencies&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Zig 0.14.1&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;x11 (&lt;code&gt;xcb&lt;/code&gt;) - for nested mode under X11, when building Phoenix with&lt;code&gt;-Dbackends=x11&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;wayland (&lt;code&gt;wayland-client&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;wayland-egl&lt;/code&gt;) - for nested mode under Wayland, when building Phoenix with&lt;code&gt;-Dbackends=wayland&lt;/code&gt;(not currently supported)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;drm (&lt;code&gt;libdrm&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;gbm&lt;/code&gt;) - for running Phoenix as a standalone X11 server, when building Phoenix with&lt;code&gt;-Dbackends=drm&lt;/code&gt;(not currently supported)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;OpenGL (&lt;code&gt;libglvnd&lt;/code&gt;which provides both&lt;code&gt;gl&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;egl&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;FAQ&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Isn't it easier to write a Wayland compositor?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite popular belief, writing a simple X server that works in practice for a wide range of applications is easier to do than it is to write a Wayland compositor (+ related software).&lt;lb/&gt; Not many people have attempted to write an X server from scratch or have proper understanding of the protocol, but if you do you can see that it's quite simple.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Ruby 4.0.0 Released&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Posted by naruse on 25 Dec 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce the release of Ruby 4.0.0. Ruby 4.0 introduces “Ruby Box” and “ZJIT”, and adds many improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ruby Box&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ruby Box is a new (experimental) feature to provide separation about definitions. Ruby Box is enabled when an environment variable &lt;code&gt;RUBY_BOX=1&lt;/code&gt; is specified. The class is &lt;code&gt;Ruby::Box&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Definitions loaded in a box are isolated in the box. Ruby Box can isolate/separate monkey patches, changes of global/class variables, class/module definitions, and loaded native/ruby libraries from other boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expected use cases are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run test cases in box to protect other tests when the test case uses monkey patches to override something&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run web app boxes in parallel to execute blue-green deployment on an app server in a Ruby process&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Run web app boxes in parallel to evaluate dependency updates for a certain period of time by checking response diff using Ruby code&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Used as the foundation (low-level) API to implement kind of “package” (high-level) API (it is not designed yet)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the detail of “Ruby Box”, see Ruby::Box. [Feature #21311] [Misc #21385]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;ZJIT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ZJIT is a new just-in-time (JIT) compiler, which is developed as the next generation of YJIT. You need Rust 1.85.0 or newer to build Ruby with ZJIT support, and ZJIT is enabled when &lt;code&gt;--zjit&lt;/code&gt; is specified.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re building a new compiler for Ruby because we want to both raise the performance ceiling (bigger compilation unit size and SSA IR) and encourage more outside contribution (by becoming a more traditional method compiler). See our blog post for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ZJIT is faster than the interpreter, but not yet as fast as YJIT. We encourage you to experiment with ZJIT, but maybe hold off on deploying it in production for now. Stay tuned for Ruby 4.1 ZJIT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Ractor Improvements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ractor, Ruby’s parallel execution mechanism, has received several improvements. A new class, &lt;code&gt;Ractor::Port&lt;/code&gt;, was introduced to address issues related to message sending and receiving (see our blog post). Additionally, &lt;code&gt;Ractor.shareable_proc&lt;/code&gt; makes it easier to share &lt;code&gt;Proc&lt;/code&gt; objects between Ractors.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the performance side, many internal data structures have been improved to significantly reduce contention on a global lock, unlocking better parallelism. Ractors also now share less internal data, resulting in less CPU cache contention when running in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ractor was first introduced in Ruby 3.0 as an experimental feature. We aim to remove its “experimental” status next year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Language changes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;*nil&lt;/code&gt;no longer calls&lt;code&gt;nil.to_a&lt;/code&gt;, similar to how&lt;code&gt;**nil&lt;/code&gt;does not call&lt;code&gt;nil.to_hash&lt;/code&gt;. [Feature #21047]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logical binary operators (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt;) at the beginning of a line continue the previous line, like fluent dot. The following code examples are equal:&lt;code&gt;if condition1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; condition2 ... end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;if condition1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; condition2 ... end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;if condition1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; condition2 ... end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Core classes updates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: We’re only listing outstanding class updates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Array&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Array#rfind&lt;/code&gt;has been added as a more efficient alternative to&lt;code&gt;array.reverse_each.find&lt;/code&gt;[Feature #21678]&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Array#find&lt;/code&gt;has been added as a more efficient override of&lt;code&gt;Enumerable#find&lt;/code&gt;[Feature #21678]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Binding&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Binding#local_variables&lt;/code&gt;does no longer include numbered parameters. Also,&lt;code&gt;Binding#local_variable_get&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Binding#local_variable_set&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;Binding#local_variable_defined?&lt;/code&gt;reject to handle numbered parameters. [Bug #21049]&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Binding#implicit_parameters&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Binding#implicit_parameter_get&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;code&gt;Binding#implicit_parameter_defined?&lt;/code&gt;have been added to access numbered parameters and “it” parameter. [Bug #21049]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Enumerator&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Enumerator.produce&lt;/code&gt;now accepts an optional&lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt;keyword argument to specify the size of the enumerator. It can be an integer,&lt;code&gt;Float::INFINITY&lt;/code&gt;, a callable object (such as a lambda), or&lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;to indicate unknown size. When not specified, the size defaults to&lt;code&gt;Float::INFINITY&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;code&gt;# Infinite enumerator enum = Enumerator.produce(1, size: Float::INFINITY, &amp;amp;:succ) enum.size # =&amp;gt; Float::INFINITY # Finite enumerator with known/computable size abs_dir = File.expand_path("./baz") # =&amp;gt; "/foo/bar/baz" traverser = Enumerator.produce(abs_dir, size: -&amp;gt; { abs_dir.count("/") + 1 }) { raise StopIteration if it == "/" File.dirname(it) } traverser.size # =&amp;gt; 4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When an ArgumentError is raised, it now displays code snippets for both the method call (caller) and the method definition (callee). [Feature #21543]&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;code&gt;test.rb:1:in 'Object#add': wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 2) (ArgumentError) caller: test.rb:3 | add(1) ^^^ callee: test.rb:1 | def add(x, y) = x + y ^^^ from test.rb:3:in '&amp;lt;main&amp;gt;'&lt;/code&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Fiber&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Introduce support for &lt;code&gt;Fiber#raise(cause:)&lt;/code&gt;argument similar to&lt;code&gt;Kernel#raise&lt;/code&gt;. [Feature #21360]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Introduce support for &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fiber::Scheduler&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduce&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Fiber::Scheduler#fiber_interrupt&lt;/code&gt;to interrupt a fiber with a given exception. The initial use case is to interrupt a fiber that is waiting on a blocking IO operation when the IO operation is closed. [Feature #21166]&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduce&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Fiber::Scheduler#yield&lt;/code&gt;to allow the fiber scheduler to continue processing when signal exceptions are disabled. [Bug #21633]&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reintroduce the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Fiber::Scheduler#io_close&lt;/code&gt;hook for asynchronous&lt;code&gt;IO#close&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invoke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Fiber::Scheduler#io_write&lt;/code&gt;when flushing the IO write buffer. [Bug #21789]&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;File&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;File::Stat#birthtime&lt;/code&gt;is now available on Linux via the statx system call when supported by the kernel and filesystem. [Feature #21205]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;

        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;IO.select&lt;/code&gt;accepts&lt;code&gt;Float::INFINITY&lt;/code&gt;as a timeout argument. [Feature #20610]&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deprecated behavior, process creation by&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt;class methods with a leading&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;, was removed. [Feature #19630]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kernel&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Kernel#inspect&lt;/code&gt;now checks for the existence of a&lt;code&gt;#instance_variables_to_inspect&lt;/code&gt;method, allowing control over which instance variables are displayed in the&lt;code&gt;#inspect&lt;/code&gt;string:&lt;code&gt;class DatabaseConfig def initialize(host, user, password) @host = host @user = user @password = password end private def instance_variables_to_inspect = [:@host, :@user] end conf = DatabaseConfig.new("localhost", "root", "hunter2") conf.inspect #=&amp;gt; #&amp;lt;DatabaseConfig:0x0000000104def350 @host="localhost", @user="root"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deprecated behavior, process creation by&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Kernel#open&lt;/code&gt;with a leading&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;, was removed. [Feature #19630]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Math&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Math.log1p&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Math.expm1&lt;/code&gt;are added. [Feature #21527]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pathname&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Pathname has been promoted from a default gem to a core class of Ruby. [Feature #17473]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Proc&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Proc#parameters&lt;/code&gt;now shows anonymous optional parameters as&lt;code&gt;[:opt]&lt;/code&gt;instead of&lt;code&gt;[:opt, nil]&lt;/code&gt;, making the output consistent with when the anonymous parameter is required. [Bug #20974]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ractor&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor::Port&lt;/code&gt;class was added for a new synchronization mechanism to communicate between Ractors. [Feature #21262]&lt;code&gt;port1 = Ractor::Port.new port2 = Ractor::Port.new Ractor.new port1, port2 do |port1, port2| port1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1 port2 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 11 port1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 2 port2 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 12 end 2.times{ p port1.receive } #=&amp;gt; 1, 2 2.times{ p port2.receive } #=&amp;gt; 11, 12&lt;/code&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor::Port&lt;/code&gt;provides the following methods:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor::Port#receive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor::Port#send&lt;/code&gt;(or&lt;code&gt;Ractor::Port#&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor::Port#close&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor::Port#closed?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor.yield&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Ractor#take&lt;/code&gt;were removed.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor#join&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Ractor#value&lt;/code&gt;were added to wait for the termination of a Ractor. These are similar to&lt;code&gt;Thread#join&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Thread#value&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor#monitor&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Ractor#unmonitor&lt;/code&gt;were added as low-level interfaces used internally to implement&lt;code&gt;Ractor#join&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor.select&lt;/code&gt;now only accepts Ractors and Ports. If Ractors are given, it returns when a Ractor terminates.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor#default_port&lt;/code&gt;was added. Each&lt;code&gt;Ractor&lt;/code&gt;has a default port, which is used by&lt;code&gt;Ractor.send&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Ractor.receive&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor#close_incoming&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Ractor#close_outgoing&lt;/code&gt;were removed.&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor.shareable_proc&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Ractor.shareable_lambda&lt;/code&gt;are introduced to make shareable Proc or lambda. [Feature #21550], [Feature #21557]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Range&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Range#to_set&lt;/code&gt;now performs size checks to prevent issues with endless ranges. [Bug #21654]&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Range#overlap?&lt;/code&gt;now correctly handles infinite (unbounded) ranges. [Bug #21185]&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Range#max&lt;/code&gt;behavior on beginless integer ranges has been fixed. [Bug #21174] [Bug #21175]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ruby&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;A new toplevel module &lt;code&gt;Ruby&lt;/code&gt;has been defined, which contains Ruby-related constants. This module was reserved in Ruby 3.4 and is now officially defined. [Feature #20884]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A new toplevel module &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ruby::Box&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;A new (experimental) feature to provide separation about definitions. For the detail of “Ruby Box”, see doc/language/box.md. [Feature #21311] [Misc #21385]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Set&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt;is now a core class, instead of an autoloaded stdlib class. [Feature #21216]&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Set#inspect&lt;/code&gt;now uses a simpler display, similar to literal arrays. (e.g.,&lt;code&gt;Set[1, 2, 3]&lt;/code&gt;instead of&lt;code&gt;#&amp;lt;Set: {1, 2, 3}&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;). [Feature #21389]&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passing arguments to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Set#to_set&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Enumerable#to_set&lt;/code&gt;is now deprecated. [Feature #21390]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Socket&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Socket.tcp&lt;/code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;code&gt;TCPSocket.new&lt;/code&gt;accepts an&lt;code&gt;open_timeout&lt;/code&gt;keyword argument to specify the timeout for the initial connection. [Feature #21347]&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;When a user-specified timeout occurred in &lt;code&gt;TCPSocket.new&lt;/code&gt;, either&lt;code&gt;Errno::ETIMEDOUT&lt;/code&gt;or&lt;code&gt;IO::TimeoutError&lt;/code&gt;could previously be raised depending on the situation. This behavior has been unified so that&lt;code&gt;IO::TimeoutError&lt;/code&gt;is now consistently raised. (Please note that, in&lt;code&gt;Socket.tcp&lt;/code&gt;, there are still cases where&lt;code&gt;Errno::ETIMEDOUT&lt;/code&gt;may be raised in similar situations, and that in both cases&lt;code&gt;Errno::ETIMEDOUT&lt;/code&gt;may be raised when the timeout occurs at the OS level.)&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;String&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

[Feature #21552]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thread&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We only list stdlib changes that are notable feature changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other changes are listed in the following sections. We also listed release history from the previous bundled version that is Ruby 3.4.0 if it has GitHub releases.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Compatibility issues&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following methods were removed from Ractor due to the addition of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor::Port&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor.yield&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor#take&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor#close_incoming&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ractor#close_outgoing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;ObjectSpace._id2ref&lt;/code&gt;is deprecated. [Feature #15408]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Process::Status#&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;Process::Status#&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;have been removed. They were deprecated in Ruby 3.3. [Bug #19868]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_path_check&lt;/code&gt;has been removed. This function was used for&lt;code&gt;$SAFE&lt;/code&gt;path checking which was removed in Ruby 2.7, and was already deprecated. [Feature #20971]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;A backtrace for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ArgumentError&lt;/code&gt;of “wrong number of arguments” now include the receiver’s class or module name (e.g., in&lt;code&gt;Foo#bar&lt;/code&gt;instead of in&lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt;). [Bug #21698]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backtraces no longer display&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;internal&lt;/code&gt;frames. These methods now appear as if it is in the Ruby source file, consistent with other C-implemented methods. [Bug #20968]&lt;p&gt;Before:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ruby -e '[1].fetch_values(42)' &amp;lt;internal:array&amp;gt;:211:in 'Array#fetch': index 42 outside of array bounds: -1...1 (IndexError) from &amp;lt;internal:array&amp;gt;:211:in 'block in Array#fetch_values' from &amp;lt;internal:array&amp;gt;:211:in 'Array#map!' from &amp;lt;internal:array&amp;gt;:211:in 'Array#fetch_values' from -e:1:in '&amp;lt;main&amp;gt;'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;After:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ruby -e '[1].fetch_values(42)' -e:1:in 'Array#fetch_values': index 42 outside of array bounds: -1...1 (IndexError) from -e:1:in '&amp;lt;main&amp;gt;'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Stdlib compatibility issues&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;CGI library is removed from the default gems. Now we only provide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cgi/escape&lt;/code&gt;for the following methods:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CGI.escape&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;CGI.unescape&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CGI.escapeHTML&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;CGI.unescapeHTML&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CGI.escapeURIComponent&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;CGI.unescapeURIComponent&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;CGI.escapeElement&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;CGI.unescapeElement&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the move of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt;from stdlib to core class,&lt;code&gt;set/sorted_set.rb&lt;/code&gt;has been removed, and&lt;code&gt;SortedSet&lt;/code&gt;is no longer an autoloaded constant. Please install the&lt;code&gt;sorted_set&lt;/code&gt;gem and&lt;code&gt;require 'sorted_set'&lt;/code&gt;to use&lt;code&gt;SortedSet&lt;/code&gt;. [Feature #21287]&lt;/item&gt;

If your application relied on this automatic default, your requests will now be sent without a Content-Type header, potentially breaking compatibility with certain servers. [GH-net-http #205]&lt;/item&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;IO&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_thread_fd_close&lt;/code&gt;is deprecated and now a no-op. If you need to expose file descriptors from C extensions to Ruby code, create an&lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt;instance using&lt;code&gt;RUBY_IO_MODE_EXTERNAL&lt;/code&gt;and use&lt;code&gt;rb_io_close(io)&lt;/code&gt;to close it (this also interrupts and waits for all pending operations on the&lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt;instance). Directly closing file descriptors does not interrupt pending operations, and may lead to undefined behaviour. In other words, if two&lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt;objects share the same file descriptor, closing one does not affect the other. [Feature #18455]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;GVL&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_thread_call_with_gvl&lt;/code&gt;now works with or without the GVL. This allows gems to avoid checking&lt;code&gt;ruby_thread_has_gvl_p&lt;/code&gt;. Please still be diligent about the GVL. [Feature #20750]&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Set&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;A C API for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt;has been added. The following methods are supported: [Feature #21459]&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_set_foreach&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_set_new&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_set_new_capa&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_set_lookup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_set_add&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_set_clear&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_set_delete&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;rb_set_size&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Implementation improvements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Class#new&lt;/code&gt;(ex.&lt;code&gt;Object.new&lt;/code&gt;) is faster in all cases, but especially when passing keyword arguments. This has also been integrated into YJIT and ZJIT. [Feature #21254]&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GC heaps of different size pools now grow independently, reducing memory usage when only some pools contain long-lived objects&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;GC sweeping is faster on pages of large objects&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;“Generic ivar” objects (String, Array, &lt;code&gt;TypedData&lt;/code&gt;, etc.) now use a new internal “fields” object for faster instance variable access&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The GC avoids maintaining an internal &lt;code&gt;id2ref&lt;/code&gt;table until it is first used, making&lt;code&gt;object_id&lt;/code&gt;allocation and GC sweeping faster&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;object_id&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;hash&lt;/code&gt;are faster on Class and Module objects&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Larger bignum Integers can remain embedded using variable width allocation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;Random&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Enumerator::Product&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Enumerator::Chain&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;Addrinfo&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;StringScanner&lt;/code&gt;, and some internal objects are now write-barrier protected, which reduces GC overhead.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Ractor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of work has gone into making Ractors more stable, performant, and usable. These improvements bring Ractor implementation closer to leaving experimental status.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Performance improvements &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Frozen strings and the symbol table internally use a lock-free hash set [Feature #21268]&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Method cache lookups avoid locking in most cases&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Class (and generic ivar) instance variable access is faster and avoids locking&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;CPU cache contention is avoided in object allocation by using a per-ractor counter&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;CPU cache contention is avoided in xmalloc/xfree by using a thread-local counter&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;object_id&lt;/code&gt;avoids locking in most cases&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bug fixes and stability &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fixed possible deadlocks when combining Ractors and Threads&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fixed issues with require and autoload in a Ractor&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fixed encoding/transcoding issues across Ractors&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fixed race conditions in GC operations and method invalidation&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fixed issues with processes forking after starting a Ractor&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;GC allocation counts are now accurate under Ractors&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fixed TracePoints not working after GC [Bug #19112]&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;JIT&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ZJIT &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Introduce an experimental method-based JIT compiler. Where available, ZJIT can be enabled at runtime with the &lt;code&gt;--zjit&lt;/code&gt;option or by calling&lt;code&gt;RubyVM::ZJIT.enable&lt;/code&gt;. When building Ruby, Rust 1.85.0 or later is required to include ZJIT support.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;As of Ruby 4.0.0, ZJIT is faster than the interpreter, but not yet as fast as YJIT. We encourage experimentation with ZJIT, but advise against deploying it in production for now.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Our goal is to make ZJIT faster than YJIT and production-ready in Ruby 4.1.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Introduce an experimental method-based JIT compiler. Where available, ZJIT can be enabled at runtime with the &lt;/item&gt;

Use&lt;code&gt;--enable-yjit=stats&lt;/code&gt;on&lt;code&gt;configure&lt;/code&gt;to enable it on&lt;code&gt;--yjit-stats&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;invalidate_everything&lt;/code&gt;to default stats, which is incremented when every code is invalidated by TracePoint.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;mem_size:&lt;/code&gt;and&lt;code&gt;call_threshold:&lt;/code&gt;options to&lt;code&gt;RubyVM::YJIT.enable&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;RJIT &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;--rjit&lt;/code&gt;is removed. We will move the implementation of the third-party JIT API to the ruby/rjit repository.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We invited a man into our home at Christmas and he stayed with us for 45 years&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Published&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Christmas is often regarded as a time for goodwill, but one young UK couple's act of kindness 50 years ago changed their lives forever.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On 23 December 1975, Rob Parsons and his wife Dianne were preparing for Christmas at their Cardiff home when they heard a knock at the door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On their doorstep stood a man with a bin bag containing his possessions in his right hand and a frozen chicken in his left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rob studied the man's face and vaguely remembered him as Ronnie Lockwood, someone he would occasionally see at Sunday School as a boy and who he was told to be kind to as he was a "bit different".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I said 'Ronnie, what's with the chicken?' He said 'somebody gave it to me for Christmas'. And then I said two words that changed all of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"And I'm not exactly sure why I said them. I said come in."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aged just 27 and 26 years old at the time, the couple felt compelled to take Ronnie, who was autistic, under their wing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They cooked his chicken, let him bathe and agreed to let him stay for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What began as an act of compassion turned into an unique companionship of love and compromise that lasted 45 years, until the day Ronnie died.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rob, now 77, and Dianne, now 76, had only been married for four years when they welcomed Ronnie into their home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ronnie was then almost 30 and had been without a home from the age of 15, living in and around Cardiff and moving from job to job - Rob would sometimes see him at a youth club he ran.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make him feel as welcome as possible, they asked their family to bring him a gift for Christmas, anything from a pair of socks to some "smellies".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I can remember him now. He was sat at the Christmas table and he had these presents and he cried because he'd never known that sort of feeling of love, you know," said Dianne.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It was incredible, really, to watch."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pair planned to let him stay until the day after Christmas, but when the day came, they couldn't bring themselves to cast Ronnie out and sought advice from the authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The homeless centre told them Ronnie needed an address to get a job, Rob said, but "to get an address, you need a job".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"That's the Catch 22 that loads of homeless people are in."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Put in a care home when he was just eight years old, Ronnie disappeared from Cardiff aged 11, said Rob, and it was only when he was researching for his book, A Knock on the Door, did he discover what happened to him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He had been sent 200 miles away to a school which was referred to in a report as a "school for subnormal boys" and he lived there for five years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"He didn't have any friends there. He had no social worker that knew him. He had no teachers that knew him."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rob said Ronnie would often ask "have I done a bad thing?" something which they believe he picked up from his time at the school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"He was always worried he had offended you, or done something wrong."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aged 15, Ronnie was sent back to Cardiff "to nothing" they said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The couple said Ronnie was a bit awkward to begin with as he would struggle to make any eye contact and conversation was kept to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"But then we got to know him and, in truth, we got to love him," they said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They helped Ronnie get a job as a waste collector and took him to buy new clothes after finding out he wore the same clothes he was given as a teenager at the school.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We didn't have kids of our own, it was like dressing your kids for school, we were proud parents," said Rob.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"As we came out of the shop, she [Dianne] said to me: 'He's got a job as a dustman, we've dressed him up as though he's the front man of the Dorchester Hotel'," Rob laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rob, who was a lawyer, would get up an extra hour early to drop Ronnie to work before going to work himself.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When he would get home, Rob said Ronnie would often be sitting there, just smiling, and one night he asked: "Ronnie, what's amusing you so much?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ronnie replied: "Rob, when you take me to work in the mornings, the other men say 'who is that who brings you to work in that car?' And I say 'oh that's my solicitor'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We don't think he was proud of being taken to work by a lawyer, but we think maybe he never had somebody take him on his first day of school," said Rob.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"And now he's almost 30... at last somebody is at the gate."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ronnie had many rituals they became accustomed to, including emptying the dishwasher each morning, to which Rob would act surprised to avoid Ronnie's disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's hard to look surprised when you get the same question on Tuesday that you had on Monday, but that was Ronnie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"We did that for 45 years," he laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"He obviously struggled to read and write, but he would buy the South Wales Echo every day," Dianne added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ronnie would buy them the same Marks and Spencer gift cards every Christmas but each year he held the same excitement for their reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ronnie spent a lot of his spare time at their local church, gathering donations for the homeless and setting up for services, "meticulously" lining out the chairs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dianne recalled one day he came home with a different pair of shoes on, and she asked: "Ronnie, where are your shoes."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He told her a homeless man needed them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"That's the type of person he was. He was amazing," they said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of their lowest times was when Dianne was ill with ME, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, external, as she recalled there being days where she couldn't get out of bed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I had a little three-year-old daughter, Rob was away working," said Dianne.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But she said Ronnie was "remarkable" and came into his own, making milk bottles for their son Lloyd, helping out around the home and playing with their daughter Katie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While they admitted the dynamic had its difficulties, including battling Ronnie's gambling addiction for 20 years, they couldn't imagine their lives without him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"It's not something I would recommend as a strategy," said Rob, "but Ronnie enriched our lives in many ways".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"He had a great heart Ronnie. He was kind, he was frustrating," said Dianne.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Sometimes I was his mother, sometimes I was his social worker and sometimes I was his carer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Somebody said to them [their children] one day, 'how did you cope with Ronnie when your friends came to the house' and they said 'well, we don't think about it really, it's just Ronnie'."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rob added: "Our kids had never ever known life without Ronnie. He was there before they came and he was there when they were gone, with children of their own."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only once did the couple consider supporting Ronnie to live independently, a few years after he moved in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As their two children were growing older and space felt limited in their one-bathroom home, they approached Ronnie's room to suggest him getting a flat down the road from them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But as they entered, he repeated that familiar question: "Have I done a bad thing?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rob said Dianne hushed him out of the room, burst into tears and said "I can't do it."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few nights later, Ronnie entered their room and asked: "We three are firm friends, aren't we?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"I said 'yes Ronnie, we three are firm friends'," said Rob.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"And we will be together forever won't we?" he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"And there was a moment's pause, probably too long, I looked across to Di and I said 'yes Ronnie, we will be together forever'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"And we were."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ronnie died in 2020 at the age of 75 after suffering a stroke and the couple say they miss him terribly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only 50 people were allowed to go to his funeral due to Covid but "tickets were hotter than a Coldplay concert" Rob joked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They received at least 100 sympathy cards, from "Oxford University professors, to politicians and the unemployed".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After his death, a new Â£1.6m wellbeing centre attached to Glenwood Church in Cardiff was named Lockwood House, after Ronnie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the old building and the new building didn't quite match, and they needed extra funding to finish the renovation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"But they needn't have worried," said Rob.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Almost to the penny, it was the exact amount Ronnie had left in his will.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"In the end the homeless man put the roof over all of our heads."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Isn't that amazing, I just think it's all meant to be," said Dianne.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"People say to us, how did it happen - 45 years - but the honest truth is, in some ways, it happened a day at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Ronnie brought a richness into our lives."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;24 December 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some time ago I posted an apology piece for Python’s tail calling results. I apologized for communicating performance results without noticing a compiler bug had occured.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I can proudly say today that I am partially retracting that apology, but only for two platforms—macOS AArch64 (XCode Clang) and Windows x86-64 (MSVC).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In our own experiments, the tail calling interpreter for CPython was found to beat the computed goto interpreter by 5% on pyperformance on AArch64 macOS using XCode Clang, and roughly 15% on pyperformance on Windows on an experimental internal version of MSVC. The Windows build is against a switch-case interpreter, but this in theory shouldn’t matter too much, more on that in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is of course, a hopefully accurate result. I tried to be more diligent here, but I am of course not infallible. However, I have found that sharing early and making a fool of myself often works well, as it has led to people catching bugs in my code, so I shall continue doing so :).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also this assumes the change doesn’t get reverted later in Python 3.15’s development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just a recap. There are two popular current ways of writing C-based interpreters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Switch-cases:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;switch (opcode) {
    case INST_1: ...
    case INST_2: ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where we just switch-case to the correct instruction handler.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the other popular way is a GCC/Clang extension called labels-as-values/computed gotos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;goto *dispatch_table[opcode];
INST_1: ...
INST_2: ...
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which is basically the same idea, but to instead jump to the address of the next label. Traditionally, the key optimization here is that it needs only one jump to go to the next instruction, while in the switch-case interpreter, a naiive compiler would need two jumps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With modern compilers however, the benefits of the computed gotos is a lot less, mainly because modern compilers have gotten better and modern hardware has also gotten better. In Nelson Elhage’s excellent investigation on the next kind of interpreter, the speedup of computed gotos over switch case on modern Clang was only in the low single digits on pyperformance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 3rd way that was suggested decades ago, but not really entirely feasible is call/tail-call threaded interpreters. In this scheme, each bytecode handler is its own function, and we tail-call from one handler to the next in the instruction stream:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;return dispatch_table[opcode];

PyObject *INST_1(...) {

}

PyObject *INST_2(...) {
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This wasn’t too feasible in C for one main reason—tail call optimization was merely an optimization. It’s something the C compiler might do, or might not do. This means if you’re unlucky and the C compiler chooses not to perform the tail call, your interpreter might stack overflow!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some time ago, Clang introduced &lt;code&gt;__attribute__((musttail))&lt;/code&gt;, which allowed
for mandating that a call must be tail-called. Otherwise, the compilation
will fail. To my knowledge, the first time this was popularized for use
in a mainstream interpreter was in
Josh Haberman’s Protobuf blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later on, Haoran Xu noticed that the GHC calling convention combined with tail calls produced efficient code. They used this for their baseline JIT in a paper and termed the technique Copy-and-Patch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After using a fixed XCode Clang, our performance numbers on CPython 3.14/3.15 suggest that the tail calling interpreter does provide a modest speedup over computed gotos. Around the 5% geomean range on pyperformance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To my understanding, &lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt; already ships Python 3.14 on macOS with tail calling,
which might be responsible for some of the speedups you see on there.
We’re planning to ship the official 3.15 macOS binaries on &lt;code&gt;python.org&lt;/code&gt; with
tail calling as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, you’re not here for that. The title of this blog post is clearly about MSVC Windows x86-64. So what about that?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION] The features for MSVC discussed below are to my knowledge, experimental. They are not guaranteed to always be around unless the MSVC team decide to keep them. Use at your own risk!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are the preliminary pyperformance results for CPython on MSVC with tail-calling vs switch-case. Any number above 1.00x is a speedup (e.g. &lt;code&gt;1.01x == 1% speedup&lt;/code&gt;), anything below 1.00x is a slowdown.
The speedup is a geomtric mean of around 15-16%, with a
range of ~60% slowdown (one or two outliers) to 78% speedup.
However, the key thing is that the vast majority of benchmaarks sped up!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chart credits to Michael Droettboom&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;[!WARNING] These results are on an experimental internal MSVC compiler, public results below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To verify this and make sure I wasn’t wrong yet again, I checked the results on my machine with Visual Studio 2026. These are the results from this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Mean +- std dev: [spectralnorm_tc_no] 146 ms +- 1 ms -&amp;gt; [spectralnorm_tc] 98.3 ms +- 1.1 ms: 1.48x faster
Mean +- std dev: [nbody_tc_no] 145 ms +- 2 ms -&amp;gt; [nbody_tc] 107 ms +- 2 ms: 1.35x faster
Mean +- std dev: [bm_django_template_tc_no] 26.9 ms +- 0.5 ms -&amp;gt; [bm_django_template_tc] 22.8 ms +- 0.4 ms: 1.18x faster
Mean +- std dev: [xdsl_tc_no] 64.2 ms +- 1.6 ms -&amp;gt; [xdsl_tc] 56.1 ms +- 1.5 ms: 1.14x faster
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So yeah, the speedups are real! For a large-ish library like xDSL, we see a 14% speedup, while for smaller microbenchmarks like nbody and spectralnorm, the speedups are greater.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks to Chris Eibl and Brandt Bucher, we managed to get the PR for this on MSVC over the finish line. I also want to sincerely thank the MSVC team. I can’t say this enough: they have been a joy to work with and I’m very impressed by what they’ve done, and I want to congratulate them on releasing Visual Studio 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is now listed in the What’s New for 3.15 notes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Builds using Visual Studio 2026 (MSVC 18) may now use the new tail-calling interpreter. Results on an early experimental MSVC compiler reported roughly 15% speedup on the geometric mean of pyperformance on Windows x86-64 over the switch-case interpreter. We have observed speedups ranging from 15% for large pure-Python libraries to 40% for long-running small pure-Python scripts on Windows. (Contributed by Chris Eibl, Ken Jin, and Brandt Bucher in gh-143068. Special thanks to the MSVC team including Hulon Jenkins.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the documentation for [[msvc::musttail]].&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used to believe the the tail calling interpreters get their speedup from better register use. While I still believe that now, I suspect that is not the main reason for speedups in CPython.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My main guess now is that tail calling resets compiler heuristics to sane levels, so that compilers can do their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me show an example, at the time of writing, CPython 3.15’s interpreter loop is around 12k lines of C code. That’s 12k lines in a single function for the switch-case and computed goto interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has caused many issues for compilers in the past, too many to list in fact. I have a EuroPython 2025 talk about this. In short, this overly large function breaks a lot of compiler heuristics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most beneficial optimisations is inlining. In the past, we’ve found that compilers sometimes straight up refuse to inline even the simplest of functions in that 12k loc eval loop. I want to stress that this is not the fault of the compiler. It’s actually doing the correct thing—you usually don’t want to increase the code size of something already super large. Unfortunately, this does’t bode well for our interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might say just write the interpreter in assembly! However, the whole point of this exercise is to not do that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ok enough talk, let’s take a look at the code now. Taking a real example, we examine &lt;code&gt;BINARY_OP_ADD_INT&lt;/code&gt; which adds two Python integers.
Cleaning up the code so it’s readable, things look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;TARGET(BINARY_OP_ADD_INT) {
    // Increment the instruction pointer.
    _Py_CODEUNIT* const this_instr = next_instr;
    frame-&amp;gt;instr_ptr = next_instr;
    next_instr += 6;
    _PyStackRef right = stack_pointer[-1];

    // Check that LHS is an int.
    PyObject *value_o = PyStackRef_AsPyObjectBorrow(left);
    if (!_PyLong_CheckExactAndCompact(value_o)) {
        JUMP_TO_PREDICTED(BINARY_OP);
    }

    // Check that RHS is an int.
    // ... (same code as above for LHS)

    // Add them together.
    PyObject *left_o = PyStackRef_AsPyObjectBorrow(left);
    PyObject *right_o = PyStackRef_AsPyObjectBorrow(right);
    res = _PyCompactLong_Add((PyLongObject *)left_o, (PyLongObject *)right_o);

    // If the addition fails, fall back to the generic instruction.
    if (PyStackRef_IsNull(res)) {
        JUMP_TO_PREDICTED(BINARY_OP);
    }

    // Close the references.
    PyStackRef_CLOSE_SPECIALIZED(left, _PyLong_ExactDealloc);
    PyStackRef_CLOSE_SPECIALIZED(right, _PyLong_ExactDealloc);

    // Write to the stack, and dispatch.
    stack_pointer[-2] = res;
    stack_pointer += -1;
    DISPATCH();
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seems simple enough, let’s take a look at the assembly for switch-case on VS 2026. Note again, this is a non-PGO build for easy source information, PGO generally makes some of these problems go away, but not all of them:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;                if (!_PyLong_CheckExactAndCompact(value_o)) {
00007FFC4DE24DCE  mov         rcx,rbx  
00007FFC4DE24DD1  mov         qword ptr [rsp+58h],rax  
00007FFC4DE24DD6  call        _PyLong_CheckExactAndCompact (07FFC4DE227F0h)  
00007FFC4DE24DDB  test        eax,eax  
00007FFC4DE24DDD  je          _PyEval_EvalFrameDefault+10EFh (07FFC4DE258FFh)
...
                res = _PyCompactLong_Add((PyLongObject *)left_o, (PyLongObject *)right_o);
00007FFC4DE24DFF  mov         rdx,rbx  
00007FFC4DE24E02  mov         rcx,r15  
00007FFC4DE24E05  call        _PyCompactLong_Add (07FFC4DD34150h)  
00007FFC4DE24E0A  mov         rbx,rax  
...
                PyStackRef_CLOSE_SPECIALIZED(value, _PyLong_ExactDealloc);
00007FFC4DE24E17  lea         rdx,[_PyLong_ExactDealloc (07FFC4DD33BD0h)]  
00007FFC4DE24E1E  mov         rcx,rsi  
00007FFC4DE24E21  call        PyStackRef_CLOSE_SPECIALIZED (07FFC4DE222A0h) 
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Huh… all our functions were not inlined. Surely that must’ve mean they were too big or something right? Let’s look at &lt;code&gt;PyStackReF_CLOSE_SPECIALIZED&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;static inline void
PyStackRef_CLOSE_SPECIALIZED(_PyStackRef ref, destructor destruct)
{
    assert(!PyStackRef_IsNull(ref));
    if (PyStackRef_RefcountOnObject(ref)) {
        Py_DECREF_MORTAL_SPECIALIZED(BITS_TO_PTR(ref), destruct);
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That looks … inlineable?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how &lt;code&gt;BINARY_OP_ADD_INT&lt;/code&gt; looks with tail calling on VS 2026 (again,
no PGO):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;                if (!_PyLong_CheckExactAndCompact(left_o)) {
00007FFC67164785  cmp         qword ptr [rax+8],rdx  
00007FFC67164789  jne         _TAIL_CALL_BINARY_OP_ADD_INT@@_A+149h (07FFC67164879h)  
00007FFC6716478F  mov         r9,qword ptr [rax+10h]  
00007FFC67164793  cmp         r9,10h  
00007FFC67164797  jae         _TAIL_CALL_BINARY_OP_ADD_INT@@_A+149h (07FFC67164879h) 
...
                res = _PyCompactLong_Add((PyLongObject *)left_o, (PyLongObject *)right_o);
00007FFC6716479D  mov         eax,dword ptr [rax+18h]

    &lt;p&gt;Would you look at that, suddenly our trivial functions get inlined :).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might also say, surely this does not happen on PGO builds? Well the issue I linked above actually says it does! So yeah happy days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once again I want to stress, this is not the compiler’s fault! It’s just that the CPython interpreter loop is not the best thing to optimize.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, for now, you will have to build from source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With VS 2026, after cloning CPython, for a release build with PGO:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$env:PlatformToolset = "v145"
./PCbuild/build.bat --tail-call-interp -c Release -p x64 --pgo
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hopefully, we can distribute this in an easier binary form in the future once Python 3.15’s development matures!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was asked for a cross-compiler test. So here’s a quick and dirty toy benchmark of pystones. The last row is the tail call enabled build. All configurations have PGO. On this toy benchmark, we get roughly a 30% uplift. Note that this is unscientific as it was only a sample size of 1 and I cannot disable Turbo Boost on my laptop on Windows for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Asahi Linux with Sway on the MacBook Air M2&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2024-12-01&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I bought a MacBook Air M2. As of writing, it’s very affordable with the 16 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, 13.6” model available for $750. As of writing, also Asahi Linux doesn’t support anything newer than M2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I had previously used:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2011-2015: MacBook Air 13.3” with Intel Core i5 1.8 GHz, 8 GB of RAM, and 256 GB SSD (aftermarket upgrade from OWC). I installed Arch Linux on it with the i3 window manager.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2014-2018: Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition. I used the Ubuntu 14.04 that came with it with the i3 window manager.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;2018-2024: Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon Gen 6 with Intel Core i7 8640U, 16 GB of RAM, and 1 TB SSD. I installed Arch Linux on it with Sway.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;1 Installing Asahi Linux&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the Asahi Linux there’s a one liner which you can paste into the Terminal. It worked very well. The only complaint is that it seemed to take hours to copy root.img and boot.img over at 150 KB/s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I intended to run it with the Sway Window Manager, and storage space is precious, I installed Fedora minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;2 Getting set up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I connected to wifi with&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;nmcli device wifi list nmcli device wifi connect 'my_ssid' password 'mypassword'&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and then I installed a bunch of packages I use, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;sudo dnf install @sway-desktop-environment fish alacritty rofi ruff rclone pavucontrol-qt i3status mako pass syncthing maim xdg-user-dirs firefox rustup openssl-devel ncdu fd-find neovim&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, I cloned my personal dotfile git repo and ran &lt;code&gt;setup.sh&lt;/code&gt;.
Of course, my configs weren’t meant for the MacBook, so I had to make some changes (which I’ve pushed to the dotfiles).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;3 Customizing for MacBook&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By default, the whole row containing the notch is disabled, leading to a large-bezels look which I personally don’t like. There has got to be a way to use that screen real estate nicely!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I re-enabled that part of the screen with&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;grubby --args=apple_dcp.show_notch=1 --update-kernel=ALL&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, I put the Sway bar on the top to make a seamless appearance where the left and right side are used for useful information but the middle part is all black. By experimentation I found that the notch is 56px tall.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;bar { position top status_command i3status modifier $mod tray_output primary # the height of the m2 macbook air's notch??? height 56 colors { background #000000 statusline #cfcfd9 separator #000000 # border background text focused_workspace #0c0c0c #413459 #cfcfd9 active_workspace #0c0c0c #413459 #cfcfd9 inactive_workspace #0c0c0c #0c0c0c #cfcfd9 urgent_workspace #2f343a #ff3300 #ffffff } }&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The full &lt;code&gt;i3status&lt;/code&gt; shows a lot of information which might get occluded by the notch, and it doesn’t work with the MacBook battery levels by default, so I had to update the config:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;general { colors = true interval = 5 } order += "wireless _first_" order += "ethernet _first_" order += "battery 0" order += "tztime local" wireless _first_ { format_up = "W: (%quality at %essid) %ip" format_down = "W: down" } ethernet _first_ { format_up = "E: %ip (%speed)" format_down = "E: down" } battery 0 { format = "%status %percentage" hide_seconds = true path = /sys/class/power_supply/macsmc-battery/uevent } tztime local { format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" }&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I usually don’t like having the bar on the top (as with macOS), since you won’t be able to move your mouse cursor to the top edge to, say, click on tabs. Despite being mostly keyboard-driven, clicking on browser tabs with the mouse is something I still do often.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To fix that, I prevented the mouse cursor from entering the bar on the top, with&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;# use swaymsg -t get_inputs for the touchpad's identifier input 1452:849:Apple_MTP_multi-touch map_to_region 0 56 2560 1608&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;3.1 Using Waybar instead&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In around September 2025, I switched from the native Swaybar to Waybar. Somehow, I was running into some issues with &lt;code&gt;swaymsg&lt;/code&gt;‘s handling of battery levels, and my computer ricing was due for a slight visual update anyway.
It’s nice to save a tiny bit of screen real estate with icons instead of pure text, but of course, it is somewhat slower than Swaybar as it needs to render graphical stuff.
The Waybar is still situated behind the notch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new waybar config and css are at waybarconfig and waybarstyle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;4 Using it as a daily driver&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am very impressed with how smooth and problem-free Asahi Linux is. It is incredibly responsive and feels even smoother than my Arch Linux desktop with a 16 core AMD Ryzen 7945HX and 64GB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The touchpad in particular is stunningly good and just as good as native macOS. The mouse cursor movement and two finger scroll with inertia just feel incredibly natural, much better than my old Thinkpad X1 Carbon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons for getting the laptop was to use it for line scan photography. I was able to install the Alkeria SDK for ARM64 without any issues, even though it came as a deb file instead of an rpm. I didn’t manage to get &lt;code&gt;alien&lt;/code&gt; to work properly (something about the architecture arm64 not matching Fedora’s convention of calling it aarch64?) so I just used bsdtar to extract the contents into the filesystem root, yolo!!!
The M2 compiles my code super fast!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With high screen brightness and compiling lots of code, my battery went down from 100% to 60% after about 4.5 hours of use — not as good as the 15 hours of battery life on macOS but still pretty respectable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, it isn’t perfect. Common issues are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;higher battery drainage during sleep, so I usually just shut it down entirely when not using it&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;no hardware acceleration for video decoding&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;some USB port quirks and external display quirks&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, fairly decent overall.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

Study</title><link>https://case.edu/news/new-study-shows-alzheimers-disease-can-be-reversed-achieve-full-neurological-recovery-not-just-prevented-or-slowed-animal-models</link><description>&lt;doc fingerprint="6f22933169f9f5e8"&gt;
  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;New study shows Alzheimer’s disease can be reversed to achieve full neurological recovery—not just prevented or slowed—in animal models&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers from Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals and the Cleveland VA showed restoring brain’s energy balance led to both pathological and functional recovery&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more than a century, people have considered Alzheimer's disease (AD) an irreversible illness. Consequently, research has focused on preventing or slowing it, rather than recovery. Despite billions of dollars spent on decades of research, there has never been a clinical trial of any drug to reverse and recover from AD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A research team from Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals (UH) and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center has now challenged this long-held dogma in the field, testing whether brains already badly afflicted with advanced AD could recover.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study, led by Kalyani Chaubey, from the Pieper Laboratory, was published online Dec. 22 in Cell Reports Medicine. Using diverse preclinical mouse models and analysis of human AD brains, the team showed that the brain’s failure to maintain normal levels of a central cellular energy molecule, NAD+, is a major driver of AD, and that maintaining proper NAD+ balance can prevent and even reverse the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NAD+ levels decline naturally across the body, including the brain, as people age. Without proper NAD+ balance, cells eventually become unable to execute many of the critical processes required for proper functioning and survival. In this study, the team showed that the decline in NAD+ is even more severe in the brains of people with AD, and that this same phenomenon also occurs in mouse models of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While AD is a uniquely human condition, it can be studied in the laboratory with mice that have been genetically engineered to express genetic mutations known to cause AD in people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The researchers used two of these mouse models: One carried multiple human mutations in amyloid processing; the other carried a human mutation in the tau protein.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Amyloid and tau pathology are two of the major early events in AD. Both lines of mice develop brain pathology resembling AD, including blood-brain barrier deterioration, axonal degeneration, neuroinflammation, impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, reduced synaptic transmission and widespread accumulation of oxidative damage. These mice also develop the characteristics of severe cognitive impairments seen in people with AD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After finding that NAD+ levels in the brain declined precipitously in both human and mouse AD, the research team tested whether preventing loss of brain NAD+ balance before disease onset or restoring brain NAD+ balance after significant disease progression could prevent or reverse AD, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The study was based on their previous work, published in Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences USA, showing that restoring the brain's NAD+ balance achieved pathological and functional recovery after severe, long-lasting traumatic brain injury. They restored NAD+ balance by administering a now well-characterized pharmacologic agent known as P7C3-A20, developed in the Pieper lab.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remarkably, not only did preserving NAD+ balance protect mice from developing AD, but delayed treatment in mice with advanced disease also enabled the brain to fix the major pathological events driven by the disease-causing genetic mutations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, both lines of mice fully recovered cognitive function. This was accompanied by normalized blood levels of phosphorylated tau 217, a recently approved clinical biomarker of AD in people, providing confirmation of disease reversal and highlighting an objective biomarker that could be used in future clinical trials for AD recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We were very excited and encouraged by our results,” said Andrew A. Pieper, the study’s senior author, a professor at the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine and director of the Brain Health Medicines Center, Harrington Discovery Institute at UH. “Restoring the brain's energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery in both lines of mice with advanced Alzheimer's. Seeing this effect in two very different animal models, each driven by different genetic causes, strengthens the new idea that recovery from advanced disease might be possible in people with AD when the brain's NAD+ balance is restored.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pieper also holds the Morley-Mather Chair in Neuropsychiatry at UH and the CWRU Rebecca E. Barchas, MD, DLFAPA, University Professorship in Translational Psychiatry. He serves as psychiatrist and investigator in the Louis Stokes VA Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results prompt a paradigm shift in how researchers, clinicians and patients can think about treating AD in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The key takeaway is a message of hope—the effects of Alzheimer's disease may not be inevitably permanent,” Pieper said. “The damaged brain can, under some conditions, repair itself and regain function.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Through our study, we demonstrated one drug-based way to accomplish this in animal models, and also identified candidate proteins in the human AD brain that may relate to the ability to reverse AD,” Chaubey said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pieper emphasized that current over-the-counter NAD+-precursors have been shown in animal models to raise cellular NAD+ to dangerously high levels that promote cancer. The pharmacological approach in this study, however, uses a pharmacologic agent (P7C3-A20) that enables cells to maintain their proper balance of NAD+ under conditions of otherwise overwhelming stress, without elevating NAD+ to supraphysiologic levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This is an important factor when considering patient care, and clinicians should consider the possibility that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring brain energy balance might offer a path to disease recovery,” Pieper said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This work also encourages new research into complementary approaches and eventual testing in patients, and the technology is being commercialized by Cleveland-based company Glengary Brain Health, which Pieper co-founded.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This new therapeutic approach to recovery needs to be moved into carefully designed human clinical trials to determine whether the efficacy seen in animal models translates to human patients,” Pieper said. “Additional next steps for the laboratory research include pinpointing which aspects of brain energy balance are most important for recovery, identifying and evaluating complementary approaches to Alzheimer's reversal, and investigating whether this recovery approach is also effective in other forms of chronic, age-related neurodegenerative disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re classified as a sweet onion, and because of their mild flavor (they don’t make your eyes tear up), some folks can eat them like an apple. Most of my customers do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a phone order one season – 2018 I believe – a customer shared this story where he smuggled some Vidalias onto his vacation cruise ship, and during each meal, would instruct the server to ‘take this onion to the back, chop it up, and add it onto my salad ‘. That story made me smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Folks who love Vidalias, love Vidalias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me stop, though. I don’t want to get ahead of myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did all this start? I’m a web guy. I’m not a farmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;I’M ADDICTED TO DOMAIN NAMES&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, it didn’t start with an idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2014, the domain name VidaliaOnions.com expired, and went up for auction. For some reason the original owner abandoned it, and being a Georgia native, I recognized it ’cause I was familiar with the industry. I’ve been buying expired or abandoned domain names for a while, and enjoy developing them into niche businesses. This one was different though – I backordered the domain as a spectator, but for kicks &amp;amp; giggles, I dropped in a bid around $2,200 ’cause I was confident I’d be outbid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5 minutes later, I was the proud owner of VidaliaOnions.com. I had no idea what to do with it. Ready, fire, aim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the domain landed in my account, I attempted to re-focus my attention on other projects, but the name kept clawing me. Like it was saying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… yoo-hoo… over here… 😘&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Faulkner had an interesting perspective on writing his characters – on how they essentially wrote themselves, and how he (Faulkner) served as a sortof mechanical in-between. His quote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would say to get the character in your mind. Once he is in your mind, and he is right, and he’s true, then he does the work himself. All you need to do then is to trot along behind him and put down what he does and what he says… You’ve got to know the character. You’ve got to believe in him. You’ve got to feel that he is alive… After that, the business of putting him down on paper is mechanical. [source]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way Faulkner treats his characters, I treat domain name projects. I buy them with an intention to develop. And I let them take the lead. They’re the inspiration for the business itself. They guide me towards what they need to become. I’m just the dude behind the keyboard (sorta).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I buy them at auction, sometimes I buy them from original-owners. But universally, the domain name always comes first, the business idea comes second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t usually rush into development. The path of some domains is apparent before I acquire. Others, the path reveals itself down the road. Vidalia was the latter. And after I acquired it, it kept nudging me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build me… build me… you know how. And you know what I should be…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a month, I began to understand what it was telling me. That I buy pears from Harry &amp;amp; David every year, and I should mimic that same service for Vidalia Onions. Instead of farm-to-door pears, farm-to-door Vidalia Onions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An interesting idea, but daunting to approach. I’m not a farmer, I don’t have employees, I don’t have a packing shed. And I have no logistics or distribution system setup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the domain name kept staring at me. ಠ~ಠ ////whispering////&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… just start …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;“take the path to Nothing, and go Nowhere until you reach it.”&lt;/head&gt;-the tao of pooh&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so I did. I’m just dumb enough to try a project of this complexity. The market size justified an online venture. Google Trends showed strong search volume for the phrase. And chefs around the world had already belted their praise over the ‘caviar of sweet onions’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I just started down a path, with no end goal or milestone set. I just started going. No angel investor. No VC backer. I just used some modest profit from my other domain name developments to fund the endeavor. This was Feb of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I began, I discovered there was a Vidalia Onion committee which represents all the Vidalia farmers. So I reached out to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were kind enough to listen to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They introduced me to several farmers in the Vidalia region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got along quite well with the 3rd farmer I met (Aries Haygood), so we decided to partner &amp;amp; give this a shot. His farm had been around for 25 years; they hadn’t focused on direct-to-consumer; but they understood its value. They operated a packing shed as well. And most importantly, they grew an award winning Vidalia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so we went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conservatively estimated fifty (50) orders for our 2015 season. We ended up with over six hundred (600).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the farm concentrated on the Vidalia, I concentrated on customer service, marketing, branding, web development, &amp;amp; logistics. I didn’t have other projects that were this front-facing, customer wise. And I discovered I immensely enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more we both focused on these efforts, the more we grew. So much so, that other Vidalia operations began shutting down their mail order efforts and simply directed folks our way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We began testing alternate marketing avenues – a billboard on I-95 just south of Savannah, GA facing northbound traffic; sponsoring a bike rider headed cross country for charity; sponsoring a high school basketball team, as well as a grade school auction fundraiser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We added a phone order hotline, which – from time to time – generates more sales than online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also made a few colossal mistakes, which were entirely of my doing, like blowing $10,000 on faulty shipping boxes from an ill-informed &amp;amp; misleading box manufacturer in Dalton, GA. (it happened early in our journey, and nearly forced me to shut down)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I refused to let something like that kill this. Honestly, my customers would be quite upset if we disappeared. Last season, while I called a gentleman back regarding a phone order, his wife answered. While I introduced myself, she interrupted me mid-sentence and hollered in exaltation to her husband: ” THE VIDALIA MAN! THE VIDALIA MAN! PICK UP THE PHONE! ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, I realized we were doing something right. Something helpful. Something that was making a positive impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sometimes say I prefer projects that focus on purpose over profit. And as we enter our 5th season, this one continues to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s immensely gratifying. I feel so fortunate to be associated with this industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m Peter Askew, and I sell onions on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Them: We leverage automated machine learning to enhance your existing BI visualizations with more proactive insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me: I sell onions on the internet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Peter Askew (@searchbound) June 13, 2018&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;** below – from the field during harvest – these have been dug &amp;amp; are ready for clipping&lt;lb/&gt; ( click &amp;amp; drag )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow me on Twitter as I continue to document my journey there.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yesterday, LangChain published a critical advisory for a vulnerability I reported in langchain-core: CVE-2025-68664 / GHSA-c67j-w6g6-q2cm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, my research focused on breaking secret managers in our “Vault Fault” work – systems that are explicitly designed to be the security boundary around your most sensitive credentials. One takeaway kept repeating: when a platform accidentally treats attacker-shaped data as trusted structure, that boundary collapses fast. This time, the system that “breaks” isn’t your secret manager. It’s the agent framework that may use them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why this vulnerability deserves extra attention:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It’s in Core. This is not a specific tool bug, not an integration edge-case, and not a “some community package did something weird.” The vulnerable APIs (dumps() / dumpd()) live in langchain-core itself.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The blast radius is scale. By download volume, langchain is one of the most widely deployed AI framework components globally today. As of late December 2025, public package telemetry shows hundreds of millions of installs, with pepy.tech reporting ~847M total downloads and pypistats showing ~98M downloads in the last month.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;One prompt can trigger a lot of machinery. The most common real-world path here is not “attacker sends you a serialized blob and you call load().” It’s subtler: LLM outputs can influence fields like additional_kwargs or response_metadata, and those fields can be serialized and later deserialized through normal framework features like streaming logs/events. Plainly, this means an exploit can be triggered by a single text prompt that cascades into a surprisingly complex internal pipeline. &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before you read further, patches are now released in versions 1.2.5 and 0.3.81. If you’re running LangChain in production, this one is trickier than it may seem; please update ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The short version of the bug&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LangChain uses a special internal serialization format where dictionaries containing an ‘lc’ marker represent LangChain objects. The vulnerability was that dumps() and dumpd() did not properly escape user-controlled dictionaries that happened to include the reserved ‘lc’ key.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So once an attacker is able to make a LangChain orchestration loop serialize and later deserialize content including an ‘lc’ key, they would instantiate an unsafe arbitrary object, potentially triggering many attacker-friendly paths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The advisory lists 12 distinct vulnerable flows, which are extremely common use cases, such as standard event streaming, logging, message history/memory or caches:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most damaging outcomes include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Secret extraction from environment variables. The advisory notes this happens when deserialization is performed with secrets_from_env=True. Notably, this was the default until yesterday. 🙂&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Object instantiation within pre-approved namespaces (including langchain_core, langchain_openai, langchain_aws, langchain_anthropic…), potentially triggering side effects in constructors (network calls, file operations, etc.).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Under certain conditions LangChain object instantiation may lead to arbitrary code execution.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is categorized under CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data, with a CNA CVSS score of 9.3 (Critical).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;My research story: how I stumbled into it&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;’Twas the night before Christmas, and I was doing the least festive kind of work: staring at serialization code and asking “wait… why is that trusted?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Security research often looks dramatic from the outside. In reality, it is usually careful reading, small hypotheses, and a slow accumulation of “that’s odd” moments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This one started the way many do at Cyata: with a simple question we ask constantly as we assess AI stacks for real-world risk:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where are the trust boundaries in AI applications, and do developers actually know where those boundaries are?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LangChain is a powerful framework, and like most modern frameworks it has to move complex structured data around: messages, tool calls, streaming events, traces, caches, and “runnables.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reviewing previous research, there was already extensive research on LangChain tooling and integrations, but very few findings on the core library.&lt;lb/&gt;I started the research working backwards. Finding interesting locations (sinks), then figuring out how an attacker might reach them. Deserialization was an obvious target.&lt;lb/&gt;It took me quite a while to find something meaningful. But after a while, I found that assuming an attacker-controlled deserialization primitive, I could trigger blind SSRF that could be leveraged to exfiltrate environment variables (to be detailed soon). Because the outcome was limited to secret exfil, instead of my primary RCE goal, I kept auditing the deserialization, and took my time.&lt;lb/&gt;The bug wasn’t a piece of bad code, it was the absence of code. dumps() simply didn’t escape user-controlled dictionaries containing ‘lc’ keys. A missing escape in the serialization path, not the deserialization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;It’s much easier to spot something wrong than to notice something missing, especially when you’re auditing load(), not dumps(). In one of the most scrutinized AI frameworks. For two and a half years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From there, the investigation became a structured exercise:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Identify where untrusted content (mostly arbitrary dictionaries) gets serialized (LLM outputs, prompt injection, user input, external tools, retrieved docs).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Identify when that serialized data gets deserialized.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Identify what an attacker can achieve from arbitrary object instantiation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that point, the core finding was clear and actionable enough to responsibly report: there was an escaping gap in dumps() / dumpd() around ‘lc’ key dictionaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The advisory later captured what we often see in practice: fields like additional_kwargs and response_metadata can be influenced by LLM output and prompt injection, and those fields can get serialized-deserialized in many flows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To the LangChain team’s credit: the response and follow-through were decisive, not just patching the bug but also hardening defaults that were too permissive for the world we’re in now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The LangChain project decided to award a $4,000 USD bounty for this finding. According to huntr, the platform where LangChain operated its bounty program, this would be the maximum amount ever awarded in the project, with bounties so far awarded up to $125.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Technical deep dive&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Background: the “lc” marker and why it exists&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LangChain serializes certain objects using a structured dict format. The ‘lc’ key is used internally to indicate “this is a LangChain-serialized structure,” not just arbitrary user data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a common pattern, but it creates a security invariant: Any user-controlled data that could contain ‘lc’ must be treated carefully. Otherwise, an attacker can craft a dict that “looks like” an internal object and trick the deserializer into giving it meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The patch makes the intent explicit in the updated documentation: during serialization, plain dicts that contain an ‘lc’ key are escaped by wrapping them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This prevents those dicts from being confused with actual LangChain serialized objects during deserialization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The allowlist: what can be instantiated&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LangChain’s load()/loads() functions don’t instantiate arbitrary classes – they check against an allowlist that controls which classes can be deserialized. By default, this allowlist includes classes from langchain_core, langchain_openai, langchain_aws, and other ecosystem packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s the catch: most classes on the allowlist have harmless constructors. Finding exploitable paths required digging through the ecosystem for classes that do something meaningful on instantiation. The ones I found are detailed below, but there may be others waiting to be discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The exfiltration path&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LangChain’s loads() function supports a secret type that resolves values from environment variables during deserialization. Before the patch, this feature secrets_from_env was enabled by default:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;if (
    value.get("lc") == 1
    and value.get("type") == "secret"
    and value.get("id") is not None
):
    [key] = value["id"]
    if key in self.secrets_map:
        return self.secrets_map[key]
    if self.secrets_from_env and key in os.environ and os.environ[key]:
        return os.environ[key] # &amp;lt;-- Returning env variable
    return None&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If a deserialized object is returned to an attacker, for example message history inside the LLM context, that could leak environment variables.&lt;lb/&gt;But the more interesting path is an indirect prompt injection. Even an attacker who cannot see any LLM responses can exfiltrate secrets by instantiating the right class. ChatBedrockConverse from langchain_aws is both in the default allowlist of loads and makes a GET request on construction.&lt;lb/&gt;The GET endpoint is attacker-controlled, and a specific HTTP header can be populated with an environment variable via the secrets_from_env feature.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This validator runs when ChatBedrockConverse is instantiated. The attacker controls endpoint_url, triggering an outbound request. Combined with secrets_from_env, the aws_access_key_id header can be populated with any environment variable – not just AWS keys.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are intentionally not publishing a copy-paste exploit here, to give time for security teams. In a few months, the Huntr website will publish them automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Code Execution via jinja2 templates&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Among the classes in the default loads() allowlist is PromptTemplate. This class creates a prompt from a template, and one of the available template formats is Jinja2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a template is rendered with Jinja2, arbitrary Python code can run. We did not find a way to trigger this directly from the loads() function alone, but if a subsequent call to the deserialized object triggers rendering, code execution follows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We suspect there may be paths to direct code execution from loads(), but we have not confirmed one yet. If you have a solid idea or a lead worth testing, we’d love to hear from you – this is exactly where the security community helps turn hypotheses into proof. 🤝&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also worth noting: in past versions, the Chain class was also in the allowlist. That class has special features that might have enabled a flow to template rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Who is affected? The practical checklist&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your application is potentially exposed if it uses vulnerable langchain-core versions. Here are some of the most common vulnerable patterns (12 flows have been identified in total):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;astream_events(version=”v1″) (v1 uses the vulnerable serialization; v2 is not vulnerable)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Runnable.astream_log()&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;dumps() / dumpd() on untrusted data, followed by load() / loads()&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Deserializing untrusted data with load() / loads()&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Internal serialization flows like RunnableWithMessageHistory, InMemoryVectorStore.load(), certain caches, pulling manifests from LangChain Hub (hub.pull), and other listed components in the advisory&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That said, the system’s behavior is complex enough that it’s risky to assume a quick code-path review will catch every reachable variant. The safer course is to upgrade to a patched version and not assume you’re in the clear until you do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, the advisory calls out what I consider the most important real-world point:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most common attack vector is through LLM response fields like additional_kwargs or response_metadata, which can be controlled via prompt injection and then serialized/deserialized in streaming operations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is exactly the kind of “AI meets classic security” intersection where organizations get caught off guard. LLM output is an untrusted input. If your framework treats portions of that output as structured objects later, you must assume attackers will try to shape it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Defensive guidance: how to respond in production&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1) Patch first (this is the fastest risk reduction)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upgrade langchain-core to a patched version. If you are using langchain, langchain-community, or other ecosystem packages, validate what version of langchain-core is actually installed in production environments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2) Assume LLM outputs can be attacker-shaped&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Treat additional_kwargs, response_metadata, tool outputs, retrieved documents, and message history as untrusted unless proven otherwise. This is especially important if you stream logs/events and later rehydrate them with a loader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3) Review deserialization features like secret resolution&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even after upgrading, keep the principle: do not enable secret resolution from environment variables unless you trust the serialized input. The project changed defaults for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The LangChainJS parallel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on my report, there is a closely related advisory in LangChainJS (GHSA-r399-636x-v7f6 / CVE-2025-68665) with similar mechanics: ‘lc’ marker confusion during serialization, enabling secret extraction and unsafe instantiation in certain configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your organization runs both Python and JavaScript LangChain stacks, treat this as a reminder that the pattern travels across ecosystems: marker-based serialization, untrusted model output, and later deserialization is a recurring risk shape.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why this matters beyond LangChain&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are entering a phase where agentic AI frameworks are becoming critical infrastructure inside production systems. Serialization formats, orchestration pipelines, tool execution, caches, and tracing are no longer “plumbing” – they are part of your security boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This vulnerability is not “just a bug in a library.” It is a case study in a bigger pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Your application might deserialize data it believes it produced safely.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;But that serialized output can contain fields influenced by untrusted sources (including LLM outputs shaped by prompt injection).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A single reserved key used as an internal marker can become a pivot point into secrets and execution-adjacent behaviors.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Cyata, our work is to help organizations build visibility, risk assessment, control, and governance around AI systems – because if you can’t quickly answer where agents are running, which versions are deployed, and what data flows through it, you’re effectively flying blind when advisories like this land.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What this teaches us about AI governance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are a security leader reading this, here is the uncomfortable truth:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most organizations cannot currently answer, quickly and confidently:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Where are we using agents?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Which versions are deployed in production?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Which services have access to sensitive secrets?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Where do LLM outputs cross those boundaries?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is not a “developer problem.” It is a visibility and governance problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that is where Cyata comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How Cyata helps: visibility, risk assessment, control, governance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Cyata, we focus on a practical outcome: reducing AI and agent risk without slowing down builders. Vulnerabilities like this one are rarely “just a patch.” They expose gaps in how teams discover where agents run, understand real trust boundaries, and enforce safer defaults across fast-moving frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Visibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Know what is running, where, and how it is wired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Answer the first CVE question quickly: are we exposed, and in which flows?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discover agent runtimes and integrations across environments (IDEs, CI, services, worker jobs, hosted agents).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Track frameworks, packages, and versions in use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Risk assessment&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prioritize what matters based on real-world blast radius, not just “library present.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support faster triage: what is internet-facing, what touches secrets, what runs with elevated credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identify the highest-risk paths: untrusted content flowing into privileged contexts (services with secrets, broad tool permissions, prod network access).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Highlight where “structured fields” can cross trust boundaries (metadata, tool outputs, streamed events, cached artifacts).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Control&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reduce exposure even before every dependency is patched everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encourage safer operational defaults: least privilege, isolation boundaries, and policy checks that scale across teams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enforce guardrails around risky patterns (for example: deserializing untrusted data, permissive object revival, unsafe streaming-to-cache-to-rehydrate flows).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gate or restrict sensitive capabilities in untrusted contexts (for example: secret access via environment, high-privilege tool execution, or running risky code paths in privileged workers).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Governance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make “safe agent usage” repeatable, auditable, and hard to drift.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Define policies for approved frameworks, versions, and configurations.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Track and time-box exceptions with owners and rationale.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Monitor for drift and risky feature usage over time, with an audit trail that supports security reviews and compliance.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a Christmas-week advisory drops, the goal is not heroics – it’s calm, controlled response backed by real inventory and enforced guardrails.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Disclosure Timeline&lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a Google support page, the company says it is rolling out a new option to let users change their email address even if it is an “@gmail.com” address.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For quite some time now, Google has allowed users to change their account email address if they are using a third-party email address, but users with an “@gmail.com” address are left unable to change it, as Google says:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If your account’s email address ends in @gmail.com, you usually can’t change it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It appears this is changing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the same support page that currently says that you usually can’t change your email, Google is detailing a new process that is “gradually rolling out.” The altered page weirdly only shows in Hindi at the moment, meaning you can’t see the changes in English. Everything quoted below is translated. The page was first spotted in the “Google Pixel Hub” group on Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google explains:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The email address associated with your Google Account is the address you use to sign in to Google services. This email address helps you and others identify your account. If you’d like, you can change your Google Account email address that ends in gmail.com to a new email address that ends in gmail.com.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is new functionality that Google hasn’t detailed elsewhere yet, but says is “gradually rolling out to all users.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With this change, Google will allow users to change their “@gmail.com” email address to a new “@gmail.com” address with an altered username. After changing, Google details that your original email address will still receive emails at the same inbox as your new one and work for sign-in, and that none of your account access will change. Users will be unable to change or delete their email within 12 months of the change.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When you change your Google Account email address from an email address ending in gmail.com to a new email address ending in gmail.com:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The old email address in your Google Account that ends with gmail.com will be set as an alias. Learn more about alias email addresses .&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You will receive emails at both your old and new email addresses.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Data saved in your account, including photos, messages, and emails sent to your old email address, will not be affected.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can reuse your old Google Account email address at any time. However, you can’t create a new Google Account email address that ends with gmail.com for the next 12 months. You can’t delete your new email address either.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;You can sign in to Google services like Gmail, Maps, YouTube, Google Play, or Drive with your old or new email address.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each account can only change its “@gmail.com” address up to 3 times for a total of 4 addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google further details that your old Gmail address will still appear in some cases, and “won’t be immediately reflected in older instances” such as events on Calendar created before the change. You’ll also still be able to send emails from the old address. The old address remains yours and cannot be used by another user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Top comment by TurboFool&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Huge if true. Many of us have had Gmail since the beginning when we didn't know it would matter this much. And many others got their accounts as kids under the same lack of realization. And some people have changed their names.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The page is very detailed on the process, but the changes just aren’t live yet. Presumably, this support page detailing the process in Hindi went up a little earlier than intended, but it certainly seems that we’ll be hearing more about this change in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the functionality goes live, users will be able to change their Gmail address via “My Account.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’ll update this article if further information comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading Lord of the Rings for two months and I’m just at the end of the first part. It’s not because I’m not enjoying it. It’s one of the most enjoyable reading experiences I can remember.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the beginning, I’ve read the whole thing aloud. I’ve found reading aloud helpful for staying engaged — limiting myself to mouth-speed rather than eye-speed means I won’t rush, miss important details, and then lose interest, which has always been a problem for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first I was anxious to read a 1,500-page book this way, because it would take so long. But, as someone pointed out to me, if I’m enjoying it, why would I want to be done with it sooner?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So I tried slowing down even more, and discovered something. I slowed to a pace that felt almost absurd, treating each sentence as though it might be a particularly important one. I gave each one maybe triple the usual time and attention, ignoring the fact that there are hundreds of pages to go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This leisurely pace made Middle-Earth blossom before my eyes. When I paused after each comma, and let each sentence ring for a small moment after the period, the events of the story reached me with more weight and strength. That extra time gave space for Tolkien’s images and moods to propagate in my mind, which they did automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some part of me still wanted to rush and get on with it, to make good time, to gloss over the songs and lore to get to Moria and Mount Doom and the other marquee moments of the story. But the more I ignored that impulse, the better the experience got.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By offering the book about triple the usual amount of attentiveness, I was getting about triple the storyness (i.e. meaning, engagement, literary pleasure). Whatever the thing is that I’m seeking when I pick up a novel in the first place, there’s much more of it available at this pace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Eating Comprehension&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This effect reminded me of a paradox around eating I recognized long ago. When you slow down your eating speed, say to half or a third your default speed, you get much more enjoyment out of a smaller amount of food. The extra attention given to each bite allows more of the “good stuff,” whatever that is exactly, to reach you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s paradoxical is that it’s precisely the seeking of that “good stuff” that normally drives me to eat so quickly, and miss most of what I’m seeking. When you try to barrel ahead to access the good stuff quicker, you get less of it in the end. Slow down and much more of it is released.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it’s released automatically, in both reading and eating. You don’t have to search it out. The good stuff (the meaning in the text, the pleasure in the eating) just rises up to meet you in that extra time you give it. Slowing down, and offering more time to the act of consumption, immediately increases reading comprehension (and eating comprehension).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both are analogous to slowing down while you vacuum a carpet. If you pass the vacuum head too quickly, you miss half the dirt. Slow down, and you can hear how much more grit is sent skittering up the tube. The suction and bristles are working, but they need more time to do their work fully, to draw up the deeper-lying stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Question the default settings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems that my default consumption speeds for reading and eating (and maybe everything else) reduce the rewards of those things significantly, undermining the point of doing either.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part of it is my own impatience. But I also suspect that modern living, with its infinite supply of consumables, tends to push our rate-of-intake dials too high. I’m not going to run out of books, or snacks, or opportunities to learn something. There’s always more, so not every crust of bread or printed page needs to be appreciated fully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Internally though, the mind is juggling like Lucy and Ethel on the conveyor belt at the chocolate factory. Our receptors for meaning and appreciation, like the vacuum head, need more time to do their full work, to make all the connections they’re designed to make.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It might sound like I’m just offering clichés – less is more, stop and smell the roses, take your time – and I guess I am. But clichés suffer the same issue: they are often profound insights, consumed and passed on too rapidly for their real meaning to register anymore. You really should stop and smell roses, as you know if you’re in the habit of doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least see what happens when you reduce your consumption speed – of anything, but especially books, information, and food – by a half, or two thirds. Notice that (1) something in you really wants to plow through at the highest viable setting, and (2) how much more of the reward is released when you slow down anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, almost everything becomes more satisfying when you give it more time and intention, even things like checking the mailbox or writing a shopping list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Speed alters taste&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Slowing down your rate of consumption will inevitably change what you want to consume. Reading throwaway news articles or AI slop with great care and attention is only going to show you how empty of value it is. Reading dense writing in inky old books, crafted for your mind by great masters, becomes easier without the rushed pace, and the meaning just blooms out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same with food. Try to savor a cheap, waxy “chocolate” bar, or a bag of store-brand cheese puffs, and you discover a harsh taste that you don’t want to look at too closely. Enjoy a homemade pastry with great attention, and discover there’s even more in it than you realized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mass production is good in so many ways, but the faster we tend to consume its fruits, the more we end up seeking things for their glossy, candied surfaces. The more we go for these surface-level rewards, the more the culture focuses on offering only that part – such as TikTok videos, processed food, CGI-forward movies, and public discourse in the form of unexamined talking points.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who knows how far we’ve drifted from the best modes of consuming the things we value. Once something becomes a norm, it seems like an appropriate standard, no matter how much has been lost. Apparently, reading silently and alone was unusual until as late as the 18th century. Certainly sit-down meals and cooking at home were.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t mean to sound like a scold. Let’s say none of this is morally good or bad. It’s just that in so much of what we do, we could be getting much more of the part of it that we really seek — but it’s only available at slower speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re curious, try consuming things more slowly, so slowly it seems silly to others — say a third your habitual speed — and see what rises up to meet you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Want to quit something in January?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recently I opened a discussion forum for Raptitude readers who want to give something up for the month of December (alcohol, social media, snacks, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s been a real success, and many people want to do something similar in January. If you want to quit something, or just give it up for a month, you’re invited to join.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;by&lt;/p&gt;on December 23, 2025&lt;p&gt;I wrote last month about my diabetes diagnosis this year and my difficult choice to wear a proprietary device (called a CGM) on my arm 24/7 to continuously monitor my glucose levels. Like my friend and colleague, Karen M. Sandler — who previously made a much higher-stakes choice to receive a proprietary implanted defibrillator to keep her safe given her genetic heart condition — I reluctantly chose to attach proprietary hardware and software to my body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device itself is quite proprietary, but fortunately the FOSS community has reverse engineered its activation and data collection protocols — creating an Android application that does a better job than the manufacturers' proprietary ones0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here in the USA, we strangely use capitalism as the center of our health care system. Two major for-profit competing brands of CGM are available here. My diabetes specialist prefers the (ironically named) Freestyle Libre Plus from Abbott. I (also rather strangely) bring a prescription for electronics to a pharmacy every month. On 2025-12-03, that phramacy sent me an alarming text message (shown here).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reading that text, I found the USA FDA announcement. My spouse cross-referenced the lot numbers while I read them off from all my Freestyle boxes1. I had indeed recently worn an impacted device!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only because my diabetes is so early of a stage was I relatively safe. The FDA reports that Freestyle injured over 700 people and killed seven people with this bug. Spcifically, the bug caused the device to falsely report an extremely low glucose level. Advanced stage diabetics use low reading information to inform them that they may have too much insulin currently. The usual remedy is to eat something sugary to raise glucose in the blood. Such should be done only with great care, as a false low reading can harm and even kill the patient (who eats a high-sugar-content item while glucose in the blood is, in fact, not low).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proprietary software in medical devices harming patients is not new. In 1985, the Therac-25 killed three people. In 2020, hundreds of patients who relied on a financially troubled tech startup found their occular implants suddenly unsupported. Some patients went blind as the devices powered down without updates. There are more examples that I could include here, but rereading this horrific stories is frankly more than I can take right now when I think of fellow diabetes sufferers who were “killed by code” recently..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's hubris for activists to guarantee that harm would be prevented if Freestyle had publicly released the hardware specifications and the complete, corresponding source code (CCS). FOSS isn't immune to bugs — even dangerous ones. However, in the centuries since the Enlightenment, we know that the scientific method depends on public disclosure about data and wide-reaching peer review of past work. FOSS (plus a publicly disclosed hardware design) wouid allow the millions of hardware and software engineers to peer-review the integrity, security, and safety of the devices to which patients entrust their lives. We achieve the promise of humanity when we each entrust our safety and health to our entire community — not merely a single for-profit entity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also will probably never know whether this issue was in hardware or software. The bug disclosure is incredibly vague, and it remains unclear how much investigation was done (if any) by government regulators into this problem. As a public policy and public health matter, the public deserves to know the technical details (software and hardware) of both the functioning device and the failed devices. NGOs should be permitted to perform their own investigations and confirmations of public safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that the hardware, software, and medical for-profit industries refuse to put the rights, safety and security of patients first, wrongful death lawsuits are typically the only way to hold these companies accountable. Yet, there are very few people who have not agreed Abbott's toxic terms of their proprietary companion application — I guestimate that fewer than 1% of Freestyle-using patients have used Juggluco from their very start (and thus never agreed to Abbott's terms). This is significant because Abbott includes a comprehensive one-way indemnity for themselves in the terms. I hope that a class action suit begins soon on this matter, but I wonder and worry that so much of the class may have signed this indemnity (which may make the road to justice bumpier).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to offer that if there is anyone out there who does tear-downs of extremely tiny electronic devices, I would be thrilled to find a volunteer who would like to see if we can either extract any software components from the device, or reverse-engineer the hardware. I have saved and sanitized all of my prior CGMs. I'd gladly send one along to anyone who wants to give a try at taking them apart. (Contact SFC or contact me on the Fediverse (via Mastodon) if you're available to do this work.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For my part, I look forward (after the Vizio trial) to sending some patches to Juggluco and also getting Juggluco available in F-Droid. Our best option in the face of these powerful medical device companies curtailing our rights is to invest our volunteer time into the edges where FOSS has resiliently worked around the constant roadblocks erected by bad actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;0My prior post about CGMs discussed the GPLv3'd Juggluco in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 In a fascinating turn of events, at least one of my past monitors (of which I fortitously saved all the boxes with the lot/serial number on them) is listed in the FDA's spreadsheet as recalled lot, yet the serial number is listed as “ safe to use” on Abbott's webform 🤔 … I'm left wondering how I can trust Abbott to write reliable software stuck into my arm if they can't even write a web form that cross-references serial numbers to lots correctly 😬.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please email any comments on this entry to info@sfconservancy.org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;When a driver challenges the kernel's assumptions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unix-based systems have been around for more than 50 years now. Although the best design ideas still prevail to this day, the evolution of the computing industry has forced operating system designers to rethink the way they work, multiple times over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From a device driver point of view, the most important change was the change from fixed, compile-time hardware configuration, enumerated upon boot and never changing afterwards, to a more dynamic model, where devices can come and go: storage devices first, with the first hotplug-capable SCSI controllers in the first half of the 1990s, and complete devices shortly later, first with the introduction of the PCMCIA bus on laptops, then with USB and Firewire, which were not limited to laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While PCMCIA support in open source operating systems had lingered for a few years before being integrated (both in Linux with "pcmcia-cs" and in FreeBSD with the "laptop package"), by the time USB support was being worked on, the required changes to accept/allow that devices may show up or disappear at any time had been completed and tested, and the kernel had no excuse not to cope with removable devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today's story is the story of a device driver which caused some kernel assumptions to no longer stand, and the work done to remediate this situation, letting the kernel cope with the new world order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This story starts on the 12th of march 2009. Theo de Raadt is travelling to Japan to visit fellow OpenBSD developer Ryan McBride, best known for implementing the CARP network high-availability protocol in OpenBSD, who has been living in Japan for a few years already.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every time he goes to Japan, Theo never misses the opportunity to visit Akihabara in Tokyo, in order to find new computing devices to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Among the devices he picks this time, is a small display, the size of a smartphone, with an usb cable, shown here running an X server under OpenBSD for the first time, a few months later. (picture courtesy of Marcus Glocker) &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The company making these USB displays is called DisplayLink.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DisplayLink provides binary-only drivers for Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OSX, and nothing more. This caused some frustration in the free software world, and Florian Echtler, with the help of Chris Hodges, worked on reverse engineering the device, with the intent to get it working under Linux. All of their work is nowadays described at https://floe.butterbrot.org/matrix/hacking/dlnk/.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, at this point, there is no support for these devices in OpenBSD either, and they attach as generic USB devices when connected:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;deraadt&amp;gt; ugen0 at uhub0 port 3 "DisplayLink LCD-8000U" rev 2.00/0.02 addr 2 &amp;lt;deraadt&amp;gt; Picked up that too&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moments later, Matthieu Herrb points to Florian Echtler's information:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;matthieu&amp;gt; &amp;lt;http://floe.butterbrot.org/displaylink/doku.php&amp;gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DisplayLink device gets passed from Theo de Raadt to developer Claudio Jeker, who lives in Switzerland close to another developer who has been recently working on USB devices, and will be the hero of this story: Marcus Glocker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once told he will be given the device, Marcus does what everyone in his place would have done: he asks the manufacturer politely for documentation on april 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was no contact information at DisplayLink, only a "contact us" webform in which you could enter your name and email address, and your message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Name: Marcus Glocker Message: Dear Ladies and Gentleman, We are thinking about developing an OpenSource driver for your DL-120/DL-160 chipsets. This would allow several OpenSource projects (e.g. NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Linux, X.org) to add support for DisplayLink based USB LCD devices, and therefore extend your potential user base. Therefore we would like to talk with you about getting basic documentation for your chipsets. It would be nice if the right person for this topic could contact me for further communication on the e-mail address stated in this form. Regards, Marcus Glocker, OpenBSD Developer&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The answer was as unhelpful as possible:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Date: Mon, 6 Apr 2009 12:49:42 +0100 From: Jason Slaughter (DisplayLink) To: Marcus Glocker Cc: Bernie Thompson (DisplayLink) Subject: Opensource Driver for OpenBSD Hello Marcus, thank you for your email. DisplayLink USB graphics are a software graphics card: graphics functions are performed on the CPU and then compressed and sent across the USB cable to be decompressed in a DisplayLink DL-120/DL-160 chip on the other side. This means that - unlike most PC hardware - getting basic documentation about the chip would not provide enough information to implement a driver for BSD. However, DisplayLink is current in the process of putting together a library that will provide the functions necessary to drive a DisplayLink USB graphics chips, and it is our intention to release this library under an open source license in the very near future. This library would provide you with all of the information necessary to develop an x.org compatible driver for DisplayLink USB graphics devices on *BSD. The best point of contact for you might be Bernie Thompson (cc'd), our VP of Software Platforms based in Seattle, Washington. We could start with a conversation on email, but Bernie and I would also be happy to have a quick phone call with you to help you understand how DisplayLink graphics work and what our plans are for supporting open source platforms. I would also be curious to get your thoughts on how DisplayLink device support might fit into BSD. Thank you, Jason&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, Marcus was sharing the results of this discussion with the other OpenBSD developers on our private chatroom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;mglock&amp;gt; wow. &amp;lt;kettenis&amp;gt; wow? &amp;lt;mglock&amp;gt; DisplayLink TM seems to be very communactive. &amp;lt;mglock&amp;gt; asked the for specs for their DL-120/DL-160 chips, and got a detailed answer withing 4 hours. &amp;lt;mglock&amp;gt; they want to call me :-) &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; they're actually responding? &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; wow... &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; I'd heard they were quite reticent. Someone on the xorg lists is rev engineering them for that reason. Not so much progress so far &amp;lt;mglock&amp;gt; interessting. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; Well, i asked him if he was reverse engineering, he said yes. I'm sure I asked if he'd asked for docs, but the reply from him doesn't include that bit. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; If you can get specifications freely, I'd be interested in a copy &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; those things are pretty cool, in an oddball kinda way &amp;lt;mglock&amp;gt; sure. keep you informed. lets see how far we come. [...] &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; just wrote back to the DisplayLink guys. lets see what happens.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The day after:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; re &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; got the DisplayLink device from claudio. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; and an answer from DisplayLink themselfs. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; we will get no docs. &amp;lt;kettenis&amp;gt; bastards! &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; but the seem to release the opensource library soon. based on libusb. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; library will be LGPL licensed ...&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Marcus does not remain inactive waiting for a hypothetical code release from DisplayLink. After weeks of trials, he reaches a point where he has a terminal (text-mode emulation) running on it, albeit slowly, and talks about it on may 1st, leading to a productive brainstorming session with a few other OpenBSD developers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; hmm, looks bad for the USB display driver for wscons. all that many little USB bulk transfers which are necessary to draw the fonts make the display rendering slow. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; i think there is no way to improve it further. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; mglocker: make a shadow area and blit the whole lot in one go &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; so make a line of text in one go the blit all of it &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; and use blits to move lines of text around for scrolling &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; nah, you need to be able to draw one character. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; hmmm &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; did they release that library by the way? &amp;lt;deraadt&amp;gt; there must be memory on the thing, to pre-load the fonts there &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; even if you preload the fonts, it doesn't help. to bit blit one character you also need to setup a bulk xfer. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; oh, offscreen memory if it has, then it's just blitting chars. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; oh jesus. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; it's the same amount of bulk xfers in the end. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; yes, i tried exactly that. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; how slow is slow? &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; it is exactly as slow as before. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; I mean how slow is the output all told? &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; i think it's not the content of the bulk xfer making it slow, but the little peaces of bulk xfers. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; ah. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; on my amd64 it's like a 19200 modem connection or such :-) &amp;lt;deraadt&amp;gt; how do they make it fast, then? &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; what info do you have on it? &amp;lt;drahn&amp;gt; can multiple 'blits' be combined? &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; all I heard about was some libarary that they will release, and the reveng stuff &amp;lt;sthen&amp;gt; if you have a shadow buffer, can't you update multiple chars in one go? &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; you could. but then i would need to "collect" lines? &amp;lt;sthen&amp;gt; yep. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; shudder. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; sounds ugly. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; welcome to graphics, mate. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; heh &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; i think i quit that area ;-) &amp;lt;drahn&amp;gt; a timeout to gather up several or polling waiting for the previous one to complete? &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; what information do you have on the hardware itself? &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; http://floe.butterbrot.org/displaylink/doku.php &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; that's what we have. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; oh, that's the reveng stuff? &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; yeah, seen it. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; there is compression, which doesn't seem to work yet. but i'm not sure if the compression stuff would help us for wscons. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; since again, you need to setup a bulk xfer for each character. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; good for bulk data moves. less good for char-by-char &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; and the thing which make it slow seems to be the setup overhead, not the content itself. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; yes. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; i don't know how the driver on windows works, but i don't guess they do something like char-by-char, as we do for wscons. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; is this a problem for scrolling, or for typing? &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; scrolling you can coalesce as long as the timeout is short. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; the scrolling seems fine. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; and it'd be a LOT better than char-by-char. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; so it's just typing? &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; the problem is for rendering the chars. e.g. "ls -l". &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; if you put a timeout say (out of my arse) 10ms. all chars that come in then go out at the same time &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; no one types that fast, so you see char by char, but ls gets done in one go &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; that would help for sure. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; try that. one transfer per char is not going to help you &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; the question is how to implement this in a nice manner ... sigh. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; several ways present themselves &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; font in offscreen memory, when you get a char make blit command for that char to where you want it. multi commands in one bulkt transfer (which is apparently ok) &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; and then send it after the timeout is done (if there is something)? &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; when the timeout fires, launch off all you've got &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; exactly &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; just queue up commands and put htem all in one bulk &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; the timeout will need tuning to be a good average between latency and bandwidth though &amp;lt;drahn&amp;gt; scrolls are a bit extra info in the queue &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; putting them in one bulk would improve it for sure. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; give it a try, and mail me the diff so I can see what you're doing &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; i'm curious, even though I don't understand the usb stack at all &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; the usb part is not difficult for this device, really. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; oh good. means I might get it. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; "ls -l /etc" takes about 5 seconds now to render. that's not nice ... &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; ok, thanks for the hints. maybe i can get something together which helps ... &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; for wsfb you'll want to provide a mmap area and sync that as well. that will suck though &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; horribly &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; it'll need a proper driver to be usabel for X &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; yes. there are different opinions for the X driver. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; some say, use wsfb, some say you need to write a own accel driver for X :-) &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; wsfb iirc mmaps the framebuffer, so you'd need to shadow it and update every X times a second &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; you'd need the compression at least for it to not suck &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; exactly. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; jup. and the compression part is missing from the rev. eng. as it looks. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; it'd help to know more about the hardware it really would &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; without compression wsfb will be FAR too slow &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; i believe so, too, now. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; no mmap over usb :( &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; no way. &amp;lt;miod&amp;gt; mglocker: can't you copy the font image to offscreen video memory and do screen-to-screen blt to display chars? &amp;lt;miod&amp;gt; that's the canonical trick. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; that was my suggestion, with batching to keep from too many bulks. &amp;lt;miod&amp;gt; ah &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; miod: i thought about that, too, but the bulk xfers keep the same. &amp;lt;miod&amp;gt; (not caught up with logs yet) &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; one per bitblit. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; i've even tested it. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; it doesn't help at all. it's exactly as slow as before. &amp;lt;miod&amp;gt; can you queue the xfers and schedule a batch of them 25 times per second? &amp;lt;deraadt&amp;gt; you can only request one blt per bulk? &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; the rev eng says you can do more, hence the batching &amp;lt;deraadt&amp;gt; sounds like a retarded protocol if you can only do one blt per bulk &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; miod: that's what oga suggested. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; yes you can queue more than one bitblit. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; but that would be i would need to "collect" chars. what oga said. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; and fire them on a timeout.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After going back to the drawing board, the driver performance improves, and it becomes worth commiting to the OpenBSD source code repository, so that people can try it and developers can work on improving it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first stab of a driver hits the tree on may 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three days later, possibly related to that commit, but we'll never know...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Date: Tue, 12 May 2009 20:08:44 +0100 From: Jason Slaughter (DisplayLink) To: Marcus Glocker Cc: Bernie Thompson (DisplayLink) Hello Marcus, Just an update on this: our source code library will be going live this Friday and you'll be able to find it by going to http://displaylink.org around Friday afternoon. We would be happy to send you a few DL-160 based USB to DVI graphics adapters if you think you would get good use out of them. If so, let me know how many you'd like and send me your mailing address. With any luck they'll get to you before the code goes live on displaylink.org. Thank you, Jason&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; oho. DisplayLink is answering again. &amp;lt;deraadt&amp;gt; heh &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; the will release the opensource driver this friday. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; and they want to send me DL-160 based USB to DVI graphic adapters. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; the library you mean? &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; jup. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; i'm sure i found a dl-160 going for 50 quid on amazon the other day &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; out of stock though &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; so, who wants to have such a toy? &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; I'd love one. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; ok, one for you, one for me, anyone else? &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; Florian Echtler will be glad to hear this. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; because the compression stuff is hard to crack. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; I wonder how complete the library will be &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; what license, by the way? &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; pretty complete i hope ;-) &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; hope is definitely the word. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; they wrote me about the license. some GPL shiz if i remember right ... &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; well it's a libusb library anyway, so it'll want a rewrite &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; GPL? if they're targetting X then they should know X uses MIT. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; *shrug* &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; after the last conversation i don't know how much they really know about X ... &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; probably they put the library out and hope somebody will write the X driver for them ... &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; time permitting i'll probably write one &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; it'll be either drm or wscons based depending on what I learn about the hardware &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; s/wscons/wsfb-style &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; oga: if you going to start on the X driver, we should sync with Florian maybe. it would be probably good if not three people start to write on the X driver when the library has been released I guess ... &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; yeah. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; if we're doing stuff with wscons for the driver though, then it won't work on linux. &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; I don't know how fbdev works. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; and he started some sourceforge page today, to find out about the compression stuff more :-) i'll forward him the mail from displaylink now.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three more days pass, and indeed, on may 15th...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;mglock&amp;gt; re &amp;lt;mglock&amp;gt; http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/libdlo &amp;lt;mglock&amp;gt; the library is online. &amp;lt;mglock&amp;gt; read first feedback from the displaylink rev. eng. mailling-list. &amp;lt;mglock&amp;gt; it seems to be useless. &amp;lt;mglock&amp;gt; since the whole compression stuff is missing. &amp;lt;mglock&amp;gt; need to look at it myself later.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5 hours later:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; mglock: displaylink rev. eng have a mailing list? &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; where? &amp;lt;mglock&amp;gt; erm, yes. &amp;lt;mglock&amp;gt; https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/displaylink-devel &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; mglock: thanks &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; hmmm, glancing at the library it is not that useful &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; disappointing&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2 hours later:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; mein gott! libdlo is ugly &amp;lt;oga&amp;gt; ERR_GOTO(function(args)) ...&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and 2 more hours later:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; i've setup another mail to displaylink asking them why they didn't include the compression stuff in their library :-)&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the same day, on the displaylink-devel list:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Date: 2009-05-15 13:59:30 From: Florian Echtler To: displaylink-devel mailing list Subject: Re: [Displaylink-devel] News from Displaylink &amp;gt; Sigh, pretty disappointing. LGPL licensed first and then it doesn't &amp;gt; contain the compression stuff. What do the think how people can &amp;gt; write an usable X.Org driver with this? I gonna ask them. All right, this is getting a bit ridiculous. Looking in dlo_usb.c, they labeled the "set encryption" request as "select channel", and the "null-key" for disabling encryption is called STD_CHANNEL. Okay, maybe just terminology. However, in dlo_data.h, there's suddenly always an DLO_MODE_ENABLE_* sequence (never seen that before), and the DLO_MODE_DATA stuff looks totally random. Hey, look, in mode_select(), it's always sending the ENABLE sequence to the "select channel" command, then the binary blob and then DLO_MODE_POSTAMBLE. Hmm, this POSTAMBLE looks just like the STD_CHANNEL default key! Oh, what a surprise, the register sets for the modes are _still_ encrypted - never mind that we can decrypt this since Christmas last year. Displaylink, I really don't get this. I'll have a closer look at the way the stride registers are implemented; this is one of the smaller parts which I still would like to figure out, but in general, this library is absolutely useless to the wider opensource community. It's obviously designed for some embedded shops which want to use it for non-realtime stuff like LCD signs etc., but it's just ridiculous to still try and obfuscate parts of an opensource library. Florian -- 0666 - Filemode of the Beast&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two more weeks pass, during which Florian Echtler continues his reverse engineering efforts and figures out the compression scheme used by the DisplayLink chip.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; for those who are interessted in the displaylink stuff ... the compression has been cracked. florian echtler did a library and showed it to the displaylink guys ;-) &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/libdlo/2009-May/000092.html &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; http://floe.butterbrot.org/external/tubecable-0.1.tar.bz2 &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; ~mglocker/dldemo2_mglocker.tar.gz &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; if you want to have a kind of C-style demo for the compression.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minor fixes to the udl driver occur on june 1st, then there is not much activity until Marcus resumes working on it, in order to add compression support.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On august 14th, he mentions the need for a compression table which could be stored on the filesystem, rather than in the kernel image:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; anyone mind if we would keep a 300kB huffman table in /etc/firmware? &amp;lt;miod&amp;gt; that's not really firmware... can't you generate the table at runtime? is this for udl evilness? &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; jup, for the huffman pixel difference compression. i could store the table into an *.h file, but i'm not sure if this is what we want. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; i don't think we can "generate" the table. &amp;lt;miod&amp;gt; but yes, although it's not technically firmware, it's loadable data, so why not &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; yeah. it's probably worth an exception in that case. &amp;lt;mglocker&amp;gt; i can draw some compressed stuff already, but some issues left to fix.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And on august 25th, compression support is added to the driver.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As more and more developers are trying the driver on as many platforms as possible, we start hitting situations where heavy screen adjustments would cause the output to stall, or some display updates to get lost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investigating these showed that the device was overflowed with requests, and needed time to process all the pending operations until further requests could be made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This was not very different from a serial line link, where the serial chip has a small (and sometimes nonexistent) FIFO queue, and no more characters can be transmitted when it gets full, until the characters get transmitted over the wire.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For serial links, the kernel handles this nicely, by forcing writers to sleep when the FIFO gets full, and waking them when space becomes available in the FIFO.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But for display terminal emulations, there was no such thing, because it was assumed that every display operation (output a character, draw the cursor shape, scroll the display in any direction) could be done without having to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And in fact, until the DisplayLink driver came into use, this was the case: display drivers either had full access to the display memory and could do the required changes directly in memory or, as e.g. for the Vax gpx driver [which I will write the story of soon...], by instructing the graphics controller to perform these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here, over the USB bus, bandwidth has to be shared with all the other USB devices on the controller, and the USB controller itself might not be able to queue enough requests for the udl needs - in other words, this is similar to the serial FIFO.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The graphics display being, from the kernel point of view, a special case of serial line, we could benefit from the FIFO behaviour, even though this had never been the case.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So a cheap and easy way to solve the "display gets overflowed with requests" problem would be to simply let the display operation routines (draw the cursor, paint a character...), which until now where `void` operations, return a value letting their caller know whether they had been able to perform the requested operation or not. The DisplayLink specific implementation of these requests could then return failure when the device FIFO is full, and let the upper layers know that they need to wait and force the process currently writing to the display, to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This would be a large, but mostly mechanical, change to all the display drivers in the OpenBSD source tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On august 30th, I suggested going in this direction:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Date: Sun, 30 Aug 2009 20:42:29 +0000 From: Miod Vallat To: private mailing list Subject: wsdisplay asynchronous processing After discussing udl(4) behaviour with mglocker@, we came to the following thoughts which I believe are worth sharing. wscons - and its wsdisplay output part - has been written 10 years ago with tga(4) and vga(4) style bitmapped devices in mind, with synchronous operations. This assumption was true, until we started to support video devices on which the video memory is not directly accessible. Examples of this are cfxga(4), gpx(4) on vax, and udl(4). The first two such drivers have been coerced to fit the synchronous model, because sending commands to the hardware was fast and did only involve the device registers. udl(4), however, is completely alien to this. Commands are sent with USB pipes, there might be other devices on the USB bus, and processing is asynchronous in nature. Now, if you look at wsdisplay, there are two conditions upon which wsdisplay will want to update the display contents: - userland writes to the wsdisplay terminal. wsdisplay is invoked from the tty layer, and has a process context, so it can sleep. - kernel writes to the console device. wsdisplay can not assume anything. So if we are able to flag devices such as udl(4) as not being able to be a console output device, then it will know that it can sleep at the wsdisplay level. Why am I talking about sleeping? Because udl(4) is currently the only wsdisplay(4) driver unable to behave synchronously. In order to complete its operation, it needs to get fifo resources and whatnot, and if none of them are available, there won't be any new resources available until the usb stack has a chance to run: udl(4) needs to sleep. Now if udl(4) is allowed to sleep, and the driver&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;wsdisplay interfaces are modified so that a driver can return EAGAIN if it is not a console device, then wsdisplay(4) can sleep. Problem solved.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and since the best way to figure out if such a proposal is worth doing is to write a proof-of-concept, the next day I shared a diff with Marcus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But that diff was larger and trickier that what my previous message implied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The reason for that, is that the graphics terminal is not simply a "line printer on a CRT". (and, writing this in 2025, I suppose some of my younger readers will not be familiar with Cathode Ray Tube displays)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An important improvement of CRT displays above line printers is that most CRT terminals have an addressable cursor position; this opens the road towards fancy displays (nowadays with colours!), first to implement IBM 3270 terminal emulators, later for more generic needs, thanks to the termcap and/or terminfo abstractions, and eventually the curses library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OpenBSD workstation console terminal emulation tries to mimic two well-known console devices, the Digital VT220 terminal (minus several seldom used features difficult to implement cleanly, such as double-width characters) on most platforms, and the Sun console (with extra features such as colour) on sparc and sparc64 ports. (I tried to have the luna88k port, which defaults to black on white display like the Sun systems, to use the sun terminal emulation, but got outpowered).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both these terminal emulations have in common that they recognize specific escape sequences, e.g. to change the cursor position, change output colours, or other specific operations. Also, simply outputting a regular character expands to at least three display operations: hide the cursor, draw the character, and draw the cursor in its new position; and if the character had been the last on the last line, the display needs to scroll, which involves one more operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If display drivers were able to fail any operations, as allowed in my proposal, we could end up with a particular output operation processed only partly. But the tty layer in the kernel has no way to know that a character has been, sort of, "partially output". In this layer, a character has either been output, or needs to be output, and nothing in-between. Any finer-grained state needs to be maintained in a lower layer, such as the vt220 emulation code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, in addition to allowing display drivers to fail operations, I wrapped the terminal emulation processing into what I called an "abort state", remembering at which point we encountered a failure, so that attempting to output a character would skip the operations which had succeeded already.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With my changes, a character output would only be "validated" if all the display operations it would cause had been successful. If not, the process writing to the display would be forced to sleep, until the display driver reports it is able to process requests again. Processing of the display operations would note which operations had been successful, so as to skip them and only perform the operations which had failed or had no chance to start earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Date: Mon, 31 Aug 2009 22:00:27 +0000 From: Miod Vallat To: Marcus Glocker Subject: early wscons `ok to stall' diff This should be enough for an i386 or amd64 kernel to compile. Many frame buffer drivers still need to be modified due to interface and prototypes changes. How does it work? Well, this adds an error path from the display driver to the tty layer. So we have this path: 1. void wsdisplay_emulops routines now return values. The driver implementing them can return 0 if it did the work, or nonzero (preferrably EAGAIN) if it couldn't. Note that generic rasops routines, accessing frame buffer memory, never fail and always return zero. 2. the return values of the emulops are now tested in the wsdisplay emulation code. This is the horrible part with a lot of changes, which will need careful review. 3. I designed this so that, when the emulops return an error, the emulation state machine is moved back to a sane state, allowing the operation to be tried again later. This involves undoing logical cursor moves, and other internal state changes. Note the code currently assumes an operation involving several emulops can fail in the middle and be restarted from the beginning - this is wrong, e.g. when scrolling the tty, since we copy rows and then clear the bottom row. If the copy works but the clearing fails, we'll restart with the copy. I am aware of this and working on an `abort state' part of the emulation state machine (which is currently the FALSE_ABORT bit in the per-emulation flags, but needs to move into its own thing). (This is why this is an alpha diff...) 4. The error condition detected by the emulation causes the tty write to abort early. The MI wsdisplay code will now know how many chars have been processed, and if it detected an early abort, it will not try to write more characters, even if there are any left in the tty queue. 5. The same function already has logic to schedule a timeout if more tty data is pending. This timeout will try to feed the driver more work, but until it fires the driver can hopefully get some interrupts and gather resources to do so. What is left to do: 1. Update all MD frame buffer drivers (mechanical). 2. Finish the abort state design and correctly recover from a partial operation. 3. Update udl to return EAGAIN in the emulops. Known problems which won't be fixed soon: 1. Some operations do not come from the tty layer, but by keyboard events (emulation reset sequence), ioctl or timeouts (screen burner). We do not necessarily have a process context there, so sleeping is not an option. I need to extend some interfaces for the affected routines to know whether the caller can recover automatically (tty context), or not, and if not, whether it's ok to sleep or not. 2. There is no way, yet, for the driver which has returned EAGAIN to cause the tty timeout to be triggered earlier (i.e. as soon as it regains resources). I'll think about it eventually. Miod (and now time for some zzz)&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next day, I received the best testimonial ever for a diff:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;mglock&amp;gt; hi from udl over wscons with initial EAGAIN support :-) &amp;lt;mglock&amp;gt; miod is evil.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After more testing, on september 1st, a new version of that diff was shared:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Date: Tue, 1 Sep 2009 20:19:02 +0000 From: Miod Vallat To: private mailing list Subject: Re: wsdisplay asynchronous processing In case people are interested, I have a monster diff (which will be split in 4 different pieces), which implements error path from the display drivers up to the tty layer, so that the driver can cause tty output to stop if it is overflowed. The tty layer (well, the wsdisplay tty code) will then nicely recover from this, and everything is fine. This diff has the disavantage of adding about 1KB of code to the kernel (for kernels with vt100 emulation), so this might be a problem for the floppies. And there is no way to disable this if SMALL_KERNEL. Unless you want to dive in your own sea of macro hell filled with sharks. Due the large size of the diff (about 200KB, affecting 51 files), I will not append it to this mail. People interested in it can find it in cvs:~miod/wscons-stall2.vari Note that, for it to be really useful on udl(4) devices - since they are the reason for this work - you need another diff from mglocker@, adding the necessary EAGAIN code in udl(4). $ wc wscons-stall2.vari 7017 26187 194603 wscons-stall2.vari Miod&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The monster diff started with the following description:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;This diff is large because many frame buffer drivers need to be modified due to interface and prototype changes. How does it work? Well, this adds an error path from the display driver to the tty layer. So we have this path: 1. void wsdisplay_emulops routines now return values. The driver implementing them can return 0 if it did the work, or nonzero (preferrably EAGAIN or EINTR) if it couldn't. Note that generic rasops routines, accessing frame buffer memory, never fail and always return zero. 2. the return values of the emulops are now tested in the wsdisplay emulation code. This is the horrible part with a lot of changes, which will need careful review. 3. I designed this so that, when the emulops return an error, the emulation state machine is moved back to a sane state, allowing the operation to be tried again later. This involves undoing logical cursor moves, and other internal state changes. Note there might be bugs in the undoing so far, I need to review this carefully. And test too (-: There are comments in wsemulvar.h trying to explain how I keep track of failures occuring in the middle of a `character' (from the tty layer point of view) output. 4. The error condition detected by the emulation causes the tty write to abort early. The MI wsdisplay code will now know how many chars have been processed, and if it detected an early abort, it will not try to write more characters, even if there are any left in the tty queue. 5. The same function already has logic to schedule a timeout if more tty data is pending. This timeout will try to feed the driver more work, but until it fires the driver can hopefully get some interrupts and gather resources to do so. Note that it is not necessary to implement a faster output resume path (e.g. if the driver gets an interrupt and frees resources), as the timeout will run only 8ms later (1/128 second). Keep in mind the human persistance of vision is about 1/25 second, so in the blink of an eye the wsdisplay code can resume stalled output several times. Problems left with this code: 1. You may notice resetop() does not check for emulops failure. This because this is an out-of-tty-layer processing (but ioctl issued to the tty device). I know how to make it able to recover, but this will need a few more emulops prototypes changes, and I would like to keep the focus of this diff minimal (har, har), i.e. trying to only address one problem. A later diff will address that area. 2. The same comments apply to the screen burner code. Again, I have plans for this. How I intend to split this work in individual commits: 1. internal wsemul changes to change the state machine functions from returning u_int to returning void (and updating emul state structs directly), so that they can later be changed again to return errors. (no functional change, but little code growth) 2. emulops prototype changes (and all the rasops / driver part of this diff). (again, no functional change, but little code growth) 3. wsemul_ops change of output() to return the number of chars consumed, and the corresponding logic in wsdisplaystart(), with the emulation code returning the number of chars it has been given (again, no functional change, but little code growth) 4. the error path handling in the emulation code, i.e. the evil part of this diff.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Of course, testing exposed a few bugs in that diff, which led to a new version:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Date: Wed, 2 Sep 2009 16:17:06 +0000 From: Miod Vallat To: private mailing list Subject: Re: wsdisplay asynchronous processing New diff fixing a few bugs in the previous diff (description of changes at the head of the new diff). cvs:~miod/wscons-stall3.vari $ wc wscons-stall3.vari 7074 26494 196861 wscons-stall23vari Miod&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And while writing this, I am dissatisfied with past me. It was not a wise idea to put the details in a file which is now long gone, and I should have put them both in the file and in the email. But I did not think that future me would want to tell this story, years later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, it turns out that I had sent that diff directly to Marcus minutes later:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Date: Wed, 2 Sep 2009 16:13:51 +0000 From: Miod Vallat To: Marcus Glocker Subject: latest wscons diff This is diff #3. Changes since last diff: - rearrange changes to wsdisplaystart() so as not to introduce a new goto. - minor simplification in wsemul_sun when backing out state changes because of failed scrollup operation. - rearrange some double-wide array updates in vt100 to be able to correctly recover from operations aborted in the middle. This double width feature is something noone uses anyway. - wrap the COPYCOLS and ERASECOLS operations in vt100 within WSEMULOP so that they will not be reissued by mistake if failure occurs after they're done. This ought to have been in the previous diff but I forgot to do this.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And some time later:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Date: Thu, 3 Sep 2009 22:00:06 +0000 From: Miod Vallat To: Marcus Glocker Subject: Re: udl Even better, with a diff that still compiles after the untested last minute change. This is diff #4. Changes since last diff: - removed udl.c changes, get them from mglocker@ - fixed an unitialized variable in wsemul_vt100_output() causing cursor image display to sometimes be skipped. - extended the abort state with four different states (ok, failed to display the cursor image, failed to jump scroll, failed a regular operation) instead of two (ok/fail) and having the `fail cursor' a particular state of failure. This allows me to make things a bit more clean (arguably) and two fix two important bugs: + after a regular failure, jump scroll would be attempted before the other operation; if the failure had happened after N operations we would then skip N operations during the jump scroll (usually causing the scroll not to happen, so lines would be overwritten instead of scrolling). + after a jump scroll failure, we need to retry it with the same number of lines as the failed operation, so that the copy/erase parts of the scrolling operation are consistent with each other.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eventually Marcus confirms it works:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;From: Miod Vallat To: Marcus Glocker Subject: Re: udl &amp;gt; This diff works pretty fine for me! I can't spot any bugs anymore yet, &amp;gt; even when running in a screen session with crazzy apps like irssi and &amp;gt; mutt. Excellent.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having been able to wrap these operations in specfic macros to hide the note-and-restart logic, this allowed installation media kernels (which would not embed the DisplayLink driver) to use the previous "nothing can fail" logic, in order not to grow these kernels and still allow them to fit on 3"Â½ floppy installation media. This work eventually got commited on september 5th, in multiple steps and then some...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;...and udl made use of it immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On september 11th, this allowed to nicely fix a diresome situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And since I am only human, a small bugfix was needed on the 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After these changes, there have been no problem reports with DisplayLink devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Later this month, an X server, based upon the "damage" extension which describes areas which need to be redrawn, was also added to the OpenBSD source tree, and support for the DisplayLink devices was now complete.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This allowed "serial console-only" platforms such as the armish and landisk ports to use a graphics console and run an X server.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And even if there had been no X server support, the DisplayLink driver forced the console code to face new challenges and solve them in a way which will benefit future drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, DisplayLink still exists as part of Synaptics, and their most recent chips are supported neither by Linux nor by OpenBSD with open source drivers. Synpatics provides a binary driver for Ubuntu, which to this day hasn't been reverse engineered, yet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The usefulness of these devices has apparently gone away, people do not seem to be interested by these devices anymore those days.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;我们对M2.1的发布而兴奋！我们的用户已经离不开MiniMax提供的最优秀的编程辅助能力和高性价比，内测显示，M2.1在架构设计、服务编排、代码评审直至部署上线的全链路环节中均表现优异，速度与资源效率均处于领先水平。&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;我们的用户非常喜欢 MiniMax M2 在编码能力与效率方面的表现。最新发布的 M2.1 在此基础上实现了速度与可靠性的实质性提升，并在更多语言及框架中保持稳定输出。对于强调高吞吐、Agentic Coding且对速度与成本敏感的研发流程，M2.1 是稳妥且具性价比的选择。&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;如何使用&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;MiniMax-M2.1 API 已在 MiniMax开放平台 开放使用：https://platform.minimaxi.com/docs/guides/text-generation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;基于 MiniMax-M2.1 的通用 Agent 产品 MiniMax Agent 现已全面开放使用：https://agent.minimaxi.com/&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;开源以及本地部署使用：https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.1 (为了保证 M2.1 的使用精度, 我们在与多个部署平台对齐测试, 并在两天后全面开源权重)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;为了方便用户使用, 我们提供了两个版本的 API, M2.1 和 M2.1-lightning。这两个 API 结果完全一样, 但是后者速度更快, 方便对 TPS 有需求的用户来使用。同时, 在 M2 手动 Cache 的基础上, M2.1 全面支持自动 Cache, 无需设置, 自动生效, 为开发者带来更流畅的体验、更低的成本与更优的延时表现。&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;我们在 Coding Plan 里面会根据资源负载给用户提供大比例的 M2.1-lightning, 并保持 Coding Plan 的价格不变。也就是说, Coding Plan 用户免费获得了大部分时间更快的推理速度。欢迎大家点击下单~&lt;/p&gt;
