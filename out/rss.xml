  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About four months ago I quit my job at Doublepoint and decided to start my own thing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'd been working on a little project with Pedrique (who would become my co-founder) for a bit over half-a-year and decided I had enough signal to determine he was someone I wanted to start a business with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was excited about the idea we were working on at the time (we were live with paying customers and truly believed in the thesis), but in hindsight, being truly honest about my motivations, I mostly wanted to run my own thing. In a dream world I'd have had the "idea of my life" while working at PostHog or Doublepoint and have gone on to build that with maximum conviction but this wasn't the case, so I got tired of waiting for a spark and decided to go out and make it happen, with the idea we were working on being our best bet at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I'd just quit my job, I had my finances well in order. Thus, my ideal scenario would have been to keep working on the product we had, try to scale it, and if that didn't work, try something else, then something else, until something did indeed really get off the ground, and only at that point we would consider whether or not to raise VC funding, depending on whether it made sense or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My ideal scenario wasn't going to work for Pedrique, though. He had told me for a while that the money he had saved up for trying to build his own thing was running out and that soon he'd need to start freelancing or something to make some income in order to sustain the search for a little longer. Prior to us working together, he had a bit of success with his MicroSaaS products but only just enough to increase his personal runway, which was now reasonably short.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We had spoken about this before, but with me now being 110% in, we had to do something about it. I had just come in full-time so we weren't about to go back to a dynamic where one person was full-time and the other part-time because they needed to make ends meet. The decision then became clear: we're gonna raise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that point, it was an easy decision to make. Again, we have two co-founders who have a lot of confidence in each other, and we don't want to let the opportunity pass us by. So while this wasn't my ideal choice, we were a business now and this was the best decision for the company. "Just don't die" goes the advice I think, and Skald had just then been born.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And so raise we did. We brought in four phenomenal angels, including, and this is relevant, my last few bosses (PostHog co-founders James and Tim and Doublepoint co-founder Ohto), and then decided to look for an early-stage fund. We eventually landed with Broom Ventures and passed up on a few other opportunities to limit dilution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great, right? I didn't need a salary yet, but for equality purposes, I now had one. Our investors are amazing. James and Ohto have been particularly helpful as angels (thank you!), and our investors are all founders of successful companies, including Jeff and Dan, the Broom GPs. We're super early, but Broom has been massively helpful and all-around just a great hands-off VC to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most importantly, none of them put any pressure on us. All understand the nature of pre-seed investing well, and that can't be said about all the potential investors we took meetings with.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So some time passes and we decide to pivot. We're really excited about the new idea. We launch and get a bit of early traction. The open source project is doing well, but we're struggling to monetize. We fail to close a few customers and the traction wanes a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then I find myself fucked in the head.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And here's where we get to the point that I'm not sure I should be talking publicly about. Does this hurt my image a bit? Maybe. Do I look like I'm not cut for this? Potentially. But I've always appreciated when people share about the process rather than just talking about things in hindsight, and reflecting while things are happening + being super transparent publicly is how I am. You're witnessing my growth, live, as I type these words.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, so what happened is I found myself spending days with my head spinning, searching for ideas. I'm angry, I'm annoyed, and I'm not being super productive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As I dug deeper into these feelings, I realized I was feeling pressured. We weren't making that much money, we weren't growing super fast. Then you look around and see "startup X gets to $1M ARR a month after launch" and shit like that and I'm feeling terrible about how we're barely growing. I'm thinking people that I really respect and admire have placed a bet on me and I'm letting them down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Except they're not saying this, I am.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's an interesting reflection that came up in a discussion between me and my girlfriend a few months prior that I realized applied to me, but in reverse. It's much more comfortable to be the person that "could be X" than to be the person that tries to actually do it. We were speaking about this regarding people who have a clear innate talent for something like music or sports but don't practice at all. Everyone says things like "you'd be the best at this if you just practiced more" but then they never do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing is: it's a lot easier to live your life thinking you could have done X if you wanted to, than to "disappoint" these people that believed in you by trying and failing. You can always lean on this idea in your head of what you could have been, and how everyone believed in you so it must be true, but you just chose not to follow that path.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my case, I found myself on the other side of that coin. Throughout my career, I've always had really high ownership roles, and have been actively involved in a couple 0 to 1 journeys. This led me throughout my career to get many comments about how great of a founder I'd be or how I have the "founder profile". I led teams, I wore a bunch of different hats, I worked hard as fuck, and I always thought about the big picture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those traits led my former bosses to then invest in me, and now suddenly I have to, in my head, live up to all of this. I can no longer take solace in some excuse like "I could have been a founder but working full-time was the best financial decision (it almost always is) so I never started my own thing". I set foot down a path from which there's no return. I've begun my attempt. I can of course stop and try again later. But from now on, I'm either gonna be a successful founder, or I'm not. And if I'm not, I'll have to deal with having broken with the expectations that people had of me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There's a lot to unpack here, including what "success" means, and how most of what I say are other people's expectations are actually my own projected onto them (I've learned this about my relationship with my father too), but this post is already a bit too long so I'll save those for another time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the whole point here is not just that having raised this money from friends my head got a bit messy, but that I started to actually operate in a way that is counterproductive for my startup, while thinking I was actually doing what was best.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ideas we considered when pivoting were looked more through a lens of "how big does this feel" rather than "what problem does this solve and for who". The slow growth was eating me, and while slow growth is terrible and can be a sign that you're on the wrong path it needs to be looked at from an objectively strategic lens. Didn't we say we were going to build an open source community and only later focus on monetization? Is that a viable strategy? Do we actually have a sound plan? Those were the things I should have been thinking about, rather than looping on "we need something that grows faster".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The people who invested in us, invested in us, not whatever idea we pitched them. And the best thing we can do is to follow our own process for building a great business based on what we believe and know, rather than focusing on making numbers look good so I can feel more relieved the next time I send over an investor update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We have a ton to learn, particularly about sales (since we're both engineers), so we can't just be building shit for the sake of building shit because that's our comfort zone. But if our process is slower than company X on TechCrunch, that's fine. It's a marathon after all.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So after probably breaking many rules about what a founder should talk about publicly, what was my whole goal here? I mean, the main thing for me with posts like this is to get things off my chest. I've always said that the reason I publish writing that includes poems about my breakup, stories about falling in love, posts about my insecurities, and reflections about my dreams is that by there being the possibility of someone reading them (because technically it could be the case that nobody does) I can truly be who I really am in my day-to-day life. If I'm ok with there being the possibility of a friend I'll meet later today having read about how I felt during my last breakup, I can be myself with them without reservations, because I've made myself available to be seen. That's always been really freeing to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a side effect, I'd hope that if this does get read by some people, particularly those starting or looking to start a business, that they can reflect about themselves, their lives, and their companies through listening to my story. I thought about writing a short bullet list about lessons I learned from raising money and dealing with its aftermath here, but honestly, that's best left to the reader to figure out. We're all different, and how one person reacts to a set of circumstances will differ from someone else. Some people don't feel pressure at all, or at least not from friends or investors. Or they only respond positively to pressure (because it certainly has benefits too). Maybe they're better off than me. Maybe they're not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is my story, after all. I wish you the best of luck with yours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;P.S. I'm doing good now. I'm motivated and sharp. If someone finds themselves in a similar situation, feel free to shoot me an email if you're keen to talk. Happy to go over what was useful for me, which fell outside of the scope of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kip (meaning "grammatical mood" in Turkish) is an experimental programming language that uses Turkish grammatical cases as part of its type system. It demonstrates how natural language morphology—specifically Turkish noun cases and vowel harmony—can be integrated into programming language design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a research/educational project exploring the intersection of linguistics and type theory, not a production programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also a tutorial in Turkish and a tutorial in English that explains how to write Kip programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kip is experimental. Expect changes in syntax and behavior over time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For you to get a taste of what Kip looks like, here is an example program that prompts the user to enter a number and then prints that many of the Fibonacci numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(* İlk n Fibonacci sayısını yazdırır. *)
(bu tam-sayıyı) (şu tam-sayıyı) (o tam-sayıyı) işlemek,
  (onla 0'ın eşitliği) doğruysa,
    durmaktır,
  yanlışsa,
    bunu yazıp,
    şunu (bunla şunun toplamını) (onla 1'in farkını) işlemektir.

çalıştırmak,
  "Bir sayı girin:" yazıp,
  isim olarak okuyup,
  ((ismin tam-sayı-hali)
    yokluksa,
      "Geçersiz sayı." yazmaktır,
    n'nin varlığıysa,
      0'ı 1'i n'yi işlemektir).

çalıştır.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Language Features&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Installation&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Example Program&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;WASM Playground&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bytecode Cache&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Project Structure&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Testing&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Morphological Analysis&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;License&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kip uses Turkish noun cases (ismin halleri) to determine argument relationships in function calls:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Case&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Turkish Name&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Suffix&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Example&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Nominative&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Yalın hal&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;(none)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;sıfır&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Accusative&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-i hali&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-i, -ı, -u, -ü&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;sayıyı&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Dative&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-e hali&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-e, -a&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;sayıya&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Locative&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-de hali&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-de, -da, -te, -ta&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;listede&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Ablative&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-den hali&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-den, -dan, -ten, -tan&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;listeden&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Genitive&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Tamlayan eki&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-in, -ın, -un, -ün&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;sayının&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Instrumental&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-le eki&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-le, -la, ile&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;sayıyla&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Possessive (3s)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Tamlanan eki&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;-i, -ı, -u, -ü, -si, -sı&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;code&gt;ardılı&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Turkish cases mark grammatical relationships explicitly, Kip allows flexible argument ordering. These two calls are equivalent:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;(5'le 3'ün farkını) yaz.
(3'ün 5'le farkını) yaz.
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As long as arguments have different case suffixes or different types, Kip can determine which argument is which.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Define algebraic data types with Turkish syntax:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you only want to explore the language, you can start with &lt;code&gt;stack exec kip&lt;/code&gt; after a successful build.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clone this repository, then:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Quick install (macOS/Linux)
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

# Or manual build
stack build&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The TRmorph transducer is bundled at &lt;code&gt;vendor/trmorph.fst&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Start REPL
stack exec kip

# Execute a file
stack exec kip -- --exec path/to/file.kip

# Install to PATH
stack install&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A browser playground build is available under &lt;code&gt;playground/&lt;/code&gt;. It compiles the
non-interactive runner (&lt;code&gt;kip-playground&lt;/code&gt;) to &lt;code&gt;wasm32-wasi&lt;/code&gt; and ships a small
HTML/JS harness that runs Kip in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See &lt;code&gt;playground/README.md&lt;/code&gt; for prerequisites, toolchain setup, and build steps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kip stores a cached, type-checked version of each &lt;code&gt;.kip&lt;/code&gt; file in a sibling &lt;code&gt;.iz&lt;/code&gt; file. When you run a file again, Kip will reuse the &lt;code&gt;.iz&lt;/code&gt; cache if both the source and its loaded dependencies are unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to force a fresh parse and type-check, delete the &lt;code&gt;.iz&lt;/code&gt; file next to the source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.iz&lt;/code&gt; files include a compiler hash. If the compiler changes, the cache is invalidated automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George Platen could not conceal the longing in his voice. It was too much to suppress. He said, “Tomorrow’s 1 May. Olympics!”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He rolled over on his stomach and peered over the foot of his bed at his roommate. Didn’t he feel it, too? Didn’t this make some impression on him?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George’s face was thin and had grown a trifle thinner in the nearly year and a half that he had been at the House. His figure was slight but the look in his blue eyes was as intense as it had ever been, and right now there was a trapped look in the way his fingers curled against the bedspread.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George’s roommate looked up briefly from his book and took the opportunity to adjust the light-level of the stretch of wall near his chair. His name was Hali Omani and he was a Nigerian by birth. His dark brown skin and massive features seemed made for calmness, and mention of the Olympics did not move him.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I know, George.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George owed much to Hali’s patience and kindness when it was needed, but even patience and kindness could be overdone.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Was this a time to sit there like a statue built of some dark, warm wood?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George wondered if he himself would grow like that after ten years here and rejected the thought violently. No!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said defiantly, “I think you’ve forgotten what May means.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The other said,“I remember very well what it means. It means nothing! You’re the one who’s forgotten that. May means nothing to you, George Platen, and,' he added softly, “It means nothing to me, Hali Omani.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “The ships are coming in for recruits. By June, thousands and thousands will leave with millions of men and women heading for any world you can name, and all that means nothing?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Less than nothing. What do you want me to do about it, anyway?” Omani ran his finger along a difficult passage in the book he was reading and his lips moved soundlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George watched him. Damn it, he thought, yell scream; you can do that much. Kick at me, do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was only that he wanted not to be so alone in his anger. He wanted not to be the only one so filled with resentment, not to be the only one dying a slow death.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was better those first weeks when the Universe was a small shell of vague light and sound pressing down upon him. It was better before Omani had wavered into view and dragged him back to a life that wasn’t worth living.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani! He was old! He was at least thirty. George thought: Will I be like that at thirty? Will I be like that in twelve years?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And because he was afraid he might be, he yelled at Omani, “Will you stop reading that fool book?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani turned a page and read on a few words, then lifted his head with its skullcap of crisply curled hair and said, “What?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What good does it do you to read the book?” He stepped forward, snorted “More electronics,” and slapped it out of Omani’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani got up slowly and picked up the book. He smoothed a crumpled page without visible rancor. “Call it the satisfaction of curiosity,” he said. “I understand a little of it today, perhaps a little more tomorrow. That’s a victory in a way.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“A victory. What kind of a victory? Is that what satisfies you in life? To get to know enough to be a quarter of a Registered Electronician by the time you’re sixty-five?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Perhaps by the time I’m thirty-five.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And then who’ll want you? Who’ll use you? Where will you go?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No one. No one. Nowhere. I’ll stay here and read other books.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And that satisfies you? Tell me! You’ve dragged me to class. You’ve got me to reading and memorizing, too. For what? There’s nothing in it that satisfies me.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What good will it do you to deny yourself satisfaction?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It means I’ll quit the whole farce. I’ll do as I planned to do in the beginning before you dovey-lovied me out of it. I’m going to force them to — to —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani put down his book. He let the other run down and then said, “To what, George?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“To correct a miscarriage of justice. A frame-up. I’ll get that Antonelli and force him to admit he — he —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani shook his head. “Everyone who comes here insists it’s a mistake. I thought you’d passed that stage.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Don’t call it a stage,” said George violently. “In my case, it’s a fact. I’ve told you —�”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You’ve told me, but in your heart you know no one made any mistake as far as you were concerned.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Because no one will admit it? You think any of them would admit a mistake unless they were forced to? — Well: I’ll force them.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was May that was doing this to George; it was Olympics month. He felt it bring the old wildness back and he couldn’t stop it. He didn’t want to stop it. He had been in danger of forgetting.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “I was going to be a Computer Programmer and I can be one. I could be one today, regardless of what they say analysis shows.” He pounded his mattress. “They’re wrong. They must be.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“The analysts are never wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“They must be. Do you doubt my intelligence?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Intelligence hasn’t one thing to do with it. Haven’t you been told that often enough? Can’t you understand that?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George rolled away, lay on his back, and stared somberly at the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What did you want to be, Hali?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I had no fixed plans. Hydroponicist would have suited me, I suppose.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Did you think you could make it?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I wasn’t sure.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George had never asked personal questions of Omani before. It struck him as queer, almost unnatural, that other people had had ambitions and ended here. Hydroponicist!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “Did you think you’d make this?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No, but here I am just the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And you’re satisfied. Really, really satisfied. You’re happy. You love it. You wouldn’t be anywhere else.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Slowly, Omani got to his feet. Carefully, he began to unmake his bed. He said, “George, you’re a hard case. You’re knocking yourself out because you won’t accept the facts about yourself. George, you’re here in what you call the House, but I’ve never heard you give it its full title. Say it, George, say it. Then go to bed and sleep this off.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George gritted his teeth and showed them. He choked out, “No!”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Then I will,” said Omani, and he did. He shaped each syllable carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George was bitterly ashamed at the sound of it. He turned his head away.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;For most of the first eighteen years of his life, George Platen had headed firmly in one direction, that of Registered Computer Programmer. There were those in his crowd who spoke wisely of Spationautics, Refrigeration Technology, Transportation Control, and even Administration. But George held firm.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He argued relative merits as vigorously as any of them, and why not? Education Day loomed ahead of them and was the great fact of their existence. It approached steadily, as fixed and certain as the calendar — the first day of November of the year following one’s eighteenth birthday. After that day, there were other topics of conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;One could discuss with others some detail of the profession, or the virtues of one’s wife and children, or the fate of one’s space-polo team, or one’s experiences in the Olympics. Before Education Day, however, there was only one topic that unfailingly and unwearyingly held everyone’s interest, and that was Education Day.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What are you going for? Think you’ll make it? Heck, that’s no good. Look at the records; quota’s been cut. Logistics now—”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Or Hypermechanics now — Or Communications now — Or Gravitics now —&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Especially Gravitics at the moment. Everyone had been talking about Gravitics in the few years just before George’s Education Day because of the development of the Gravitic power engine.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Any world within ten light-years of a dwarf star, everyone said, would give its eyeteeth for any kind of Registered Gravitics Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The thought of that never bothered George. Sure it would; all the eyeteeth it could scare up. But George had also heard what had happened before in a newly developed technique. Rationalization and simplification followed in a flood. New models each year; new types of gravitic engines; new principles. Then all those eyeteeth gentlemen would find themselves out of date and superseded by later models with later educations. The first group would then have to settle down to unskilled labor or ship out to some backwoods world that wasn’t quite caught up yet.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Now Computer Programmers were in steady demand year after year, century after century. The demand never reached wild peaks; there was never a howling bull market for Programmers; but the demand climbed steadily as new worlds opened up and as older worlds grew more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He had argued with Stubby Trevelyan about that constantly. As best friends, their arguments had to be constant and vitriolic and, of course, neither ever persuaded or was persuaded.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;But then Trevelyan had had a father who was a Registered Metallurgist and had actually served on one of the Outworlds, and a grandfather who had also been a Registered Metallurgist. He himself was intent on becoming a Registered Metallurgist almost as a matter of family right and was firmly convinced that any other profession was a shade less than respectable.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“There’ll always be metal, he said, “and there’s an accomplishment in molding alloys to specification and watching structures grow. Now what’s a Programmer going to be doing? Sitting at a coder all day long, feeding some fool mile-long machine.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Even at sixteen, George had learned to be practical. He said simply, “There’ll be a million Metallurgists put out along with you.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Because it’s good. A good profession. The best.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But you get crowded out, Stubby. You can be way back in line. Any world can tape out its own Metallurgists, and the market for advanced Earth models isn’t so big. And it’s mostly the small worlds that want them. You know what per cent of the turn-out of Registered Metallurgists get tabbed for worlds with a Grade A rating. I looked it up. It’s just 13.3 per cent. That means you’ll have seven chances in eight of being stuck in some world that just about has running water. You may even be stuck on Earth; 2.3 per cent are.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan said belligerently, “There’s no disgrace in staying on Earth. Earth needs technicians, too. Good ones.” His grandfather had been an Earth-bound Metallurgist, and Trevelyan lifted his finger to his upper lip and dabbed at an as yet nonexistent mustache.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George knew about Trevelyan’s grandfather and, considering the Earth-bound position of his own ancestry, was in no mood to sneer. He said diplomatically, “No intellectual disgrace. Of course not. But it’s nice to get into a Grade A world, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan frowned. “If only one in a million makes it, what makes you think you’ll make it?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said guardedly, “I’ll make it.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He never dared tell anyone; not Trevelyan; not his parents; of exactly what he was doing that made him so confident. But he wasn’t worried. He was simply confident (that was the worst of the memories he had in the hopeless days afterward). He was as blandly confident as the average eight-year-old kid approaching Reading Day — that childhood preview of Education Day.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Of course, Reading Day had been different. Partly, there was the simple fact of childhood. A boy of eight takes many extraordinary things in stride. One day you can’t read and the next day you can. That’s just the way things are. Like the sun shining.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And then not so much depended upon it. There were no recruiters just ahead, waiting and jostling for the lists and scores on the coming Olympics. A boy or girl who goes through the Reading Day is just someone who has ten more years of undifferentiated living upon Earth’s crawling surface; just someone who returns to his family with one new ability.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;By the time Education Day came, ten years later, George wasn’t even sure of most of the details of his own Reading Day.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Most clearly of all, he remembered it to be a dismal September day with a mild rain falling. (September for Reading Day; November for. Education Day; May for Olympics. They made nursery rhymes out of it.) George had dressed by the wall lights, with his parents far more excited than he himself was. His father was a Registered Pipe Fitter and had found his occupation on Earth. This fact had always been a humiliation to him, although, of course, as anyone could see plainly, most of each generation must stay on Earth in the nature of things.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;There had to be farmers and miners and even technicians on Earth. It was only the late-model, high-specialty professions that were in demand on the Outworlds, and only a few millions a year out of Earth’s eight billion population could be exported. Every man and woman on Earth couldn’t be among that group.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;But every man and woman could hope that at least one of his children could be one, and Platen, Senior, was certainly no exception. It was obvious to him (and, to be sure, to others as well) that George was notably intelligent and quick-minded. He would be bound to do well and he would have to, as he was an only child. If George didn’t end on an Outworld, they would have to wait for grandchildren before a next chance would come along, and that was too far in the future to be much consolation.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Reading Day would not prove much, of course, but it would be the only indication they would have before the big day itself. Every parent on Earth would be listening to the quality of reading when his child came home with it; listening for any particularly easy flow of words and building that into certain omens of the future. There were few families that didn’t have at least one hopeful who, from Reading Day on, was the great hope because of the way he handled his trisyllabics.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Dimly, George was aware of the cause of his parents’ tension, and if there was any anxiety in his young heart that drizzly morning, it was only the fear that his father’s hopeful expression might fade out when he returned home with his reading.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The children met in the large assembly room of the town’s Education Hall. All over Earth, in millions of local halls, throughout that month, similar groups of children would he meeting. George felt depressed by the grayness of the room and by the other children, strained and stiff in unaccustomed finery.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Automatically, George did as all the rest of the children did. He found the small clique that represented the children on his floor of the apartment house and joined them.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan, who lived immediately next door, still wore his hair childishly long and was years removed from the sideburns and thin, reddish mustache that he was to grow as soon as he was physiologically capable of it.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan (to whom George was then known as Jawjee) said, “Bet you’re scared.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I am not,’ said George. Then, confidentially, “My folks got a hunk of printing up on the dresser in my room, and when I come home, I’m going to read it for them.” (George’s main suffering at the moment lay in the fact that he didn’t quite know where to put his hands. He had been warned not to scratch his head or rub his ears or pick his nose or put his hands into his pockets. This eliminated almost every possibility.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan put his hands in his pockets and said, “My father isn’t worried.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan, Senior, had been a Metallurgist on Diporia for nearly seven years, which gave him a superior social status in his neighborhood even though he had retired and returned to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Earth discouraged these re-immigrants because of population problems, but a small trickle did return. For one thing the cost of living was lower on Earth, and what was a trifling annuity on Diporia, say, was a comfortable income on Earth. Besides, there were always men who found more satisfaction in displaying their success before the friends and scenes of their childhood than before all the rest of the Universe besides.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan, Senior further explained that if he stayed on Diporia, so would his children, and Diporia was a one-spaceship world. Back on Earth, his kids could end up anywhere, even Novia.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Stubby Trevelyan had picked up that item early. Even before Reading Day, his conversation was based on the carelessly assumed fact that his ultimate home would be in Novia.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George, oppressed by thoughts of the other’s future greatness and his own small-time contrast, was driven to belligerent defense at once.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“My father isn’t worried either. He just wants to hear me read because he knows I’ll be good. I suppose your father would just as soon not hear you because he knows you’ll be all wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I will not be all wrong. Reading is nothing. On Novia, I’ll hire people to read to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Because you won’t be able to read yourself, on account of you’re dumb!”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Then how come I’ll be on Novia?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And George, driven, made the great denial, “Who says you’ll be on Novia? Bet you don’t go anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Stubby Trevelyan reddened. “I won’t be a Pipe Fitter like your old man.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Take that back, you dumbhead.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You take that back.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;They stood nose to nose, not wanting to fight but relieved at having something familiar to do in this strange place. Furthermore, now that George had curled his hands into fists and lifted them before his face, the problem of what to do with his hands was, at least temporarily, solved. Other children gathered round excitedly.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;But then it all ended when a woman’s voice sounded loudly over the public address system. There was instant silence everywhere. George dropped his fists and forgot Trevelyan.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Children,” said the voice, “we are going to call out your names. As each child is called, he or she is to go to one of the men waiting along the side walls. Do you see them? They are wearing red uniforms so they will be easy to find. The girls will go to the right. The boys will go to the left. Now look about and see which man in red is nearest to you —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George found his man at a glance and waited for his name to be called off. He had not been introduced before this to the sophistications of the alphabet and the length of time it took to reach his own name grew disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The crowd of children thinned; little rivulets made their way to each of the red-clad guides.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;When the name ‘George Platen’ was finally called, his sense of relief was exceeded only by the feeling of pure gladness at the fact that Stubby Trevelyan still stood in his place, uncalled.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George shouted back over his shoulder as he left, “Yay, Stubby, maybe they don’t want you.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;That moment of gaiety quickly left. He was herded into a line and directed down corridors in the company of strange children. They all looked at one another, large-eyed and concerned, but beyond a snuffling, “Quitcher pushing” and “Hey, watch out” there was no conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;They were handed little slips of paper which they were told must remain with them. George stared at his curiously. Little black marks of different shapes. He knew it to be printing but how could anyone make words out of it? He couldn’t imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was told to strip; he and four other boys who were all that now remained together. All the new clothes came shucking off and four eight-year-olds stood naked and small, shivering more out of embarrassment than cold. Medical technicians came past, probing them, testing them with odd instruments, pricking them for blood. Each took the little cards and made additional marks on them with little black rods that produced the marks, all neatly lined up, with great speed. George stared at the new marks, but they were no more comprehensible than the old. The children were ordered back into their clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;They sat on separate little chairs then and waited again. Names were called again and ‘George Platen’ came third.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He moved into a large room, filled with frightening instruments with knobs and glassy panels in front. There was a desk in the very center, and behind it a man sat, his eyes on the papers piled before him.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “George Platen?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” said George, in a shaky whisper. All this waiting and all this going here and there was making him nervous. He wished it were over.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The man behind the desk said, “I am Dr Lloyd, George. How are you?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The doctor didn’t look up as he spoke. It was as though he had said those words over and over again and didn’t have to look up any more.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I’m all right.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Are you afraid, George?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“N — no, sir,” said George, sounding afraid even in his own ears.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“That’s good,” said the doctor, “because there’s nothing to be afraid of you know. Let’s see, George. It says here on your card that your father is named Peter and that he’s a Registered Pipe Fitter and your mother is named Amy and is a Registered Home Technician. Is that right?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Y — yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And your birthday is 13 February,and you had an ear infection about a year ago. Right?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Do you know how I know all these things?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It’s on the card, I think, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“That’s right.” The doctor looked up at George for the first time and smiled. He showed even teeth and looked much younger than George’s father. Some of George’s nervousness vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The doctor passed the card to George. “Do you know what all those things there mean, George?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Although George knew he did not he was startled by the sudden request into looking at the card as though he might understand now through some sudden stroke of fate. But they were just marks as before and he passed the card back. “No, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Why not?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George felt a sudden pang of suspicion concerning the sanity of this doctor. Didn’t he know why not?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “I can’t read, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Would you like to read?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Why, George?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George stared, appalled. No one had ever asked him that. He had no answer. He said falteringly, “I don’t know, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Printed information will direct you all through your life. There is so much you’ll have to know even after Education Day. Cards like this one will tell you. Books will tell you. Television screens will tell you. Printing will tell you such useful things and such interesting things that not being able to read would be as bad as not being able to see. Do you understand?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Are you afraid, George?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Good. Now I’ll tell you exactly what we’ll do first. I’m going to put these wires on your forehead just over the corners of your eyes. They’ll stick there but they won’t hurt at all. Then, I’ll turn on something that will make a buzz. It will sound funny and it may tickle you, but it won’t hurt. Now if it does hurt, you tell me, and I’ll turn it off right away, but it won’t hurt. All right?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George nodded and swallowed.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Are you ready?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George nodded. He closed his eyes while the doctor busied himself. His parents had explained this to him. They, too, had said it wouldn’t hurt, but then there were always the older children. There were the ten- and twelve-year-olds who howled after the eight-year-olds waiting for Reading Day, “Watch out for the needle.” There were the others who took you off in confidence and said, “They got to cut your head open. They use a sharp knife that big with a hook on it,” and so on into horrifying details.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George had never believed them but he had had nightmares, and now he closed his eyes and felt pure terror.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He didn’t feel the wires at his temple. The buzz was a distant thing, and there was the sound of his own blood in his ears, ringing hollowly as though it and he were in a large cave. Slowly he chanced opening his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The doctor had his back to him. From one of the instruments a strip of paper unwound and was covered with a thin, wavy purple line. The doctor tore off pieces and put them into a slot in another machine. He did it over and over again. Each time a little piece of film came out which the doctor looked at. Finally, he turned toward George with a queer frown between his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The buzzing stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said breathlessly, “Is it over?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The doctor said, “Yes,” but he was still frowning.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Can I read now?’ asked George. He felt no different.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The doctor said, “What?” then smiled very suddenly and briefly. He said, “It works fine, George. You’ll be reading in fifteen minutes. Now we’re going to use another machine this time and it will take longer. I’m going to cover your whole head, and when I turn it on you won’t be able to see or hear anything for a while, but it won’t hurt. Just to make sure I’m going to give you a little switch to hold in your hand. If anything hurts, you press the little button and everything shuts off. All right?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;In later years, George was told that the little switch was strictly a dummy; that it was introduced solely for confidence. He never did know for sure, however, since he never pushed the button.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;A large smoothly curved helmet with a rubbery inner lining was placed over his head and left there. Three or four little knobs seemed to grab at him and bite into his skull, but there was only a little pressure that faded. No pain.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The doctor’s voice sounded dimly. “Everything all right, George?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And then, with no real warning, a layer of thick felt closed down all about him. He was disembodied, there was no sensation, no universe, only himself and a distant murmur at the very ends of nothingness telling him something — telling him — telling him —&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He strained to hear and understand but there was all that thick felt between.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Then the helmet was taken off his head, and the light was so bright that it hurt his eyes while the doctor’s voice drummed at his ears.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The doctor said, “Here’s your card, George. What does it say?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George looked at his card again and gave out a strangled shout. The marks weren’t just marks at all. They made up words. They were words just as clearly as though something were whispering them in his ears. He could hear them being whispered as he looked at them.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What does it say, George?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It says — it says — ‘Platen, George. Born 13 February 6492 of Peter and Amy Platen in...’” He broke off.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You can read, George,” said the doctor. “It’s all over.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“For good? I won’t forget how?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Of course not” The doctor leaned over to shake hands gravely. “You will be taken home now.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was days before George got over this new and great talent of his. He read for his father with such facility that Platen, Senior, wept and called relatives to tell the good news.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George walked about town, reading every scrap of printing he could find and wondering how it was that none of it had ever made sense to him before.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He tried to remember how it was not to be able to read and he couldn’t. As far as his feeling about it was concerned, he had always been able to read. Always.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;At eighteen, George was rather dark, of medium height, but thin enough to look taller. Trevelyan, who was scarcely an inch shorter, had a stockiness of build that made ‘Stubby’ more than ever appropriate, but in this last year he had grown self-conscious. The nickname could no longer be used without reprisal. And since Trevelyan disapproved of his proper first name even more strongly, he was called Trevelyan or any decent variant of that. As though to prove his manhood further, he had most persistently grown a pair of sideburns and a bristly mustache.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was sweating and nervous now, and George, who had himself grown out of ‘Jaw-jee’ and into the curt monosyllabic gutturability of ‘George,’ was rather amused by that.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;They were in the same large hall they had been in ten years before (and not since). It was as if a vague dream of the past had come to sudden reality. In the first few minutes George had been distinctly surprised at finding everything seem smaller and more cramped than his memory told him; then he made allowance for his own growth.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The crowd was smaller than it had been in childhood. It was exclusively male this time. The girls had another day assigned them.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan leaned over to say, “Beats me the way they make you wait.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Red tape,” said George. “You can’t avoid it.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan said, “What makes you so damned tolerant about it?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I’ve got nothing to worry about.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Oh, brother, you make me sick. I hope you end up Registered Manure Spreader just so I can see your face when you do.” His somber eyes swept the crowd anxiously.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George looked about, too. It wasn’t quite the system they used on the children. Matters went slower, and instructions had been given out at the start in print (an advantage over the pre-Readers). The names Platen and Trevelyan were well down the alphabet still, but this time the two knew it.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Young men came out of the education rooms, frowning and uncomfortable, picked up their clothes and belongings, then went off to analysis to learn the results.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Each, as he come out, would be surrounded by a clot of the thinning crowd. “How was it?” “How ’d it feel?” “Whacha think ya made?” “Ya feel any different?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Answers were vague and noncommittal.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George forced himself to remain out of those clots. You only raised your own blood pressure. Everyone said you stood the best chance if you remained calm. Even so, you could feel the palms of your hands grow cold. Funny that new tensions came with the years.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;For instance, high-specialty professionals heading out for an Outworld were accompanied by a wife (or husband). It was important to keep the sex ratio in good balance on all worlds. And if you were going out to a Grade A world, what girl would refuse you? George had no specific girl in mind yet; he wanted none. Not now! Once he made Programmer; once he could add to his name, Registered Computer Programmer, he could take his pick, like a sultan in a harem. The thought excited him and he tried to put it away. Must stay calm.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan muttered “What’s it all about anyway? First they say it works best if you’re relaxed and at ease. Then they put you through this and make it impossible for you to be relaxed and at ease.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Maybe that’s the idea. They’re separating the boys from the men to begin with. Take it easy, Trev.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Shut up.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George’s turn came. His name was not called. It appeared in glowing letters on the notice board.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He waved at Trevelyan. “Take it easy. Don’t let it get you.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was happy as he entered the testing chamber. Actually happy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The man behind the desk said, “George Platen?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;For a fleeting instant there was a razor-sharp picture in George’s mind of another man, ten years earlier, who had asked the same question, and it was almost as though this were the same man and he, George, had turned eight again as he had stepped across the threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;But the man looked up and, of course, the face matched that of the sudden memory not at all. The nose was bulbous, the hair thin and stringy, and the chin wattled as though its owner had once been grossly overweight and had reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The man behind the desk looked annoyed. “Well?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George came to Earth. “I’m George Platen, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Say so, then. I’m Dr Zachary Antonelli, and we’re going to be intimately acquainted in a moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He stared at small strips of film, holding them up to the light owlishly.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George winced inwardly. Very hazily, he remembered that other doctor (he had forgotten the name) staring at such film. Could these be the same? The other doctor had frowned and this one was looking at him now as though he were angry.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;His happiness was already just about gone.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Dr Antonelli spread the pages of a thickish file out before him now and put the films’s carefully to one side. “It says here you want to be a Computer Programmer.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Still do?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It’s a responsible and exacting position. Do you feel up to it?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Most pre-Educates don’t put down any specific profession. I believe they are afraid of queering it.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I think that’s right sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Aren’t you afraid of that?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I might as well be honest, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Dr Antonelli nodded, but without any noticeable lightening of his expression. “Why do you want to be a Programmer?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It’s a responsible and exacting position as you said, sir. It’s an important job and an exciting one. I like it and I think I can do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Dr Antonelli put the papers away, and looked at George sourly. He said, “How do you know you like it? Because you think you’ll be snapped up by some Grade A planet?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George thought uneasily: He’s trying to rattle you. Stay calm and stay frank.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “I think a Programmer has a good chance, sir, but even if I were left on Earth, I know I’d like it.” (That was true enough. I’m not lying, thought George.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“All right how do you know?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He asked it as though he knew there was no decent answer and George almost smiled. He had one.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “I’ve been reading about Programming, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You’ve been what?” Now the doctor looked genuinely astonished and George took pleasure in that.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Reading about it, sir. I bought a book on the subject and I’ve been studying it.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“A book for Registered Programmers?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But you couldn’t understand it.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Not at first. I got other books on mathematics and electronics. I made out all I could. I still don’t know much, but I know enough to know I like it and to know I can make it.” (Even his parents never found that secret cache of books or knew why he spent so much time in his own room or exactly what happened to the sleep he missed.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The doctor pulled at the loose skin under his chin. “What was your idea in doing that, son?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I wanted to make sure I would be interested, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Surely you know that being interested means nothing. You could be devoured by a subject and if the physical make-up of your brain makes it more efficient for you to be something else, something else you will be. You know that, don’t you?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I’ve been told that,” said George cautiously.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Well, believe it. It’s true.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Dr Antonelli said, “Or do you believe that studying some subject will bend the brain cells in that direction, like that other theory that a pregnant woman need only listen to great music persistently to make a composer of her child. Do you believe that?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George flushed. That had certainly been in his mind. By forcing his intellect constantly in the desired direction, he had felt sure that he would be getting a head start. Most of his confidence had rested on exactly that point.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I never-” he began, and found no way of finishing.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Well it isn’t true. Good Lord, youngster, your brain pattern is fixed at birth. It can be altered by a blow hard enough to damage the cells or by a burst blood vessel or by a tumor or by a major infection — each time, of course, for the worse. But it certainly can’t be affected by your thinking special thoughts.” He stared at George thoughtfully, then said, “Who told you to do this?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George, now thoroughly disturbed, swallowed and said, “No one, doctor. My own idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Who knew you were doing it after you started?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No one. Doctor, I meant to do no wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Who said anything about wrong? Useless is what I would say. Why did you keep it to yourself?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I — I thought they’d laugh at me.” (He thought abruptly of a recent exchange with Trevelyan. George had very cautiously broached the thought, as of something merely circulating distantly in the very outermost reaches of his mind, concerning the possibility of learning something by ladling it into the mind by hand, so to speak, in bits and pieces. Trevelyan had hooted, “George, you’ll be tanning your own shoes next and weaving your own shirts.” He had been thankful then for his policy of secrecy.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Dr Antonelli shoved the bits of film he had first looked at from position to position in morose thought. Then he said, “Let’s get you analyzed. This is getting me nowhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The wires went to George’s temples. There was the buzzing. Again there came a sharp memory of ten years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George’s hands were clammy; his heart pounded. He should never have told the doctor about his secret reading. It was his damned vanity, he told himself. He had wanted to show how enterprising he was, how full of initiative. Instead, he had showed himself superstitious and ignorant and aroused the hostility of the doctor. (He could tell the doctor hated him for a wise guy on the make.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And now he had brought himself to such a state of nervousness, he was sure the analyzer would show nothing that made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He wasn’t aware of the moment when the wires were removed from his temples. The sight of the doctor, staring at him thoughtfully, blinked into his consciousness and that was that; the wires were gone. George dragged himself together with a tearing effort. He had quite given up his ambition to be a Programmer. In the space of ten minutes, it had all gone.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said dismally, “I suppose no?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No what?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No Programmer?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The doctor rubbed his nose and said, “You get your clothes and whatever belongs to you and go to room 15-C. Your files will be waiting for you there. So will my report.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said in complete surprise, “Have I been Educated already? I thought this was just to —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Dr Antonelli stared down at his desk. “It will all be explained to you. You do as I say.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George felt something like panic. What was it they couldn’t tell him? He wasn’t fit for anything but Registered Laborer. They were going to prepare him for that; adjust him to it.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was suddenly certain of it and he had to keep from screaming by main force.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He stumbled back to his place of waiting. Trevelyan was not there, a fact for which he would have been thankful if he had had enough self-possession to be meaningfully aware of his surroundings. Hardly anyone was left, in fact, and the few who were looked as though they might ask him questions were it not that they were too worn out by their tail-of-the-alphabet waiting to buck the fierce, hot look of anger and hate he cast at them.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;What right had they to be technicians and he, himself, a Laborer? Laborer! He was certain!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was led by a red-uniformed guide along the busy corridors lined with separate rooms each containing its groups, here two, there five: the Motor Mechanics, the Construction Engineers, the Agronomists — There were hundreds of specialized Professions and most of them would be represented in this small town by one or two anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He hated them all just then: the Statisticians, the Accountants, the lesser breeds and the higher. He hated them because they owned their smug knowledge now, knew their fate, while he himself, empty still, had to face some kind of further red tape.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He reached 15-C, was ushered in and left in an empty room. For one moment, his spirits bounded. Surely, if this were the labor classification room, there would be dozens of youngsters present.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;A door sucked into its recess on the other side of a waist-high partition and an elderly, white-haired man stepped out. He smiled and showed even teeth that were obviously false, but his face was still ruddy and unlined and his voice had vigor.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “Good evening, George. Our own sector has only one of you this time, I see.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Only one?” said George blankly.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Thousands over the Earth, of course. Thousands. You’re not alone.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George felt exasperated. He said, “I don’t understand, sir. What’s my classification? What’s happening?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Easy, son. You’re all right. It could happen to anyone. He held out his hand and George took it mechanically. It was warm and it pressed George’s hand firmly. “Sit down, son. I’m Sam Ellenford.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George nodded impatiently. “I want to know what’s going on, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Of course. To begin with, you can’t be a Computer Programmer, George. You’ve guessed that I think.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, I have,’ said George bitterly. “What will I be, then?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“That’s the hard part to explain, George.” He paused, then said with careful distinctness, “Nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What!”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Nothing!”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But what does that mean? Why can’t you assign me a profession?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“We have no choice in the matter, George. It’s the structure of your mind that decides that.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George went a sallow yellow. His eyes bulged. “There’s something wrong with my mind?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“There’s something about it. As far as professional classification is concerned, I suppose you can call it wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But why?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ellenford shrugged. “I’m sure you know how Earth runs its Educational program, George. Practically any human being can absorb practically any body of knowledge, but each individual brain pattern is better suited to receiving some types of knowledge than others. We try to match mind to knowledge as well as we can within the limits of the quota requirements for each profession.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George nodded. “Yes, I know.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Every once in a while, George, we come up against a young man whose mind is not suited to receiving a superimposed knowledge of any sort.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You mean I can’t be Educated?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“That is what I mean.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But that’s crazy. I’m intelligent. I can understand —” He looked helplessly about as though trying to find some way of proving that he had a functioning brain.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Don’t misunderstand me, please”, said Ellenford gravely. “ You’re intelligent. There’s no question about that. You’re even above average in intelligence. Unfortunately that has nothing to do with whether the mind ought to be allowed to accept superimposed knowledge or not. In fact, it is almost always the intelligent person who comes here.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You mean I can’t even be a Registered Laborer?” babbled George. Suddenly even that was better than the blank that faced him. “What’s there to know to be a Laborer?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Don’t underestimate the Laborer, young man. There are dozens of subclassifications and each variety has its own corpus of fairly detailed knowledge. Do you think there’s no skill in knowing the proper manner of lifting a weight? Besides, for the Laborer, we must select not only minds suited to it but bodies as well. You’re not the type, George, to last long as a Laborer.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George was conscious of his slight build. He said, “But I’ve never heard of anyone without a profession.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“There aren’t many,” conceded Ellenford. “And we protect them.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Protect them?” George felt confusion and fright grow higher inside him.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You’re a ward of the planet, George. From the time you walked through that door, we’ve been in charge of you.” And he smiled.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was a fond smile. To George it seemed the smile of ownership; the smile of a grown man for a helpless child.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “You mean, I’m going to be in prison?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Of course not. You will simply be with others of your kind.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Your kind. The words made a kind of thunder in George’s ear.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ellenford said, “You need special treatment. We’ll take care of you.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;To George’s own horror, he burst into tears. Ellenford walked to the other end of the room and faced away as though in thought.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George fought to reduce the agonized weeping to sobs and then to strangle those. He thought of his father and mother, of his friends, of Trevelyan, of his own shame — He said rebelliously, “I learned to read.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Everyone with a whole mind can do that. We’ve never found exceptions. It is at this stage that we discover — exceptions. And when you learned to read, George, we were concerned about your mind pattern. Certain peculiarities were reported even then by the doctor in charge.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Can’t you try Educating me? You haven’t even tried. I’m willing to take the risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“The law forbids us to do that, George. But look, it will not be bad. We will explain matters to your family so they will not be hurt. At the place to which you’ll be taken, you’ll be allowed privileges. We’ll get you books and you can learn what you will.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Dab knowledge in by hand,” said George bitterly. “Shred by shred. Then, when I die I’ll know enough to be a Registered Junior Office Boy, Paper-Clip Division.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yet I understand you’ve already been studying books.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George froze. He was struck devastatingly by sudden understanding. “That’s it”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What is?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“That fellow Antonelli. He’s knifing me.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No, George. You’re quite wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Don’t tell me that.” George was in an ecstasy of fury. “That lousy bastard is selling me out because he thought I was a little too wise for him. I read books and tried to get a head start toward programming. Well, what do you want to square things? Money? You won’t get it. I’m getting out of here and when I finish broadcasting this —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was screaming.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ellenford shook his head and touched a contact.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Two men entered on catfeet and got on either side of George. They pinned his arms to his sides. One of them used an air-spray hypodermic in the hollow of his right elbow and the hypnotic entered his vein and had an almost immediate effect.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;His screams cut off and his head fell forward. His knees buckled and only the men on either side kept him erect as he slept.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;They took care of George as they said they would; they were good to him and unfailingly kind — about the way, George thought, he himself would be to a sick kitten he had taken pity on.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;They told him that he should sit up and take some interest in life; and then told him that most people who came there had the same attitude of despair at the beginning and that he would snap out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He didn’t even hear them.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Dr Ellenford himself visited him to tell him that his parents had been informed that he was away on special assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George muttered, “Do they know —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ellenford assured him at once,“We gave no details.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;At first George had refused to eat. They fed him intravenously. They hid sharp objects and kept him under guard. Hali Omani came to be his roommate and his stolidity had a calming effect.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;One day, out of sheer desperate boredom, George asked for a book. Omani, who himself read books constantly, looked up, smiling broadly. George almost withdrew the request then, rather than give any of them satisfaction, then thought: What do I care?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He didn’t specify the book and Omani brought one on chemistry. It was in big print, with small words and many illustrations. It was for teenagers. He threw the book violently against the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;That’s what he would be always. A teenager all his life. A pre-Educate forever and special books would have to be written for him. He lay smoldering in bed, staring at the ceiling, and after an hour had passed, he got up sulkily, picked up the book, and began reading.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It took him a week to finish it and then he asked for another.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Do you want me to take the first one back?” asked Omani.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George frowned. There were things in the book he had not understood, yet he was not so lost to shame as to say so.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;But Omani said, “Come to think of it, you’d better keep it. Books are meant to be read and reread.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was that same day that he finally yielded to Omani’s invitation that he tour the place. He dogged at the Nigerian’s feet and took in his surroundings with quick hostile glances.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The place was no prison certainly. There were no walls, no locked doors, no guards. But it was a prison in that the inmates had no place to go outside.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was somehow good to see others like himself by the dozen. It was so easy to believe himself to be the only one in the world so — maimed.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He mumbled, “How many people here anyway?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Two hundred and five, George, and this isn’t the only place of the sort in the world. There are thousands.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Men looked up as he passed, wherever he went; in the gymnasium, along the tennis courts; through the library (he had never in his life imagined books could exist in such numbers; they were stacked, actually stacked, along long shelves). They stared at him curiously and he returned the looks savagely. At least they were no better than he; no call for them to look at him as though he were some son of curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Most of them were in their twenties. George said suddenly, “What happens to the older ones?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani said, “This place specializes in the younger ones.” Then, as though he suddenly recognized an implication in George’s question that he had missed earlier, he shook his head gravely and said, “They’re not put out of the way, if that’s what you mean. There are other Houses for older ones.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Who cares?” mumbled George, who felt he was sounding too interested and in danger of slipping into surrender.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You might. As you grow older, you will find yourself in a House with occupants of both sexes.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;That surprised George somehow. “Women, too?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Of course. Do you suppose women are immune to this sort of thing?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George thought of that with more interest and excitement than he had felt for anything since before that day when — He forced his thought away from that.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani stopped at the doorway of a room that contained a small closed-circuit television set and a desk computer.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Five or six men sat about the television. Omani said, “This is a classroom.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “What’s that?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“The young men in there are being educated. Not,” he added, quickly, “in the usual way.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You mean they’re cramming it in bit by bit.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“That’s right. This is the way everyone did it in ancient times.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;This was what they kept telling him since he had come to the House but what of it? Suppose there had been a day when mankind had not known the diatherm-oven. Did that mean he should be satisfied to eat meat raw in a world where others ate it cooked?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “Why do they want to go through that bit-by-bit stuff?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“To pass the time, George, and because they’re curious.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What good does it do them?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It makes them happier.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George carried that thought to bed with him.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The next day he said to Omani ungraciously, “Can you get me into a classroom where I can find out something about programming?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani replied heartily, “Sure.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was slow and he resented it. Why should someone have to explain something and explain it again? Why should he have to read and reread a passage, then stare at a mathematical relationship and not understand it at once? That wasn’t how other people had to be.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Over and over again, he gave up. Once he refused to attend classes for a week.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;But always he returned. The official in charge, who assigned reading, conducted the television demonstrations, and even explained difficult passages and concepts, never commented on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George was finally given a regular task in the gardens and took his turn in the various kitchen and cleaning details. This was represented to him as being an advance, but he wasn’t fooled. The place might have been far more mechanized than it was, but they deliberately made work for the young men in order to give them the illusion of worth-while occupation, of usefulness. George wasn’t fooled.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;They were even paid small sums of money out of which they could buy certain specified luxuries or which they could put aside for a problematical use in a problematical old age. George kept his money in an open jar, which he kept on a closet shelf. He had no idea how much he had accumulated. Nor did he care.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He made no real friends though he reached the stage where a civil good day was in order. He even stopped brooding (or almost stopped) on the miscarriage of justice that had placed him there. He would go weeks without dreaming of Antonelli, of his gross nose and wattled neck, of the leer with which he would push George into a boiling quicksand and hold him under, till he woke screaming with Omani bending over him in concern.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani said to him on a snowy day in February, “It’s amazing how you’re adjusting.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;But that was February, the thirteenth to be exact, his nineteenth birthday. March came, then April, and with the approach of May he realized he hadn’t adjusted at all.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The previous May had passed unregarded while George was still in his bed, drooping and ambitionless. This May was different.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;All over Earth, George knew, Olympics would be taking place and young men would be competing, matching their skills against one another in the fight for a place on a new world. There would be the holiday atmosphere, the excitement, the news reports, the self-contained recruiting agents from the worlds beyond space, the glory of victory or the consolations of defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;How much of fiction dealt with these motifs, how much of his own boyhood excitement lay in following the events of Olympics from year to year; how many of his own plans —&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George Platen could not conceal the longing in his voice.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was too much to suppress. He said, “Tomorrow’s the first of May. Olympics!”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And that led to his first quarrel with Omani and to Omani’s bitter enunciation of the exact name of the institution in which George found himself.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani gazed fixedly at George and said distinctly, “A House for the Feeble-minded.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George Platen flushed. Feeble-minded!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He rejected it desperately. He said in a monotone, “I’m leaving.” He said it on impulse. His conscious mind learned it first from the statement as he uttered it.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani, who had returned to his book, looked up. “What?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George knew what he was saying now. He said it fiercely, “I’m leaving.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“That’s ridiculous. Sit down, George, calm yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Oh, no. I’m here on a frame-up, I tell you. This doctor, Antonelli, took a dislike to me. It’s the sense of power these petty bureaucrats have. Cross them and they wipe out your life with a stylus mark on some card file.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Are you back to that?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And staying there till it’s all straightened out. I’m going to get to Antonelli somehow, break him, force the truth out of him.” George was breathing heavily and he felt feverish. Olympics month was here and he couldn’t let it pass. If he did, it would be the final surrender and he would be lost for all time.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani threw his legs over the side of his bed and stood up. He was nearly six feet tall and the expression on his face gave him the look of a concerned Saint Bernard. He put his arm about George’s shoulder, “If I hurt your feelings —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George shrugged him off. “You just said what you thought was the truth, and I’m going to prove it isn’t the truth, that’s all. Why not? The door’s open. There aren’t any locks. No one ever said I couldn’t leave. I’ll just walk out.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“All right, but where will you go?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“To the nearest air terminal, then to the nearest Olympics center. I’ve got money.” He seized the open jar that held the wages he had put away. Some of the coins jangled to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“That will last you a week maybe. Then what?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“By then I’ll have things settled.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“By then you’ll come crawling back here,” said Omani earnestly, “with all the progress you’ve made to do over again. You’re mad, George.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Feeble-minded is the word you used before.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Well, I’m sorry I did. Stay here, will you?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Are you going to try to stop me?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani compressed his full lips. “No, I guess I won’t. This is your business. If the only way you can learn is to buck the world and come back with blood on your face, go ahead. — Well, go ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George was in the doorway now, looking back over his shoulder. “I’m going” — he came back to pick up his pocket grooming set slowly — “I hope you don’t object to my taking a few personal belongings.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani shrugged. He was in bed again reading, indifferent.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George lingered at the door again, but Omani didn’t look up. George gritted his teeth, turned and walked rapidly down the empty corridor and out into the night-shrouded grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He had expected to be stopped before leaving the grounds. He wasn’t. He had stopped at an all-night diner to ask directions to an air terminal and expected the proprietor to call the police. That didn’t happen. He summoned a skimmer to take him to the airport and the driver asked no questions.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Yet he felt no lift at that. He arrived at the airport sick at heart. He had not realized how the outer world would be. He was surrounded by professionals. The diner’s proprietor had had his name inscribed on the plastic shell over the cash register. So and so, Registered Cook. The man in the skimmer had his license up, Registered Chauffeur. George felt the bareness of his name and experienced a kind of nakedness because of it worse, he felt skinned. But no one challenged him. No one studied him suspiciously and demanded proof of professional rating.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George thought bitterly: Who would imagine any human being without one?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He bought a ticket to San Francisco on the 3 a.m. plane. No other plane for a sizable Olympics center was leaving before morning and he wanted to wait as little as possible. As it was, he sat huddled in the waiting room, watching for the police. They did not come.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was in San Francisco before noon and the noise of the city struck him like a blow. This was the largest city he had ever seen and he had been used to silence and calm for a year and a half now.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Worse, it was Olympics month. He almost forgot his own predicament in his sudden awareness that some of the noise, excitement, confusion was due to that.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Olympics boards were up at the airport for the benefit of the incoming travelers, and crowds jostled around each one. Each major profession had its own board. Each listed directions to the Olympics Hall where the contest for that day for that profession would be given; the individuals competing and their city of birth; the Outworld (if any) sponsoring it.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was a completely stylized thing. George had read descriptions often enough in the newsprints and films, watched matches on television, and even witnessed a small Olympics in the Registered Butcher classification at the county seat. Even that, which had no conceivable Galactic implication (there was no Outworlder in attendance, of course) aroused excitement enough.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Partly, the excitement was caused simply by the fact of competition, partly by the spur of local pride (oh, when there was a home-town boy to cheer for, though he might be a complete stranger), and, of course, partly by betting. There was no way of stopping the last.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George found it difficult to approach the board. He found himself looking at the scurrying, avid onlookers in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;There must have been a time when they themselves were Olympic material. What had they done? Nothing!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;If they had been winners, they would be far out in the Galaxy somewhere, not stuck here on Earth. Whatever they were, their professions must have made them Earth-bait from the beginning; or else they had made themselves Earth-bait by inefficiency at whatever high-specialized professions they had had.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Now these failures stood about and speculated on the chances of newer and younger men. Vultures!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;How he wished they were speculating on him.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He moved down the line of boards blankly, clinging to the outskirts of the groups about them. He had eaten breakfast on the strato and he wasn’t hungry. He was afraid, though. He was in a big city during the confusion of the beginning of Olympics competition. That was protection, sure. The city was full of strangers. No one would question George. No one would care about George.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;No one would care. Not even the House, thought George bitterly. They cared for him like a sick kitten, but if a sick kitten up and wanders off, well too bad, what can you do?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And now that he was in San Francisco, what did he do? His thoughts struck blankly against a wall. See someone? Whom? How? Where would he even stay? The money he had left seemed pitiful.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The first shamefaced thought of going back came to him. He could go to the police — He shook his head violently as though arguing with a material adversary.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;A word caught his eye on one of the boards, gleaming there: Metallurgist. In smaller letters, nonferrous. At the bottom of a long list of names, in flowing script, sponsored by Novia.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It induced painful memories: himself arguing with Trevelyan, so certain that he himself would be a Programmer, so certain that a Programmer was superior to a Metallurgist, so certain that he was following the right course, so certain that he was clever —&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;So clever that he had to boast to that small-minded, vindictive Antonelli. He had been so sure of himself that moment when he had been called and had left the nervous Trevelyan standing there, so cocksure.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George cried out in a short, incoherent high-pitched gasp. Someone turned to look at him, then hurried on. People brushed past impatiently pushing him this way and that. He remained staring at the board, openmouthed.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was as though the board had answered his thought. He was thinking ‘Trevelyan’ so hard that it had seemed for a moment that of course the board would say ‘Trevelyan’ back at him.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;But that was Trevelyan, up there. And Armand Trevelyan (Stubby’s hated first name: up in lights for everyone to see) and the right home town. What’s more, Trev had wanted Novia, aimed for Novia, insisted on Novia; and this competition was sponsored by Novia.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;This had to be Trev; good old Trev. Almost without thinking he noted the directions for getting to the place of competition and took his place in line for a skimmer.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Then he thought somberly: Trev made it! He wanted to be a Metallurgist, and he made it!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George felt colder, more alone than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;There was a line waiting to enter the hall. Apparently, Metallurgy Olympics was to be an exciting and closely fought one. At least, the illuminated sky sign above the ball said so, and the jostling crowd seemed to think so.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It would have been a rainy day, George thought, from the color of the sky, but San Francisco had drawn the shield across its breadth from bay to ocean. It was an expense to do so, of course, but all expenses were warranted where the comfort of Outworlders was concerned. They would be in town for the Olympics. They were heavy spenders. And for each recruit taken, there would be a fee both to Earth, and to the local government from the planet sponsoring the Olympics. It paid to keep Outworlders in mind of a particular city as a pleasant place in which to spend Olympics time. San Francisco knew what it was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George, lost in thought, was suddenly aware of a gentle pressure on his shoulder blade and a voice saving, “Are you in line here, young man?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The line had moved up without George’s having noticed the widening gap. He stepped forward hastily and muttered, “Sorry, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;There was the touch of two fingers on the elbow of his jacket and he looked about furtively.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The man behind him nodded cheerfully. He had iron-gray hair, and under his jacket he wore an old-fashioned sweater that buttoned down the front. He said, “I didn’t mean to sound sarcastic.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No offense.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“All right, then.” He sounded cozily talkative. “I wasn’t sure you might not simply be standing there, entangled with the line, so to speak. only by accident. I thought you might be a —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“A what?” said George sharply. “Why, a contestant, of course. You look young.” George turned away. He felt neither cozy nor talkative, and bitterly impatient with busybodies.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;A thought struck him. Had an alarm been sent out for him? Was his description known, or his picture? Was Gray-hair behind him trying to get a good look at his face?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He hadn’t seen any news reports. He craned his neck to see the moving strip of news headlines parading across one section of the city shield, somewhat lackluster against the gray of the cloudy afternoon sky. It was no use. He gave up at once. The headlines would never concern themselves with him. This was Olympics time and the only news worth headlining was the comparative scores of the winners and the trophies won by continents, nations, and cities.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It would go on like that for weeks, with scores calculated on a per capita basis and every city finding some way of calculating itself into a position of honor. His own town had once placed third in an Olympics covering Wiring Technician; third in the whole state. There was still a plaque saying so in Town Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George hunched his head between his shoulders and shoved his hands in his pocket and decided that made him more noticeable. He relaxed and tried to look unconcerned, and felt no safer. He was in the lobby now, and no authoritative hand had yet been laid on his shoulder. He filed into the hall itself and moved as far forward as he could.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It was with an unpleasant shock that he noticed Gray-hair next to him. He looked away quickly and tried reasoning with himself. The man had been right behind him in line after all.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Gray-hair, beyond a brief and tentative smile, paid no attention to him and, besides, the Olympics was about to start. George rose in his seat to see if he could make out the position assigned to Trevelyan and at the moment that was all his concern.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The hall was moderate in size and shaped in the classical long oval with the spectators in the two balconies running completely about the rim and the contestants in the linear trough down the center. The machines were set up, the progress boards above each bench were dark, except for the name and contest number of each man. The contestants themselves were on the scene, reading, talking together; one was checking his fingernails minutely.(It was, of course, considered bad form for any contestant to pay any attention to the problem before him until the instant of the starting signal.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George studied the program sheet he found in the appropriate slot in the arm of his chair and found Trevelyan’s name. His number was twelve and, to George’s chagrin, that was at the wrong end of the hall. He could make out the figure of Contestant Twelve, standing with his hands in his pockets, back to his machine, and staring at the audience as though he were counting the house. George couldn’t make out the face.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Still that was Trev.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George sank back in his seat. He wondered if Trev would do well. He hoped, as a matter of conscious duty, that he would, and yet there was something within him that felt rebelliously resentful. George, professionless, here, watching. Trevelyan, Registered Metallurgist, Nonferrous, there, competing.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George wondered if Trevelyan had competed in his first year. Sometimes men did, if they felt particularly confident — or hurried. It involved a certain risk. However efficient the Educative process, a preliminary year on Earth ('oiling the stiff knowledge’, as the expression went) insured a higher score.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;If Trevelyan was repeating, maybe he wasn’t doing so well. George felt ashamed that the thought pleased him just a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He looked about. The stands were almost full. This would be a well-attended Olympics, which meant greater strain on the contestants — or greater drive, perhaps, depending on the individual.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Why Olympics, he thought suddenly? He had never known. Why was bread called bread?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Once he had asked his father: “Why do they call it Olympics, Dad?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And his father had said: “Olympics means competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George had said: “Is when Stubby and I fight an Olympics, Dad?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Platen, Senior, had said: “No. Olympics is a special kind of competition and don’t ask silly questions. You’ll know all you have to know when you get Educated.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George, back in the present, sighed and crowded down into his seat.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;All you have to know!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Funny that the memory should be so clear now. “When you get Educated.” No one ever said, “If you get Educated.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He always had asked silly questions, it seemed to him now. It was as though his mind had some instinctive foreknowledge of its inability to be Educated and had gone about asking questions in order to pick up scraps here and there as best it could.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And at the House they encouraged him to do so because They agreed with his mind’s instinct. It was the only way.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He sat up suddenly. What the devil was he doing? Falling for that lie? Was it because Trev was there before him, an Educee, competing in the Olympics that he himself was surrendering?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He wasn’t feeble-minded! No!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And the shout of denial in his mind was echoed by the sudden clamor in the audience as everyone got to his feet. The box seat in the very center of one long side of the oval was filling with an entourage wearing the colors of Novia, and the word ‘Novia’ went up above them on the main board.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Novia was a Grade A world with a large population and a thoroughly developed civilization, perhaps the best in the Galaxy. It was the kind of world that every Earthman wanted to live in someday; or, failing that to see his children live in. (George remembered Trevelyan’s insistence on Novia as a goal — and there he was competing for it.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The lights went out in that section of the ceiling above the audience and so did the wall lights. The central trough, in which the contestants waited, became floodlit.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Again George tried to make out Trevelyan. Too far.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The clear, polished voice of the announcer sounded. “Distinguished Novian sponsors. Ladies. Gentlemen. The Olympics competition for Metallurgist, Nonferrous, is about to begin. The contestants are —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Carefully and conscientiously, he read off the list in the program. Names. Home towns. Educative years. Each name received its cheers, the San Franciscans among them receiving the loudest. When Trevelyan’s name was reached, George surprised himself by shouting and waving madly. The gray-haired man next to him surprised him even more by cheering likewise.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George could not help but stare in astonishment and his neighbor leaned over to say (speaking loudly in order to be heard over the hubbub), “No one here from my home town; I’ll root for yours. Someone you know?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George shrank back. “No.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I noticed you looking in that direction. Would you like to borrow my glasses?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No. Thank you.” (Why didn’t the old fool mind his own business?)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The announcer went on with other formal details concerning the serial number of the competition, the method of timing and scoring and so on. Finally, he approached the meat of the matter and the audience grew silent as it listened.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Each contestant will be supplied with a bar of nonferrous alloy of unspecified composition. He will be required to sample and assay the bar, reporting all results correctly to four decimals in per cent. All will utilize for this purpose a Beeman Microspectrograph Model FX-2, each of which is, at the moment, not in working order.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;There was an appreciative shout from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Each contestant will be required to analyze the fault of his machine and correct it. Tools and spare parts are supplied. The spare part necessary may not be present, in which case it must be asked for, and time of delivery thereof will be deducted from final time. Are all contestants ready?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The board above Contestant Five flashed a frantic red signal. Contestant Five ran off the floor and returned a moment later. The audience laughed good-naturedly.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Are all contestants ready?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The boards remained blank.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Any questions”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Still blank.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You may begin.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;There was, of course, no way anyone in the audience could tell how any contestant was progressing except for whatever notations went up on the notice board. But then, that didn’t matter. Except for what professional Metallurgists there might be in the audience, none would understand anything about the contest professionally in any case. What was important was who won, who was second, who was third. For those who had bets on the standings (illegal but unpreventable) that was all-important. Everything else might go hang.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George watched as eagerly as the rest, glancing from one contestant to the next, observing how this one had removed the cover from his microspectrograph with deft strokes of a small instrument; how that one was peering into the face of the thing; how still a third was setting his alloy bar into its holder; and how a fourth adjusted a vernier with such small touches that he seemed momentarily frozen.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan was as absorbed as the rest. George had no way of telling how he was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The notice board over Contestant Seventeen flashed:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Focus plate out of adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The audience cheered wildly.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Contestant Seventeen might be right and he might, of course, be wrong. If the latter, he would have to correct his diagnosis later and lose time. Or he might never correct his diagnosis and be unable to complete his analysis or, worse still, end with a completely wrong analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Never mind. For the moment, the audience cheered.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Other boards lit up. George watched for Board Twelve. That came on finally: ‘Sample holder off-center. New clamp depresser needed.’&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;An attendant went running to him with a new pan. If Trevelyan was wrong, it would mean useless delay. Nor would the time elapsed in waiting for the pan be deducted. George found himself holding his breath.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Results were beginning to go up on Board Seventeen, in gleaming letters: aluminum, 41.2649; magnesium, 22.1914; copper, 10.1001.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Here and there, other boards began sprouting figures.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The audience was in bedlam.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George wondered how the contestants could work in such pandemonium, then wondered if that were not even a good thing. A first-class technician should work best under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Seventeen rose from his place as his board went red-rimmed to signify completion. Four was only two seconds behind him. Another, then another.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan was still working, the minor constituents of his alloy bar still unreported. With nearly all contestants standing, Trevelyan finally rose, also. Then, tailing off, Five rose, and received an ironic cheer.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It wasn’t over. Official announcements were naturally delayed. Time elapsed was something, but accuracy was just as important. And not all diagnoses were of equal difficulty. A dozen factors had to be weighed.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Finally, the announcer’s voice sounded, “Winner in the time of four minutes and twelve seconds, diagnosis correct, analysis correct within an average of zero point seven parts per hundred thousand, Contestant Number — Seventeen, Henry Anton Schrnidt of —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;What followed was drowned in the screaming. Number Eight was next and then Four, whose good time was spoiled by a five part in ten thousand error in the niobium figure. Twelve was never mentioned. He was an also-ran. George made his way through the crowd to the Contestant’s Door and found a large clot of humanity ahead of him. There would be weeping relatives (joy or sorrow, depending) to greet them, newsmen to interview the top-scorers, or the home-town boys, autograph hounds, publicity seekers and the just plain curious. Girls, too, who might hope to catch the eye of a top-scorer, almost certainly headed for Novia (or perhaps a low-scorer who needed consolation and had the cash to afford it).&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George hung back. He saw no one he knew. With San Francisco so far from home, it seemed pretty safe to assume that there would be no relatives to condole with Trev on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Contestants emerged, smiling weakly, nodding at shouts of approval. Policemen kept the crowds far enough away to allow a lane for walking. Each high-scorer drew a portion of the crowd off with him, like a magnet pushing through a mound of iron filings.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;When Trevelyan walked out, scarcely anyone was left. (George felt somehow that he had delayed coming out until just that had come to pass.) There was a cigarette in his dour mouth and he turned, eyes downcast, to walk off. It was the first hint of home George had had in what was almost a year and a half and seemed almost a decade and a half. He was almost amazed that Trevelyan hadn’t aged, that he was the same Trev he had last seen.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George sprang forward. “Trev!”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan spun about, astonished. He stared at George and then his hand shot out. “George Platen, what the devil — ”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And almost as soon as the look of pleasure had crossed his face, It left. His hand dropped before George had quite the chance of seizing it.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Were you in there?’ A curt jerk of Trev’s head indicated the hall.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I was.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“To see me?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Didn’t do so well did I?” He dropped his cigarette and stepped on it, staring off to the street, where the emerging crowd was slowly eddying and finding its way into skimmers, while new lines were forming for the next scheduled Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan said heavily, “So what? It’s only the second time I missed. Novia can go shove after the deal I got today. There are planets that would jump at me fast enough — But, listen, I haven’t seen you since Education Day. Where did you go? Your folks said you were on special assignment but gave no details and you never wrote. You might have written.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I should have,” said George uneasily. “Anyway, I came to say I was sorry the way things went just now.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Don’t be,” said Trevelyan. “I told you. Novia can go shove — At that I should have known. They've been saying for weeks that the Beeman machine would be used. All the wise money was on Beeman machines. The damned Education tapes they ran through me were for Henslers and who uses Henslers? The worlds in the Goman Cluster if you want to call them worlds. Wasn’t that a nice deal they gave me?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Can’t you complain to —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Don’t be a fool. They’ll tell me my brain was built for Henslers. Go argue. Everything went wrong. I was the only one who had to send out for a piece of equipment. Notice that?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“They deducted the time for that, though.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Sure, but I lost time wondering if I could be right in my diagnosis when I noticed there wasn’t any clamp depresser in the parts they had supplied. They don’t deduct for that. If it had been a Hensler, I would have known I was right. How could I match up then? The top winner was a San Franciscan. So were three of the next four. And the fifth guy was from Los Angeles. They get big-city Educational tapes. The best available. Beeman spectrographs and all. How do I compete with them? I came all the way out here just to get a chance at a Novian-sponsored Olympics in my classification and I might just as well have stayed home. I knew it, I tell you, and that settles it. Novia isn’t the only chunk of rock in space. Of all the damned —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He wasn’t speaking to George. He wasn’t speaking to anyone. He was just uncorked and frothing. George realized that.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “If you knew in advance that the Beemans were going to be used, couldn’t you have studied up on them?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“They weren’t in my tapes, I tell you.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You could have read — books.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The last word had tailed off under Trevelyan’s suddenly sharp look.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan said, “Are you trying to make a big laugh out of this? You think this is funny? How do you expect me to read some book and try to memorize enough to match someone else who knows.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I thought —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You try it. You try —” Then, suddenly, “What’s your profession, by the way?” He sounded thoroughly hostile.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Well —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Come on, now. If you’re going to be a wise guy with me, let’s see what you’ve done. You’re still on Earth, I notice, so you’re not a Computer Programmer and your special assignment can’t be much.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “Listen, Trev, I’m late for an appointment.” He backed away, trying to smile.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No, you don’t.” Trevelyan reached out fiercely, catching hold of George’s jacket. “You answer my question. Why are you afraid to tell me? What is it with you? Don’t come here rubbing a bad showing in my face, George, unless you can take it, too. Do you hear me?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was shaking George in frenzy and they were struggling and swaying across the floor, when the Voice of Doom struck George’s ear in the form of a policeman’s outraged call.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“All right now. All right. Break it up.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George’s heart turned to lead and lurched sickeningly. The policeman would be taking names, asking to see identity cards, and George lacked one. He would be questioned and his lack of profession would show at once; and before Trevelyan, too, who ached with the pain of the drubbing he had taken and would spread the news back home as a salve for his own hurt feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George couldn’t stand that. He broke away from Trevelyan and made to run, but the policeman’s heavy hand was on his shoulder. “Hold on there. Let’s see your identity card.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Trevelyan was fumbling for his, saying harshly, “I’m Amand Trevelyan, Metallurgist, Nonferrous. I was just competing in the Olympics. You better find out about him, though, officer.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George faced the two, lips dry and throat thickened past speech.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Another voice sounded, quiet, well-mannered. “Officer. One moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The policeman stepped back. “Yes, sir?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“This young man is my guest. What is the trouble?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George looked about in wild surprise. It was the gray-haired man who had been sitting next to him. Gray-hair nodded benignly at George.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Guest? Was he mad?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The policeman was saying, “These two were creating a disturbance, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Any criminal charges? Any damages?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Well, then, I’ll be responsible.” He presented a small card to the policeman’s view and the latter stepped back at once.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Trevelyan began indignantly, “Hold on, now —” but the policeman turned on him.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“All right, now. Got any charges?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I just —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“On your way. The rest of you — move on.” A sizable crowd had gathered, which now, reluctantly, unknotted itself and raveled away.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George let himself be led to a skimmer but balked at entering.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “Thank you, but I’m not your guest.” (Could it be a ridiculous case of mistaken identity?)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;But Gray-hair smiled and said, “You weren’t but you are now. Let me introduce myself, I’m Ladislas Ingenescu, Registered Historian.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Come, you will come to no harm, I assure you. After all, I only wanted to spare you some trouble with a policeman.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But why?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Do you want a reason? Well, then, say that we’re honorary towns-mates, you and I. We both shouted for the same man, remember, and we towns-people must stick together, even if the tie is only honorary. Eh?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And George, completely unsure of this man, Ingenescu, and of himself as well, found himself inside the skimmer. Before he could make up his mind that he ought to get off again, they were off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He thought confusedly: The man has some status. The policeman deferred to him.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was almost forgetting that his real purpose here in San Francisco was not to find Trevelyan but to find some person with enough influence to force a reappraisal of his own capacity of Education.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It could be that Ingenescu was such a man. And right in George’s lap.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Everything could be working out fine — fine. Yet it sounded hollow in his thought. He was uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;During the short skimmer-hop, Ingenescu kept up an even flow of small talk, pointing out the landmarks of the city, reminiscing about past Olympics he had seen. George, who paid just enough attention to make vague sounds during the pauses, watched the route of flight anxiously.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Would they head for one of the shield-openings and leave the city altogether?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The skimmer landed at the roof-entry of a hotel and, as he alighted, Ingenescu said, “I hope you’ll eat dinner with me in my room?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “Yes,” and grinned unaffectedly. He was just beginning to realize the gap left within him by a missing lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu let George eat in silence. Night closed in and the wall lights went on automatically. (George thought: I’ve been on my own almost twenty-four hours.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And then over the coffee, Ingenescu finally spoke again. He said, “You’ve been acting as though you think I intend you harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George reddened, put down his cup and tried to deny it, but the older man laughed and shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It’s so. I’ve been watching you closely since I first saw you and I think I know a great deal about you now.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George half rose in horror.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu said, “But sit down. I only want to help you.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George sat down but his thoughts were in a whirl. If the old man knew who he was, why had he not left him to the policeman? On the other hand, why should he volunteer help?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu said, “You want to know why I should want to help you? Oh, don’t look alarmed. I can’t read minds. It’s just that my training enables me to judge the little reactions that give minds away, you see. Do you understand that?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu said, “Consider my first sight of you. You were waiting in line to watch an Olympics, and your micro-reactions didn’t match what you were doing. The expression of your face was wrong, the action of your hands was wrong. It meant that something, in general was wrong, and the interesting thing was that, whatever it was, it was nothing common, nothing obvious. Perhaps, I thought, it was something of which your own conscious mind was unaware.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George was in an agony of indecision. If this was a trap, why should it be such an indirect, roundabout one? And he had to turn to someone. He had come to the city to find help and here was help being offered. Perhaps what was wrong was that it was being offered. It came too easy.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu said, “Of course, what you tell me as a Social Scientist is a privileged communication. Do you know what that means?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It means, it would be dishonorable for me to repeat what you say to anyone for any purpose. Moreover no one has the legal right to compel me to repeat it.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, with sudden suspicion, “I thought you were a Historian.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“So I am.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Just now you said you were a Social Scientist.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;lngenescu broke into loud laughter and apologized for it when he could talk. “I’m sorry, young man, I shouldn’t laugh, and I wasn’t really laughing at you. I was laughing at Earth and its emphasis on physical science, and the practical segments of it at that. I’ll bet you can rattle off every subdivision of construction technology or mechanical engineering and yet you’re a blank on social science.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Well, then what is social science?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Social science studies groups of human beings and there are many high-specialized branches to it, just as there are to zoology, for instance. For instance, there are Culturists, who study the mechanics of cultures, their growth, development, and decay. Cultures,’ he added, forestalling a question, “are all the aspects of a way of life. For instance it includes the way we make our living, the things we enjoy and believe, what we consider good and bad and so on. Do you understand?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I think I do.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“An Economist — not an Economic Statistician, now, but an Economist — specializes in the study of the way a culture supplies the bodily needs of its individual members. A psychologist specializes in the individual member of a society and how he is affected by the society. A Futurist specializes in planning the future course of a society, and a Historian — That’s where I come in, now.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“A Historian specializes in the past development of our own society and of societies with other cultures.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George found himself interested. “Was it different in the past?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I should say it was. Until a thousand years ago, there was no Education; not what we call Education, at least.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “I know. People learned in bits and pieces out of books.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Why, how do you know this?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I’ve heard it said,’ said George cautiously. Then, “Is there any use in worrying about what’s happened long ago? I mean, it’s all done with, isn’t it?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It’s never done with, my boy. The past explains the present. For instance, why is our Educational system what it is?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George stirred restlessly. The man kept bringing the subject back to that. He said snappishly, “Because it’s best.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Ah, but why is it best? Now you listen to me for one moment and I’ll explain. Then you can tell me if there is any use in history. Even before interstellar travel was developed —” He broke off at the look of complete astonishment on George’s face. “Well, did you think we always had it?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I never gave it any thought, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I’m sure you didn’t. But there was a time, four or five thousand years ago, when mankind was confined to the surface of Earth. Even then, his culture had grown quite technological and his numbers had increased to the point where any failure in technology would have meant mass starvation and disease. To maintain the technological level and advance it in the face of an increasing population, more and more technicians and scientists had to be trained, and yet, as science advanced, it took longer and longer to train them.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Does it help you to understand knowing that without it, interstellar colonization was impossible for fifteen hundred years?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Then you see the uses of history.” The Historian smiled. “ And now I wonder if you see why I’m interested in you?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George snapped out of time and space back to reality. Ingenescu, apparently, didn’t talk aimlessly. All this lecture had been a device to attack him from a new angle.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, once again withdrawn, hesitating, “Why?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Social Scientists work with societies and societies are made up of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“All right.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But people aren’t machines. The professionals in physical science work with machines. There is only a limited amount to know about a machine and the professionals know it all. Furthermore, all machines of given sort are just about alike so that there is nothing to interest them in any given individual machine. But people, ah — They are so complex and so different one from another that a Social Scientist never knows all there is to know or even a good part of what there is to know. To understand his own specialty, he must always be ready to study people; particularly unusual specimens.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Like me,’ said George tonelessly.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I shouldn’t call you a specimen, I suppose, but you are unusual. You’re worth studying, and If you will allow me that privilege then, in return, I will help you if you are in trouble and if I can.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;There were pin wheels whirring in George’s mind. — All this talk about people and colonization made possible by Education. It was as though caked thought within him were being broken up and strewn about mercilessly.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “Let me think,” and clamped his hands over his ears.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He took them away and said to the Historian, “Will you do something for me, sir?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“If I can,” said the Historian amiably.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And everything I say in this room is a privileged communication. You said so.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And I meant it.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Then get me an interview with an Outworld official with — with a Novian.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu looked startled. “Well, now —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You can do it,’ said George earnestly. “You’re an important official. I saw the policeman’s look when you put that card in front of his eyes. If you refuse, I — I won’t let you study me.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;It sounded a silly threat in George’s own ears, one without force. On Ingenescu, however, it seemed to have a strong effect.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “That’s an impossible condition. A Novian in Olympics month —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“All right, then, get me a Novian on the phone and I’ll my own arrangements for an interview.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Do you think you can?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I know I can. Wait and see.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu stared at George thoughtfully and then reached for the visiphone.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George waited, half drunk with this new outlook on the whole problem and the sense of power it brought. It couldn’t miss. It couldn’t miss. He would be a Novian yet. He would leave Earth in triumph despite Antonelli and the whole crew of fools at the House for the (he almost laughed aloud) Feeble-minded.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;advertisement&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George watched eagerly as the visiplate lit up. It would open up a window into a room of Novians, a window into a small patch of Novia transplanted to Earth. In twenty-four hours, he had accomplished that much.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;There was a burst of laughter as the plate unmisted and sharpened, but for the moment no single head could be seen but rather the fast passing of the shadows of men and women, this way and that. A voice was heard, clearworded over a background of babble. “Ingenescu? He wants me?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Then there he was, staring out of the plate. A Novian. A genuine Novian. (George had not an atom of doubt. There was something completely Outworldly about him. Nothing that could be completely defined, or even momentarily mistaken.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was swarthy in complexion with a dark wave of hair combed rigidly back from his forehead. He wore a thin black mustache and a pointed beard, just as dark, that scarcely reached below the lower limit of his narrow chin, but the rest of his face was so smooth that it looked a though it had been depilated permanently.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He was smiling. “Ladislas, this goes too far. We fully expect to be spied on, within reason, during our stay on Earth, but mind reading is out of bounds.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Mind reading, Honorable?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Confess! You knew I was going to call you this evening. You knew I was only waiting to finish this drink.” His moved up into view and his eye peered through a glass of a faintly violet liqueur. “I can’t offer you one, afraid.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George, out of range of Ingenescu’s transmitter, could not be seen by the Novian. He was relieved at that. He wanted time to compose himself and he needed it badly. It was as though he were made up exclusively of restless fingers, drumming, drumming —&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;But he was right. He hadn’t miscalculated. Ingenescu was important. The Novian called him by his first name.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Good! Things worked well. What George had lost on Antonelli, he would make up, with advantage, on Ingenescu. And someday, when he was on his own at last, and could come back to Earth as powerful a Novian as this one who could negligently joke with Ingenescu’s first name and be addressed as ‘Honorable’ in turn — when he came back, he would settle with Antonelli. He had a year and a half to pay back and he —&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He all but lost his balance on the brink of the enticing daydream and snapped back in sudden anxious realization that he was losing the thread of what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian was saying, “— doesn’t hold water. Novia has a civilization as complicated and advanced as Earth’s. We’re not Zeston, after all. It’s ridiculous that we have to come here for individual technicians.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu said soothingly, “Only for new models. There is never any certainty that new models will be needed. To buy the Educational tapes would cost you the same price as a thousand technicians and how do you know you would need that many?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian tossed off what remained of his drink and laughed. (It displeased George, somehow, that a Novian should be this frivolous. He wondered uneasily if perhaps the Novian ought not to have skipped that drink and even the one or two before that.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian said, 'That’s typical pious fraud, Ladislas. You know we can make use of all the late models we can. I collected five Metallurgists this afternoon —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I know,’ said Ingenescu. “I was there.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Watching me! Spying!” cried the Novian. “I’ll tell you What it is. The new-model Metallurgists I got differed from the previous model only in knowing the use of Beeman Spectrographs. The tapes couldn’t be modified that much, not that much” (he held up two fingers close together) “from last year’s model. You introduce the new models only to make us buy and spend and come here hat in hand.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“We don’t make you buy.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No, but you sell late-model technicians to Landonum and so we have to keep pace. It’s a merry-go-round you have us on, you pious Earthmen, but watch out, there may be an exit somewhere.” There was a sharp edge to his laugh, and it ended sooner than it should have.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu said, “In all honesty, I hope there is. Meanwhile, as to the purpose of my call-”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“That’s right, you called. Oh, well, I’ve said my say and I suppose next year there’ll be a new model of Metallurgist anyway for us to spend goods on, probably with a new gimmick for niobium assays and nothing else altered and the next year — But go on, what is it you want?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I have a young man here to whom I wish you to speak.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Oh?” The Novian looked not completely pleased with that. “ Concerning what?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I can’t say. He hasn’t told me. For that matter he hasn’t even told me his name and profession.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian frowned. “Then why take up my time?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“He seems quite confident that you will be interested in what he has to say.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I dare say.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And,” said Ingenescu, “as a favor to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian shrugged. “Put him on and tell him to make it short.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu stepped aside and whispered to George,“Address him as ‘Honorable’.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George swallowed with difficulty. This was it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George felt himself going moist with perspiration. The thought had come so recently, yet it was in him now so certainly. The beginnings of it had come when he had spoken to Trevelyan, then everything had fermented and billowed into shape while Ingenescu had prattled, and then the Novian’s own remarks had seemed to nail it all into place.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “Honorable, I’ve come to show you the exit from the merry-go-round.” Deliberately, he adopted the Novian’s own metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian stared at him gravely. “What merry-go-round?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You yourself mentioned it, Honorable. The merry-go-round that Novia is on when you come to Earth to — to get technicians.” (He couldn’t keep his teeth from chattering; from excitement not fear.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian said, “You’re trying to say that you know a way by which we can avoid patronizing Earth’s mental super-market. Is that it?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir. You can control your own Educational system.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Umm. Without tapes?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Y — yes, Honorable.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian, without taking his eyes from George, called out, “Ingenescu, get into view.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Historian moved to where he could be seen over George’s shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian said, “What is this? I don’t seem to penetrate.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I assure you solemnly,” said Ingenescu, “that whatever this is it is being done on the young man’s own initiative, Honorable. I have not inspired this. I have nothing to do with it.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Well, then, what is the young man to you? Why do you call me on his behalf?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu said, “He is an object of study, Honorable. He has value to me and I humor him.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What kind of value?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It’s difficult to explain; a matter of my profession.” The Novian laughed shortly. “Well, to each his profession.” He nodded to an invisible person or persons outside plate range. “There’s a young man here, a protégé of Ingenescu or some such thing, who will explain to us how to Educate without tapes.” He snapped his fingers, and another glass of pale liqueur appeared in his hand. “Well, young man?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The faces on the plate were multiple now. Men and women, both, crammed in for a view of George, their faces molded into various shades of amusement and curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George tried to look disdainful. They were all, in their own ways, Novians as well as the Earthman, ‘studying’ him as though he were a bug on a pin. Ingenescu was sitting in a corner, now, watching him owl-eyed.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Fools, he thought tensely, one and all. But they would have to understand. He would make them understand.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He said, “I was at the Metallurgist Olympics this afternoon.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You, too?’ said the Novian blandly. “It seems all Earth was there.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No, Honorable, but I was. I had a friend who competed and who made out very badly because you were using the Beeman machines. His education had included only the Henslers, apparently an older model. You said the modification involved was slight.” George held up two fingers close together in conscious mimicry of the other’s previous gesture. “And my friend had known some time in advance that knowledge of the Beeman machines would be required.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And what does that signify?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It was my friend’s lifelong ambition to qualify for Novia. He already knew the Henslers. He had to know the Beemans to qualify and he knew that. To learn about the Beemans would have taken just a few more facts, a bit more data, a small amount of practice perhaps. With a life’s ambition riding the scale, he might have managed this —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And where would he have obtained a tape for the additional facts and data? Or has Education become a private matter for home study here on Earth?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;There was dutiful laughter from the faces in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “That’s why he didn’t learn, Honorable. He thought he needed a tape. He wouldn’t even try without one, no matter what the prize. He refused to try without a tape.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Refused, eh? Probably the type of fellow who would refuse to fly without a skimmer.” More laughter and the Novian thawed into a smile and said, “The fellow is amusing. Go on. I’ll give you another few moments.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said tensely, “Don’t think this is a joke. Tapes are actually bad. They teach too much; they’re too painless. A man who learns that way doesn’t know how to learn any other way. He’s frozen into whatever position he’s been taped. Now if a person weren't given tapes but were forced to learn by hand, so to speak, from the start; why, then he’d get the habit of learning, and continue to learn. Isn’t that reasonable? Once he has the habit well developed he can be given just a small amount of tape-knowledge, perhaps, to fill in gaps or fix details. Then he can make further progress on his own. You can make Beeman Metallurgists out of your own Hensler Metallurgists in that way and not have to come to Earth for new models.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian nodded and sipped at his drink. “And where does everyone get knowledge without tapes? From interstellar vacuum?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“From books. By studying the instruments themselves. By thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Books? How does one understand books without Education?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Books are in words. Words can be understood for the most part. Specialized words can be explained by the technicians you already have.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What about reading? Will you allow reading tapes?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Reading tapes are all right, I suppose but there’s no reason you can’t learn to read the old way, too. At least in part.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian said, “So that you can develop good habits from the start?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, yes,” George said gleefully. The man was beginning to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And what about mathematics?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“That’s the easiest of all, sir — Honorable. Mathematics is different from other technical subjects. It starts with certain simple principles and proceeds by steps. You Can start with nothing and learn. It’s practically designed for that. Then, once you know the proper types of mathematics, other technical books become quite understandable. Especially if you start with easy ones.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Are there easy books?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Definitely. Even if there weren’t, the technicians you now have can try to write easy books. Some of them might be able to put some of their knowledge into words and symbols.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Good Lord,” said the Novian to the men clustered about him. “ The young devil has an answer for everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I have. I have,’ shouted George. “Ask me.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Have you tried learning from books yourself? Or is this just theory with you?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George turned to look quickly at Ingenescu, but the Historian was passive. There was no sign of anything but gentle interest in his face.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said,“I have.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And do you find it works?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, Honorable,” said George eagerly. “Take me with you to Novia. I can set up a program and direct —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Wait I have a few more questions. How long would it take, do you suppose, for you to become a Metallurgist capable of handling a Beeman machine, supposing you started from nothing and did not use Educational tapes?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George hesitated. “Well — years, perhaps.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Two years? Five? Ten?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I can’t say, Honorable.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Well, there’s a vital question to which you have no answer, have you? Shall we say five years? Does that sound reasonable to you?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“I suppose so.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“All right. We have a technician studying metallurgy according to this method of yours for five years. He’s no good to us during that time, you’ll admit but he must be fed and housed and paid all that time.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Let me finish. Then when he’s done and can use the Beeman, five years have passed. Don’t you suppose we’ll have modified Beemans then which he won’t be able to use?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But by then he’ll be expert on learning. He could learn the new details necessary in a matter of days.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“So you say. And suppose this friend of yours, for instance, had studied up on Beemans on his own and managed to learn it; would he be as expert in its use as a competitor who had learned it off the tapes?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Maybe not —” began George.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Ah,” said the Novian.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Wait, let me finish. Even if he doesn’t know something as well, it’s the ability to learn further that’s important. He may be able to think up things, new things that no tape-Educated man would. You’ll have a reservoir of original thinkers — ”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“In your studying,” said the Novian, “have you thought up any new things?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“No, but I’m just one man and I haven’t studied long —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes. — Well, ladies, gentlemen, have we been sufficiently amused?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Wait,” cried George, in sudden panic.“I want to arrange a personal interview. There are things I can’t explain over the visiphone. There are details —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Novian looked past George. “Ingenescu! I think I have done you your favor. Now, really, I have a heavy schedule tomorrow. Be well!”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The screen went blank.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George’s hands shot out toward the screen, as though in a wild impulse to shake life back into it. He cried out, “He didn’t believe me. He didn’t believe me.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu said, “No, George. Did you really think he would?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George scarcely heard him. “But why not? It’s all true. It’s all so much to his advantage. No risk. I and a few men to work with — A dozen men training for years would cost less than one technician. — He was drunk! Drunk! He didn’t understand.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George looked about breathlessly. “How do I get to him? I’ve got to. This was wrong. Shouldn’t have used the visiphone. I need time. Face to face. How do I-”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu said, “He won’t see you, George. And if he did, he wouldn’t believe you.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“He will, I tell you. When he isn’t drinking. He-” George turned squarely toward the Historian and his eyes widened. “Why do you call me George?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Isn’t that your name? George Platen?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You know me?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“All about you.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George was motionless except for the breath pumping his chest wall up and down.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ingenescu said, “I want to help you, George. I told you that. I’ve been studying you and I want to help you.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George screamed, “I don’t need help. I’m not feeble-minded. The whole world is, but I’m not.” He whirled and dashed madly for the door.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He flung it open and two policemen roused themselves suddenly from their guard duty and seized him.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;For all George’s straining, he could feel the hypo-spray at the fleshy point just under the corner of his jaw, and that was it. The last thing he remembered was the face of Ingenescu, watching with gentle concern.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George opened his eyes to the whiteness of a ceiling. He remembered what had happened. He remembered it distantly as though it had happened to somebody else. He stared at the ceiling till the whiteness filled his eyes and washed his brain clean, leaving room, it seemed, for new thought and new ways of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;He didn’t know how long he lay there so, listening to the drift of his own thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;There was a voice in his ear. “Are you awake?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And George heard his own moaning for the first time. Had he been moaning? He tried to turn his head.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The voice said, “Are you in pain, George?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George whispered, “Funny. I was so anxious to leave Earth. I didn’t understand.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Do you know where you are?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Back in the — the House.” George managed to turn. The voice belonged to Omani.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “It’s funny I didn’t understand.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani smiled gently, “Sleep again —”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George slept.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;And woke again. His mind was clear.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani sat at the bedside reading, but he put down the book as George’s eyes opened.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George struggled to a sitting position. He said, “Hello.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Are you hungry?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You bet.” He stared at Omani curiously. “I was followed when I left, wasn’t I?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani nodded. “You were under observation at all times. We were going to maneuver you to Antonelli and let you discharge your aggressions. We felt that to be the way you could make progress. Your emotions were clogging your advance.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, with a trace of embarrassment, “I was all wrong about him.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t matter now. When you stopped to stare at the Metallurgy notice board at the airport, one of our agents reported back the list of names. You and I had talked about your past sufficiently so that I caught the significance of Trevelyan’s name there. You asked for directions to the Olympics; there was the possibility that this might result in the kind of crisis we were hoping for; we sent Ladislas Ingenescu to the hall to meet you and take over.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“He’s an important man in the government, isn’t he?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, he is.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And you had him take over. It makes me sound important.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You are important, George.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;A thick stew had arrived, steaming, fragrant. George grinned wolfishly and pushed his sheets back to free his arms. Omani helped arrange the bed-table. For a while, George ate silently.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Then George said, “I woke up here once before just for a short time.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani said, “I know. I was here.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, I remember. You know, everything was changed. It was as though I was too tired to feel emotion. I wasn’t angry any more. I could just think. It was as though I had been drugged to wipe out emotion.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You weren’t,” said Omani. “Just sedation. You had rested.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Well, anyway, it was all clear to me, as though I had known it all the time but wouldn’t listen to myself. I thought: What was it I had wanted Novia to let me do? I had wanted to go to Novia and take a batch of un-Educated youngsters and teach them out of books. I had wanted to establish a House for the Feeble-rninded — like here — and Earth already has them — many of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Omani’s white teeth gleamed as he smiled. “The Institute of Higher Studies is the correct name for places like this.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Now I see it,” said George, “so easily I am amazed at my blindness before. After all, who invents the new instrument models that require new-model technicians? Who invented the Beeman spectrographs, for instance? A man called Beeman, I suppose, but he couldn’t have been tape-Educated or how could he have made the advance?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Exactly.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Or who makes Educational tapes? Special tape-making technicians? Then who makes the tapes to train them? More advanced technicians? Then who makes the tapes — You see what I mean. Somewhere there has to be an end. Somewhere there must be men and women with capacity for original thought.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Yes, George.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George leaned back, stared over Omani’s head, and for a moment there was the return of something like restlessness to his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Why wasn’t I told all this at the beginning?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“Oh, if we could,” said Omani, “the trouble it would save us. We can analyze a mind, George, and say this one will make an adequate architect and that one a good woodworker. We know of no way of detecting the capacity for original, creative thought? It is too subtle a thing. We have some rule-of-thumb methods that mark out individuals who may possibly or potentially have such a talent.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“On Reading Day, such individuals are reported. You were, for instance. Roughly speaking, the number so reported comes to one in ten thousand. By the time Education Day arrives, these individuals are checked again, and nine out of ten of them turn out to have been false alarms. Those who remain are sent to places like this.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George said, “Well, what’s wrong with telling people that one out of — of a hundred thousand will end at places like these? Then it won’t be such a shock to those who do.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“And those who don’t? The ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine that don’t? We can’t have all those people considering themselves failures. They aim at the professions and one way or another they all make it. Everyone can place after his or her name: Registered something-or-other. In one fashion or another every individual has his or her place in society and this is necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“But we?” said George. “The one in one hundred thousand exception?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“You can’t be told. That’s exactly it. It’s the final test. Even after we’ve thinned out the possibilities on Education Day, nine out of ten of those who come here are not quite the material of creative genius, and there’s no way we can distinguish those nine from the tenth that we want by any form of machinery. The tenth one must tell us himself.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“How?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“We bring you here to a House for the Feeble-minded and the man who won’t accept that is the man we want. It’s a method that can be cruel but it works. It won’t do to say to a man, ‘You can create. Do so.’ It is much safer to wait for a man to say, ‘I can create, and I will do so whether you wish it or not.’ There are ten thousand men like you, George, who support the advancing technology of fifteen hundred worlds. We can’t allow ourselves to miss one recruit to that number or waste our efforts on one member who doesn’t measure up.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George pushed his empty plate out of the way and lifted a cup of coffee to his lips.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What about the people here who don’t — measure up?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“They are taped eventually and become our Social Scientists. Ingenescu is one. I am a Registered Psychologist. We are second echelon, so to speak.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George finished his coffee. He said, “I still wonder about one thing?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;“What is that?”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;George threw aside the sheet and stood up. “Why do they call them Olympics?”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;

In A Greek–English Lexicon, it is defined as the "name of a dish compounded of all kinds of dainties, fish, flesh, fowl, and sauces".[2]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the longest Greek word, containing 171 letters and 78 syllables. The transliteration has 183 Latin characters and is the longest word ever to appear in literature, according to the Guinness World Records (1990).[3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Variant forms&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The form of the word quoted here is the version listed in the Liddell &amp;amp; Scott Greek lexicon (1940) and quoted therein as being amended by August Meineke,[2] contrasting F.W. Hall and W.M. Geldart's 1907 edition of Aristophanis Comoediae (used in the Assemblywomen play) variant of (differences underlined):&lt;lb/&gt; λοπαδοτεμαχοσελαχογαλεοκρανιολειψανοδριμυποτριμματοσιλφιοτυρομελιτοκατακεχυμενοκιχλεπικοσσυφοφαττοπεριστεραλεκτρυονοπτεκεφαλλιοκιγκλοπελειολαγῳοσιραιοβαφητραγανοπτερυγώ.[4] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Description&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The dish was a fricassée, with at least 16 sweet and sour ingredients, including the following:[3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;list rend="ul"&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fish slices&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Fish of the Elasmobranchii subclass (a shark or ray fish)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Rotted dogfish or small shark's head&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;A generally sharp-tasting dish of several ingredients grated and pounded together&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Silphion, possibly a kind of giant fennel, now believed extinct&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;A kind of crab, shrimp, or crayfish&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Honey poured down&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Wrasse (or thrush)&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;A kind of sea fish or blackbird as topping&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Wood pigeon&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Domestic pigeon&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Rooster&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;The roasted head of dabchick&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Hare, which could be a kind of bird or a kind of sea hare&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;New wine boiled down&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;Wing and/or fin&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Context&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;The term is used in the ultimate chorus of the play, when Blepyrus (and the audience) are summoned to the first feast laid on by the new system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1167] And you others, let your light steps too keep time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;[1168] Very soon we'll be eating&lt;lb/&gt;[1170] lopadotemachoselachogaleokranioleipsanodrimypotrimmatosilphiokarabomelitokatakechymenokichlepikossyphophattoperisteralektryonoptekephaliokigklopeleiolagoiosiraiobaphetraganopterygon [sic].&lt;lb/&gt;[1175] Come, quickly, seize hold of a plate, snatch up a cup, and let's run to secure a place at table.

Eugene O'Neill, 1938[1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h2"&gt;English translations&lt;/head&gt;[edit]&lt;p&gt;In English prose translation by Leo Strauss (1966), this Greek word is rendered as "oysters-saltfish-skate-sharks'-heads-left-over-vinegar-dressing-laserpitium-leek-with-honey-sauce-thrush-blackbird-pigeon-dove-roast-cock's-brains-wagtail-cushat-hare-stewed-in-new-wine-gristle-of-veal-pullet's-wings".[5]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;English verse translation by Benjamin Bickley Rogers (1902) follows the original meter and the original form of composition:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plattero-filleto-mulleto-turboto-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;-Cranio-morselo-pickleo-acido-&lt;lb/&gt;-Silphio-honeyo-pouredonthe-topothe-&lt;lb/&gt;-Ouzelo-throstleo-cushato-culvero-&lt;lb/&gt;-Cutleto-roastingo-marowo-dippero-&lt;lb/&gt;-Leveret-syrupu-gibleto-wings.[6]&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An older English verse translation by Rev.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CLI for Figma. LLMs already know React and work great with CLIs — this combines both.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;echo '&amp;lt;Frame style={{padding: 24, backgroundColor: "#3B82F6", borderRadius: 12}}&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;Text style={{fontSize: 18, color: "#FFF"}}&amp;gt;Hello Figma&amp;lt;/Text&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/Frame&amp;gt;' | figma-use render --stdin&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No JSON schemas, no MCP protocol overhead — just JSX that any LLM can write.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;📄 Includes SKILL.md — drop-in reference for Claude Code and other AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MCP servers exchange verbose JSON. CLIs are token-efficient:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# 47 tokens
figma-use create frame --width 400 --height 300 --fill "#FFF" --radius 12 --layout VERTICAL --gap 16&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;vs MCP JSON request + response: ~200 tokens for the same operation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For AI agents doing dozens of Figma operations, this adds up fast. If you still prefer MCP, see MCP Server section.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every LLM has been trained on millions of React components. They can write this without examples:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Frame style={{ flexDirection: 'column', gap: 16, padding: 24 }}&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;Text style={{ fontSize: 24, fontWeight: 'bold' }}&amp;gt;Title&amp;lt;/Text&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;Text style={{ fontSize: 14, color: '#666' }}&amp;gt;Description&amp;lt;/Text&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/Frame&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; command takes this JSX and creates real Figma nodes — frames, text, components, auto-layout, the works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;bun install -g @dannote/figma-use

figma-use plugin install  # Install plugin (quit Figma first)
figma-use proxy      # Start proxy server&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open Figma → Plugins → Development → Figma Use&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;g-emoji&gt;⚠️&lt;/g-emoji&gt;Uses Figma's internal multiplayer protocol — ~100x faster than plugin API, but may break if Figma changes it.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# Terminal 1: Start Figma with debug port
figma --remote-debugging-port=9222

# Terminal 2: Start proxy
figma-use proxy&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;# From stdin
echo '&amp;lt;Frame style={{width: 200, height: 100, backgroundColor: "#FF0000"}} /&amp;gt;' | figma-use render --stdin

# From file
figma-use render ./Card.figma.tsx

# With props
figma-use render ./Card.figma.tsx --props '{"title": "Hello"}'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Frame&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Rectangle&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Ellipse&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Line&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Star&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Polygon&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Vector&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Group&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;// Layout
flexDirection: 'row' | 'column'
justifyContent: 'flex-start' | 'center' | 'flex-end' | 'space-evenly'
alignItems: 'flex-start' | 'center' | 'flex-end' | 'stretch'
gap: number
padding: number
paddingTop / paddingRight / paddingBottom / paddingLeft: number

// Size &amp;amp; Position

// Text

color: string
textAlign: 'left' | 'center' | 'right'&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;defineComponent&lt;/code&gt; creates a Figma Component. First usage renders the master, subsequent usages create Instances:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { defineComponent, Frame, Text } from '@dannote/figma-use/render'

const Card = defineComponent('Card',
  &amp;lt;Frame style={{ padding: 24, backgroundColor: '#FFF', borderRadius: 12 }}&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Text style={{ fontSize: 18, color: '#000' }}&amp;gt;Card&amp;lt;/Text&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/Frame&amp;gt;
)

export default () =&amp;gt; (
  &amp;lt;Frame style={{ gap: 16, flexDirection: 'row' }}&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Card /&amp;gt;  {/* Creates Component */}
    &amp;lt;Card /&amp;gt;  {/* Creates Instance */}
    &amp;lt;Card /&amp;gt;  {/* Creates Instance */}
  &amp;lt;/Frame&amp;gt;
)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;defineComponentSet&lt;/code&gt; creates a Figma ComponentSet with all variant combinations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { defineComponentSet, Frame, Text } from '@dannote/figma-use/render'

const Button = defineComponentSet('Button', {
  variant: ['Primary', 'Secondary'] as const,
  size: ['Small', 'Large'] as const,
}, ({ variant, size }) =&amp;gt; (
  &amp;lt;Frame style={{ 
    padding: size === 'Large' ? 16 : 8,
    backgroundColor: variant === 'Primary' ? '#3B82F6' : '#E5E7EB',
    borderRadius: 8,
  }}&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Text style={{ color: variant === 'Primary' ? '#FFF' : '#111' }}&amp;gt;
      {variant} {size}
    &amp;lt;/Text&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/Frame&amp;gt;
))

export default () =&amp;gt; (
  &amp;lt;Frame style={{ gap: 16, flexDirection: 'column' }}&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Button variant="Primary" size="Large" /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Button variant="Secondary" size="Small" /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/Frame&amp;gt;
)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This creates 4 variant components (Primary/Small, Primary/Large, Secondary/Small, Secondary/Large) inside a ComponentSet, plus instances with the requested variants.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bind colors to Figma variables by name:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;import { defineVars, Frame, Text } from '@dannote/figma-use/render'

const colors = defineVars({
  bg: { name: 'Colors/Gray/50', value: '#F8FAFC' },
  text: { name: 'Colors/Gray/900', value: '#0F172A' },
})

export default () =&amp;gt; (
  &amp;lt;Frame style={{ backgroundColor: colors.bg }}&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Text style={{ color: colors.text }}&amp;gt;Bound to variables&amp;lt;/Text&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/Frame&amp;gt;
)&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; is a fallback. At render time, colors get bound to actual Figma variables by name.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; command is the fastest way to create complex layouts. For simpler operations or modifications, use direct commands:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;figma-use create frame --width 400 --height 300 --fill "#FFF" --radius 12 --layout VERTICAL --gap 16
figma-use create rect --width 100 --height 50 --fill "#FF0000" --radius 8

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Design is far more than form or function. Itâs the tangible expression of a brandâs identity, values, and promise. While a brand defines what a company stands for, design gives those aspirations form and substance. Design uniquely delivers value: visually, physically, and experientially.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At ThinkNext Design, every creation begins with empathy and seeks purpose. We look to understand not just what people need, but what they desire. Whether crafting something entirely new or reimagining the familiar, our work blends aesthetic restraint with purposeful clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is innovative design that resonates emotionally, performs beautifully, and endures as a reflection of the brand behind it. More than 200,000,000 ThinkPads have been sold since 1992, and still counting. That didn't happen by accident.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the early 1990's, the original IBM AS/400 product line was rapidly losing market share due to a growing perception that the product family employed outdated technology, and was highly overpriced. David led a strategic design initiative to recast that image via a sweeping change that would forever reposition the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The resulting award winning design featured stark black enclosures, dramatic air inlets, and simple yet powerful forms. This was a striking contrast to the putty colored neutral appearance that had come to dominate not only the IBM server products, but the entire industry. Following the series introduction, AS/400 Division revenues jumped by a double-digit percentage. Comments of yesterday's technology were quickly replaced by associations with objects such as the innovative F117a stealth fighter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AS/400 systems had a control panel that included special functions that were designed to only be accessed by authorized operators. Restricted access was achieved using a traditional stainless steel keylock mated to a rotating electric switch. Without the key only basic functions could be operated. Unfortunately the assembly was very costly and the metal key/lock was a source of potential electrostatic discharge. The security keystick eliminated the dated and flawed assembly entirely. Inserting the asymmetrical key enabled access to the restricted functions, cost a fraction of the previous solution and eliminated the ESD issue altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The soft rim and soft dome caps were added in 1997 creating a suite of Trackpoint cap options. The introduction followed an exhaustive design-led initiative to improve the existing cat tongue cap's comfort and utility. The effort revealed that three caps were better than one, giving the user choice. All three were shipped with every ThinkPad for many years. Only the soft dome cap remains in production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to the introduction of the Netfinity 7000, IBM's PC servers were tower based offerings that often found themselves awkwardly placed on shelves in generic computer racks. The Netfinity design eliminated this makeshift approach with a "rack and stack" solution. The system could truly rack mount using industry standard rails, or stand alone as a tower. The design also included a stacking NetBay with provision for mounting rack mounted OEM devices without purchasing a full blown rack. Many of the system components, including hardfiles, were removable from the front without tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ThinkPad ThinkLight was first introduced on the ThinkPad i Series 1400. Observing a fellow airline passenger reading using a small light clipped to the top edge of their book, David immediately thought this idea could be adapted for use on a laptop. The final design used a white LED to illuminate the keyboard from the top bezel. It was the industry's first, and arguably most effective method, of illuminating a laptop keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The introduction of the IBM Personal Computer in 1981 was a technology milestone that forever changed the world. Subsequent innovation, however, was primarily limited to technology advancements and improved affordability. In nearly 20 years, little had been done to dramatically change the design paradigm of metal box, chunky monitor, and keyboard. David initiated and led a design project to reinvent the standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working in close collaboration with noted designer Richard Sapper, David and his team created an industry-leading all-in-one computer that capitalized on emerging flat-panel display technology. The final, award-winning design integrated the monitor, CPU, and optical drive into a remarkably slim profile. The optical drive was discreetly concealed within the base structure, dropping down smoothly at the touch of a button.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bucking the trend for bloated, frivolous designs, the Aptiva S Series speakers were conceived to match the unique angular design language of the flat panel based computer design. The sophisticated desktop speakers could be customized with brightly colored fabric grills adding to the premium image. The design was selected by Dieter Rams for a Best of Category award at the annual IF Design Exhibition in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ThinkPad X300 stands as a landmark in industrial design, proving how disciplined engineering and purposeful aesthetics can redefine an entire product category. Its carbon-fiber and magnesium construction, meticulously refined form, and forward-looking adoption of SSD storage and LED backlighting positioned it as a breakthrough ultraportable long before such features became commonplace. Its development earned widespread attention, most notably in BusinessWeekâs cover story âThe Making of the ThinkPad X300,â which showcased the intense, design-driven effort behind the machine. The project was explored even more deeply in Steve Hammâs book The Race for Perfect, which chronicled the X300âs creation as an example of ambitious, high-stakes innovation. Together, these accounts cement the X300âs legacy as one of the most influential and thoughtfully crafted ThinkPads ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skylight was an early âsmartbookâ product designed as a lightweight, always-connected device that blended elements of a smartphone and laptop. The imaginative overall product design was created by Richard Sapper, but the keyboard was the work of David and his team. Although the product was short-lived, the sculpted island style keyboard was eventually adopted for use on future ThinkPad and consumer laptops. The sculpted key surface and unique D-shape aid substantially in enhancing comfort and improving typing accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shortly following the Lenovo acquisition of IBM's PC business, the IBM logo was removed from ThinkPad. David was a strong proponent of establishing ThinkPad as the primary badge on the product due to the brand's high recognition and subsequent value. He proposed using the sub-brand font, normally appearing below the IBM logo, as ThinkPad's new wordmark. He enhanced it with a bright red dot over the letter i which was derived from the TrackPoint cap. His now iconic concept was universally adopted as the new ThinkPad product badge worldwide in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2010 the dot was enhanced with a glowing red LED that is still in use today. The dot glows solid if the ThinkPad is powered on and slowly pulses like a heartbeat when in a suspended sleep state. The design draws attention and adds life to the brand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first-generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon introduced a bold new interpretation of classic ThinkPad design. It's carbon-fiber reinforced chassis delivered exceptional strength with a remarkably low weight. The sculpted island-style keyboard, subtle red accents, and gently tapered edges gave it a modern precision appearance without sacrificing the brand's renowned usability &amp;amp; iconic visual impression.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The scaled-down travel mouse shares it's essential geometry with a mouse originally created for IBM's Aptiva lineup in the late 1990's. The characteristically low front, generously sculpted tail and inwardly inclined side surfaces enhance ergonomics and daily use. These design concepts have been nearly universally adopted by other computer/accessory manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When using a tablet as a camera the screen cover typically flops around since folding it all the way around would block the camera. The quickshot cover eliminates this inconvenience thanks to a patented folding corner. When folded back, it automatically launched the camera app to let you take a picture instantly. The flopping cover annoyance was eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The revolutionary design replaced the bezel/box paradigm with a form that resembles a rectangular tube through which large volumes of air pass. The unique appearance telegraphs raw power. The design, however, is much more than skin deep. The machine's innovative interior is highly modular and eliminates the need for tools to replace or upgrade key components. Flush handles are thoughtfully incorporated in the shell for moving the workstation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pioneering ThinkPad X1 Tablet design featured a uniquely hinged kickstand that enabled customizing the user experience with a system of snap-on modules. Modules offered were the Productivity Module, which added extra battery life and additional ports; the Presenter Module, featuring a built-in pico projector for critical presentations; and the 3D Imaging Module, equipped with an Intel RealSense camera for depth sensing and 3D scanning. Together, these modules provided flexible, on-demand functionality while preserving the tabletâs portability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ThinkPad 25 was created and launched to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the iconic brand. It artfully blended retro design elements with modern engineering. Inspired heavily by years of passionate customer feedback and social-media campaigns calling for a âclassic ThinkPadâ revival, the project brought back beloved features such as the 7-row keyboard with blue accents, a tradition-inspired ThinkPad logo, and TrackPoint cap options. Wrapped in a soft-touch black chassis and powered by contemporary hardware, the ThinkPad 25 stood as a collaborative tributeâshaped not only by Lenovoâs designers but also by a global community of fans.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Originally written and designed for the 20th anniversary celebration held at the MoMA. The highly collectable work was updated in 2025 for the 25th anniversary limited edition ThinkPad T25. Both booklets document and illuminate David Hill's beliefs and philosophies that have shaped the design of ThinkPad for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ThinkPad ThinkShutter is a simple, built-in mechanical privacy cover designed to give users instant control over their webcam. Sliding smoothly across the lens, it provides a clear visual indication when the camera is physically blocked, eliminating reliance on questionable software controls or LED indicators. It integrates cleanly into the display bezel adding negligible thickness. Achieving peace of mind with makeshift solutions such as masking tape, Post-it notes, and even clothespins are a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Graph in-Buffer Retrieval &amp;amp; Associative Memory&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Graph in-Buffer: Graph structure (entities + relationships) stored in RAM&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Retrieval: Query mechanism for retrieving relevant context in RAG workflows&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Associative Memory: Traverse between associated nodes via relationships, all accessed from memory&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GibRAM is an in-memory knowledge graph server designed for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) workflows. It combines a lightweight graph store with vector search so that related pieces of information remain connected in memory. This makes it easier to retrieve related regulations, articles or other text when a query mentions specific subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;In memory and Ephemeral: Data lives in RAM with a configurable time to live. It is meant for short lived analysis and exploration rather than persistent storage.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Graph and Vectors Together: Stores named entities, relationships and document chunks alongside their embeddings in the same structure.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Graph aware Retrieval: Supports traversal over entities and relations as well as semantic search, helping you pull in context that would be missed by vector similarity alone.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Python SDK: Provides a GraphRAG style workflow for indexing documents and running queries with minimal code. Components such as chunker, extractor and embedder can be swapped out.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As I was browsing the web and catching up on some sites I visit periodically, I found a cool article from Tom Hayden about using Amazon Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) and mrjob in order to compute some statistics on win/loss ratios for chess games he downloaded from the millionbase archive, and generally have fun with EMR. Since the data volume was only about 1.75GB containing around 2 million chess games, I was skeptical of using Hadoop for the task, but I can understand his goal of learning and having fun with mrjob and EMR. Since the problem is basically just to look at the result lines of each file and aggregate the different results, it seems ideally suited to stream processing with shell commands. I tried this out, and for the same amount of data I was able to use my laptop to get the results in about 12 seconds (processing speed of about 270MB/sec), while the Hadoop processing took about 26 minutes (processing speed of about 1.14MB/sec).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After reporting that the time required to process the data with 7 c1.medium machine in the cluster took 26 minutes, Tom remarks&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is probably better than it would take to run serially on my machine but probably not as good as if I did some kind of clever multi-threaded application locally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is absolutely correct, although even serial processing may beat 26 minutes. Although Tom was doing the project for fun, often people use Hadoop and other so-called Big Data (tm) tools for real-world processing and analysis jobs that can be done faster with simpler tools and different techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One especially under-used approach for data processing is using standard shell tools and commands. The benefits of this approach can be massive, since creating a data pipeline out of shell commands means that all the processing steps can be done in parallel. This is basically like having your own Storm cluster on your local machine. Even the concepts of Spouts, Bolts, and Sinks transfer to shell pipes and the commands between them. You can pretty easily construct a stream processing pipeline with basic commands that will have extremely good performance compared to many modern Big Data (tm) tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An additional point is the batch versus streaming analysis approach. Tom mentions in the beginning of the piece that after loading 10000 games and doing the analysis locally, that he gets a bit short on memory. This is because all game data is loaded into RAM for the analysis. However, considering the problem for a bit, it can be easily solved with streaming analysis that requires basically no memory at all. The resulting stream processing pipeline we will create will be over 235 times faster than the Hadoop implementation and use virtually no memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Learn about the data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first step in the pipeline is to get the data out of the PGN files. Since I had no idea what kind of format this was, I checked it out on Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[Event "F/S Return Match"]
[Site "Belgrade, Serbia Yugoslavia|JUG"]
[Date "1992.11.04"]
[Round "29"]
[White "Fischer, Robert J."]
[Black "Spassky, Boris V."]
[Result "1/2-1/2"]
(moves from the game follow...)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are only interested in the results of the game, which only have 3 real outcomes. The 1-0 case means that white won, the 0-1 case means that black won, and the 1/2-1/2 case means the game was a draw. There is also a - case meaning the game is ongoing or cannot be scored, but we ignore that for our purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Acquire sample data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is get a lot of game data. This proved more difficult than I thought it would be, but after some looking around online I found a git repository on GitHub from rozim that had plenty of games. I used this to compile a set of 3.46GB of data, which is about twice what Tom used in his test. The next step is to get all that data into our pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Build a processing pipeline&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are following along and timing your processing, don’t forget to clear your OS page cache as otherwise you won’t get valid processing times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shell commands are great for data processing pipelines because you get parallelism for free. For proof, try a simple example in your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sleep 3 | echo "Hello world."
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intuitively it may seem that the above will sleep for 3 seconds and then print &lt;code&gt;Hello world&lt;/code&gt; but in fact both steps are done at the same time. This basic fact is what can offer such great speedups for simple non-IO-bound processing systems capable of running on a single machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before starting the analysis pipeline, it is good to get a reference for how fast it could be and for this we can simply dump the data to &lt;code&gt;/dev/null&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat *.pgn &amp;gt; /dev/null
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this case, it takes about 13 seconds to go through the 3.46GB, which is about 272MB/sec. This would be a kind of upper-bound on how quickly data could be processed on this system due to IO constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we can start on the analysis pipeline, the first step of which is using &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; to generate the stream of data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat *.pgn
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since only the result lines in the files are interesting, we can simply scan through all the data files, and pick out the lines containing ‘Results’ with &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat *.pgn | grep "Result"
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will give us only the &lt;code&gt;Result&lt;/code&gt; lines from the files. Now if we want, we can simply use the &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;uniq&lt;/code&gt; commands in order to get a list of all the unique items in the file along with their counts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat *.pgn | grep "Result" | sort | uniq -c
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a very straightforward analysis pipeline, and gives us the results in about 70 seconds. While we can certainly do better, assuming linear scaling this would have taken the Hadoop cluster approximately 52 minutes to process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to reduce the speed further, we can take out the &lt;code&gt;sort | uniq&lt;/code&gt; steps from the pipeline, and replace them with AWK, which is a wonderful tool/language for event-based data processing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cat *.pgn | grep "Result" | awk '{ split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will take each result record, split it on the hyphen, and take the character immediately to the left, which will be a 0 in the case of a win for black, a 1 in the case of a win for white, or a 2 in the case of a draw. Note that &lt;code&gt;$0&lt;/code&gt; is a built-in variable that represents the entire record.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This reduces the running time to approximately 65 seconds, and since we’re processing twice as much data this is a speedup of around 47 times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So even at this point we already have a speedup of around 47 with a naive local solution. Additionally, the memory usage is effectively zero since the only data stored is the actual counts, and incrementing 3 integers is almost free in memory space terms. However, looking at &lt;code&gt;htop&lt;/code&gt; while this is running shows that &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; is currently the bottleneck with full usage of a single CPU core.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Parallelize the bottlenecks&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This problem of unused cores can be fixed with the wonderful &lt;code&gt;xargs&lt;/code&gt; command, which will allow us to parallelize the &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt;. Since &lt;code&gt;xargs&lt;/code&gt; expects input in a certain way, it is safer and easier to use &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;-print0&lt;/code&gt; argument in order to make sure that each file name being passed to &lt;code&gt;xargs&lt;/code&gt; is null-terminated. The corresponding &lt;code&gt;-0&lt;/code&gt; tells &lt;code&gt;xargs&lt;/code&gt; to expected null-terminated input. Additionally, the &lt;code&gt;-n&lt;/code&gt; how many inputs to give each process and the &lt;code&gt;-P&lt;/code&gt; indicates the number of processes to run in parallel. Also important to be aware of is that such a parallel pipeline doesn’t guarantee delivery order, but this isn’t a problem if you are used to dealing with distributed processing systems. The &lt;code&gt;-F&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; indicates that we are only matching on fixed strings and not doing any fancy regex, and can offer a small speedup, which I did not notice in my testing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;find . -type f -name '*.pgn' -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 -P4 grep -F "Result" | gawk '{ split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print NR, white, black, draw }'
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This results in a run time of about 38 seconds, which is an additional 40% or so reduction in processing time from parallelizing the &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; step in our pipeline. This gets us up to approximately 77 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although we have improved the performance dramatically by parallelizing the &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; step in our pipeline, we can actually remove this entirely by having &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; filter the input records (lines in this case) and only operate on those containing the string “Result”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;find . -type f -name '*.pgn' -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 -P4 awk '/Result/ { split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may think that would be the correct solution, but this will output the results of each file individually, when we want to aggregate them all together. The resulting correct implementation is conceptually very similar to what the MapReduce implementation would be.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;find . -type f -name '*.pgn' -print0 | xargs -0 -n4 -P4 awk '/Result/ { split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++ } END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }' | awk '{games += $1; white += $2; black += $3; draw += $4; } END { print games, white, black, draw }'
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By adding the second awk step at the end, we obtain the aggregated game information as desired.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This further improves the speed dramatically, achieving a running time of about 18 seconds, or about 174 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, we can make it a bit faster still by using mawk, which is often a drop-in replacement for &lt;code&gt;gawk&lt;/code&gt; and can offer better performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;find . -type f -name '*.pgn' -print0 | xargs -0 -n4 -P4 mawk '/Result/ { split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++ } END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }' | mawk '{games += $1; white += $2; black += $3; draw += $4; } END { print games, white, black, draw }'
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This &lt;code&gt;find | xargs mawk | mawk&lt;/code&gt; pipeline gets us down to a runtime of about 12 seconds, or about 270MB/sec, which is around 235 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hopefully this has illustrated some points about using and abusing tools like Hadoop for data processing tasks that can better be accomplished on a single machine with simple shell commands and tools. If you have a huge amount of data or really need distributed processing, then tools like Hadoop may be required, but more often than not these days I see Hadoop used where a traditional relational database or other solutions would be far better in terms of performance, cost of implementation, and ongoing maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Most websites today want to process your data and ask for consent using cookie banners. While these banners are meant to give you control, in practice they often result in repetitive and time-consuming clicks—especially if your browser clears cookies when you close it. The same banner reappears, and you find yourself making the same choices again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consent-O-Matic is a browser extension designed to solve this problem. Developed by the Centre for Advanced Visualization and Interaction (CAVI) at Aarhus University, the tool automatically handles consent banners on your behalf. After you set your preferences during installation, Consent-O-Matic will recognize many common Consent Management Platform (CMP) banners, apply your choices, and confirm with a little checkmark next to the extension icon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because Consent-O-Matic is an open-source project, anyone can contribute to its improvement by adding new rules, updating old rules, or updating documentation. This collaborative approach ensures that the extension keeps pace with the constantly changing landscape of online consent banners—and makes it easier for everyone to safeguard their data with less hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consent-O-Matic currently works with more than 200 CMPs (see full list here), including major platforms like UserCentrics, CookieBot, OneTrust, as well as cookie banners for specific websites.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consent-O-Matic uses the following set of permissions in the browser when installed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Access to read all pages - It searches each page you visit for consent-related popups that it knows how to handle&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Information about tab URLs - You can turn the extension on/off on a page-by-page basis by clicking the icon. To check if it is enabled it needs to know the address of the page you are visiting&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Storage - Your preferences and settings are stored directly in your browser&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extension only communicates with the web in two situations:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When fetching and updating rule lists&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;When you report a website as not working through the extension icon menu (the Let us know! button)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The URL of the website reported through the extension icon is sent to a website hosted by Aarhus University in the form of a URI-encoded query string (e.g., LinkedIn will be reported as &lt;code&gt;https://gdprconsent.projects.cavi.au.dk/report.php?url=www.linkedin.com&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We highly recommend installing directly through the official extension store of your browser (mentioned at the top). Installing through the official channels will automatically keep you up-to-date with new versions when they are released.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is also possible to get the extension by other means.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As an alternative to extension stores you can manually download and extract one of the published versions from the Releases page on Github.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you do that you have to use the developer feature of the browser to Load Unpacked (Chrome) or Load Temporary Addon (Firefox) and point it at the manifest.json in the unpacked zip-directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, if you intend to review or make changes to the code, you can build and install directly from the source code:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/cavi-au/Consent-O-Matic.git
cd Consent-O-Matic
npm install
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and then run one of &lt;code&gt;npm run build-firefox&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;npm run build-chromium&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;npm run build-safari&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Firefox or Chromium you can now proceed as above for installing release archives but point the browser at the &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; folder or a folder where you extracted the zip from build/dist/. Safari requires loading the XCode project to further build an app.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We do not recommend installing from source.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your favorite CMP is missing from the current list, feel free to either create a custom list that you can add (click the extension icon in your browser, click "More add-on settings", click "Rule lists", and enter the URL of your custom list.). If you really want to contribute, feel free to create a Pull Request while you're at it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Users can send reports when rules for specific websites are not working. The full list of reported URLs is available here. The number indicates how many times the URL was reported. This list currently does not show if/when the rules for a URL have been checked/adjusted, so always verify whether the rule is still broken/missing before you start working on it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A rule list for Consent-O-Matic is a JSON structure that contains the rules for detecting a CMP (Consent Management Provider), and dealing with the CMP popup when it is detected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each CMP is a named entry and contains 2 parts, &lt;code&gt;detectors&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;methods&lt;/code&gt;. The name should ideally be the actual name of the underlying CMP (correctly capitalized and whitespaced) or of the website if it is unique to that domain. The name will be shown in the About section of extension's settings, so make it user-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
   "MyCMP": {
      "detectors": [ ... ],
      "methods": [ ... ]
   },
   "AnotherCMP": {
      "detectors": [ ... ],
      "methods": [ ... ]
   },
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If more than 1 detector is added to a CMP, the CMP counts as detected if any of the detectors trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Detectors are the part that detects if a certain rule set should be applied. Basically, if a detector triggers, the methods will be applied.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Detector structure:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
   "presentMatcher": [{ ... }],
   "showingMatcher": [{ ... }]
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The present matcher is used to detect if the CMP is present on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some CMPs still insert the popup HTML into the DOM even when re-visiting a page where you have already given consent earlier. We only want to handle the consent form if its actually showing on the page. This is what the showing matcher is used for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both the present and showing matcher follow the common structure of &lt;code&gt;Matchers&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both the present and showing matcher can be multiple matchers, only triggering the detector if all of the matchers (respectively for present and showing) apply.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Methods are collections of actions. There are 4 methods supported by Consent-O-Matic. &lt;code&gt;OPEN_OPTIONS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DO_CONSENT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SAVE_CONSENT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;HIDE_CMP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the methods are optional, and, if present, the methods will be run in the order given below when a detector is triggered.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;HIDE_CMP
OPEN_OPTIONS
HIDE_CMP
DO_CONSENT
SAVE_CONSENT
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Methods take on the form:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
   "name": " ... ",
   "action": { ... }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;where the name is one of the 4 supported methods and action is the action to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most actions and matchers have some target that they apply to. For this reason, Consent-O-Matic has a DOM selection mechanism that can easily help with selecting the correct DOM element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"parent": {
   "selector": ".some.css.selector",
   "textFilter": "someTextFilter",
   "styleFilter": {
      "option": "someStyleOption",
      "value": "someStyleValue",
      "negated": false
   },
   "displayFilter": true,
   "iframeFilter": false,
   "childFilter": {}
},
"target": {
   "selector": ".some.css.selector",
   "textFilter": "someTextFilter",
   "styleFilter": {
      "option": "someStyleOption",
      "value": "someStyleValue",
      "negated": false
   },
   "displayFilter": true,
   "iframeFilter": false,
   "childFilter": {}
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are 2 parts, &lt;code&gt;parent&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;parent&lt;/code&gt; is optional but if it exists it will be resolved first, and used as the starting point for &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt;. This allows you to construct very complicated selections of elements that wouldn't otherwise be possible with a single plain CSS selector. One example of such is selecting into shadow DOM - where using parent to target the element with the shadow allows querying its children with the selector.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the parameters to &lt;code&gt;parent&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt; except &lt;code&gt;selector&lt;/code&gt; are optional.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The selection method works by using the CSS selector from &lt;code&gt;selector&lt;/code&gt; and then filtering the resulting DOM nodes via the various available filters:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;textFilter&lt;/code&gt;filters all nodes that do not include the given text. It can also be given as an array&lt;code&gt;"textFilter":["filter1", "filter2"]&lt;/code&gt;and then it filters all nodes that do not include one of the given text filters.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;styleFilter&lt;/code&gt;filters based on computedStyles.&lt;code&gt;option&lt;/code&gt;is the style option to compare for example&lt;code&gt;position&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;is the value to compare against and&lt;code&gt;negated&lt;/code&gt;sets if the option value should match or not match the given value.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;displayFilter&lt;/code&gt;can be used to filter nodes based on if they are display hidden or not.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;iframeFilter&lt;/code&gt;filters nodes based on if they are inside an iframe or not.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;childFilter&lt;/code&gt;is a fully new DOM selection, that then filters on the original selection, based on if a selection was made by&lt;code&gt;childFilter&lt;/code&gt;or not.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is an example DOM selection:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;"parent": {
   "selector": ".myParent",
   "iframeFilter": true,
   "childFilter": {
      "target": {
         "selector": ".myChild",
         "textFilter": "Gregor"
      }
   }
},
"target": {
   "selector": ".myTarget"
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This selector first tries to find the &lt;code&gt;parent&lt;/code&gt; which is a DOM element with the class &lt;code&gt;myParent&lt;/code&gt; that is inside an iframe and has a child DOM element with the class &lt;code&gt;myChild&lt;/code&gt; that contains the text "Gregor".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then, using this parent as "root", it tries to find a DOM element with the class &lt;code&gt;myTarget&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This could then be the target of an action or matcher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actions are the part of Consent-O-Matic that actually do stuff. Some actions do something to a target selection, others have to do with control flow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This action simulates a mouse click on its target.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
   "type": "click",
   "target": {
      "selector": ".myButton",
      "textFilter": "Save settings"
   },
   "openInTab": false
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;openInTab&lt;/code&gt; if set to true, will trigger a ctrl+shift+click instead of a click, which should make the link, if any, open in a new tab, and focus that tab.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this example we only use a simple &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;textFilter&lt;/code&gt; but full DOM selection is supported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This action runs a list of actions in order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
   "type": "list",
   "actions": []
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;actions&lt;/code&gt; is an array of actions that will all be run in order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The consent action takes an array of consents, and tries to apply the users consent selections.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
   "type": "consent",
   "consents": []
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;consents&lt;/code&gt; is an array of Consent types&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some consent forms use a slider to set a consent level, this action supports simulating sliding with such a slider.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
   "type": "slide",
   "target": {
      "selector": ".mySliderKnob"
   },
   "dragTarget": {
      "target": {
         "selector": ".myChoosenOption"
      }
   },
   "axis": "y"
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt; is the target DOM element to simulate the slide motion on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;dragTarget&lt;/code&gt; is the DOM element to use for slide distance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;axis&lt;/code&gt; selects if the slider should go horizontal "x" or vertical "y".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The slide event will simulate that the mouse dragged &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt; the distance from &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;dragTarget&lt;/code&gt; on the given &lt;code&gt;axis&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This action is used as control flow, running another action depending on if a DOM selection finds an element or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
   "type": "ifcss",
   "target": {
      "selector": "",
   },
   "trueAction": {
      "type": "click",
      "target": {
         "selector": ".myTrueButton"
      }
   },
   "falseAction": {
      "type": "click",
      "target": {
         "selector": ".myFalseButton"
      }
   }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;trueAction&lt;/code&gt; is an action that will be run if the DOM selection finds an element.
&lt;code&gt;falseAction&lt;/code&gt; will be run when the DOM selection does not find an element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This action waits until the DOM selector finds a DOM element that matches. This is mostly used if something in the consent form loads slowly and needs to be waited for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
   "type": "waitcss",
   "target": {
      "selector": ".myWaitTarget"
   },
   "retries": 10,
   "waitTime": 200,
   "negated": false
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;retries&lt;/code&gt; is the number of times to check for the target DOM element. Deafults to 10.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;waitTime&lt;/code&gt; determines the time between retry attempts. Defaults to 250.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;negated&lt;/code&gt; makes "Wait For CSS" wait until the target is NOT found.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If some set of actions needs to be run several times, but with different DOM nodes as root, the for each action can be used. It runs its action 1 time for each DOM element that is selected by its DOM selection; all actions run inside the for each loop will see the DOM as starting from the currently selected node.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
   "type": "foreach",
   "target": {
      "selector": ".loopElement"
   },
   "action": {}
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;action&lt;/code&gt; is the action to run for each found DOM element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This action waits the given amount of milliseconds before continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
   "type": "wait",
   "waitTime": 250
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This action sets CSS class 'ConsentOMatic-CMP-Hider' on the DOM selection. The default CSS rules will then set opacity to 0 on the element.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
   "type": "hide",
   "target": {
      "selector": ".myHiddenClass"
   }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This action closes the current tab, useful for consent providers like Evidon, which likes to open new tabs with the consent dashboard inside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
   "type": "close"
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Matchers are used to check for the presence of some DOM selection, or the state of some DOM selection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This matcher checks for the presence of a DOM selection, and return that it matches if it exists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
   "type": "css",
   "target": {
      "selector": ".myMatchingClass"
   }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This matcher checks the state of an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type='checkbox' /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and returns that it matches if the checkbox is checked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
   "type": "checkbox",
   "target": {
      "selector": ".myInputCheckbox"
   }
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is what is used inside Consent Actions and defines the actual consent that the user should be giving or not giving.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each consent has a type, that matches the consent categories inside Consent-O-Matic, so if a user has toggled the first consent category to ON, (Type A) and the consent is of type "A", then the consent will be enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Usually the consent is given either as a toggle, or a set of buttons on/off. Therefore &lt;code&gt;consent&lt;/code&gt; has a mechanism for each of these cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
   "type": "A",
   "toggleAction": {},
   "matcher": {},
   "trueAction": {},
   "falseAction": {}
}&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; is the type of consent category this rule defines and determines if this consent should be on or off depending on the user's selection for that type of category.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;toggleAction&lt;/code&gt; this action is used to select consent if the popup uses a toggle or a switch to communicate consent. The action will be run if the matcher says the consent is in a state different from what the user has asked it to be, otherwise it will not be run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;matcher&lt;/code&gt; is the matcher used to check which state the consent is in. For a checkbox matcher, the consent is given if the checkbox is checked. For a CSS matcher the consent is given if the matcher finds a DOM selection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;trueAction&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;falseAction&lt;/code&gt; are actions used if consent instead has to be given by pressing one of two buttons, rather than being toggled on/off. These will be run depending on the user's selection of consent. If the user has given consent for this category type, the &lt;code&gt;trueAction&lt;/code&gt; will be run, and &lt;code&gt;falseAction&lt;/code&gt; will be run if the user has not given consent to this category type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;toggleAction&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;matcher&lt;/code&gt; is present on the content config, toggleAction will be used, if one of them is missing, &lt;code&gt;trueAction&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;falseAction&lt;/code&gt; will be used instead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As seen in the addon settings, in the same order:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;D: Information Storage and Access&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A: Preferences and Functionality&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;B: Performance and Analytics&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;E: Content selection, delivery, and reporting&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;F: Ad selection, delivery, and reporting&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;X: Other Purposes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Putting it all together, here is a full example of a CMP "MyCMP" that has 2 consent categories to toggle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;{
   "MyCMP": {

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A free and open-source rootkit for Linux&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;[LWN subscriber-only content]&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;Welcome to LWN.net&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The following subscription-only content has been made available to you by an LWN subscriber. Thousands of subscribers depend on LWN for the best news from the Linux and free software communities. If you enjoy this article, please consider subscribing to LWN.

    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While there are several rootkits that target Linux, they have so far not fully embraced the open-source ethos typical of Linux software. Luckily, Matheus Alves has been working to remedy this lack by creating an open-source rootkit called Singularity for Linux systems. Users who feel their computers are too secure can install the Singularity kernel module in order to allow remote code execution, disable security features, and hide files and processes from normal administrative tools. Despite its many features, Singularity is not currently known to be in use in the wild — instead, it provides security researchers with a testbed to investigate new detection and evasion techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; Alves is quite emphatic about the research nature of Singularity, saying that its main purpose is to help drive security research forward by demonstrating what is currently possible. He calls for anyone using the software to "&lt;quote&gt;be a researcher, not a criminal&lt;/quote&gt;", and to test it only on systems where they have explicit permission to test. If one did wish to use Singularity for nefarious purposes, however, the code is MIT licensed and freely available — using it in that way would only be a crime, not an instance of copyright infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Getting its hooks into the kernel&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole problem of how to obtain root permissions on a system and go about installing a kernel module is out of scope for Singularity; its focus is on how to maintain an undetected presence in the kernel once things have already been compromised. In order to do this, Singularity goes to a lot of trouble to present the illusion that the system hasn't been modified at all. It uses the kernel's existing Ftrace mechanism to hook into the functions that handle many system calls and change their responses to hide any sign of its presence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using Ftrace offers several advantages to the rootkit; most importantly, it means that the rootkit doesn't need to change the CPU trap-handling vector for system calls, which was one of the ways that some rootkits have been identified historically. It also avoids having to patch the kernel's functions directly — kernel functions already have hooks for Ftrace, so the rootkit doesn't need to perform its own ad-hoc modifications to the kernel's machine code, which might be detected. The Ftrace mechanism can be disabled at run time, of course — so Singularity helpfully enables it automatically and blocks any attempts to turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Singularity is concerned with hiding four classes of things: its own presence, the existence of attacker-controlled processes, network communication with those processes, and the files that those processes use. Hiding its own presence is actually fairly straightforward: when the kernel module is loaded, it resets the kernel's taint marker and removes itself from the list of active kernel modules. This also means that Singularity cannot be unloaded, since it doesn't appear in the normal interfaces that are used for unloading kernel modules. It also blocks the loading of subsequent kernel modules (although they will appear to load — they'll just silently fail). Consequently, Alves recommends experimenting with Singularity in a virtual machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Hiding processes&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hiding processes, on the other hand, is more complicated. The mechanism that Singularity uses starts by identifying and remembering which processes are supposed to be hidden. Singularity uses a single 32-entry array of process IDs to track attacker-controlled processes; this is because a more sophisticated data structure would introduce more opportunities for the rootkit to be caught, either by adding additional memory allocations that could be noticed, or by introducing delays whenever one of its hooked functions needs to check the list of hidden process IDs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Singularity supports two ways to add processes to the list: by sending an unused signal, or by setting a special environment variable and launching a new process. To implement the former, it hooks the kill() system call to detect an unused signal (number 59, by default), quashes the signal, adds the target process to its internal list, and gives the process root permissions in the global namespace. This means that attacker-controlled processes can be added from inside containers, and automatically escape the container using their new root privileges. To handle the environment variable, the execve() system call is hooked in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once a process is in the list, attempts to send signal 0 (to check whether the process exists) are also intercepted, as are other system calls that could refer to the process, such as getpgid(), sched_getaffinity(), and others. The total number of processes on the system, as reported by sysinfo() is also decremented to keep things consistent. The process's files in /proc are hidden by Singularity's file-hiding code. That code is probably the trickiest part of the whole rootkit. The basic idea is to filter out hidden directory entries such that the filesystem appears to remain in a consistent state, but filesystem code is difficult to get right at the best of times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Hiding files&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a program calls getdents(), the kernel fills the provided buffer with directory entries as normal. Then, Singularity's hook copies the buffer back from user memory, removes the hidden entries, puts the modified buffer back in user memory, and changes the return value of the system call to reflect the smaller number of directory entries returned. This slightly complicated process is because the kernel doesn't provide a good place for Singularity to inject a hook before the directory entries are written to user memory the first time. So, one potential way to identify the rootkit is to have another thread race with the attempt to read directory entries, trying to spot any that were removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Changing the number of returned directory entries alone would make the system appear to be in an inconsistent state, however. Directories in Linux filesystems are supposed to track the number of references to them; this includes the ".." references inside child directories. So, when hiding a directory, Singularity also needs to intercept calls to stat() in order to adjust the number of visible links to its parent directory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Direct access to hidden directories, in the form of openat() and related system calls, is also made to fail. readlink() poses a special challenge because it resolves symbolic links without actually opening them; it has to be handled separately. In addition to the procfs files of hidden processes, Singularity also hides any directories matching a set of user-supplied patterns. By default, it hides things named "singularity", but the project's documentation suggests changing this in the build configuration, since otherwise detecting the rootkit becomes straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite this sophisticated file-hiding machinery, Singularity doesn't help against forensic examinations of a hard disk from another computer. If it isn't installed in the running kernel, it can't hide anything. Therefore, the documentation also recommends putting as many hidden files as possible onto temporary filesystems stored in RAM, so that they don't show up after the system is rebooted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another problem for the rootkit is files that contain traces of its presence, but that would raise eyebrows if they disappeared entirely. This includes things like the system log, but also files in procfs like kallsyms or enabled_functions that expose which kernel functions have had Ftrace probes attached. For those files, Singularity doesn't hide them at the filesystem level, but it does filter calls to read() to hide incriminating information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deciding which log lines are incriminating isn't a completely solved problem, though. Right now, Singularity relies on matching a set of known strings. This is another place where users will have to customize the build to avoid simple detection methods.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Hiding network activity&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even once an attacker's processes can hide themselves and their files, it is still usually desirable to communicate information back to a command-and-control server. Singularity will work to hide network connections using a specific TCP port (8081, by default), and hide packets sent to and from that port from packet captures. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6. Hiding the connections from tools like netstat uses the same filesystem-hiding code as before. Hiding things from packet captures requires hooking into the kernel's packet-receiving code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, this is another place where Singularity can't control the observations of uncompromised computers: if one is running a network tap on another computer, the packets to and from Singularity's hidden port will be totally visible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;The importance of compatibility&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Singularity only supports x86 and x86_64, but it does support both 64-bit and 32-bit system call interfaces. This is important, because otherwise a 32-bit application running on top of a 64-bit kernel could potentially see different results, which would be suspicious. To avoid this, Singularity inserts all of the aforementioned Ftrace hooks twice, once on the 32-bit system call and once on the 64-bit system call. A generic wrapper function converts from the 32-bit calling convention to the 64-bit calling convention before forwarding to the actual implementation of the hook.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Singularity has been tested on a variety of 6.x kernels, including some versions shipped by Ubuntu, CentOS Stream, Debian, and Fedora. Since the tool primarily uses the Ftrace interface, it should be supported on most kernels — although since it interfaces with internal details of the kernel, there is always the chance that an update will break things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tool also comes bundled with a set of utility scripts for cleaning up evidence that it was installed in the first place. These include a script that mimics normal log-rotation behavior, except that it silently truncates the logs to hinder analysis; a script that securely shreds a source-code checkout in case the module was compiled locally; and a script that automatically configures the rootkit's module to be loaded on boot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall, Singularity is remarkably sneaky. If someone didn't know what to look for, they would probably have trouble identifying that anything was amiss. The rootkit's biggest tell is probably the way that it prevents Ftrace from being disabled; if one writes "0" to /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace_enabled and the content of the file remains "1", that's a pretty clear sign that something is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Readers interested in fixing that limitation are welcome to submit a pull request to the project; Alves is interested in receiving bug fixes, suggestions for new evasion techniques, and reports of working detection methods. The code itself is simple and modular, so it is relatively easy to adapt Singularity for one's own purposes. Perhaps having such a vivid demonstration of what is possible to do with a rootkit will inspire new, better detection or prevention methods.&lt;/p&gt;

On one hand, some sort of antivirus might be able to find the suspicious hooks by loading a module or filter. If the EDR calls home to the admin dashboard and says it failed to talk to its module, the user's device can fail some enterprise posture compliance thing and the machine won't be allowed to log in to the VPN or corporate SSO.

It's not to say that it would reveal it to the unsuspecting user, but those aware of these names might recognize the pattern. In any case it's really nice to provide such a playground to demonstrate what can really happen and that intrusions are not science fiction. Posted Jan 17, 2026 22:39 UTC (Sat) by matheuz (subscriber, #181907) [Link] Another point is that previously there was only a hook on finit and init_module to prevent other rootkit scanners that look for gaps in kernel memory from detecting it. In practice, they still fail to detect it. Even so, I will further improve module hiding using a technique that also avoids detection by LKM-based rootkit scanners. The blocking of new modules is temporary, and this hook will be removed soon. The same applies to blocking certain eBPF operations. This is also temporary. Once I have more time to work on Singularity, eBPF operations that attempt to detect hidden processes or files will be bypassed as well. That said, there will no longer be any behavioral changes related to these two modules. Additionally, Singularity can bypass EDRs such as CrowdStrike Falcon, which is eBPF-based, Trend Micro EDR, which is LKM-based, Kaspersky, also LKM-based, Elastic Security (there is an article in the Singularity README explaining how to bypass it), and some other EDRs that I tested in my virtual machine.

From user space, ftrace appears to be properly disabled, since reading ftrace_enabled returns the expected value and no abnormal behavior is observed. Internally, however, ftrace remains fully operational. The internal state is determined by the intercepted write and tracked via internal flags, rather than relying on the real kernel ftrace toggle. Additionally, when ftrace is in this fake-disabled state, access to tracing interfaces such as trace, trace_pipe, enabled_functions, and touched_functions is carefully controlled. Reads from trace return only static header information and no new events, while reads from trace_pipe block indefinitely without emitting trace data. This behavior closely matches that of a legitimately disabled ftrace subsystem and prevents the leakage of partial or suspicious output. As a result, common detection techniques that rely on inconsistencies in ftrace_enabled, or on monitoring trace and trace_pipe for unexpected activity, are ineffective. The overall behavior remains coherent and indistinguishable from a normal ftrace disable operation, despite ftrace continuing to function internally.

Most of the needed pieces appear to be present, although a Martus-like system should also report the total storage capacity to be smaller than the actual amount. A security system for dissidents and journalists could reuse many of the components, but allow the user to deploy and control them. &lt;head&gt;Stealth or anti-debug?&lt;/head&gt;&lt;lb/&gt; But it looks like the init_module hook just returns -ENOEXEC, that's bound to raise some alarms, too.&lt;lb/&gt; Or for desktop users, you will have a black screen after loading nvidia.ko... and actually you probably wouldn't suspect anything.

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Training a 30M parameters Topological Transformer&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tauformer is a topological transformer (see paper) that replaces dot‑product attention with a Laplacian-derived scalar (taumode) per token/head, then attends using distances in that scalar space. Below is a post-style overview of the idea and the first training signals from a 30M-parameter run.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tauformer in one idea&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tauformer’s goal is to inject domain structure directly into attention by using a Graph Laplacian built from a domain embedding space (a “domain memory”) as a persistent reference. Instead of ranking keys by \(Q\cdot K\), Tauformer ranks them by how similar their Laplacian-derived taumode scalars are, which is intended to bias attention toward domain-relevant relations rather than generic geometric similarity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the implementation level, Tauformer keeps the familiar Q/K/V projections, RoPE, causal masking, and stable softmax/value aggregation pipeline, but changes how attention logits are computed. Each head vector is compressed into a scalar \(\lambda\) using a bounded Rayleigh-quotient energy computed with a feature-space Laplacian \(L\), then logits are computed as a negative distance \(-|\lambda_q-\lambda_k|/\text{temperature}\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key building blocks (as implemented):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Taumode scalar: compute \(E_{\text{raw}}=(x^\top L x)/(x^\top x+\varepsilon)\), then bound it as \(E_{\text{raw}}/(E_{\text{raw}}+\tau)\) to produce \(\lambda\in[0,1)\).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Logits: \(\text{att}_{ij} = -\|\lambda^Q_i - \lambda^K_j\|/\text{temperature}\), then reuse causal mask \(→\) subtract row max \(→\) softmax \(→\) multiply by \(V\).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why it can be cheaper&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because scoring no longer needs full key vectors, Tauformer’s KV-cache can store values plus a compact key-side scalar stream rather than both K and V tensors. Concretely, the cache payload is \((V,\lambda_k)\) (not \((K,V)\)), which yields an approximate ~50% per-layer cache reduction for typical head dimensions (small overhead for storing the extra scalar).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The design also anticipates using a sparse Laplacian from a precomputed domain manifold so computing \(\lambda\) can depend on Laplacian sparsity (nnz) rather than dense \(D^2\) multiplication. It exchanges the long preliminary adjustment of weights with a pre-training shorter phase in which a Laplacian is built using &lt;code&gt;arrowspace&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Run setup (what was trained)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This run trains a 30M-class TauGPT. Training uses AdamW with base LR \(5\times10^{-4}\) and a warmup of 100 steps, then keeps the base LR constant unless the plateau logic scales it down. Data comes from a local JSONL file (&lt;code&gt;train.jsonl&lt;/code&gt;) streamed through an IterableDataset, with a routed split where every 20th batch is used for validation (\(≈5%\)).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;cell&gt;About 5%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Results at a glance&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At step 100 the run reports train loss 4.6772 and val loss 4.9255 (PPL 107.47), and by step 2000 it reaches val loss 2.3585 (Perplexity 6.59). The best validation point in the log is step 4500 with &lt;code&gt;val_loss=1.9146&lt;/code&gt;, after which validation regresses to &lt;code&gt;2.3746&lt;/code&gt; by step 5000.
The final run summary records &lt;code&gt;step=5000&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;best_val_loss=1.914555&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;current_lr_scale=0.03125&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;total_tokens=655360000&lt;/code&gt;. That is a good result for \(~2\) hours of training on this smallest model (at an average of ~60K Tokens Per Second).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The early phase is strong: validation drops from 4.93 at step 100 to ~2.36 by step 2000, showing that the model and pipeline learn effectively at this scale. After that, validation becomes noisy (e.g., rising back to 2.92 at step 2100 and peaking near 2.95 at step 4200) before the late “lucky break” to 1.91 at step 4500. Throughout, the run holds a fixed taumode value which means the attention geometry is not being updated as weights evolve as this will be take place in the next iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Baseline: Closing note&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All the model’s files, data, training settings and logs will be published with a permissive license once the results are consolidated and tests will move to a larger scale model.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This baseline run kept taumode fixed throughout, while using a simple validation loop and plateau-triggered LR scaling, and it still converged quickly in the early-to-mid training window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the later part of the run shows volatility and regression after the best checkpoint, the next experiments focus on “adaptive” taumode strategies where taumode is recalibrated at intervals (including the “gradient” strategy that detects energy drift and gates recalibration by performance of the gradient in the previous steps) plus more sophisticated validation behaviors already implemented in the training loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Considering the small model size and the short training horizon (5,000 steps total, lowest loss at 4600), these results support the architecture as promising, with broader evaluation and scaled tests planned next—especially at 100M parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A very interesting question has been raised by this test: what is the correlation between cross-entropy and taumode? Model convergence brings the loss down but at the same time recalibrating the taumode used on the learned weights brings down the taumode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What may be correlated (and why)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cross-entropy and taumode are likely correlated because Tauformer’s attention kernel is built from Laplacian-derived scalar energies (λ/taumode) rather than dot-product similarity, so changes in the λ distribution change attention behavior and therefore training dynamics. In the current training loop, the observed “taumode convergence” is also mechanically explained by how taumode is recalibrated: on (re)start, the code can compute a median energy from block0 key (K) vectors produced by the current weights and then set that median as the global taumode.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What “converging taumode” means here&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The calibration is effectively computing a Rayleigh-style energy statistic on K vectors under a Laplacian (numerator/denominator), and then taking a median over the batch to set a single scalar taumode. In the reference implementation, taumode/λ is based on a bounded Rayleigh quotient: \(E_{\text{raw}}(x) = \frac{x^\top L x}{x^\top x + \varepsilon}\) and then \(\lambda_\tau(x)=\frac{E_{\text{raw}}}{E_{\text{raw}}+\tau}\), which maps energies into \([0,1)\).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why taumode can drift downward as loss improves&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Healthy interpretation: as training progresses, the model may learn K representations that are “smoother” (lower-energy, so closer) with respect to the domain/manifold Laplacian, pushing the median energy down while also improving next-token prediction (lower cross-entropy).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Unhealthy interpretation (collapse risk): median energy can also drop if K vectors collapse toward low-variance or less-discriminative configurations, which can reduce contrast in λ-distance logits even if loss continues improving short-term.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Key confound: if taumode is recalibrated on resume, then taumode changes are not purely a passive “measurement of convergence”; they can act like a mid-training hyperparameter change, so correlation with loss does not automatically imply causality in the direction “lower taumode \(⇒\) lower loss”.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A strong explanation for “converging taumode” (as a property of learned representations, not an artifact) is: as weights converge, the distribution of per-token energies \(x^\top L x\) stabilizes, so repeated measurements (median, p50) across batches and checkpoints become consistent and typically shift toward lower-energy manifold-aligned directions. To validate that, it helps to separate (1) the fixed constant used by attention from (2) a purely diagnostic “current batch median energy”, and track not just the median but also the spread (p05/p95), because collapse would show shrinking spread even when the median looks lower.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“lower loss \(⇒\) lower taumode” is a plausible causal direction in Tauformer, because the cross-entropy gradient flows through the Tauformer attention path that depends on Laplacian-energy-derived scalars computed from Q/K (and in your calibration code, specifically from block0 K vectors). As the model improves next-token prediction, it can simultaneously learn representations whose Laplacian Rayleigh energy is lower, so any “recalibrate taumode from learned weights” procedure will tend to output a smaller median. If this it true, where is the optimal stopping state?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Further readings&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some shift is happening in understanding information thanks to large scale learning machines!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this recent paper, MDL refers to the “minimum description length principle”, which says the best explanation/model is the one that minimizes the total code length needed to describe (1) the model and (2) the data given the model. Epiplexity \(ST(X)\) is defined as the program length of the compute-feasible model \(P\) that minimizes time-bounded MDL, while time-bounded entropy HT(X) is the expected code length of the data under that model. Operationally, the paper proposes practical estimators based on neural-network training dynamics (e.g., prequential “area under the loss curve above final loss”) to approximate how much structure a bounded learner actually absorbs from data&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Qualitatively, &lt;code&gt;arrowspace&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;taumode&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tau-attention&lt;/code&gt; are exactly the kind of deterministic computations that can increase usable/learnable structure for bounded learners, which is one of the central motivations for epiplexity.
Through the epiplexity lens, the operations carried on by &lt;code&gt;arrowspace&lt;/code&gt; and Tauformer (converts each head vector into a bounded scalar λτ using a Rayleigh-quotient-style energy followed by a bounding map) is a deterministic compression that can re-factor information into a form that is cheaper for downstream computation to exploit, potentially increasing the amount of structure a bounded observer can learn from the same underlying signal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am happy I have somehow anticipated this switch in point of view in &lt;code&gt;arrowspace&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Acknoledgements&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I gratefully acknowledge Enverge Labs for kindly providing the computation time used to run these experiments on their H100 GPU cluster powered by clean and cheap energy, this aligns perfectly with the topological tranformer objective to provide cheaper computation for Transformers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Introduction to When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve changed careers every two or three years ever since I dropped out of university in 1990, and one of the best gigs I ever had was working as a freelance systems administrator, working in the steam tunnels of the information age, pulling cables, configuring machines, keeping the backups running, kicking the network in its soft and vulnerable places. Sysadmins are the unsung heroes of the century, and if they’re not busting you for sending racy IMs, or engaging in unprofessional email conduct it’s purely out of their own goodwill.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a pernicious myth that the Internet was designed to withstand a nuclear war; while that Strangelove wet-dream was undoubtedly present in the hindbrains of the generals who greenlighted the network’s R&amp;amp;D at companies like Rand and BBN, it wasn’t really a big piece of the actual engineering and design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it does make for a compelling scenario, this vision of the sysadmins in their cages around the world, watching with held breath as the generator failed and the servers went dark, waiting out the long hours until the power and the air run out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This story originally appeared in Baen’s Universe Magazine, an admirable, high-quality online magazine edited by Eric Flint, himself a talented writer and a passionate advocate for open and free culture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Listeners to my podcast heard this story as it was written, read aloud in serial chinks after each composing session. The pressure of listeners writing in, demanding to know what happened next, kept me honest and writing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Originally published in Baen’s Universe, 2006)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Felix’s special phone rang at two in the morning, Kelly rolled over and punched him in the shoulder and hissed, “Why didn’t you turn that fucking thing off before bed?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Because I’m on call,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You’re not a fucking doctor,” she said, kicking him as he sat on the bed’s edge, pulling on the pants he’d left on the floor before turning in. “You’re a goddamned systems administrator.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s my job,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They work you like a government mule,” she said. “You know I’m right. For Christ’s sake, you’re a father now, you can’t go running off in the middle of the night every time someone’s porn supply goes down. Don’t answer that phone.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He knew she was right. He answered the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Main routers not responding. BGP not responding.” The mechanical voice of the systems monitor didn’t care if he cursed at it, so he did, and it made him feel a little better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Maybe I can fix it from here,” he said. He could login to the UPS for the cage and reboot the routers. The UPS was in a different netblock, with its own independent routers on their own uninterruptible power-supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kelly was sitting up in bed now, an indistinct shape against the headboard. “In five years of marriage, you have never once been able to fix anything from here.” This time she was wrong—he fixed stuff from home all the time, but he did it discreetly and didn’t make a fuss, so she didn’t remember it. And she was right, too—he had logs that showed that after 1AM, nothing could ever be fixed without driving out to the cage. Law of Infinite Universal Perversity—AKA Felix’s Law.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Five minutes later Felix was behind the wheel. He hadn’t been able to fix it from home. The independent router’s netblock was offline, too. The last time that had happened, some dumbfuck construction worker had driven a ditch-witch through the main conduit into the data-center and Felix had joined a cadre of fifty enraged sysadmins who’d stood atop the resulting pit for a week, screaming abuse at the poor bastards who labored 24-7 to splice ten thousand wires back together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His phone went off twice more in the car and he let it override the stereo and play the mechanical status reports through the big, bassy speakers of more critical network infrastructure offline. Then Kelly called.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Hi,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Don’t cringe, I can hear the cringe in your voice.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He smiled involuntarily. “Check, no cringing.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I love you, Felix,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’m totally bonkers for you, Kelly. Go back to bed.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“2.0’s awake,” she said. The baby had been Beta Test when he was in her womb, and when her water broke, he got the call and dashed out of the office, shouting, The Gold Master just shipped! They’d started calling him 2.0 before he’d finished his first cry. “This little bastard was born to suck tit.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry I woke you,” he said. He was almost at the data center. No traffic at 2AM. He slowed down and pulled over before the entrance to the garage. He didn’t want to lose Kelly’s call underground.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s not waking me,” she said. “You’ve been there for seven years. You have three juniors reporting to you. Give them the phone. You’ve paid your dues.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I don’t like asking my reports to do anything I wouldn’t do,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You’ve done it,” she said. “Please? I hate waking up alone in the night. I miss you most at night.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Kelly—”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’m over being angry. I just miss you is all. You give me sweet dreams.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“OK,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Simple as that?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Exactly. Simple as that. Can’t have you having bad dreams, and I’ve paid my dues. From now on, I’m only going on night call to cover holidays.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She laughed. “Sysadmins don’t take holidays.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“This one will,” he said. “Promise.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You’re wonderful,” she said. “Oh, gross. 2.0 just dumped core all over my bathrobe.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“That’s my boy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Oh that he is,” she said. She hung up, and he piloted the car into the data-center lot, badging in and peeling up a bleary eyelid to let the retinal scanner get a good look at his sleep-depped eyeball.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He stopped at the machine to get himself a guarana/medafonil power-bar and a cup of lethal robot-coffee in a spill-proof clean-room sippy-cup. He wolfed down the bar and sipped the coffee, then let the inner door read his hand-geometry and size him up for a moment. It sighed open and gusted the airlock’s load of positively pressurized air over him as he passed finally to the inner sanctum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was bedlam. The cages were designed to let two or three sysadmins maneuver around them at a time. Every other inch of cubic space was given over to humming racks of servers and routers and drives. Jammed among them were no fewer than twenty other sysadmins. It was a regular convention of black tee-shirts with inexplicable slogans, bellies overlapping belts with phones and multitools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normally it was practically freezing in the cage, but all those bodies were overheating the small, enclosed space. Five or six looked up and grimaced when he came through. Two greeted him by name. He threaded his belly through the press and the cages, toward the Ardent racks in the back of the room.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Felix.” It was Van, who wasn’t on call that night.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What are you doing here?” he asked. “No need for both of us to be wrecked tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What? Oh. My personal box is over there. It went down around 1:30 and I got woken up by my process-monitor. I should have called you and told you I was coming down—spared you the trip.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix’s own server—a box he shared with five other friends—was in a rack one floor down. He wondered if it was offline too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What’s the story?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Massive flashworm attack. Some jackass with a zero-day exploit has got every Windows box on the net running Monte Carlo probes on every IP block, including IPv6. The big Ciscos all run administrative interfaces over v6, and they all fall over if they get more than ten simultaneous probes, which means that just about every interchange has gone down. DNS is screwy, too—like maybe someone poisoned the zone transfer last night. Oh, and there’s an email and IM component that sends pretty lifelike messages to everyone in your address book, barfing up Eliza-dialog that keys off of your logged email and messages to get you to open a Trojan.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Jesus.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Yeah.” Van was a type-two sysadmin, over six feet tall, long pony-tail, bobbing Adam’s apple. Over his toast-rack chest, his tee said CHOOSE YOUR WEAPON and featured a row of polyhedral RPG dice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix was a type-one admin, with an extra seventy or eighty pounds all around the middle, and a neat but full beard that he wore over his extra chins. His tee said HELLO CTHULHU and featured a cute, mouthless, Hello-Kitty-style Cthulhu. They’d known each other for fifteen years, having met on Usenet, then f2f at Toronto Freenet beer-sessions, a Star Trek convention or two, and eventually Felix had hired Van to work under him at Ardent. Van was reliable and methodical. Trained as an electrical engineer, he kept a procession of spiral notebooks filled with the details of every step he’d ever taken, with time and date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Not even PEBKAC this time,” Van said. Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair. Email trojans fell into that category—if people were smart enough not to open suspect attachments, email trojans would be a thing of the past. But worms that ate Cisco routers weren’t a problem with the lusers—they were the fault of incompetent engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“No, it’s Microsoft’s fault,” Felix said. “Any time I’m at work at 2AM, it’s either PEBKAC or Microsloth.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They ended up just unplugging the frigging routers from the Internet. Not Felix, of course, though he was itching to do it and get them rebooted after shutting down their IPv6 interfaces. It was done by a couple bull-goose Bastard Operators From Hell who had to turn two keys at once to get access to their cage—like guards in a Minuteman silo. 95 percent of the long distance traffic in Canada went through this building. It had better security than most Minuteman silos.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix and Van got the Ardent boxes back online one at a time. They were being pounded by worm-probes—putting the routers back online just exposed the downstream cages to the attack. Every box on the Internet was drowning in worms, or creating worm-attacks, or both. Felix managed to get through to NIST and Bugtraq after about a hundred timeouts, and download some kernel patches that should reduce the load the worms put on the machines in his care. It was 10AM, and he was hungry enough to eat the ass out of a dead bear, but he recompiled his kernels and brought the machines back online. Van’s long fingers flew over the administrative keyboard, his tongue protruding as he ran load-stats on each one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I had two hundred days of uptime on Greedo,” Van said. Greedo was the oldest server in the rack, from the days when they’d named the boxes after Star Wars characters. Now they were all named after Smurfs, and they were running out of Smurfs and had started in on McDonaldland characters, starting with Van’s laptop, Mayor McCheese.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Greedo will rise again,” Felix said. “I’ve got a 486 downstairs with over five years of uptime. It’s going to break my heart to reboot it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What the everlasting shit do you use a 486 for?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Nothing. But who shuts down a machine with five years uptime? That’s like euthanizing your grandmother.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I wanna eat,” Van said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Tell you what,” Felix said. “We’ll get your box up, then mine, then I’ll take you to the Lakeview Lunch for breakfast pizzas and you can have the rest of the day off.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You’re on,” Van said. “Man, you’re too good to us grunts. You should keep us in a pit and beat us like all the other bosses. It’s all we deserve.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s your phone,” Van said. Felix extracted himself from the guts of the 486, which had refused to power up at all. He had cadged a spare power-supply from some guys who ran a spam operation and was trying to get it fitted. He let Van hand him the phone, which had fallen off his belt while he was twisting to get at the back of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Hey, Kel,” he said. There was an odd, snuffling noise in the background. Static, maybe? 2.0 splashing in the bath? “Kelly?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The line went dead. He tried to call back, but didn’t get anything—no ring nor voicemail. His phone finally timed out and said NETWORK ERROR.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Dammit,” he said, mildly. He clipped the phone to his belt. Kelly wanted to know when he was coming home, or wanted him to pick something up for the family. She’d leave voicemail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He was testing the power-supply when his phone rang again. He snatched it up and answered it. “Kelly, hey, what’s up?” He worked to keep anything like irritation out of his voice. He felt guilty: technically speaking, he had discharged his obligations to Ardent Financial LLC once the Ardent servers were back online. The past three hours had been purely personal—even if he planned on billing them to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was sobbing on the line.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Kelly?” He felt the blood draining from his face and his toes were numb.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Felix,” she said, barely comprehensible through the sobbing. “He’s dead, oh Jesus, he’s dead.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Who? Who, Kelly?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Will,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will? he thought. Who the fuck is—He dropped to his knees. William was the name they’d written on the birth certificate, though they’d called him 2.0 all along. Felix made an anguished sound, like a sick bark.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’m sick,” she said, “I can’t even stand anymore. Oh, Felix. I love you so much.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Kelly? What’s going on?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Everyone, everyone—” she said. “Only two channels left on the tube. Christ, Felix, it looks like dawn of the dead out the window—” He heard her retch. The phone started to break up, washing her puke-noises back like an echoplex.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Stay there, Kelly,” he shouted as the line died. He punched 911, but the phone went NETWORK ERROR again as soon as he hit SEND.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He grabbed Mayor McCheese from Van and plugged it into the 486’s network cable and launched Firefox off the command line and googled for the Metro Police site. Quickly, but not frantically, he searched for an online contact form. Felix didn’t lose his head, ever. He solved problems and freaking out didn’t solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He located an online form and wrote out the details of his conversation with Kelly like he was filing a bug report, his fingers fast, his description complete, and then he hit SUBMIT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van had read over his shoulder. “Felix—” he began.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“God,” Felix said. He was sitting on the floor of the cage and he slowly pulled himself upright. Van took the laptop and tried some news sites, but they were all timing out. Impossible to say if it was because something terrible was happening or because the network was limping under the superworm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I need to get home,” Felix said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’ll drive you,” Van said. “You can keep calling your wife.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They made their way to the elevators. One of the building’s few windows was there, a thick, shielded porthole. They peered through it as they waited for the elevator. Not much traffic for a Wednesday. Were there more police cars than usual?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Oh my God—” Van pointed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CN Tower, a giant white-elephant needle of a building loomed to the east of them. It was askew, like a branch stuck in wet sand. Was it moving? It was. It was heeling over, slowly, but gaining speed, falling northeast toward the financial district. In a second, it slid over the tipping point and crashed down. They felt the shock, then heard it, the whole building rocking from the impact. A cloud of dust rose from the wreckage, and there was more thunder as the world’s tallest freestanding structure crashed through building after building.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The Broadcast Centre’s coming down,” Van said. It was—the CBC’s towering building was collapsing in slow motion. People ran every way, were crushed by falling masonry. Seen through the port-hole, it was like watching a neat CGI trick downloaded from a file-sharing site.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sysadmins were clustering around them now, jostling to see the destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What happened?” one of them asked.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The CN Tower fell down,” Felix said. He sounded far away in his own ears.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Was it the virus?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The worm? What?” Felix focused on the guy, who was a young admin with just a little type-two flab around the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Not the worm,” the guy said. “I got an email that the whole city’s quarantined because of some virus. Bioweapon, they say.” He handed Felix his Blackberry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix was so engrossed in the report—purportedly forwarded from Health Canada—that he didn’t even notice that all the lights had gone out. Then he did, and he pressed the Blackberry back into its owner’s hand, and let out one small sob.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The generators kicked in a minute later. Sysadmins stampeded for the stairs. Felix grabbed Van by the arm, pulled him back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Maybe we should wait this out in the cage,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What about Kelly?” Van said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix felt like he was going to throw up. “We should get into the cage, now.” The cage had microparticulate air-filters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They ran upstairs to the big cage. Felix opened the door and then let it hiss shut behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Felix, you need to get home—”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s a bioweapon,” Felix said. “Superbug. We’ll be OK in here, I think, so long as the filters hold out.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Get on IRC,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They did. Van had Mayor McCheese and Felix used Smurfette. They skipped around the chat channels until they found one with some familiar handles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; pentagons gone/white house too&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; MY NEIGHBORS BARFING BLOOD OFF HIS BALCONY IN SAN DIEGO&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Someone knocked over the Gherkin. Bankers are fleeing the City like rats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I heard that the Ginza’s on fire&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix typed: I’m in Toronto. We just saw the CN Tower fall. I’ve heard reports of bioweapons, something very fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van read this and said, “You don’t know how fast it is, Felix. Maybe we were all exposed three days ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix closed his eyes. “If that were so we’d be feeling some symptoms, I think.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Looks like an EMP took out Hong Kong and maybe Paris—realtime sat footage shows them completely dark, and all netblocks there aren’t routing&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You’re in Toronto?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was an unfamiliar handle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Yes—on Front Street&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; my sisters at UofT and i cnt reach her—can you call her?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; No phone service&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix typed, staring at NETWORK PROBLEMS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I have a soft phone on Mayor McCheese,” Van said, launching his voice-over-IP app. “I just remembered.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix took the laptop from him and punched in his home number. It rang once, then there was a flat, blatting sound like an ambulance siren in an Italian movie.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; No phone service&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix typed again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He looked up at Van, and saw that his skinny shoulders were shaking. Van said, “Holy motherfucking shit. The world is ending.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix pried himself off of IRC an hour later. Atlanta had burned. Manhattan was hot—radioactive enough to screw up the webcams looking out over Lincoln Plaza. Everyone blamed Islam until it became clear that Mecca was a smoking pit and the Saudi Royals had been hanged before their palaces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His hands were shaking, and Van was quietly weeping in the far corner of the cage. He tried calling home again, and then the police. It didn’t work any better than it had the last 20 times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He sshed into his box downstairs and grabbed his mail. Spam, spam, spam. More spam. Automated messages. There—an urgent message from the intrusion detection system in the Ardent cage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He opened it and read quickly. Someone was crudely, repeatedly probing his routers. It didn’t match a worm’s signature, either. He followed the traceroute and discovered that the attack had originated in the same building as him, a system in a cage one floor below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He had procedures for this. He portscanned his attacker and found that port 1337 was open—1337 was “leet” or “elite” in hacker number/letter substitution code. That was the kind of port that a worm left open to slither in and out of. He googled known sploits that left a listener on port 1337, narrowed this down based on the fingerprinted operating system of the compromised server, and then he had it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was an ancient worm, one that every box should have been patched against years before. No mind. He had the client for it, and he used it to create a root account for himself on the box, which he then logged into, and took a look around.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was one other user logged in, “scaredy,” and he checked the proccess monitor and saw that scaredy had spawned all the hundreds of processes that were probing him and plenty of other boxen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He opened a chat:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Stop probing my server&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He expected bluster, guilt, denial. He was surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Are you in the Front Street data-center?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Yes&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Christ I thought I was the last one alive. I’m on the fourth floor. I think there’s a bioweapon attack outside. I don’t want to leave the clean room.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix whooshed out a breath.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You were probing me to get me to trace back to you?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Yeah&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; That was smart&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clever bastard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I’m on the sixth floor, I’ve got one more with me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; What do you know?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix pasted in the IRC log and waited while the other guy digested it. Van stood up and paced. His eyes were glazed over.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Van? Pal?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I have to pee,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“No opening the door,” Felix said. “I saw an empty Mountain Dew bottle in the trash there.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Right,” Van said. He walked like a zombie to the trash can and pulled out the empty magnum. He turned his back.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I’m Felix&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Will&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix’s stomach did a slow somersault as he thought about 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Felix, I think I need to go outside,” Van said. He was moving toward the airlock door. Felix dropped his keyboard and struggled to his feet and ran headlong to Van, tackling him before he reached the door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Van,” he said, looking into his friend’s glazed, unfocused eyes. “Look at me, Van.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I need to go,” Van said. “I need to get home and feed the cats.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There’s something out there, something fast-acting and lethal. Maybe it will blow away with the wind. Maybe it’s already gone. But we’re going to sit here until we know for sure or until we have no choice. Sit down, Van. Sit.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’m cold, Felix.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was freezing. Felix’s arms were broken out in gooseflesh and his feet felt like blocks of ice.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Sit against the servers, by the vents. Get the exhaust heat.” He found a rack and nestled up against it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Are you there?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Still here—sorting out some logistics&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; How long until we can go out?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I have no idea&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No one typed anything for quite some time then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix had to use the Mountain Dew bottle twice. Then Van used it again. Felix tried calling Kelly again. The Metro Police site was down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, he slid back against the servers and wrapped his arms around his knees and wept like a baby.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a minute, Van came over and sat beside him, with his arm around Felix’s shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They’re dead, Van,” Felix said. “Kelly and my s—son. My family is gone.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You don’t know for sure,” Van said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’m sure enough,” Felix said. “Christ, it’s all over, isn’t it?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’ll gut it out a few more hours and then head out. Things should be getting back to normal soon. The fire department will fix it. They’ll mobilize the Army. It’ll be OK.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix’s ribs hurt. He hadn’t cried since—Since 2.0 was born. He hugged his knees harder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then the doors opened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two sysadmins who entered were wild-eyed. One had a tee that said TALK NERDY TO ME and the other one was wearing an Electronic Frontiers Canada shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Come on,” TALK NERDY said. “We’re all getting together on the top floor. Take the stairs.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix found he was holding his breath.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If there’s a bioagent in the building, we’re all infected,” TALK NERDY said. “Just go, we’ll meet you there.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There’s one on the sixth floor,” Felix said, as he climbed to his feet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Will, yeah, we got him. He’s up there.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TALK NERDY was one of the Bastard Operators From Hell who’d unplugged the big routers. Felix and Van climbed the stairs slowly, their steps echoing in the deserted shaft. After the frigid air of the cage, the stairwell felt like a sauna.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a cafeteria on the top floor, with working toilets, water and coffee and vending machine food. There was an uneasy queue of sysadmins before each. No one met anyone’s eye. Felix wondered which one was Will and then he joined the vending machine queue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He got a couple more energy bars and a gigantic cup of vanilla coffee before running out of change. Van had scored them some table space and Felix set the stuff down before him and got in the toilet line. “Just save some for me,” he said, tossing an energy bar in front of Van.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the time they were all settled in, thoroughly evacuated, and eating, TALK NERDY and his friend had returned again. They cleared off the cash-register at the end of the food-prep area and TALK NERDY got up on it. Slowly the conversation died down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I’m Uri Popovich, this is Diego Rosenbaum. Thank you all for coming up here. Here’s what we know for sure: the building’s been on generators for three hours now. Visual observation indicates that we’re the only building in central Toronto with working power—which should hold out for three more days. There is a bioagent of unknown origin loose beyond our doors. It kills quickly, within hours, and it is aerosolized. You get it from breathing bad air. No one has opened any of the exterior doors to this building since five this morning. No one will open the doors until I give the go-ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Attacks on major cities all over the world have left emergency responders in chaos. The attacks are electronic, biological, nuclear and conventional explosives, and they are very widespread. I’m a security engineer, and where I come from, attacks in this kind of cluster are usually viewed as opportunistic: group B blows up a bridge because everyone is off taking care of group A’s dirty nuke event. It’s smart. An Aum Shin Rikyo cell in Seoul gassed the subways there about 2AM Eastern—that’s the earliest event we can locate, so it may have been the Archduke that broke the camel’s back. We’re pretty sure that Aum Shin Rikyo couldn’t be behind this kind of mayhem: they have no history of infowar and have never shown the kind of organizational acumen necessary to take out so many targets at once. Basically, they’re not smart enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’re holing up here for the foreseeable future, at least until the bioweapon has been identified and dispersed. We’re going to staff the racks and keep the networks up. This is critical infrastructure, and it’s our job to make sure it’s got five nines of uptime. In times of national emergency, our responsibility to do that doubles.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One sysadmin put up his hand. He was very daring in a green Incredible Hulk ring-tee, and he was at the young end of the scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Who died and made you king?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I have controls for the main security system, keys to every cage, and passcodes for the exterior doors—they’re all locked now, by the way. I’m the one who got everyone up here first and called the meeting. I don’t care if someone else wants this job, it’s a shitty one. But someone needs to have this job.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You’re right,” the kid said. “And I can do it every bit as well as you. My name’s Will Sario.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Popovich looked down his nose at the kid. “Well, if you’ll let me finish talking, maybe I’ll hand things over to you when I’m done.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Finish, by all means.” Sario turned his back on him and walked to the window. He stared out of it intensely. Felix’s gaze was drawn to it, and he saw that there were several oily smoke plumes rising up from the city.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Popovich’s momentum was broken. “So that’s what we’re going to do,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kid looked around after a stretched moment of silence. “Oh, is it my turn now?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a round of good-natured chuckling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Here’s what I think: the world is going to shit. There are coordinated attacks on every critical piece of infrastructure. There’s only one way that those attacks could be so well coordinated: via the Internet. Even if you buy the thesis that the attacks are all opportunistic, we need to ask how an opportunistic attack could be organized in minutes: the Internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“So you think we should shut down the Internet?” Popovich laughed a little, but stopped when Sario said nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We saw an attack last night that nearly killed the Internet. A little DoS on the critical routers, a little DNS-foo, and down it goes like a preacher’s daughter. Cops and the military are a bunch of technophobic lusers, they hardly rely on the net at all. If we take the Internet down, we’ll disproportionately disadvantage the attackers, while only inconveniencing the defenders. When the time comes, we can rebuild it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You’re shitting me,” Popovich said. His jaw literally hung open.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s logical,” Sario said. “Lots of people don’t like coping with logic when it dictates hard decisions. That’s a problem with people, not logic.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a buzz of conversation that quickly turned into a roar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Shut UP!” Popovich hollered. The conversation dimmed by one Watt. Popovich yelled again, stamping his foot on the countertop. Finally there was a semblance of order. “One at a time,” he said. He was flushed red, his hands in his pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One sysadmin was for staying. Another for going. They should hide in the cages. They should inventory their supplies and appoint a quartermaster. They should go outside and find the police, or volunteer at hospitals. They should appoint defenders to keep the front door secure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix found to his surprise that he had his hand in the air. Popovich called on him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“My name is Felix Tremont,” he said, getting up on one of the tables, drawing out his PDA. “I want to read you something.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“‘Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“‘We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“‘Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know us, nor do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions.’&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“That’s from the Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace. It was written 12 years ago. I thought it was one of the most beautiful things I’d ever read. I wanted my kid to grow up in a world where cyberspace was free—and where that freedom infected the real world, so meatspace got freer too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He swallowed hard and scrubbed at his eyes with the back of his hand. Van awkwardly patted him on the shoe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“My beautiful son and my beautiful wife died today. Millions more, too. The city is literally in flames. Whole cities have disappeared from the map.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He coughed up a sob and swallowed it again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“All around the world, people like us are gathered in buildings like this. They were trying to recover from last night’s worm when disaster struck. We have independent power. Food. Water.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We have the network, that the bad guys use so well and that the good guys have never figured out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We have a shared love of liberty that comes from caring about and caring for the network. We are in charge of the most important organizational and governmental tool the world has ever seen. We are the closest thing to a government the world has right now. Geneva is a crater. The East River is on fire and the UN is evacuated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The Distributed Republic of Cyberspace weathered this storm basically unscathed. We are the custodians of a deathless, monstrous, wonderful machine, one with the potential to rebuild a better world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I have nothing to live for but that.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were tears in Van’s eyes. He wasn’t the only one. They didn’t applaud him, but they did one better. They maintained respectful, total silence for seconds that stretched to a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“How do we do it?” Popovich said, without a trace of sarcasm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The newsgroups were filling up fast. They’d announced them in news.admin.net-abuse.email, where all the spamfighters hung out, and where there was a tight culture of camaraderie in the face of full-out attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new group was alt.november5-disaster.recovery, with .recovery.governance, .recovery.finance, .recovery.logistics and .recovery.defense hanging off of it. Bless the wooly alt. hierarchy and all those who sail in her.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sysadmins came out of the woodwork. The Googleplex was online, with the stalwart Queen Kong bossing a gang of rollerbladed grunts who wheeled through the gigantic data-center swapping out dead boxen and hitting reboot switches. The Internet Archive was offline in the Presidio, but the mirror in Amsterdam was live and they’d redirected the DNS so that you’d hardly know the difference. Amazon was down. Paypal was up. Blogger, Typepad and Livejournal were all up, and filling with millions of posts from scared survivors huddling together for electronic warmth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Flickr photostreams were horrific. Felix had to unsubscribe from them after he caught a photo of a woman and a baby, dead in a kitchen, twisted into an agonized heiroglyph by the bioagent. They didn’t look like Kelly and 2.0, but they didn’t have to. He started shaking and couldn’t stop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wikipedia was up, but limping under load. The spam poured in as though nothing had changed. Worms roamed the network.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;.recovery.logistics was where most of the action was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; We can use the newsgroup voting mechanism to hold regional&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; elections&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix knew that this would work. Usenet newsgroup votes had been running for more than twenty years without a substantial hitch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; We’ll elect regional representatives and they’ll pick a Prime Minister.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Americans insisted on President, which Felix didn’t like. Seemed too partisan. His future wouldn’t be the American future. The American future had gone up with the White House. He was building a bigger tent than that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were French sysadmins online from France Telecom. The EBU’s data-center had been spared in the attacks that hammered Geneva, and it was filled with wry Germans whose English was better than Felix’s. They got on well with the remains of the BBC team in Canary Wharf.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They spoke polyglot English in .recovery.logistics, and Felix had momentum on his side. Some of the admins were cooling out the inevitable stupid flamewars with the practice of long years. Some were chipping in useful suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly few thought that Felix was off his rocker.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I think we should hold elections as soon as possible. Tomorrow at the latest. We can’t rule justly without the consent of the governed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Within seconds the reply landed in his inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You can’t be serious. Consent of the governed? Unless I miss my guess, most of the people you’re proposing to govern are puking their guts out, hiding under their desks, or wandering shell-shocked through the city streets. When do THEY get a vote?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix had to admit she had a point. Queen Kong was sharp. Not many woman sysadmins, and that was a genuine tragedy. Women like Queen Kong were too good to exclude from the field. He’d have to hack a solution to get women balanced out in his new government. Require each region to elect one woman and one man?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He happily clattered into argument with her. The elections would be the next day; he’d see to it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Prime Minister of Cyberspace? Why not call yourself the Grand Poobah of the Global Data Network? It’s more dignified, sounds cooler and it’ll get you just as far.” Will had the sleeping spot next to him, up in the cafeteria, with Van on the other side. The room smelled like a dingleberry: twenty-five sysadmins who hadn’t washed in at least a day all crammed into the same room. For some of them, it had been much, much longer than a day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Shut up, Will,” Van said. “You wanted to try to knock the Internet offline.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Correction: I want to knock the Internet offline. Present-tense”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix cracked one eye. He was so tired, it was like lifting weights.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Look, Sario—if you don’t like my platform, put one of your own forward. There are plenty of people who think I’m full of shit and I respect them for that, since they’re all running opposite me or backing someone who is. That’s your choice. What’s not on the menu is nagging and complaining. Bedtime now, or get up and post your platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sario sat up slowly, unrolling the jacket he had been using for a pillow and putting it on. “Screw you guys, I’m out of here.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I thought he’d never leave,” Felix said and turned over, lying awake a long time, thinking about the election.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were other people in the running. Some of them weren’t even sysadmins. A US Senator on retreat at his summer place in Wyoming had generator power and a satellite phone. Somehow he’d found the right newsgroup and thrown his hat into the ring. Some anarchist hackers in Italy strafed the group all night long, posting broken-English screeds about the political bankruptcy of “governance” in the new world. Felix looked at their netblock and determined that they were probably holed up in a small Interaction Design institute near Turin. Italy had been hit very bad, but out in the small town, this cell of anarchists had taken up residence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A surprising number were running on a platform of shutting down the Internet. Felix had his doubts about whether this was even possible, but he thought he understood the impulse to finish the work and the world. Why not?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He fell asleep thinking about the logistics of shutting down the Internet, and dreamed bad dreams in which he was the network’s sole defender.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He woke to a papery, itchy sound. He rolled over and saw that Van was sitting up, his jacket balled up in his lap, vigorously scratching his skinny arms. They’d gone the color of corned beef, and had a scaly look. In the light streaming through the cafeteria windows, skin motes floated and danced in great clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What are you doing?” Felix sat up. Watching Van’s fingernails rip into his skin made him itch in sympathy. It had been three days since he’d last washed his hair and his scalp sometimes felt like there were little egg-laying insects picking their way through it. He’d adjusted his glasses the night before and had touched the back of his ears; his finger came away shining with thick sebum. He got blackheads in the backs of his ears when he didn’t shower for a couple days, and sometimes gigantic, deep boils that Kelly finally popped with sick relish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Scratching,” Van said. He went to work on his head, sending a cloud of dandruff-crud into the sky, there to join the scurf that he’d already eliminated from his extremeties. “Christ, I itch all over.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix took Mayor McCheese from Van’s backpack and plugged it into one of the Ethernet cables that snaked all over the floor. He googled everything he could think of that could be related to this. “Itchy” yielded 40,600,000 links. He tried compound queries and got slightly more discriminating links.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I think it’s stress-related excema,” Felix said, finally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I don’t get excema,” Van said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix showed him some lurid photos of red, angry skin flaked with white. “Stress-related excema,” he said, reading the caption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van examined his arms. “I have excema,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Says here to keep it moisturized and to try cortisone cream. You might try the first aid kit in the second-floor toilets. I think I saw some there.” Like all of the sysadmins, Felix had had a bit of a rummage around the offices, bathrooms, kitchen and store-rooms, squirreling away a roll of toilet-paper in his shoulder-bag along with three or four power-bars. They were sharing out the food in the caf by unspoken agreement, every sysadmin watching every other for signs of gluttony and hoarding. All were convinced that there was hoarding and gluttony going on out of eyeshot, because all were guilty of it themselves when no one else was watching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van got up and when his face hove into the light, Felix saw how puffed his eyes were. “I’ll post to the mailing-list for some antihistamine,” Felix said. There had been four mailing lists and three wikis for the survivors in the building within hours of the first meeting’s close, and in the intervening days they’d settled on just one. Felix was still on a little mailing list with five of his most trusted friends, two of whom were trapped in cages in other countries. He suspected that the rest of the sysadmins were doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van stumbled off. “Good luck on the elections,” he said, patting Felix on the shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix stood and paced, stopping to stare out the grubby windows. The fires still burned in Toronto, more than before. He’d tried to find mailing lists or blogs that Torontonians were posting to, but the only ones he’d found were being run by other geeks in other data-centers. It was possible—likely, even—that there were survivors out there who had more pressing priorities than posting to the Internet. His home phone still worked about half the time but he’d stopped calling it after the second day, when hearing Kelly’s voice on the voicemail for the fiftieth time had made him cry in the middle of a planning meeting. He wasn’t the only one.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Election day. Time to face the music.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Are you nervous?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Nope,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix typed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I don’t much care if I win, to be honest. I”m just glad we’re doing this. The alternative was sitting around with our thumbs up our ass, waiting for someone to crack up and open the door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cursor hung. Queen Kong was very high latency as she bossed her gang of Googloids around the Googleplex, doing everything she could to keep her data center online. Three of the offshore cages had gone offline and two of their six redundant network links were smoked. Lucky for her, queries-per-second were way down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; There’s still China&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;she typed. Queen Kong had a big board with a map of the world colored in Google-queries-per-second, and could do magic with it, showing the drop-off over time in colorful charts. She’d uploaded lots of video clips showing how the plague and the bombs had swept the world: the initial upswell of queries from people wanting to find out what was going on, then the grim, precipitous shelving off as the plagues took hold.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; China’s still running about ninety percent nominal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You can’t think that they’re responsible&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; No&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;She typed, but then she started to key something and then stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; No of course not. I believe the Popovich Hypothesis. This is a bunch of assholes all using the rest for cover. But China put them down harder and faster than anyone else. Maybe we’ve finally found a use for totalitarian states.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix couldn’t resist. He typed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You’re lucky your boss can’t see you type that. You guys were pretty enthusiastic participants in the Great Firewall of China.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Wasn’t my idea&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;she typed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; And my boss is dead. They’re probably all dead. The whole Bay Area got hit hard, and then there was the quake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’d watched the USGS’s automated data-stream from the 6.9 that trashed northern Cal from Gilroy to Sebastopol. Soma webcams revealed the scope of the damage—gas main explosions, seismically retrofitted buildings crumpling like piles of children’s blocks after a good kicking. The Googleplex, floating on a series of gigantic steel springs, had shook like a plateful of jello, but the racks had stayed in place and the worst injury they’d had was a badly bruised eye on a sysadmin who’d caught a flying cable-crimper in the face.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Sorry. I forgot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; It’s OK. We all lost people, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I’m not worried about the election. Whoever wins, at least we’re doing SOMETHING&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Not if they vote for one of the fuckrags&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fuckrag was the epithet that some of the sysadmins were using to describe the contingent that wanted to shut down the Internet. Queen Kong had coined it—apparently it had started life as a catch-all term to describe the clueless IT managers that she’d chewed up through her career.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; They won’t. They’re just tired and sad is all. Your endorsement will carry the day&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Googloids were one of the largest and most powerful blocs left behind, along with the satellite uplink crews and the remaining transoceanic crews. Queen Kong’s endorsement had come as a surprise and he’d sent her an email that she’d replied to tersely: “can’t have the fuckrags in charge.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; gtg&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;she typed and then her connection dropped. He fired up a browser and called up google.com. The browser timed out. He hit reload, and then again, and then the Google front-page came back up. Whatever had hit Queen Kong’s workplace—power failure, worms, another quake—she had fixed it. He snorted when he saw that they’d replaced the O’s in the Google logo with little planet Earths with mushroom clouds rising from them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Got anything to eat?” Van said to him. It was mid-afternoon, not that time particularly passed in the data-center. Felix patted his pockets. They’d put a quartermaster in charge, but not before everyone had snagged some chow out of the machines. He’d had a dozen power-bars and some apples. He’d taken a couple sandwiches but had wisely eaten them first before they got stale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“One power-bar left,” he said. He’d noticed a certain looseness in his waistline that morning and had briefly relished it. Then he’d remembered Kelly’s teasing about his weight and he’d cried some. Then he’d eaten two power bars, leaving him with just one left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Oh,” Van said. His face was hollower than ever, his shoulders sloping in on his toast-rack chest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Here,” Felix said. “Vote Felix.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van took the power-bar from him and then put it down on the table. “OK, I want to give this back to you and say, ‘No, I couldn’t,’ but I’m fucking hungry, so I’m just going to take it and eat it, OK?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“That’s fine by me,” Felix said. “Enjoy.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“How are the elections coming?” Van said, once he’d licked the wrapper clean.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Dunno,” Felix said. “Haven’t checked in a while.” He’d been winning by a slim margin a few hours before. Not having his laptop was a major handicap when it came to stuff like this. Up in the cages, there were a dozen more like him, poor bastards who’d left the house on Der Tag without thinking to snag something WiFi-enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You’re going to get smoked,” Sario said, sliding in next to them. He’d become famous in the center for never sleeping, for eavesdropping, for picking fights in RL that had the ill-considered heat of a Usenet flamewar. “The winner will be someone who understands a couple of fundamental facts.” He held up a fist, then ticked off his bullet points by raising a finger at a time. “Point: The terrorists are using the Internet to destroy the world, and we need to destroy the Internet first. Point: Even if I’m wrong, the whole thing is a joke. We’ll run out of generator-fuel soon enough. Point: Or if we don’t, it will be because the old world will be back and running, and it won’t give a crap about your new world. Point: We’re gonna run out of food before we run out of shit to argue about or reasons not to go outside. We have the chance to do something to help the world recover: we can kill the net and cut it off as a tool for bad guys. Or we can rearrange some more deck chairs on the bridge of your personal Titanic in the service of some sweet dream about an ‘independent cyberspace.’”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The thing was that Sario was right. They would be out of fuel in two days—intermittent power from the grid had stretched their generator lifespan. And if you bought his hypothesis that the Internet was primarily being used as a tool to organize more mayhem, shutting it down would be the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Felix’s daughter and his wife were dead. He didn’t want to rebuild the old world. He wanted a new one. The old world was one that didn’t have any place for him. Not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van scratched his raw, flaking skin. Puffs of dander and scruff swirled in the musty, greasy air. Sario curled a lip at him. “That is disgusting. We’re breathing recycled air, you know. Whatever leprosy is eating you, aerosolizing it into the air supply is pretty anti-social.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You’re the world’s leading authority on anti-social, Sario,” Van said. "Go away or I’ll multi-tool you to death.” He stopped scratching and patted his sheathed multi-pliers like a gunslinger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Yeah, I’m anti-social. I’ve got Asperger’s and I haven’t taken any meds in four days. What’s your fucking excuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van scratched some more. “I’m sorry,” he said. “I didn’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sario cracked up. “Oh, you are priceless. I’d bet that three quarters of this bunch is borderline autistic. Me, I’m just an asshole. But I’m one who isn’t afraid to tell the truth, and that makes me better than you, dickweed.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Fuckrag,” Felix said, “fuck off.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They had less than a day’s worth of fuel when Felix was elected the first ever Prime Minister of Cyberspace. The first count was spoiled by a bot that spammed the voting process and they lost a critical day while they added up the votes a second time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But by then, it was all seeming like more of a joke. Half the data-centers had gone dark. Queen Kong’s net-maps of Google queries were looking grimmer and grimmer as more of the world went offline, though she maintained a leader-board of new and rising queries—largely related to health, shelter, sanitation and self-defense.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Worm-load slowed. Power was going off to many home PC users, and staying off, so their compromised PCs were going dark. The backbones were still lit up and blinking, but the missives from those data-centers were looking more and more desperate. Felix hadn’t eaten in a day and neither had anyone in a satellite Earth-station of transoceanic head-end.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Water was running short, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Popovich and Rosenbaum came and got him before he could do more than answer a few congratulatory messages and post a canned acceptance speech to newsgroups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’re going to open the doors,” Popovich said. Like all of them, he’d lost weight and waxed scruffy and oily. His BO was like a cloud coming off a trash-bag behind a fish-market on a sunny day. Felix was quite sure he smelled no better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You’re going to go for a reccy? Get more fuel? We can charter a working group for it—great idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rosenbaum shook his head sadly. “We’re going to go find our families. Whatever is out there has burned itself out. Or it hasn’t. Either way, there’s no future in here.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What about network maintenance?” Felix said, though he knew the answers. “Who’ll keep the routers up?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’ll give you the root passwords to everything,” Popovich said. His hands were shaking and his eyes were bleary. Like many of the smokers stuck in the data-center, he’d gone cold turkey this week. They’d run out of caffeine products two days earlier, too. The smokers had it rough.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“And I’ll just stay here and keep everything online?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You and anyone else who cares anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix knew that he’d squandered his opportunity. The election had seemed noble and brave, but in hindsight all it had been was an excuse for infighting when they should have been figuring out what to do next. The problem was that there was nothing to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I can’t make you stay,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Yeah, you can’t.” Popovich turned on his heel and walked out. Rosenbaum watched him go, then he gripped Felix’s shoulder and squeezed it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Thank you, Felix. It was a beautiful dream. It still is. Maybe we’ll find something to eat and some fuel and come back.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rosenbaum had a sister whom he’d been in contact with over IM for the first days after the crisis broke. Then she’d stopped answering. The sysadmins were split among those who’d had a chance to say goodbye and those who hadn’t. Each was sure the other had it better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They posted about it on the internal newsgroup—they were still geeks, after all, and there was a little honor guard on the ground floor, geeks who watched them pass toward the double doors. They manipulated the keypads and the steel shutters lifted, then the first set of doors opened. They stepped into the vestibule and pulled the doors shut behind them. The front doors opened. It was very bright and sunny outside, and apart from how empty it was, it looked very normal. Heartbreakingly so.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two took a tentative step out into the world. Then another. They turned to wave at the assembled masses. Then they both grabbed their throats and began to jerk and twitch, crumpling in a heap on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Shiii—!” was all Felix managed to choke out before they both dusted themselves off and stood up, laughing so hard they were clutching their sides. They waved once more and turned on their heels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Man, those guys are sick,” Van said. He scratched his arms, which had long, bloody scratches on them. His clothes were so covered in scurf they looked like they’d been dusted with icing sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I thought it was pretty funny,” Felix said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Christ I’m hungry,” Van said, conversationally.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Lucky for you, we’ve got all the packets we can eat,” Felix said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You’re too good to us grunts, Mr President,” Van said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Prime Minister,” he said. “And you’re no grunt, you’re the Deputy Prime Minister. You’re my designated ribbon-cutter and hander-out of oversized novelty checks.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It buoyed both of their spirits. Watching Popovich and Rosenbaum go, it buoyed them up. Felix knew then that they’d all be going soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That had been pre-ordained by the fuel-supply, but who wanted to wait for the fuel to run out, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; half my crew split this morning&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Queen Kong typed. Google was holding up pretty good anyway, of course. The load on the servers was a lot lighter than it had been since the days when Google fit on a bunch of hand-built PCs under a desk at Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; we’re down to a quarter&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix typed back. It was only a day since Popovich and Rosenbaum left, but the traffic on the newsgroups had fallen down to near zero. He and Van hadn’t had much time to play Republic of Cyberspace. They’d been too busy learning the systems that Popovich had turned over to them, the big, big routers that had went on acting as the major interchange for all the network backbones in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, someone posted to the newsgroups every now and again, generally to say goodbye. The old flamewars about who would be PM, or whether they would shut down the network, or who took too much food—it was all gone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He reloaded the newsgroup. There was a typical message.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Runaway processes on Solaris&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Uh, hi. I’m just a lightweight MSCE but I’m the only one awake here and four of the DSLAMs just went down. Looks like there’s some custom accounting code that’s trying to figure out how much to bill our corporate customers and it’s spawned ten thousand threads and its eating all the swap. I just want to kill it but I can’t seem to do that. Is there some magic invocation I need to do to get this goddamned weenix box to kill this shit? I mean, it’s not as if any of our customers are ever going to pay us again. I’d ask the guy who wrote this code, but he’s pretty much dead as far as anyone can work out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He reloaded. There was a response. It was short, authoritative, and helpful—just the sort of thing you almost never saw in a high-caliber newsgroup when a noob posted a dumb question. The apocalypse had awoken the spirit of patient helpfulness in the world’s sysop community.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van shoulder-surfed him. “Holy shit, who knew he had it in him?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He looked at the message again. It was from Will Sario.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He dropped into his chat window.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; sario i thought you wanted the network dead why are you helping msces fix their boxen?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;sheepish grin&amp;gt; Gee Mr PM, maybe I just can’t bear to watch a computer suffer at the hands of an amateur.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He flipped to the channel with Queen Kong in it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; How long?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Since I slept? Two days. Until we run out of fuel? Three days. Since we ran out of food? Two days.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Jeez. I didn’t sleep last night either. We’re a little short handed around here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; asl? Im monica and I live in pasadena and Im bored with my homework. WOuld you like to download my pic???&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The trojan bots were all over IRC these days, jumping to every channel that had any traffic on it. Sometimes you caught five or six flirting with each other. It was pretty weird to watch a piece of malware try to con another instance of itself into downloading a trojan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They both kicked the bot off the channel simultaneously. He had a script for it now. The spam hadn’t even tailed off a little.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; How come the spam isn’t reducing? Half the goddamned data-centers have gone dark&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Queen Kong paused a long time before typing. As had become automatic when she went high-latency, he reloaded the Google homepage. Sure enough, it was down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Sario, you got any food?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You won’t miss a couple more meals, Your Excellency&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van had gone back to Mayor McCheese but he was in the same channel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What a dick. You’re looking pretty buff, though, dude.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van didn’t look so good. He looked like you could knock him over with a stiff breeze and he had a phlegmy, weak quality to his speech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; hey kong everything ok?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; everything’s fine just had to go kick some ass&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“How’s the traffic, Van?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Down 25 percent from this morning,” he said. There were a bunch of nodes whose connections routed through them. Presumably most of these were home or commercial customers is places where the power was still on and the phone company’s COs were still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every once in a while, Felix would wiretap the connections to see if he could find a person who had news of the wide world. Almost all of it was automated traffic, though: network backups, status updates. Spam. Lots of spam.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Spam’s still up because the services that stop spam are failing faster than the services that create it. All the anti-worm stuff is centralized in a couple places. The bad stuff is on a million zombie computers. If only the lusers had had the good sense to turn off their home PCs before keeling over or taking off&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; at the rate were going well be routing nothing but spam by dinnertime&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van cleared his throat, a painful sound. “About that,” he said. “I think it’s going to hit sooner than that. Felix, I don’t think anyone would notice if we just walked away from here.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix looked at him, his skin the color of corned-beef and streaked with long, angry scabs. His fingers trembled.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You drinking enough water?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van nodded. “All frigging day, every ten seconds. Anything to keep my belly full.” He pointed to a refilled Pepsi Max bottle full of water by his side.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Let’s have a meeting,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There had been forty-three of them on D-Day. Now there were fifteen. Six had responded to the call for a meeting by simply leaving. Everyone knew without having to be told what the meeting was about.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“So that’s it, you’re going to let it all fall apart?” Sario was the only one with the energy left to get properly angry. He’d go angry to his grave. The veins on his throat and forehead stood out angrily. His fists shook angrily. All the other geeks went lids-down at the site of him, looking up in unison for once at the discussion, not keeping one eye on a chat-log or a tailed service log.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Sario, you’ve got to be shitting me,” Felix said. “You wanted to pull the goddamned plug!”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I wanted it to go clean,” he shouted. “I didn’t want it to bleed out and keel over in little gasps and pukes forever. I wanted it to be an act of will by the global community of its caretakers. I wanted it to be an affirmative act by human hands. Not entropy and bad code and worms winning out. Fuck that, that’s just what’s happened out there.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Up in the top-floor cafeteria, there were windows all around, hardened and light-bending, and by custom, they were all blinds-down. Now Sario ran around the room, yanking down the blinds. How the hell can he get the energy to run? Felix wondered. He could barely walk up the stairs to the meeting room.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harsh daylight flooded in. It was a fine sunny day out there, but everywhere you looked across that commanding view of Toronto’s skyline, there were rising plumes of smoke. The TD tower, a gigantic black modernist glass brick, was gouting flame to the sky. “It’s all falling apart, the way everything does.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Listen, listen. If we leave the network to fall over slowly, parts of it will stay online for months. Maybe years. And what will run on it? Malware. Worms. Spam. System-processes. Zone transfers. The things we use fall apart and require constant maintenance. The things we abandon don’t get used and they last forever. We’re going to leave the network behind like a lime-pit filled with industrial waste. That will be our fucking legacy—the legacy of every keystroke you and I and anyone, anywhere ever typed. You understand? We’re going to leave it to die slow like a wounded dog, instead of giving it one clean shot through the head.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van scratched his cheeks, then Felix saw that he was wiping away tears.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Sario, you’re not wrong, but you’re not right either,” he said. “Leaving it up to limp along is right. We’re going to all be limping for a long time, and maybe it will be some use to someone. If there’s one packet being routed from any user to any other user, anywhere in the world, it’s doing it’s job.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If you want a clean kill, you can do that,” Felix said. “I’m the PM and I say so. I’m giving you root. All of you.” He turned to the white-board where the cafeteria workers used to scrawl the day’s specials. Now it was covered with the remnants of heated technical debates that the sysadmins had engaged in over the days since the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He scrubbed away a clean spot with his sleeve and began to write out long, complicated alphanumeric passwords salted with punctuation. Felix had a gift for remembering that kind of password. He doubted it would do him much good, ever again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Were going, kong. Fuels almost out anyway&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; yeah well thats right then. it was an honor, mr prime minister&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; you going to be ok?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; ive commandeered a young sysadmin to see to my feminine needs and weve found another cache of food thatll last us a coupel weeks now that were down to fifteen admins—im in hog heaven pal&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; youre amazing, Queen Kong, seriously. Dont be a hero though. When you need to go go. Theres got to be something out there&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; be safe felix, seriously—btw did i tell you queries are up in Romania? maybe theyre getting back on their feet&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; really?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; yeah, really. we’re hard to kill—like fucking roaches&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Her connection died. He dropped to Firefox and reloaded Google and it was down. He hit reload and hit reload and hit reload, but it didn’t come up. He closed his eyes and listened to Van scratch his legs and then heard Van type a little.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They’re back up,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix whooshed out a breath. He sent the message to the newsgroup, one that he’d run through five drafts before settling on, “Take care of the place, OK? We’ll be back, someday.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everyone was going except Sario. Sario wouldn’t leave. He came down to see them off, though.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sysadmins gathered in the lobby and Felix made the safety door go up, and the light rushed in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sario stuck his hand out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Good luck,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You too,” Felix said. He had a firm grip, Sario, stronger than he had any right to be. “Maybe you were right,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Maybe,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You going to pull the plug?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sario looked up at the drop-ceiling, seeming to peer through the reinforced floors at the humming racks above. “Who knows?” he said at last.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van scratched and a flurry of white motes danced in the sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Let’s go find you a pharmacy,” Felix said. He walked to the door and the other sysadmins followed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They waited for the interior doors to close behind them and then Felix opened the exterior doors. The air smelled and tasted like a mown grass, like the first drops of rain, like the lake and the sky, like the outdoors and the world, an old friend not heard from in an eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Bye, Felix,” the other sysadmins said. They were drifting away while he stood transfixed at the top of the short concrete staircase. The light hurt his eyes and made them water.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I think there’s a Shopper’s Drug Mart on King Street,” he said to Van. “We’ll thrown a brick through the window and get you some cortisone, OK?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You’re the Prime Minister,” Van said. “Lead on.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;#&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They didn’t see a single soul on the fifteen minute walk. There wasn’t a single sound except for some bird noises and some distant groans, and the wind in the electric cables overhead. It was like walking on the surface of the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Bet they have chocolate bars at the Shopper’s,” Van said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix’s stomach lurched. Food. “Wow,” he said, around a mouthful of saliva.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They walked past a little hatchback and in the front seat was the dried body of a woman holding the dried body of a baby, and his mouth filled with sour bile, even though the smell was faint through the rolled-up windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He hadn’t thought of Kelly or 2.0 in days. He dropped to his knees and retched again. Out here in the real world, his family was dead. Everyone he knew was dead. He just wanted to lie down on the sidewalk and wait to die, too.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van’s rough hands slipped under his armpits and hauled weakly at him. “Not now,” he said. “Once we’re safe inside somewhere and we’ve eaten something, then and then you can do this, but not now. Understand me, Felix? Not fucking now.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The profanity got through to him. He got to his feet. His knees were trembling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Just a block more,” Van said, and slipped Felix’s arm around his shoulders and led him along.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Thank you, Van. I’m sorry.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“No sweat,” he said. “You need a shower, bad. No offense.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“None taken.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Shoppers had a metal security gate, but it had been torn away from the front windows, which had been rudely smashed. Felix and Van squeezed through the gap and stepped into the dim drug-store. A few of the displays were knocked over, but other than that, it looked OK. By the cash-registers, Felix spotted the racks of candy bars at the same instant that Van saw them, and they hurried over and grabbed a handful each, stuffing their faces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You two eat like pigs.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They both whirled at the sound of the woman’s voice. She was holding a fire-axe that was nearly as big as she was. She wore a lab-coat and comfortable shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You take what you need and go, OK? No sense in there being any trouble.” Her chin was pointy and her eyes were sharp. She looked to be in her forties. She looked nothing like Kelly, which was good, because Felix felt like running and giving her a hug as it was. Another person alive!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Are you a doctor?” Felix said. She was wearing scrubs under the coat, he saw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You going to go?” She brandished the axe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix held his hands up. “Seriously, are you a doctor? A pharmacist?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I used to be a RN, ten years ago. I’m mostly a Web-designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You’re shitting me,” Felix said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Haven’t you ever met a girl who knew about computers?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Actually, a friend of mine who runs Google’s data-center is a girl. A woman, I mean.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You’re shitting me,” she said. “A woman ran Google’s data-center?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Runs,” Felix said. “It’s still online.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“NFW,” she said. She let the axe lower.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Way. Have you got any cortisone cream? I can tell you the story. My name’s Felix and this is Van, who needs any anti-histamines you can spare.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I can spare? Felix old pal, I have enough dope here to last a hundred years. This stuff’s going to expire long before it runs out. But are you telling me that the net’s still up?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s still up,” he said. “Kind of. That’s what we’ve been doing all week. Keeping it online. It might not last much longer, though.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“No,” she said. “I don’t suppose it would.” She set the axe down. “Have you got anything to trade? I don’t need much, but I’ve been trying to keep my spirits up by trading with the neighbors. It’s like playing civilization.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You have neighbors?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“At least ten,” she said. “The people in the restaurant across the way make a pretty good soup, even if most of the veg is canned. They cleaned me out of Sterno, though.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You’ve got neighbors and you trade with them?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Well, nominally. It’d be pretty lonely without them. I’ve taken care of whatever sniffles I could. Set a bone—broken wrist. Listen, do you want some Wonder Bread and peanut butter? I have a ton of it. Your friend looks like he could use a meal.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Yes please,” Van said. “We don’t have anything to trade, but we’re both committed workaholics looking to learn a trade. Could you use some assistants?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Not really.” She spun her axe on its head. “But I wouldn’t mind some company.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They ate the sandwiches and then some soup. The restaurant people brought it over and made their manners at them, though Felix saw their noses wrinkle up and ascertained that there was working plumbing in the back room. Van went in to take a sponge bath and then he followed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“None of us know what to do,” the woman said. Her name was Rosa, and she had found them a bottle of wine and some disposable plastic cups from the housewares aisle. “I thought we’d have helicopters or tanks or even looters, but it’s just quiet.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You seem to have kept pretty quiet yourself,” Felix said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Didn’t want to attract the wrong kind of attention.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You ever think that maybe there’s a lot of people out there doing the same thing? Maybe if we all get together we’ll come up with something to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Or maybe they’ll cut our throats,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van nodded. “She’s got a point.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix was on his feet. “No way, we can’t think like that. Lady, we’re at a critical juncture here. We can go down through negligence, dwindling away in our hiding holes, or we can try to build something better.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Better?” She made a rude noise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“OK, not better. Something though. Building something new is better than letting it dwindle away. Christ, what are you going to do when you’ve read all the magazines and eaten all the potato chips here?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rosa shook her head. “Pretty talk,” she said. “But what the hell are we going to do, anyway?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Something,” Felix said. “We’re going to do something. Something is better than nothing. We’re going to take this patch of the world where people are talking to each other, and we’re going to expand it. We’re going to find everyone we can and we’re going to take care of them and they’re going to take care of us. We’ll probably fuck it up. We’ll probably fail. I’d rather fail than give up, though.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van laughed. “Felix, you are crazier than Sario, you know it?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We’re going to go and drag him out, first thing tomorrow. He’s going to be a part of this, too. Everyone will. Screw the end of the world. The world doesn’t end. Humans aren’t the kind of things that have endings.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rosa shook her head again, but she was smiling a little now. “And you’ll be what, the Pope-Emperor of the World?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“He prefers Prime Minister,” Van said in a stagey whisper. The anti-histamines had worked miracles on his skin, and it had faded from angry red to a fine pink.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You want to be Minister of Health, Rosa?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Boys,” she said. “Playing games. How about this. I’ll help out however I can, provided you never ask me to call you Prime Minister and you never call me the Minister of Health?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s a deal,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van refilled their glasses, upending the wine bottle to get the last few drops out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The raised their glasses. “To the world,” Felix said. “To humanity.” He thought hard. “To rebuilding.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“To anything,” Van said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“To anything,” Felix said. “To everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“To everything,” Rosa said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They drank. The next day, they started to rebuild. And months later, they started over again, when disagreements drove apart the fragile little group they’d pulled together. And a year after that, they started over again. And five years later, they started again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix dug ditches and salvaged cans and buried the dead. He planted and harvested. He fixed some cars and learned to make biodiesel. Finally he fetched up in a data-center for a little government—little governments came and went, but this one was smart enough to want to keep records and needed someone to keep everything running, and Van went with him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They spent a lot of time in chat rooms and sometimes they happened upon old friends from the strange time they’d spent running the Distributed Republic of Cyberspace, geeks who insisted on calling him PM, though no one in the real world ever called him that anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It wasn’t a good life, most of the time. Felix’s wounds never healed, and neither did most other people’s. There were lingering sicknesses and sudden ones. Tragedy on tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Felix liked his data-center. There in the humming of the racks, he never felt like it was the first days of a better nation, but he never felt like it was the last days of one, either.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; go to bed, felix&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; soon, kong, soon—almost got this backup running&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; youre a junkie, dude.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; look whos talking&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He reloaded the Google homepage. Queen Kong had had it online for a couple years now. The Os in Google changed all the time, whenever she got the urge. Today they were little cartoon globes, one smiling the other frowning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He looked at it for a long time and dropped back into a terminal to check his backup. It was running clean, for a change. The little government’s records were safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; ok night night&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; take care&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Van waved at him as he creaked to the door, stretching out his back with a long series of pops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Sleep well, boss,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Don’t stick around here all night again,” Felix said. “You need your sleep, too.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You’re too good to us grunts,” Van said, and went back to typing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Felix went to the door and walked out into the night. Behind him, the biodiesel generator hummed and made its acrid fumes. The harvest moon was up, which he loved. Tomorrow, he’d go back and fix another computer and fight off entropy again. And why not?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was what he did. He was a sysadmin.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How long do electric car batteries last? The updated guide to real-world EV battery health&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Analysis of over 22,700 electric vehicles, covering 21 different vehicle models, confirms that overall, modern EV batteries are robust and built to last beyond a typical vehicle’s service life.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senior Manager, Sustainable Mobility at Geotab&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jan 12, 2026&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Key Insights&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Average degradation rate: The average annual electric vehicle degradation rate is 2.3%.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Power: High-power DC fast charging (&amp;gt;100kW) is the single largest stressor, leading to degradation rates up to twice that of the low power charging group (3.0% vs 1.5% per year).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Climate: Hot climates impose a penalty on battery life, with vehicles operating in hot conditions degrading 0.4% faster per year than those in mild climates.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Utilization: The increase in degradation from high daily use is a measurable but worthwhile trade-off for the gains in fleet productivity and ROI.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;State of charge (SOC): For most EV use, there's no need to worry about avoiding fully charging or emptying the battery. Degradation only speeds up when vehicles spend over 80% of their total time at or near-full or nearly empty charge levels.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How long will my electric vehicle battery really last? It’s a key question for anyone considering an EV. Battery degradation, or the gradual decline in a battery's ability to store energy, affects your driving range, performance and the vehicle’s resale value. To support innovation and build fleet confidence in electric vehicle technology, Geotab has conducted several extensive studies using real-world telematics data (data collected from the vehicles themselves) to see how quickly EV batteries degrade.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our 2025 analysis of over 22,700 electric vehicles, covering 21 different vehicle models, confirms that overall, modern EV batteries are robust and built to last beyond a typical vehicle’s service life. However, this latest dataset, which includes newer EV generations and a growing reliance on high-speed charging, highlights the variability across vehicles and how certain operating conditions can have a big impact. While some battery degradation is inevitable, fleet managers can make some adjustments to get the most life out of their batteries and their investment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Battery degradation trends: Comparing past analyses&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Geotab’s first big study in 2020 on light-duty electric vehicles showed an average battery degradation rate of 2.3% per year. By 2023, further analyses showed an improvement, with 11 common EV models averaging only 1.8% degradation annually (likely due to advancements in battery technology and thermal management systems).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we expanded the study in 2025, the average capacity loss had returned to 2.3% per year across the 21 make-models. This means the average battery is projected to have 81.6% of its original capacity (state of health or SOH) after eight years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This return to a 2.3% average doesn’t mean batteries are getting worse. It likely reflects a few combined factors related to newer vehicles and how they are being used, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Higher-power charging: The overall average is likely being influenced by the rise of higher-powered charging capabilities in newer EV models.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vehicle type and chemistry: Average degradation rate appears to vary significantly by model. Multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) including light vans in our analysis average a higher rate (2.7% per year) compared to light cars (2.0% per year). Differences across vehicle models are likely driven by specific battery chemistries which are designed for different priorities such as maximizing range (energy density) or maximizing how long they last (longevity), as well as unique configurations in battery management systems.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Initial drop-off: Many EVs show a sharper drop in capacity in the first year or two before the rate levels out. The current average includes a higher proportion of newer EVs. In contrast, eight out of 11 of the same established models from our 2023 data set have stabilized to an impressive 1.4% average degradation per year, demonstrating exceptional long-term SOH retention.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 1: Average EV battery degradation rates, by vehicle model and class (multi-purpose vehicles such as vans, passenger cars and trucks). Models have been anonymized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While inherent design influences battery health across vehicle models, the vehicle’s operating conditions have an impact too. To better understand the role of external factors, we grouped vehicles into similar operational conditions, looking at power levels, local climate and usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Average degradation rates only tell part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How high-speed charging influences EV battery life&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As electric vehicle technology advances, we’re seeing more powerful and faster charging capabilities. While faster, higher-power charging can improve vehicle productivity, it’s important to ask: How does this extra power affect the battery’s long-term health? Our analysis shows that both the frequency and the power level of direct current fast charging (DCFC) influence how quickly the battery degrades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The impact of DC fast charging usage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To see how DC fast charging (DCFC) matters, we split the vehicles into two groups based on how often they used DCFC as a portion of all charging sessions (AC and DC):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Low DCFC frequency: Vehicles where DCFC constituted less than 12% of total charging sessions experienced an average annual degradation of 1.5%.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High DCFC frequency: Vehicles that exceeded 12% DCFC usage saw a full percent increase in average annual degradation of 2.5%.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The results confirm: if you use DC fast charging more often, your battery will lose capacity faster, on average.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 2: Chart depicts the average degradation rate of vehicles based on how much they relied on DCFC charging, defined by low = under 12% DCFC usage and high = over 12% DCFC usage&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Does charging power matter?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Frequency is only half the story; we must also consider the “punch” the battery receives during those sessions. To investigate whether the power level matters independently of just DCFC frequency, we grouped the high-frequency DCFC users into two buckets: Low-Power, where less than 40% of DCFC sessions exceeded 100kW, and High-Power, where more than 40% of DCFC sessions exceeded 100kW. This results in three defined groups:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;DCFC Group&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;DCFC Usage Criteria&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;High Power Sessions (&amp;gt;100 kW)&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Average Degradation (per year)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Low Frequency&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Less than 12% of sessions&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;N/A&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;1.5%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="4"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;High-Frequency Low-Power&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;More than 12% of sessions&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Less than 40% of DCFC sessions&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;2.2%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;High-Frequency High-Power&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;More than 12% of sessions&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Over 40% of DCFC sessions&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;3.0%&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate a clear benefit for vehicles that predominantly use lower power charging, which are projected to still have 88% of their original battery capacity after eight years (1.5% annual degradation). In contrast, vehicles that frequently use both high-power and high-frequency DCFC are projected to have a battery capacity of 76% after eight years (3.0% annual degradation).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 3: The average degradation rate of vehicles by frequency and power of DCFC usage, defined by Low Frequency = under 12% DCFC usage; High-Frequency Low-Power = over 12% DCFC usage, &amp;lt;40% 100+kW; High-Frequency High-Power = over 12% DCFC usage, &amp;gt;40% 100+kW.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;The shift: Adapting to a high-power landscape&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Across our customer base, reliance on high-speed DC fast charging has nearly tripled, jumping from less than 10% to about 25% of all charging sessions. Furthermore, the average power of these sessions has increased from roughly 70 kW to over 90 kW.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note: The fluctuations seen in 2020 were largely driven by the high concentration of Tesla models and their early adoption of the high-power Supercharger network. Since then, a broader range of vehicle models has entered the market with the capability to accept higher charging power rates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 4: Average frequency of DCFC charging has increased steadily over the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 5: Average DCFC power (calculated by averaging the peak power for all DCFC charging sessions for every three months, or quarter) has increased over the last five years. This graph’s zig-zag nature showcases the seasonal changes in average peak power.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Strategic sizing: Matching the charger to the job&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This trend highlights the importance of strategic sizing: carefully matching charging power to a vehicle's specific operational requirements. For the best long-term battery health, the best practice is to use the lowest power level that still meets your operational schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For instance, if a vehicle is regularly parked overnight for five or more hours, installing infrastructure to fully charge it in 15 minutes may be overkill. By reserving high-power DCFC for essential needs rather than making it the default, you can significantly protect your long-term battery investment.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How does temperature impact battery degradation?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Temperature plays a significant role in why batteries degrade. EV batteries exposed to extreme heat degrade faster than those in cooler climates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Hot temperatures&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High temperatures naturally speed up battery degradation because heat increases chemical activity and stress inside the cell. Fortunately, EVs’ internal battery management systems help lessen this effect by regulating the battery temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To assess the impact of climate, we grouped vehicles based on the percentage of days exceeding 25° C:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Mild climate group: Vehicles that experience less than 35% of days above 25° C.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hot climate group: Vehicles that experience more than 35% of days above 25° C.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The data confirms a moderate effect: vehicles operating in hot climates on average degrade 0.4% faster per year than those in mild climates. As a result, geographic location remains a key variable in predicting a battery’s lifespan. Our current dataset lacked sufficient “cold-only” samples – vehicles in consistently cold climates without a warm season – to isolate the impact of extreme cold on long-term degradation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, an EV in Arizona will likely have a shorter battery life than the same model driven in Norway.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To study this, we grouped vehicles by climate:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Temperate: Fewer than five days per year over 80℉ (27℃) or under 23℉ (-5℃)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Hot: More than five days per year over 80℉ (27℃)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;State of charge (SOC): Utilizing the full battery&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EV owners are often advised to keep their battery charge (SOC) between 20% and 80% to avoid the chemical stress associated with a full or empty battery. However, our data indicates that this cautionary measure is only critical if the battery is habituated at these extremes for extended durations. For typical daily use, strict adherence to the 20-80% SOC rule may be unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To measure the actual impact of charge levels, we analyzed how long vehicles spend at extreme SOC levels (below 20% or above 80%) across all states (driving, charging and rest). We categorized the vehicles into three groups:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Low exposure (below 50% of total time at extreme SOC)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Medium exposure (50%-80% of total time at extreme SOC)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High exposure (above 80% of total time at extreme SOC)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note on data controls: Our analysis observed an inverse relationship between DCFC frequency and extreme SOC exposure. Due to the "tapering effect", where DC charging speeds drop significantly after 80%, high-frequency DCFC users rarely spend prolonged time at maximum charge. Once controlling for this variable, we found that a distinct threshold exists for where SOC exposure begins to impact long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 6: Exposure to extreme state of charge (SOC) is only significant under high exposure, where time above 80% SOC or below 20% SOC exceeds 80% of cumulative time. To control for power, this chart only includes vehicles with low DCFC usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The data demonstrates that moderate exposure to extreme SOC levels does not significantly accelerate degradation. The degradation rates for the low (1.4%) and medium (1.5%) groups are nearly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, there is a critical threshold at 80% exposure. Vehicles that habitually spent over 80% of their total time at extreme SOC levels experienced a significant acceleration in battery degradation, averaging 2.0% per year. This increase shows that battery degradation only accelerates when there is prolonged, habitual and extreme exposure to high or low states of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Why moderate SOC exposure is safe&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A key factor in mitigating SOC-related stress is the protective engineering implemented by auto and battery manufacturers. All modern EV batteries incorporate hidden software buffers at the upper and lower limits of the charge capacity. For instance, a battery indicating 100% SOC is chemically less than a full charge, and 0% does not represent a chemically empty state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This engineering buffer likely explains the minimal impact observed from moderate SOC exposure in our analysis. The battery is designed to handle normal use across its entire charge range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Prioritizing productivity: Utilization as a managed cost&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Battery life is also influenced by throughput; how much energy moves through the cells overall. We measured this using the average charge cycle metric, which tracks how many “full” cycles a battery completes. One full cycle represents the cumulative discharge and replenishment of 100% of the battery’s usable capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, if a vehicle uses 25% of its battery for a morning delivery and then charges that 25% back over lunch, it has completed one-quarter of a cycle. Repeating this four times equals one full cycle. We averaged this total over the course of a year to determine the daily intensity of use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To analyze this impact, we categorized vehicles in three groups:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Low charge cycle (&amp;lt;15%): The equivalent of a full cycle every 7+ days&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Medium charge cycle (15%-35%): The equivalent of a full cycle every 3-6 days&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;High charge cycle (&amp;gt;35%): The equivalent of a full cycle every 1-2 days&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Figure 7: Battery state of health by charge cycle&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The data confirms that operating intensity accelerates aging. As daily throughput climbs from low utilization (&amp;lt; 15% of a cycle) to high utilization (&amp;gt; 35% of a cycle), the average annual degradation penalty increases by 0.8% (rising from 1.5% to 2.3%). This reveals an unavoidable trade-off for fleets: higher daily productivity, essential for maximizing revenue and achieving a faster return on investment (ROI), comes at the cost of faster battery wear. However, this intensive utilization also maximizes the displacement of internal combustion fuels, saving on costs and directly advancing fleet sustainability and carbon reduction targets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The long-term impact is arguably nominal when weighed against the benefits of maximized uptime: After eight years, low-use vehicles are projected to retain 88% state of health, while high-use vehicles still maintain a highly functional 81.6%.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The primary takeaway for fleet managers is clear: Operational strategies should prioritize vehicle deployment to meet both ROI and sustainability targets. However, managers must ensure that increased utilization doesn’t result in a disproportionate reliance on high power DCFC, which will drive additional capacity loss.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Design, chemistry and the limits of our data&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While our analysis focuses on external factors (power, climate, battery level and usage), it’s important to remember that intrinsic factors like battery system design and composition can also influence degradation rates (and the impact of external stressors).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intrinsic factors that impact battery longevity (but are not looked at in this study) include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Battery chemistry: The specific chemistry used (e.g., lithium iron phosphate [LFP], nickel manganese cobalt [NMC], or emerging sodium-ion) will dictate the baseline degradation curve. Different chemistries are optimized for different benefits; some favor longer cycle life (longevity), while others prioritize higher energy densities, thermal stability or lower production costs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Battery Management System (BMS): The design and software within the BMS play a critical role in how the battery is protected under stress. This includes the battery packs’ thermal management systems.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Important notice&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All data and degradation rates presented in this study are aggregated and averaged across large cohorts. Therefore, while these findings establish strong trends, it is important to note that each individual vehicle may exhibit more or less degradation than the average due to a unique combination of its intrinsic battery properties and its specific usage profile.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Study summary: Managing risk and optimizing ROI&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The data confirms that modern EV batteries remain robust and are expected to last beyond a typical vehicle's service life. However, our 2025 analysis, which shows the average degradation rate has returned to 2.3% per year, highlights the emergence of specific operational behaviors that accelerate aging. These trends offer a clear, proactive strategy for fleet management.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High-power DC fast charging is a dominant stressor, leading to the highest annual battery degradation rate. This finding is particularly important, given the industry's trend toward high-power charging. While we expect continued improvements in battery technology and management systems to correct for these external factors (thus promoting the long-term viability of electric fleets), fleet strategy can prioritize certain actions to maximize vehicle lifespans and ROI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Fleet manager takeaways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Be strategic with charging power: Where appropriate, prioritize AC charging or lower-power DC charging, only using high-power DCFC (especially above 100 kW) when operationally necessary. This strategy helps minimize battery stress, as unchecked, high-power charging can lead to an estimated 76.0% SOH after eight years, compared to 88.0% SOH for those who prioritize lower-power charging.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Be aware of climate: There was a small but measurable difference for EVs operating in hotter climates (an increased rate of 0.4%). Consider operational adjustments during heat waves such as parking in the shade or indoors to reduce exposure.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Prioritize vehicle utilization: The acceleration in degradation from high utilization is a manageable cost (an approximate 0.8% penalty) when weighed against the significant revenue and productivity gains from maximizing vehicle deployment. Your fleet strategy should prioritize uptime and usage.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Avoid extreme state of charge (SOC) exposure: Your drivers can worry less about adhering to a 20%-80% SOC rule for day-to-day use. However, avoid leaving vehicles parked and idle for prolonged, habitual periods when the charge is near full or near empty, as degradation accelerates significantly when extreme SOC exposure exceeds a 80% cumulative time threshold.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adopting a telematics-led, data-driven approach provides the visibility necessary for proactive monitoring. By leveraging these insights to strategically manage charging power and avoid prolonged exposure to extreme SOC levels, you can effectively preserve battery health, help protect your investment and ensure the long-term operational viability of your EV fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The average lifespan of EV batteries will be around 13 years or more based on observed degradation rates. Modern electric vehicle (EV) batteries continue to perform strongly. Geotab’s latest analysis shows an average degradation rate of 2.3% per year, affirming long-term battery viability for both individual and fleet use. EV battery degradation varies by model and is also influenced by operating conditions for the vehicle such as charging power, climate and usage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fast charging, particularly using DC fast chargers, can increase battery degradation due to the higher temperatures and currents involved. Frequent use of fast chargers may shorten the battery’s lifespan compared to slower Level 2 charging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can check your EV battery health using telematics tools that provide data on its state of charge, degradation rate and remaining capacity. Many EVs also offer built-in diagnostics to monitor battery performance and notify drivers of potential issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Geotab’s 2024 study, the average battery degradation rate was 1.8% per year. In the updated 2026 study, the average battery degradation rate increased to 2.3% per year, based on a larger dataset and shifts in EV usage patterns, particularly an increase in fast charging.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EV battery degradation is measured by tracking its state of health (SOH), which represents its current usable energy capacity relative to its capacity when new. Geotab calculates current battery capacity by measuring energy input (when charging) and output (when driving), analyzing the battery’s change in state of charge (SOC) during these energy transfers. By measuring these parameters over time, this methodology provides a reliable long-term trend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most impactful decision within the operator's control is the charging power used. Reserve high-power DC fast charging (DCFC) only for when operational demands require it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plan 9 is a research operating system from the same group who created UNIX at Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center (CSRC). It emerged in the late 1980s, and its early development coincided with continuing development of the later versions of Research UNIX. Plan 9 can be seen as an attempt to push some of the same ideas that informed UNIX even further into the era of networking and graphics. Rob Pike has described Plan 9 as "an argument" for simplicity and clarity, while others have described it as "UNIX, only moreso."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From The Use of Name Spaces in Plan 9:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plan 9 argues that given a few carefully implemented abstractions it is possible to produce a small operating system that provides support for the largest systems on a variety of architectures and networks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the intro(1) man page:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plan 9 is a distributed computing environment assembled from separate machines acting as terminals, CPU servers, and file servers. A user works at a terminal, running a window system on a raster display. Some windows are connected to CPU servers; the intent is that heavy computing should be done in those windows but it is also possible to compute on the terminal. A separate file server provides file storage for terminals and CPU servers alike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The two most important ideas in Plan 9 are:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most everything else in the system falls out of these two basic ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read: intro(1); Plan 9 from Bell Labs; Designing Plan 9, originally delivered at the UKUUG Conference in London, July 1990; and FQA 7 - System Management; for a more detailed overview of Plan 9's design.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, Plan 9 continues in its original form, as well as in several derivatives and forks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States of Plan 9&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that Plan 9 from Bell Labs was dead as in gratis, that a working VGA driver was rejected because VESA, and that people just want to run Plan 9 on their computers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plan 9 from Bell Labs — The original Plan 9. Effectively dead, all the developers have been run out of the Labs and/or are on display at Google.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plan 9 from User Space — Plan 9 userspace ported/imitated for UNIX (specifically OS X).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;9legacy — David du Colombier's collection of patches to Bell Labs Plan 9. (It is not a fork, but is treated as the continuation of Labs Plan 9 by people mad about 9front.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;9atom — Erik Quanstrom's fork of Plan 9, previously maintained to Erik's needs and occasionally pilfered by 9front. Destiny unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;9front — (that's us) (we rule (we're the tunnel snakes))&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NIX — High performance cloud computing is NIX — imploded in the past, but survived and adapted to 9front.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NxM — A kernel for manycore systems — never spotted in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clive — A new operating system from Francisco J. Ballesteros, declared inert in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Akaros — Akaros is an open source, GPL-licensed operating system for manycore architectures. Has no bearing on anything but has attracted grant money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Harvey — Harvey is an effort to get the Plan 9 code working with gcc and clang. Flatlined in 2023, succeeded by r9.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inferno — Inferno is a distributed operating system started at Bell Labs, but is now developed and maintained by Vita Nuova Holdings as free software. Just kidding! It is not developed or maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ANTS — Advanced Namespace Tools for Plan 9. ANTS is a collection of modifications and additional software which adds new namespace manipulation capabilities to Plan 9.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jehanne — Jehanne:Harvey::William King Harvey:J. Edgar Hoover&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;r9 — A project based on the idea that Plan 9 needs a ground-up rewrite in a language that can't be compiled on Plan 9. Everyone expects big things.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plan 9 Foundation — Now offering downloads of historical Plan 9 releases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the words of the Bell Labs Plan 9 wiki:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plan 9 is not Unix. If you think of it as Unix, you may become frustrated when something doesn't exist or when it works differently than you expected. If you think of it as Plan 9, however, you'll find that most of it works very smoothly, and that there are some truly neat ideas that make things much cleaner than you have seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confusion is compounded by the fact that many UNIX commands exist on Plan 9 and behave in similar ways. In fact, some of Plan 9's userland (such as the upas mail interface, the sam text editor, and the rc shell) are carried over directly from Research UNIX 10th Edition. Further investigation reveals that many ideas found in Plan 9 were explored in more primitive form in the later editions of Research UNIX.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, Plan 9 is a completely new operating system that makes no attempt to conform to past prejudices. The point of the exercise (circa the late 1980s) was to avoid past problems and explore new territory. Plan 9 is not UNIX for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Plan 9 from User Space (also known as plan9port or p9p) is a port of many Plan 9 from Bell Labs libraries and applications to UNIX-like operating systems. Currently it has been tested on a variety of operating systems including: Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris and SunOS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plan9port consists of a combination of mostly unaltered Plan 9 userland utilities packaged alongside various attempts to imitate Plan 9's kernel intefaces using miscellaneous available UNIX programs and commands. Some of the imitations are more successful than others. In all, plan9port does not accurately represent the experience of using actual Plan 9, but does provide enough functionality to make some users content with running acme on their Macbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is now being slowly ported to the Go programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inferno is a distributed operating system also created at Bell Labs, but which is now developed and maintained by Vita Nuova Holdings as free software. It employs many ideas from Plan 9 (Inferno does share some compatible interfaces with Plan 9, including the 9P/Styx protocol), but is a completely different OS. Many users new to Plan 9 find out about Inferno and immediately decide to abandon Plan 9 and its opaque user interface for this obviously "more advanced" sibling, but usually abandon that, too, upon first contact with Inferno's Tk GUI. Notable exceptions duly noted.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;``Plan 9'' is not a product, and is not intended to be. It is research --&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;an experimental investigation into a different way of computing. The&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;developers started from several basic assumptions: that CPUs are very&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;cheap but that we don't really know how to combine them effectively; that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;*good* networking is very important; that an intelligent user interface&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(complete with dot-mapped display and mouse) is a Right Decision; that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;existing systems with networks, mice, etc., are not the correct way to&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;do things, and in particular that today's workstations are not the way to&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;go. (No, I won't bother to explain all their reasoning; that's a long&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and separate article.) Finally, the UNIX system per se is dead as a&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;vehicle for serious research into operating system structure; it has grown&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;too large, and is too constrained by 15+ years of history.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now -- given those assumptions, they decided to throw away what we have&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;today and design a new system. Compatibility isn't an issue -- they are&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;not in the product-building business. (Nor are they in the ``let's make&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;another clever hack'' business.) Of course aspects of Plan 9 resemble&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the UNIX system quite strongly -- is it any surprise that Pike, Thompson,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;et al., think that that's a decent model to follow? But Plan 9 isn't,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and is not meant to be, a re-implementation of the UNIX system. If you&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;want, call it a UNIX-like system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will Plan 9 ever be released? I have no idea. Will it remain buried?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope not. Large companies do not sponsor large research organizations&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;just for the prestige; they hope for an (eventual) concrete return in the&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;form of concepts that can be made into (or incorporated into) products.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;it's accurate, though, and I'm sure I'll be told if I'm wrong...&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;From a newcomer's perspective, it feels like dealing with a cult run&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;by scam artists. It seems someone wants to profit from me by selling&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;books on Amazon, like a multi-level marketing group. People say&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;others here are on a spectrum, but it feels more like psychosis, with&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a loss of contact with reality. I really feel like I'm being&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;gaslighted. I might seem like a troll, but you don't understand how&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;you appear to others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I am looking for a Plan 9 group that doesn't behave this way. If&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;anyone is interested, let's form a group that isn't cult-like, that&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;just wants to help newcomers and not prey on them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's be perfectly honest. Many features that today's "computer experts" consider to be essential to computing (JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, etc.) either did not exist when Plan 9 was abandoned by its creators, or were purposely left out of the operating system. You might find this to be an unacceptable obstacle to adopting Plan 9 into your daily workflow. If you cannot imagine a use for a computer that does not involve a web browser, Plan 9 may not be for you.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;See: http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the roaring 2020s have seen Plan 9 sprout a substantial presence on social media, so if you're here for that, YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You may ask yourself, well, how did I get here? In the words of Plan 9 contributor Russ Cox:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why Plan 9 indeed. Isn't Plan 9 just another Unix clone? Who cares?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plan 9 presents a consistent and easy to use interface. Once you've settled in, there are very few surprises here. After I switched to Linux from Windows 3.1, I noticed all manner of inconsistent behavior in Windows 3.1 that Linux did not have. Switching to Plan 9 from Linux highlighted just as much in Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One reason Plan 9 can do this is that the Plan 9 group has had the luxury of having an entire system, so problems can be fixed and features added where they belong, rather than where they can be. For example, there is no tty driver in the kernel. The window system handles the nuances of terminal input.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Plan 9 was just a really clean Unix clone, it might be worth using, or it might not. The neat things start happening with user-level file servers and per-process namespace. In Unix, /dev/tty refers to the current window's output device, and means different things to different processes. This is a special hack enabled by the kernel for a single file. Plan 9 provides full-blown per-process namespaces. In Plan 9 /dev/cons also refers to the current window's output device, and means different things to different processes, but the window system (or telnet daemon, or ssh daemon, or whatever) arranges this, and does the same for /dev/mouse, /dev/text (the contents of the current window), etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since pieces of file tree can be provided by user-level servers, the kernel need not know about things like DOS's FAT file system or GNU/Linux's EXT2 file system or NFS, etc. Instead, user-level servers provide this functionality when desired. In Plan 9, even FTP is provided as a file server: you run ftpfs and the files on the server appear in /n/ftp.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need not stop at physical file systems, though. Other file servers synthesize files that represent other resources. For example, upas/fs presents your mail box as a file tree at /mail/fs/mbox. This models the recursive structure of MIME messages especially well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As another example, cdfs presents an audio or data CD as a file system, one file per track. If it's a writable CD, copying new files into the /mnt/cd/wa or /mnt/cd/wd directories does create new audio or data tracks. Want to fixate the CD as audio or data? Remove one of the directories.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plan 9 fits well with a networked environment, files and directory trees can be imported from other machines, and all resources are files or directory trees, it's easy to share resources. Want to use a different machine's sound card? Import its /dev/audio. Want to debug processes that run on another machine? Import its /proc. Want to use a network interface on another machine? Import its /net. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Hi! I'm new to Plan 9. I'm really excited to work with this new Linux system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hit some questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1 How do I run X11?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2 Where is Emacs?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;3 The code is weird. It doesn't look like GNU C at all. Did the people who wrote Plan 9 know about C?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;4 I tried to run mozilla but it did not work. How come?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is this guy you?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Related: http://9front.org/buds.html&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A summary of common features you may have been expecting that are missing from Plan 9:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhatIsNotInPlanNine&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the people who worked on Plan 9 have moved on from Bell Labs and/or no longer work on Plan 9. Various reasons have been articulated by various people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ran Plan 9 from Bell Labs as my day to day work environment until around 2002. By then two facts were painfully clear. First, the Internet was here to stay; and second, Plan 9 had no hope of keeping up with web browsers. Porting Mozilla to Plan 9 was far too much work, so instead I ported almost all the Plan 9 user level software to FreeBSD, Linux, and OS X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russ Cox (again):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The standard set up for a Plan 9 aficionado here seems to be a Mac or Linux machine running Plan 9 from User Space to get at sam, acme, and the other tools. Rob, Ken, Dave, and I use Macs as our desktop machines, but we're a bit of an exception. Most Google engineers use Linux machines, and I know of quite a few ex-Bell Labs people who are happy to be using sam or acme on those machines. My own setup is two screens. The first is a standard Mac desktop with non-Plan 9 apps and a handful of 9terms, and the second is a full-screen acme for getting work done. On Linux I do the same but the first screen is a Linux desktop running rio (formerly dhog's 8½).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More broadly, every few months I tend to get an email from someone who is happy to have just discovered that sam is still maintained and available for modern systems. A lot of the time these are people who only used sam on Unix, never on Plan 9. The plan9port.tgz file was downloaded from 2,522 unique IP addresses in 2009, which I suspect is many more than Plan 9 itself. In that sense, it's really nice to see the tools getting a much wider exposure than they used to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven't logged into a real Plan 9 system in many years, but I use 9vx occasionally when I want to remind myself how a real Plan 9 tool worked. It's always nice to be back, however briefly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russ&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russ Cox continues:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Can you briefly tell us why you (Russ, Rob, Ken and Dave)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; no longer use Plan9 ?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Because of missing apps or because of missing driver for your hardware ?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; And do you still use venti ?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operating systems and programming languages have strong network effects: it helps to use the same system that everyone around you is using. In my group at MIT, that meant FreeBSD and C++. I ran Plan 9 for the first few years I was at MIT but gave up, because the lack of a shared system made it too hard to collaborate. When I switched to FreeBSD, I ported all the Plan 9 libraries and tools so I could keep the rest of the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I still use venti, in that I still maintain the venti server that takes care of backups for my old group at MIT. It uses the plan9port venti, vbackup, and vnfs, all running on FreeBSD. The venti server itself was my last real Plan 9 installation. It's Coraid hardware, but I stripped the software and had installed my own Plan 9 kernel to run venti on it directly. But before I left MIT, the last thing I did was reinstall the machine using FreeBSD so that others could help keep it up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I wasn't interacting with anyone else it'd be nice to keep using Plan 9. But it's also nice to be able to use off the shelf software instead of reinventing wheels (9fans runs on Linux) and to have good hardware support done by other people (I can shut my laptop and it goes to sleep, and even better, when I open it again, it wakes up!). Being able to get those things and still keep most of the Plan 9 user experience by running Plan 9 from User Space is a compromise, but one that works well for me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russ&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What Russ says is true but for me it was simpler. I used Plan 9 as my local operating system for a year or so after joining Google, but it was just too inconvenient to live on a machine without a C++ compiler, without good NFS and SSH support, and especially without a web browser. I switched to Linux but found it very buggy (the main problem was most likely a bad graphics board and/or driver, but still) and my main collaborator (Robert Griesemer) had done the ground work to get a Mac working as a primary machine inside Google, and Russ had plan9port up, so I pushed plan9port onto the Mac and have been there ever since, quite happily. Nowadays Apples are officially supported so it's become easy, workwise.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I miss a lot of what Plan 9 did for me, but the concerns at work override that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-rob&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They probably have their reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Plan 9 CD-ROM needed about 100MB for the full distribution, if that. We&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;hatched a plan to fill up the rest with encoded music and include the&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;software to decode it. (We wanted to get the encoder out too, but lawyers&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;stood in the way. Keep reading.) Using connections I had with folks in the&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;area, and some very helpful friends in the music business, I got permission&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;to distribute several hours of existing recorded stuff from groups like the&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Residents and Wire. Lou Reed gave a couple of pieces too - he was very&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;interested in Ken and Sean's work (which, it should be noted, was built on&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;groundbreaking work done in the acoustics center at Bell Labs) and visited&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;us to check it out. Debby Harry even recorded an original song for us in&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the studio.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We had permission for all this of course, and releases from everyone&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;involved. It was very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So naturally, just before release, an asshole (I am being kind) lawyer at&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T headquarters in Manhattan stopped the project cold. In a phone call&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;that treated me as shabbily as I have ever been, he said he didn't know who&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;these "assholes" (again, but this time his term) were and therefore the&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;releases were meaningless because anyone could have written them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And that, my friends, is why MP-3 took off instead of the far better&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;follow-on system we were on the cusp of getting out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-rob&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;P.S. No, I don't have the music any more. Too sad to keep.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the years Plan 9 has been released under various licenses, to the consternation of many.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first edition, released in 1992, was made available only to universities. The process for acquiring the software was convoluted and prone to clerical error. Many potential users had trouble obtaining it within a reasonable time frame and many complaints were voiced on the eventual Plan 9 Internet mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second edition, released in 1995 in book-and-CD form under a relatively standard commercial license, was available via mailorder as well as through a special telephone number for a price of approximately $350 USD. It was certainly easier to acquire than the first edition, but many potential users still complained that the price was too high and that the license was too restrictive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the year 2000, the third edition of Plan 9 was finally released under a custom "open source" license, the Plan 9 License. Richard Stallman was not impressed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When I saw the announcement that the Plan Nine software had been released as "open source", I wondered whether it might be free software as well. After studying the license, my conclusion was that it is not free; the license contains several restrictions that are totally unacceptable for the Free Software Movement. (See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read more here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;http://www.linuxtoday.com/developer/2000070200704OPLFSW&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the year 2002, the fourth edition of Plan 9 was released under the Lucent Public License. This time, Theo de Raadt was not impressed:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new license is utterly unacceptable for use in a BSD project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually, I am astounded that the OSI would declare such a license acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is not a license which makes it free. It is a *contract* with consequences; let me be clear -- it is a contract with consequences that I am unwilling to accept.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read more here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;http://9fans.net/archive/2003/06/270&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2014, portions of the Plan 9 source code were again re-licensed, this time under the GPLv2, for distribution with the University of California, Berkeley's Akaros operating system. Predictably, various parties were not impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russ Cox tried to make sense of the situation by commenting in a Hacker News thread:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you ask "why did big company X make strange choice Y regarding licensing or IP", 99 times out of 100 the answer is "lawyers". If the Plan 9 group had had its way, Plan 9 would have been released for free under a trivial MIT-like license (the one used for other pieces of code, like the one true awk) in 2003 instead of creating the Lucent Public License. Or in 2000 instead of creating the "Plan 9 License". Or in 1995 instead of as a $350 book+CD that came with a license for use by an entire "organization". Or in 1992 instead of being a limited academic release.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thankfully I am not at Lucent anymore and am not privy to the tortured negotiations that ended up at the obviously inelegant compromise of "The University of California, Berkeley, has been authorised by Alcatel-Lucent to release all Plan 9 software previously governed by the Lucent Public License, Version 1.02 under the GNU General Public License, Version 2." But the odds are overwhelming that the one-word answer is "lawyers".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some have suggested that confusion about licensing may have contributed to Plan 9's failure to supplant UNIX in the wider computing world.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In 2021, the Plan 9 Foundation (aka P9F—no relation) convinced Nokia to re-license all historical editions of the Plan9 source code under the MIT Public License.&lt;/p&gt;
