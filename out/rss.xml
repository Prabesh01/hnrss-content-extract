    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When people talk about the value of paying attention and slowing down, they often make it sound prudish and monk-like. Attention is something we “have to protect.” And we have to “pay”1 attention—like a tribute.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But we shouldn’t forget how interesting and overpoweringly pleasurable sustained attention can be. Slowing down makes reality vivid, strange, and hot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me start with the most obvious example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As anyone who has had good sex knows, sustained attention and delayed satisfaction are a big part of it. When you resist the urge to go ahead and get what you want and instead stay in the moment, you open up a space for seduction and fantasy. Desire begins to loop on itself and intensify.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what is going on here, but my rough understanding is that the expectation of pleasure activates the dopaminergic system in the brain. Dopamine is often portrayed as a pleasure chemical, but it isn’t really about pleasure so much as the expectation that pleasure will occur soon. So when we are being seduced and sense that something pleasurable is coming—but it keeps being delayed, and delayed skillfully—the phasic bursts of dopamine ramp up the levels higher and higher, pulling more receptors to the surface of the cells, making us more and more sensitized to the surely-soon-to-come pleasure. We become hyperattuned to the sensations in our genitals, lips, and skin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And it is not only dopamine ramping up that makes seduction warp our attentional field, infusing reality with intensity and strangeness. There are a myriad of systems that come together to shape our feeling of the present: there are glands and hormones and multiple areas of the brain involved. These are complex physical processes: hormones need to be secreted and absorbed; working memory needs to be cleared and reloaded, and so on. The reason deep attention can’t happen the moment you notice something is that these things take time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What’s more, each of these subsystems update what they are reacting to at a different rate. Your visual cortex can cohere in less than half a second. A stress hormone like cortisol, on the other hand, has a half-life of 60–90 minutes and so can take up to 6 hours to fully clear out after the onset of an acute stressor. This means that if we switch what we pay attention to more often than, say, every 30 minutes, our system will be more or less decohered—different parts will be “attending to” different aspects of reality.2 There will be “attention residue” floating around in our system—leftovers from earlier things we paid attention to (thoughts looping, feelings circling below consciousness, etc.), which crowd out the thing we have in front of us right now, making it less vivid.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inversely, the longer we are able to sustain the attention without resolving it and without losing interest, the more time the different systems of the body have to synchronize with each other, and the deeper the experience gets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Locked in on the same thing, the subsystems begin to reinforce each other: the dopamine makes us aware of our skin, and sensations on the skin ramp up dopamine release, making us even more aware of our skin. A finger touches our belly, and we start to fantasize about where that finger might be going; and so now our fantasies are locked in, too, releasing even more dopamine and making us even more aware of our skin. The more the subsystems lock in, the more intense the feedback loops get. After twenty minutes, our sense of self has evaporated, and we’re in a realm where we do, feel, and think things that would seem surreal in other contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similar things happen when we are able to sustain our attention to things other than sex, too. The exact mechanics differ, I presume, but the basic pattern is that when we let our attention linger on something, our bodily systems synchronize and feed each other stimuli in an escalatory loop that restructures our attentional field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Almost anything that we are able to direct sustained attention at will begin to loop on itself and bloom.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To take a dark example, if you focus on your anxiety, the anxiety can begin to loop on itself until you hyperventilate and get tunnel vision and become filled with nightmarish thoughts and feelings—a panic attack.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And you do the same thing with joy. If you learn to pay sustained attention to your happiness, the pleasant sensation will loop on itself until it explodes and pulls you into a series of almost hallucinogenic states, ending in cessation, where your consciousness lets go and you disappear for a while. This takes practice. The practice is called jhanas, and it is sometimes described as the inverse of a panic attack. I have only ever entered the first jhana, once while spending an hour putting our four-year-old to sleep and meditating on how wonderful it is to lie there next to her. It was really weird and beautiful. If you want to know more about these sorts of mental states, I recommend José Luis Ricón Fernández de la Puente’s recent write-up of his experiences, Nadia Asparouhova on her experiences, and her how-to guide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is José, whose blog is normally detailed reflections on cell biology and longevity and metascience, describing the second evening of a jhana retreat:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So I went down to the beach. “Kinda nice”, I thought. The sky had a particularly vibrant blue color, the waves had ‘the right size’, their roar was pleasant. I started to walk around trying to continue meditating. I focused my awareness on an arising sensation of open heartedness and then I noticed my eyes tearing up (“Huh? I thought”). I looked again at the ocean and then I saw it. It was fucking amazing. So much color and detail: waves within waves, the fractal structure of the foamy crests as they disintegrate back into the ocean. The feeling of the sun on my skin. I felt overwhelmed. As tears ran down my face and lowkey insane grin settled on my face I found myself mumbling “It’s... always been like this!!!!” “What the fuck??!” followed by “This is too much!! Too much!!!”. The experience seemed to be demanding from me to feel more joy and awe than I was born to feel or something like that. In that precise moment I felt what “painfully beautiful” means for the first time in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The fact that we can enter fundamentally different, and often exhilarating, states of mind by learning how to sustain our attention is fascinating. It makes you wonder what other states are waiting out there. What will happen if you properly pay attention to an octopus?3 What about your sense of loneliness?4 A mathematical idea?5 The weights of a neural net?6 The footnotes here take you to examples of people who have done that. There are so many things to pay attention to and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things to sustain attention toward is art.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a period in my twenties when I didn’t get art. I thought artists were trying to say something, but I felt superior because I thought there had to be better ways of getting their ideas across (and also, better ideas). But then I realized that good art—at least the art I am spontaneously drawn to—has little to do with communication. Instead, it is about crafting patterns of information that, if you feed them sustained attention, will begin to structure your attentional field in interesting ways. Art is guided meditation. The point isn’t the words, but what happens to your mind when you attend to those words (or images, or sounds). There is nothing there to understand; it is just something to experience, like sex. But the experiences can be very deep and, sometimes, transformative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2019, for example, I saw a performance of Jean Sibelius’s 5th Symphony at the University Hall in Uppsala.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before the concert began, I spent a few minutes with my eyes closed, doing a body scan, to be fully present when the music began. As the horns at the opening of the piece called out, I decided to keep my eyes closed, so I wouldn’t be distracted by looking at the hands of the musicians. Then… a sort of daydream started up. The mood suggested to me the image of a cottage overlooking a sloping meadow and a thick wood of pines, a few hours from Helsinki. It was a pretty obvious image, since I knew that Sibelius wrote the piece at Aniola, which is 38 km north of Helsinki. But then I saw an old man walking up the meadow and into the house. The camera cut. Through an open door, I saw the man, alone, working at a desk. I saw it as clearly as if it had been projected on a screen before me: the camera moved slowly toward the back of the man.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Through the window above his desk, I could see a light in the distance. Perhaps it was Helsinki? No, it felt alive, like a being—something alive and growing, something that was headed here. But then again, if you were to see a city from space, watching it sped up by 100,000x, it would look like a being moving through the landscape, spreading, getting closer. The old man sat there for a hundred years, watching the light. There was a sinking feeling in my body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One spring, birds fell dead from the sky. They littered the fields, whole droves of them filled the ditches—blue birds, red birds, and black. The man carried them into his woodshed and placed them in waist-high piles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The film kept going, and the emotional intensity and complexity gradually ramped up. For the thirty minutes that it took the orchestra to play the three movements of the symphony, I experienced what felt like two or three feature films, all interconnected by some strange emotional logic. In the third movement, a group of hunter-gatherers was living in a cave that reminded me of the entrance to a nuclear waste facility. A girl hiding behind a tree saw men with cars arrive…&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The structure of the music was such that it gave me enough predictability and enough surprise to allow my attention to deeply cohere. The melody lines and harmonies dredged up memories and images from my subconscious, weaving them into a rich cinematic web of stories. Guided by the music, my mind could tunnel into an attentional state where I was able to see things I had never seen before and where I could work through some deep emotional pain that seemed to resolve itself through the images.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the music stopped, I barely knew where I was.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I opened my eyes and remembered that my brother was sitting next to me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What did you think?” I said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I don’t know,” he said. “I felt kind of restless.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In Spanish, you “lend” attention. In Swedish, you “are” attention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not like 30 minutes is some ideal. Attention can, under the right conditions, keep getting deeper and more coherent for much longer, as attested by people who meditate for weeks. Inversely, you can, if you have a well developed dorsal attention network and low cortisol level etc, cohere to a high degree in a few minutes. (Though if you have a lot of stress hormones, thirty minutes will not be nearly enough to get out of a flighty mode of attention.) In other words, I don’t think you can put a precise number at it.&lt;lb/&gt;Time to coherence depends on your starting place (mood, hormones, chemical make up in the brain), your skill, and the level of coherence you want to pursue. There is a famous study saying it takes people 23 minutes to get to full productivity after an interruption, which seems like it is correlated to the time it takes them to deeply cohere their attentional field. On the other hand, there is also an upper limit at how long you can cohere, which also depends on a bunch of factors. If I’m working on an essay, I notice that the quality of my thinking drops after about 20 minutes of sustained attention and I need to pause for a few minutes and walk around to get back up to full focus. So in my case, my deepest thinking seem to decohere before I even reach that infamous 23 minute mark! And after 3-4 hours, the quality of my attention goes down so much that everything I write ends up being deleted the day after. For more relaxed attention, like meditation, I haven’t reached the limit for how long I can deepen my coherence—after an hour, which is the longest I’ve gone, I’m still shifting deeper into attention.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Charles Darwin:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[During our stay in Porto Praya,] I was much interested, on several occasions, by watching the habits of an Octopus, or cuttle-fish. Although common in the pools of water left by the retiring tide, these animals were not easily caught. By means of their long arms and suckers, they could drag their bodies into very narrow crevices; and when thus fixed, it required great force to remove them. At other times they darted tail first, with the rapidity of an arrow, from one side of the pool to the other, at the same instant discolouring the water with a dark chestnut-brown ink. These animals also escape detection by a very extraordinary, chameleon-like power of changing their colour. They appear to vary their tints according to the nature of the ground over which they pass: when in deep water, their general shade was brownish purple, but when placed on the land, or in shallow water, this dark tint changed into one of a yellowish green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The colour, examined more carefully, was a French grey, with numerous minute spots of bright yellow: the former of these varied in intensity; the latter entirely disappeared and appeared again by turns. These changes were effected in such a manner, that clouds, varying in tint between a hyacinth red and a chestnut-brown, were continually passing over the body. Any part, being subjected to a slight shock of galvanism, became almost black: a similar effect, but in a less degree, was produced by scratching the skin with a needle. These clouds, or blushes as they may be called, are said to be produced by the alternate expansion and contraction of minute vesicles containing variously coloured fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cuttle-fish displayed its chameleon-like power both during the act of swimming and whilst remaining stationary at the bottom. I was much amused by the various arts to escape detection used by one individual, which seemed fully aware that I was watching it. Remaining for a time motionless, it would then stealthily advance an inch or two, like a cat after a mouse; sometimes changing its colour: it thus proceeded, till having gained a deeper part, it darted away, leaving a dusky train of ink to hide the hole into which it had crawled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;While looking for marine animals, with my head about two feet above the rocky shore, I was more than once saluted by a jet of water, accompanied by a slight grating noise. At first I could not think what it was, but afterwards I found out that it was this cuttle-fish, which, though concealed in a hole, thus often led me to its discovery. That it possesses the power of ejecting water there is no doubt, and it appeared to me that it could certainly take good aim by directing the tube or siphon on the under side of its body. From the difficulty which these animals have in carrying their heads, they cannot crawl with ease when placed on the ground. I observed that one which I kept in the cabin was slightly phosphorescent in the dark.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sasha Chapin writes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late winter 2024, I noticed that I wasn’t living up to my stated policy of trying to accept every emotion passing through my system. There were certain shades of existential loneliness that I was pushing away. This was causing some friction. Solitude is simply part of my current life chapter, since Cate is more independent than any of my previous partners, and Berkeley is a place where I don’t feel at home socially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;As a response, I made feelings of solitude the central focus of my practice. I tried to become like a sommelier, going out of my way to appreciate all the shades of loneliness that colored my afternoons, trying to zoom in on every micro-pixel and embrace rather than reject.&lt;lb/&gt;Again—normal. This is what, for me, long-term practice often consists of: noticing when my reactions don’t line up with my principles, and seeing if I can bring myself into deeper alignment.&lt;lb/&gt;However, I noticed something odd. Dropping the resistance to loneliness allowed me to slip into deeper sensations of flow. It was almost as if the emotional resistance had been preventing the emergence of a more intuitive part of my will. There were a few memorable walks I took where the feeling of solitude felt like a portal into an exquisitely smooth parallel world. When I allowed my emotions to pierce me more deeply, I fell into a different degree of cooperation with reality. Every step felt precise and necessary, like a choreographed dance.&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Michael Nielsen writes about this in an essay where he describes the experience of pushing himself to go deeper than usual in understanding a mathematical proof:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I gradually internalize the mathematical objects I’m dealing with [using spaced repetition]. It becomes easier and easier to conduct (most of) my work in my head. [. . .] Furthermore, as my understanding of the objects change – as I learn more about their nature, and correct my own misconceptions – my sense of what I can do with the objects changes as well. It’s as though they sprout new affordances, in the language of user interface design, and I get much practice in learning to fluidly apply those affordances in multiple ways. [. . .]&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After going through the [time-consuming process of deeply understanding a proof,] I had a rather curious experience. I went for a multi-hour walk along the San Francisco Embarcadero. I found that my mind simply and naturally began discovering other facts related to the result. In particular, I found a handful (perhaps half a dozen) of different proofs of the basic theorem, as well as noticing many related ideas. This wasn’t done especially consciously – rather, my mind simply wanted to find these proofs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chris Olah writes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Research intimacy is different from theoretical knowledge. It involves internalizing information that hasn’t become part of the “scientific cannon” yet. Observations we don’t (yet) see as important, or haven’t (yet) digested. The ideas are raw.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(A personal example: I’ve memorized hundreds of neurons in InceptionV1. I know how they behave, and I know how that behavior is built from earlier neurons. These seem like obscure facts, but they give me powerful, concrete examples to test ideas against.)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Research intimacy is also different from research taste. But it does feed into it, and I suspect it’s one of the key ingredients in beating the “research taste market.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As your intimacy with a research topic grows, your random thoughts about it become more interesting. Your thoughts in the shower or on a hike bounce against richer context. Your unconscious has more to work with. Your intuition deepens.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I suspect that a lot of “brilliant insights” are natural next steps from someone who has deep intimacy with a research topic. And that actually seems more profound.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Health&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;WiFi signals can measure heart rate—no wearables needed&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engineers prove their technique is effective even with the lowest-cost WiFi devices&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Press Contact&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Media Access&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Key takeaways&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The Pulse-Fi system is highly accurate, achieving clinical-level heart rate monitoring with ultra low-cost WiFi devices, making it useful for low resource settings.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The system works with the person in a variety of different positions and from up to 10 feet away.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heart rate is one of the most basic and important indicators of health, providing a snapshot into a person’s physical activity, stress and anxiety, hydration level, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, measuring heart rate requires some sort of wearable device, whether that be a smart watch or hospital-grade machinery. But new research from engineers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, shows how the signal from a household WiFi device can be used for this crucial health monitoring with state-of-the-art accuracy—without the need for a wearable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their proof of concept work demonstrates that one day, anyone could take advantage of this non-intrusive WiFi-based health monitoring technology in their homes. The team proved their technique works with low-cost WiFi devices, demonstrating its usefulness for low resource settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A study demonstrating the technology, which the researchers have coined “Pulse-Fi,” was published in the proceedings of the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Measuring with WiFi&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A team of researchers at UC Santa Cruz’s Baskin School of Engineering that included Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Katia Obraczka, Ph.D. student Nayan Bhatia, and high school student and visiting researcher Pranay Kocheta designed a system for accurately measuring heart rate that combines low-cost WiFi devices with a machine learning algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WiFi devices push out radio frequency waves into physical space around them and toward a receiving device, typically a computer or phone. As the waves pass through objects in space, some of the wave is absorbed into those objects, causing mathematically detectable changes in the wave.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pulse-Fi uses a WiFi transmitter and receiver, which runs Pulse-Fi’s signal processing and machine learning algorithm. They trained the algorithm to distinguish even the faintest variations in signal caused by a human heart beat by filtering out all other changes to the signal in the environment or caused by activity like movement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The signal is very sensitive to the environment, so we have to select the right filters to remove all the unnecessary noise,” Bhatia said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Dynamic results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team ran experiments with 118 participants and found that after only five seconds of signal processing, they could measure heart rate with clinical-level accuracy. At five seconds of monitoring, they saw only half a beat-per-minute of error, with longer periods of monitoring time increasing the accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team found that the Pulse-Fi system worked regardless of the position of the equipment in the room or the person whose heart rate was being measured—no matter if they were sitting, standing, lying down, or walking, the system still performed. For each of the 118 participants, they tested 17 different body positions with accurate results&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These results were found using ultra-low-cost ESP32 chips, which retail between $5 and $10 and Raspberry Pi chips, which cost closer to $30. Results from the Raspberry Pi experiments show even better performance. More expensive WiFi devices like those found in commercial routers would likely further improve the accuracy of their system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They also found that their system had accurate performance with a person three meters, or nearly 10 feet, away from the hardware. Further testing beyond what is published in the current study shows promising results for longer distances.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“What we found was that because of the machine learning model, that distance apart basically had no effect on performance, which was a very big struggle for past models,” Kocheta said. “The other thing was position—all the different things you encounter in day to day life, we wanted to make sure we were robust to however a person is living.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Creating the dataset&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make their heart rate detection system work, the researchers needed to train their machine learning algorithm to distinguish the faint detections in WiFi signals caused by a human heartbeat. They found that there was no existing data for these patterns using an ESP32 device, so they set out to create their own dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the UC Santa Cruz Science and Engineering library, they set up their ESP32 system along with a standard oximeter to gather “ground truth” data. By combining the data from the Pulse-Fi setup with the ground truth data, they could teach a neural network which changes in signals corresponded with heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to the ESP32 dataset they collected, they also tested Pulse-Fi using a dataset produced by a team of researchers in Brazil using a Raspberry Pi device, which created the most extensive existing dataset on WiFi for heart monitoring, as far as the researchers are aware.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;Beyond heart rate&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now, the researchers are working on further research to extend their technique to detect breathing rate in addition to heart rate, which can be useful for the detection of conditions like sleep apnea. Unpublished results show high promise for accurate breathing rate and apnea detection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those interested in commercial use of this technology can contact Assistant Director of Innovation Transfer Marc Oettinger: marc.oettinger@ucsc.edu.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi HN! – We’re Pranjali, Dhruv and Harsha, building Slashy (&lt;/p&gt;https://www.slashy.ai&lt;p&gt;). We’re building a general agent that connects to apps and can read data across them and perform actions via custom tools, semantic search, and personalized memory. Here’s a demo: &lt;/p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeApHMHhccA&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While working on a previous startup, we realized we were spending more time doing busywork in apps than actually building product. We lost hundreds of hours scraping LinkedIn profiles, updating spreadsheets, updating investor reports, and communicating across multiple Slack channels. Our breaking point happened after I checked my screen time and realized I spent 4 hours a day in Gmail. We decided that we could create more value solving this than by working on the original startup (a code generation agent similar to Lovable).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slashy is an AI agent that uses direct tool calls to services such as Gmail, Calendar, Notion, Sheets and more. We built all of our tools in-house since we found that most MCPs are low quality and add an unnecessary layer of abstraction. Through these tools, the agent is able to semantically search across your apps, get relevant information, and perform actions (e.g. send emails, create calendar events, etc). This solves the problem of context-switching and copy-pasting information from an app back and forth into ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slashy integrates to 15 different services so far (G-Suite, Slack, Notion, Dropbox, Airtable, Outlook, Phone, Linear, Hubspot, and more). We use a single agent architecture (as we found this reduces hallucinations), and use our own custom tools—doing so allows the model to have higher quality as we can design them to work in a general agent structure, for example we use markdown for Slack/Notion instead of their native text structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what makes Slashy different from the 100 other general agents?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- It Actually Takes Action: Unlike ChatGPT or Claude that just give you information, Slashy researches companies, creates Google Docs with findings, adds contacts to your CRM, schedules follow-ups, and sends personalized emails – all in one workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Cross-Tool Context: Most automation tools work in silos (one of the biggest problems with MCP). Slashy understands your data across platforms. It can read your previous Slack conversations about a prospect, check your calendar for availability, research their company online, and draft a personalized email. What powers this is our own semantic search functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- User Action Graphs: Our agent over time has memory not just of past conversations, but also forms user actions graphs to know what actions are expected based on previous user conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- No Technical Setup Required: While Zapier requires building complex flows and fails silently, Slashy works through natural language. Just describe what you want automated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Custom UI: For our tool calls we design custom UI for each of them to make the UX more natural.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of workflows people use us for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;▪ "Every day look at my calendar and send me a notion doc with in-depth backgrounds on everyone I’m meeting"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;▪ "Find the emails of everyone who reacted to my latest LinkedIn post and send personalized outreach"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;▪ "Can you make me an investor pitch deck with market research, competitive analysis, and financial projections"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;▪ "Doing a full Nvidia Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slashy.ai is live with a free tier (100 daily credits) along with 500 credits for any new account. You can immediately try out workflows like the ones above and we have a special code for HN (HACKERNEWS at checkout).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope you all enjoy Slashy as much as we do :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How we built an interpreter for Swift (a compiled language)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bitrig dynamically generates and runs Swift apps on your phone. Normally this would require compiling and signing with Xcode, and you can’t do that on an iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make it possible to instantly run your app, we built a Swift interpreter. But it’s an unusual interpreter, since it interprets from Swift… to Swift. One of the top questions we’ve gotten is how it’s implemented, so we wanted to share how it works. To make this more accessible and interesting, we simplified some of the more esoteric details. But we hope you’ll come away with a high-level picture of how the interpreter works.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Swift project helpfully provides a way to reuse all of the parsing logic from the compiler: SwiftSyntax. This made our job a lot easier. We can easily take some Swift code and get a parsed tree out of it, which we can use to evaluate and call into to get dynamic runtime values. Let’s dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can start with generating the simplest kind of runtime values. For any literals (strings, floating point numbers, integers, and booleans), we can create corresponding Swift instances (&lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Bool&lt;/code&gt;) to represent them. Since we’re not compiling this, we don’t know ahead of time what all the types will be, so we need to type erase all instances. Let’s make an enum to represent these runtime interpreter values (since we'll have multiple kinds soon):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;enum InterpreterValue { case nativeValue(Any) }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next, we'll expand our interpreter runtime values to be able to represent developer-defined types, too. Let’s say we have a struct with two fields: a string and an integer. We’ll store it as a type that has a dictionary mapping from the property name to the runtime value. When an initializer gets called, we simply need to map the arguments to the property names and populate the dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;enum InterpreterValue { case nativeValue(Any) case customInstance(CustomInstance) } struct CustomInstance { var type: InterpreterType var values: [String: InterpreterValue] }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But, what happens when we want to call an API that comes from a framework, like SwiftUI? For example, let’s say we have a call to &lt;code&gt;Text("Hello World")&lt;/code&gt;. We don’t want to rewrite all of the APIs, the whole benefit of making a native app is being able to call into those implementations! Well, those APIs are available for us to call into since the interpreter is also written in Swift (naturally!). We just need to change from a dynamic call to a compiled one. We can do that by pre-compiling a call to the &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt; initializer that can take dynamic arguments. Something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;func evaluateTextInitializer(arguments: [Argument]) -&amp;gt; Text { Text(arguments.first?.value.stringValue ?? "") }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But of course, we need more than just the &lt;code&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt; initializer, so we'll generalize this to any initializer we might be called with:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;func evaluateInitializer(type: String, arguments: [Argument]) -&amp;gt; Any? { if type == "Text" { return Text(arguments.first?.value.stringValue ?? "") } else if type == "Image" { return Image(arguments.first?.value.stringValue ?? "") ... }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can follow this same pattern for all other API types: function calls, properties, subscripts, etc. The difficult part is that there are a lot of APIs. It’s not practical to hand-write code to call into all of them, but fortunately there is a structured list of all of them: the .swiftinterface file for each framework. We can parse those files to get a list of all of the APIs we need and then generate the necessary code to call into them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One interesting thing about taking this approach to its most extreme is that even very basic operations that you might expect any interpreter to implement, like basic numeric operations, can still call into their framework implementations. So this kind of interpreter doesn’t know how to calculate or evaluate anything itself, and is really more of a glorified foreign function interface, but from dynamic Swift to compiled Swift.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One last important challenge is how to make custom types conform to framework protocols. For example, how do we make a custom SwiftUI &lt;code&gt;View&lt;/code&gt;? Well, at runtime, we need a concrete type that conforms to the desired protocol. To do this, we can make stub types that conform to the protocol, but instead of having any logic of their own, simply call out to the interpreter to implement any requirements. Let’s look at &lt;code&gt;Shape&lt;/code&gt;, a simple example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;struct ShapeStub: Shape { var interpreter: Interpreter var instance: CustomInstance var layoutDirectionBehavior: LayoutDirectionBehavior { instance.instanceMemberProperty("layoutDirectionBehavior", interpreter: interpreter).layoutDirectionBehaviorValue } func path(in rect: CGRect) -&amp;gt; Path { let arguments = [Argument(label: "in", value: rect)] return instance.instanceFunction("path", arguments: arguments, interpreter: interpreter).pathValue } }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coming back to &lt;code&gt;View&lt;/code&gt;, this works the same way, with a little extra complexity because of the associated type that we have to type erase:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;struct ViewStub: View { var interpreter: Interpreter var instance: CustomInstance var body: AnyView { instance.instanceMemberProperty("body", interpreter: interpreter).viewValue .map { AnyView($0) } } }&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And now we can make views that have dynamic implementations!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s a broad survey of how the interpreter is implemented. If you want to try it out in practice, download Bitrig!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there’s more you want to know about the interpreter, or Bitrig as a whole, let us know!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;■ opacity of the eye lens&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;■ narrowing of the visual field&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;■ high-frequency hearing loss&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;■ head mobility restrictions&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;■ joint stiffness&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;■ loss of strength&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h4"&gt;GERT for only 1390,‑ / £ 1250,-&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;complete as pictured, plus shipping and VAT if applicable&lt;lb/&gt; New: now with 2 pairs of glasses instead of the model shown&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Due to the significant increase in the time and effort required to process orders, in particular as a result of incomplete or incorrect information provided with orders, and the fact that we increasingly have to send reminders for invoices for smaller amounts, we can only accept orders with a value of at least 300 euros or pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Customer reviews:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The quality is great and it works how it is supposed to. Im happy with my purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Great way to teach about elderly behavior. Ive been using this suit for a while now and its very durable and easy to use. Thanks!!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;A PM's Guide to AI Agent Architecture: Why Capability Doesn't Equal Adoption&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;A complete guide to agent architecture, orchestration patterns, trust strategies, and adoption plans for PMs building AI agents.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last week, I was talking to a PM who'd in the recent months shipped their AI agent. The metrics looked great: 89% accuracy, sub-second respond times, positive user feedback in surveys. But users were abandoning the agent after their first real problem, like a user with both a billing dispute and a locked account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;"Our agent could handle routine requests perfectly, but when faced with complex issues, users would try once, get frustrated, and immediately ask for a human."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This pattern is observed across every product team that focuses on making their agents "smarter" when the real challenge is making architectural decisions that shape how users experience and begin to trust the agent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this post, I'm going to walk you through the different layers of AI agent architecture. How your product decisions determine whether users trust your agent or abandon it. By the end of this, you'll understand why some agents feel "magical" while others feel "frustrating" and more importantly, how PMs should architect for the magical experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We'll use a concrete customer support agent example throughout, so you can see exactly how each architectural choice plays out in practice. We’ll also see why the counterintuitive approach to trust (hint: it's not about being right more often) actually works better for user adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Let's say you're building a customer support agent&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You're the PM building an agent that helps users with account issues - password resets, billing questions, plan changes. Seems straightforward, right?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But when a user says "I can't access my account and my subscription seems wrong" what should happen?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scenario A: Your agent immediately starts checking systems. It looks up the account, identifies that the password was reset yesterday but the email never arrived, discovers a billing issue that downgraded the plan, explains exactly what happened, and offers to fix both issues with one click.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scenario B: Your agent asks clarifying questions. "When did you last successfully log in? What error message do you see? Can you tell me more about the subscription issue?" After gathering info, it says "Let me escalate you to a human who can check your account and billing."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same user request. Same underlying systems. Completely different products.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Four Layers Where Your Product Decisions Live&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think of agent architecture like a stack where each layer represents a product decision you have to make.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Layer 1: Context &amp;amp; Memory (What does your agent remember?)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Decision: How much should your agent remember, and for how long?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn't just technical storage - it's about creating the illusion of understanding. Your agent's memory determines whether it feels like talking to a robot or a knowledgeable colleague.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our support agent: Do you store just the current conversation, or the customer's entire support history? Their product usage patterns? Previous complaints?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Types of memory to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Session memory: Current conversation ("You mentioned billing issues earlier...")&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Customer memory: Past interactions across sessions ("Last month you had a similar issue with...")&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Behavioral memory: Usage patterns ("I notice you typically use our mobile app...")&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Contextual memory: Current account state, active subscriptions, recent activity&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The more your agent remembers, the more it can anticipate needs rather than just react to questions. Each layer of memory makes responses more intelligent but increases complexity and cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Layer 2: Data &amp;amp; Integration (How deep do you go?)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Decision: Which systems should your agent connect to, and what level of access should it have?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deeper your agent connects to user workflows and existing systems, the harder it becomes for users to switch. This layer determines whether you're a tool or a platform.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our support agent: Should it integrate with just your Stripe’s billing system, or also your Salesforce CRM, ZenDesk ticketing system , user database, and audit logs? Each integration makes the agent more useful but also creates more potential failure points - think API rate limits, authentication challenges, and system downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's what's interesting - Most of us get stuck trying to integrate with everything at once. But the most successful agents started with just 2-3 key integrations and added more based on what users actually asked for.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Layer 3: Skills &amp;amp; Capabilities (What makes you different?)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Decision: Which specific capabilities should your agent have, and how deep should they go?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your skills layer is where you win or lose against competitors. It's not about having the most features - it's about having the right capabilities that create user dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our support agent: Should it only read account information, or should it also modify billing, reset passwords, and change plan settings? Each additional skill increases user value but also increases complexity and risk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implementation note: Tools like MCP (Model Context Protocol) are making it much easier to build and share skills across different agents, rather than rebuilding capabilities from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;Layer 4: Evaluation &amp;amp; Trust (How do users know what to expect?)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Decision: How do you measure success and communicate agent limitations to users?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This layer determines whether users develop confidence in your agent or abandon it after the first mistake. It's not just about being accurate - it's about being trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our support agent: Do you show confidence scores ("I'm 85% confident this will fix your issue")? Do you explain your reasoning ("I checked three systems and found...")? Do you always confirm before taking actions ("Should I reset your password now?")? Each choice affects how users perceive reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trust strategies to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Confidence indicators: "I'm confident about your account status, but let me double-check the billing details"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reasoning transparency: "I found two failed login attempts and an expired payment method"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Graceful boundaries: "This looks like a complex billing issue - let me connect you with our billing specialist who has access to more tools"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Confirmation patterns: When to ask permission vs. when to act and explain&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The counterintuitive insight: users trust agents more when they admit uncertainty than when they confidently make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;So how do you actually architect an agent?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, so you understand the layers. Now comes the practical question that every PM asks: "How do I actually implement this? How does the agent talk to the skills? How do skills access data? How does evaluation happen while users are waiting?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your orchestration choice determines everything about your development experience, your debugging process, and your ability to iterate quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lets walk through the main approaches, and I'll be honest about when each one works and when it becomes a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;1. Single-Agent Architecture (Start Here)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Everything happens in one agent's context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our support agent: When the user says "I can't access my account," one agent handles it all - checking account status, identifying billing issues, explaining what happened, offering solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why this works: Simple to build, easy to debug, predictable costs. You know exactly what your agent can and can't do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why it doesn't: Can get expensive with complex requests since you're loading full context every time. Hard to optimize specific parts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Most teams start here, and honestly, many never need to move beyond it. If you're debating between this and something more complex, start here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;2. Skill-Based Architecture (When You Need Efficiency)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have a router that figures out what the user needs, then hands off to specialized skills.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our support agent: Router realizes this is an account access issue and routes to the `LoginSkill`. If the LoginSkill discovers it's actually a billing problem, it hands off to `BillingSkill`.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Real example flow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;User: "I can't log in"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Router → LoginSkill&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;LoginSkill checks: Account exists ✓, Password correct ✗, Billing status... wait, subscription expired&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;LoginSkill → BillingSkill: "Handle expired subscription for user123"&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;BillingSkill handles renewal process&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why this works: More efficient - you can use cheaper models for simple skills, expensive models for complex reasoning. Each skill can be optimized independently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why it doesn't: Coordination between skills gets tricky fast. Who decides when to hand off? How do skills share context?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here's where MCP really helps - it standardizes how skills expose their capabilities, so your router knows what each skill can do without manually maintaining that mapping.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;3. Workflow-Based Architecture (Enterprise Favorite)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You predefine step-by-step processes for common scenarios. Think LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, N8N, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our support agent: "Account access problem" triggers a workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Check account status&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If locked, check failed login attempts&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If too many failures, check billing status&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If billing issue, route to payment recovery&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If not billing, route to password reset&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why this works: Everything is predictable and auditable. Perfect for compliance-heavy industries. Easy to optimize each step.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why it doesn't: When users have weird edge cases that don't fit your predefined workflows, you're stuck. Feels rigid to users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;4. Collaborative Architecture (The Future?)&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiple specialized agents work together using A2A (agent-to-agent) protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The vision: Your agent discovers that another company's agent can help with issues, automatically establishes a secure connection, and collaborates to solve the customer's problem. Think a booking.com agent interacting with an American Airlines agent!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For our support agent: `AuthenticationAgent` handles login issues, `BillingAgent` handles payment problems, `CommunicationAgent` manages user interaction. They coordinate through standardized protocols to solve complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reality check: This sounds amazing but introduces complexity around security, billing, trust, and reliability that most companies aren't ready for. We're still figuring out the standards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This can produce amazing results for sophisticated scenarios, but debugging multi-agent conversations is genuinely hard. When something goes wrong, figuring out which agent made the mistake and why is like detective work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's the thing: start simple. Single-agent architecture handles way more use cases than you think. Add complexity only when you hit real limitations, not imaginary ones.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But here's what's interesting - even with the perfect architecture, your agent can still fail if users don't trust it. That brings us to the most counterintuitive lesson about building agents.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The trust thing that everyone gets wrong&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here's something counterintuitive: Users don't trust agents that are right all the time. They trust agents that are honest about when they might be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Think about it from the user's perspective. Your support agent confidently says "I've reset your password and updated your billing address." User thinks "great!" Then they try to log in and... it doesn't work. Now they don't just have a technical problem - they have a trust problem.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compare that to an agent that says "I think I found the issue with your account. I'm 80% confident this will fix it. I'm going to reset your password and update your billing address. If this doesn't work, I'll immediately escalate to a human who can dive deeper."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Same technical capability. Completely different user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building trusted agents requires focus on three things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Confidence calibration: When your agent says it's 60% confident, it should be right about 60% of the time. Not 90%, not 30%. Actual 60%.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reasoning transparency: Users want to see the agent's work. "I checked your account status (active), billing history (payment failed yesterday), and login attempts (locked after 3 failed attempts). The issue seems to be..."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Graceful escalation: When your agent hits its limits, how does it hand off? A smooth transition to a human with full context is much better than "I can't help with that."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A lot of times we obsess over making agents more accurate, when what users actually want was more transparency about the agent's limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What's Coming Next&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Part 2, I'll dive deeper into the autonomy decisions that keep most PMs up at night. How much independence should you give your agent? When should it ask for permission vs forgiveness? How do you balance automation with user control?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We'll also walk through the governance concerns that actually matter in practice - not just theoretical security issues, but the real implementation challenges that can make or break your launch timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Saquon Barkley calls me, but he’s distracted. In the background, two little voices shout “Bye, friends!” as Barkley wrangles his kids, Jada, 7, and Saquon Jr., 3, into the car. He apologizes, then explains they’re headed to an Old Spice photo shoot tied to his latest endorsement — a Saquon-branded shampoo and conditioner called “Saquon Soar.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a cinematic image: one of the NFL’s biggest stars juggling dad duty and the demands of a sponsorship. But Barkley isn’t content to just cash checks and smile for the camera. He has always treated these deals as building blocks for the empire he’s determined to build before football ends. And he knows it could all end suddenly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From the moment he entered the NFL in 2018, Barkley carried a kind of financial paranoia that most athletes don’t confront until retirement. He parked his entire $31.2 million rookie contract into long-term investments like the S&amp;amp;P 500, vowing to live only off endorsements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2021, he went further, backing payments app Strike as his first startup investment and pledging to take all marketing income in Bitcoin through the platform. At the time, Bitcoin’s price was approximately $32,000. Today, it’s hovering around $111,000, turning a $10 million income stream into a $35 million asset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That move rattled more than a few people. “Good old American dollars should be the standard,” superagent Leigh Steinberg warned, cautioning athletes against chasing crypto volatility.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barkley heard the critics, but he doubled down. Sitting on cash, he argued, isn’t enough — not when most athletes earn the bulk of their money in their 20s and face inflation, poor financial literacy, and limited access to tools. “A sad yet common reality is many enter bankruptcy later on,” he wrote on X. “We can do better.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His drive isn’t just financial. Barkley has the career most players dream about, but those closest to him say that his humility is born out of a gnawing sense that it could all slip away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Barkley, equity is a safeguard — a way to wrest back control from the injuries, draft picks, or franchise decisions that can derail a career overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Football is fragile, while investing gives him a different relationship to risk. It may be volatile, but it’s a risk he can shape. Guided by business manager Ken Katz, he has avoided the typical athlete playbook of podcasts and clothing lines, instead building a portfolio that looks more like an elite venture fund than a celebrity brand.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After reading Peter Thiel’s Zero to One, Barkley was most inspired by the idea of getting ahead by betting on businesses that create something so original that competition becomes irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Profile has exclusively learned that Barkley has invested a portion of his earnings so far — a mix of his rookie contract and endorsement income — across more than 10 private startups, typically writing checks between $250,000 and $500,000.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The high-growth startups in his portfolio include Anthropic (currently valued at $183 billion), Anduril ($30.5 billion), Ramp ($22.5 billion), Cognition ($9.8 billion), Neuralink ($9 billion), Strike (~$1 billion), and Polymarket (~$1 billion). He’s also a limited partner in funds including Founders Fund, Thrive Capital, Silver Point Capital, and Multicoin Capital.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some of those bets have already appreciated dramatically: Strike, for example, has delivered a 10x return in value since his investment. Barkley has also allocated a portion of his wealth into steadier assets like index funds and real estate, hedging the volatility that comes with venture and crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike peers LeBron James and Serena Williams, who command headlines with splashy business ventures, Barkley’s approach is leaner and more surgical. He is making selective bets on technology companies that he believes are creating lasting value for their users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The question is whether his bets will hold. Venture investing is inherently risky — even late-stage startups with multibillion-dollar valuations can falter or see their valuations slashed when markets turn. To date, none of Barkley’s investments have flamed out or depreciated, largely because he prefers to come in at later stages of a company’s growth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the end, Barkley must confront the question: Is he building something that lasts, or simply trading one kind of risk for another?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For more longform profiles of extraordinary people, make sure to sign up for The Profile here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A few days before Thanksgiving last year, Ramp CEO Eric Glyman glanced at his phone and did a double take. His colleague Sam Buck had texted that Saquon Barkley wanted to invest in the expense management startup. Glyman was stunned. Most athletes ask for cash in exchange for an endorsement. Barkley wanted equity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The best player in the NFL wants to work with us,” Glyman remembers thinking. “Like, what? What’s happening?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barkley, who came in when Ramp was valued at $7 billion, didn’t just write a check. Convinced by Ramp’s mission to help businesses cut costs and perform more efficiently, he tied his own fortunes to the company’s — and then went to work to make sure it paid off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the 2025 Super Bowl, Barkley starred in a Ramp commercial: a 15-second spot of him, in full pads, drowning in paperwork before Ramp’s automation saves the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ad aired as the Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs, and Barkley set a new single-season rushing yards record for regular season and playoffs combined. For Ramp, it became their biggest traffic day ever. For Barkley, it was one of the rare times an endorsement literally boosted his own net worth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That was by design. Barkley’s process usually begins with his business manager, Ken Katz, reaching out to a company. Their strategy is to target technology companies and source deals through trusted word-of-mouth referrals in Katz’s investor network. The founder then gets invited to dinner with Barkley, where the running back plays interrogator.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s about asking them what they stand for, what their mission is, why they think they’ll be successful,” Barkley tells me. “They have to be confident, but arrogance is a turn-off.” If he’s interested, he often gives a verbal commitment on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sam Buck, Ramp’s head of financial institutions, insists Barkley was never treated like a celebrity mascot. “It was like, ‘Hey, you’re on the cap table now,’” he says. “We’re going to hold you accountable — just like we do with Founders Fund or General Catalyst — to help us grow.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And Barkley delivered. He FaceTimed Ramp partners to help close deals. He joined customer meet-and-greets. He talked about the company any chance he got.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fresh off the Super Bowl, he appeared on the TODAY show, still buzzing from the win. He fielded questions about being a champion, about his family, about life off the field. Then TODAY co-host Savannah Guthrie pivoted. “You have your own Super Bowl commercial, by the way, for Ramp, where you’re an investor,” she said. “So tell me how all this came about.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barkley didn’t miss a beat. He turned the moment into a plug for his investment: “I fell in love with the team of Ramp … You get a lot of athletes who get involved with brands, and you get a certain dollar to show up and do things. But … as this company grows, I get to grow with it — it takes it to a whole new level for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The strategy is working. Barkley invested $500,000 into Ramp at a $7 billion valuation. The company’s valuation has more than tripled since then, which means his stake is now worth roughly $1.5 million. Earlier this year, Ramp announced $700 million in annualized revenue. “We’re growing faster this year than last year,” Glyman says, “and I don’t think it’s unrelated that Saquon has been involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Barkley’s commitment also shows up in less public settings. In May, he flew to a Founders Fund symposium in Montana, an event filled with billionaires, CEOs, and top investors. He spent the day listening and networking, before catching a red-eye back to Philadelphia for a morning speaking obligation. Within hours, he was on a return flight to Montana. After another full day at the symposium, he boarded a midnight flight to make it to his daughter’s soccer game the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Longtime venture investor Brian Singerman noticed his dedication to building meaningful relationships. “That stuff is impossible to fake,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even so, Barkley isn’t blind to the trade-offs. For someone intent on building generational wealth, venture capital represents both the biggest swing and the biggest vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Honestly, putting your money in the S&amp;amp;P is going to beat 90% of venture capital,” says Singerman, who is one of Barkley’s advisers. “But that last 10% is going to crush the S&amp;amp;P.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This version of Barkley — the investor, the owner — didn’t come naturally. He didn’t grow up with stock tips or startup dinners. His financial philosophy was shaped by something starker: watching what happens when the money runs out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When Barkley tells me about growing up in the Bronx, he chooses his words carefully. He had a loving family, he says, and doesn’t remember feeling the financial instability, at least not consciously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But to understand his obsession with money, risk, and generational wealth, you have to start with his parents. Tonya and Alibay were both born in the Bronx and raised five children together.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2001, when Saquon was four, the family left for Pennsylvania. Over the years, Tonya developed a motto she repeated often: “All things are possible.” She believed it because she had lived it, navigating crises that could have broken the family but didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of those crises came when Barkley was in elementary school. The family was evicted and spent eight months without a home. The shelter system wouldn’t take fathers, so they were split up. Barkley and his sister went to live with a family friend while his parents scrambled to rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Financially, we obviously struggled, but my mom and dad never made us feel that,” he says. “It wasn’t like we were on the streets. We had family and friends who took us in, but [the experience] did give me the perspective I have on life right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His father carries his own formative scar. A gifted boxer, Alibay had made it to the semifinals of the 1992 New York State Golden Gloves before his shoulder gave out. He couldn’t afford surgery. At 21, he quit — not by choice but by circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I never had the money to get it fixed,” he says. The missed chance haunted him, and it became the lesson he drilled into his children: never quit on your passion. “If you quit this, it will be easy to quit jobs, quit relationships, quit on your kids,” he says. “That’s probably why Saquon is so adamant when he gets hurt about still being in there.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That “never quit” mantra became Barkley’s compass. At 13, frustrated in school and doubting football, he thought about walking away. His father told him the boxing story again. It stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From then on, Barkley zeroed in. He would play football, and he would become great.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Growing up, he had flashes of being great, but there was always someone in front of him,” says childhood friend Nick Shafnisky. “He was never going to let someone say he wasn’t the best.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Penn State, Barkley fulfilled that prophecy, boasting 3,843 rushing yards and 43 touchdowns in three seasons. Head coach James Franklin drilled players with one message: “Use football to build generational wealth. Don’t let football use you.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Barkley took it to heart. One night, Franklin overheard his wife on a call talking about real estate. He showered, brushed his teeth, and got into bed, and she was still on the phone. When she finally hung up, he asked who it was. “It’s Saquon,” she told him.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He was working on his first real estate investment and wanted to understand how to structure the deal and spot potential red flags. “I think curiosity is a really important trait in successful people, and Saquon is very curious,” Franklin tells me.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His questions about money and wealth went from theoretical to real when the New York Giants drafted Barkley second overall in the 2018 NFL Draft and handed him a $31 million rookie contract. He delivered immediately: 1,300 rushing yards, 91 receptions, Rookie of the Year, Pro Bowl. The dream was intact — until it wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Week 2 of the 2020 season, against the Chicago Bears, Barkley was tackled awkwardly near the sideline. He clutched his knee and was carted off the field. The diagnosis? A torn ACL, partially torn meniscus, and an MCL strain. It was a devastating cocktail of injuries. “I definitely had some dark moments during that time,” Barkley says. “I had those moments of, ‘Man, why me?’”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether Barkley realized it or not, it was his father’s nightmare revisited: one injury, one twist, and everything could vanish. At Katz’s suggestion, Barkley watched Peter Thiel’s “Competition Is for Losers” lecture at Stanford and read his book Zero to One, both of which left an impression. Thiel’s argument — that the biggest returns come from a few breakthrough bets — resonated. Football suddenly felt fragile, and investing began to feel urgent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His return to the NFL was shaky. In 2021, after months of rehab, he sprained his ankle early in the season and stumbled to a career-low 593 rushing yards. Friends say he wasn’t himself. His mom reminded him: “No matter what, you can always get back up.” He did. By 2022, Barkley was back at 1,300 yards and another Pro Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it was no longer possible to ignore the reality that his body and career were vulnerable. The Giants reminded him of that in 2023 when they slapped him with the “franchise tag.” It was a one-year deal — not the long-term contract he had earned. To Barkley, it was a gut punch. Even after proving himself, he was treated as expendable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It was a very contentious situation,” says former NFL defensive great J.J. Watt. “[Barkley] was the star of [the Giants], and they basically kicked him out the door.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Publicly, Barkley stayed composed. Privately, the rejection lit a fire. Running backs have the shortest shelf life in the league, but his bigger worry was what comes after. Approximately 78% of NFL players face financial distress within two years of retiring, and he was determined not to be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By then, he had already built a portfolio and a mindset beyond football. In 2024, Barkley left the Giants for a three-year, $37.75 million deal with the Philadelphia Eagles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a declaration that he knew his value, and he wasn’t going to sign a deal that didn’t reflect it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In February 2025, confetti rained down on the Philadelphia Eagles after they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl. Barkley had delivered — a standout game, a title, and the biggest win of his career on his 28th birthday. “I don’t think anything is going to top this,” he said on the field moments after the final whistle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That night, Barkley threw an afterparty at St. Pizza in New Orleans. The guest list was surreal, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Pete Davidson, Zac Efron, and Chance the Rapper. But scattered among the celebrities was a quieter, more unexpected group: the founders of Barkley’s portfolio companies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jack Mallers, CEO of Strike, was one of them. “I felt bad for him,” Mallers says. “Even though he had just won the Super Bowl and it was his birthday, it felt like he was still working. He took a photo with everyone. Answered every question. Asked the founders how business was going. It was unbelievable.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mallers first met Barkley through an email from business manager Ken Katz with the subject line: Saquon Barkley loves Bitcoin. “It felt like a scam,” Mallers laughs. But after dinner with Barkley, he realized the interest was real and gave him a spot in Strike’s $100 million round. Barkley invested $100,000, and today the company is reportedly valued at over $1 billion, marking a 10x return on his stake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That deal forged a deep relationship. Since they met, Barkley and Mallers have spent hours debating Bitcoin as a store of value. In 2021, Barkley went all in on the digital currency, announcing he would convert 100% of his endorsement income — Nike, Pepsi, Visa, Dunkin’ — into Bitcoin using Strike.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The move was yet another example of Barkley using his platform to amplify a company in which he has equity. “The average NFL career is 3 years and inflation is real,” he tweeted. “Saving and preserving money over time is hard… Bitcoin is a proven, safe, global, and open system that allows anyone to save money.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crypto executives hailed his entrance into the world of Bitcoin. “He’s setting a blueprint for athletes to take charge of their financial future,” says Coinbase president Emilie Choi. But traditional advisers recoiled. “The value of Bitcoin is much more volatile than the value of the U.S. dollar,” one financial planner warned in an op-ed. “How would you feel if your hypothetical Bitcoin paycheck was worth 10% less the day after it was deposited into your account?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a while, Barkley looked prescient as his holdings appreciated in value. Mallers even joked, “My goal was to help him earn more through Bitcoin and Strike than he would in the NFL. And I think he will.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But then came the crash. Famed crypto exchange FTX collapsed near the end of 2022, its founder was accused of fraud, and Bitcoin’s price plunged below $16,000 — more than 50% below the level at which Barkley had invested.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As he scrolled through the taunts on social media, Barkley picked up the phone and called Katz, asking the question on everyone’s mind: “What is going on?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Katz told him to hold, and Barkley did. When I ask about embracing risk in that moment, he likens it to football: one week you’re celebrated, the next you’re vilified. Volatility, he says, is temporary.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That discipline is rooted in his partnership with Katz. The two met when Barkley was still at Penn State and Katz was 24, hustling to break into sports management. A decade later, Katz is still his consigliere who pushes him to think like a contrarian.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Katz has consistently advised Barkley to use his influence to win deals. “My thesis has always been: Use the fame to get equity in the companies of the best founders in the world,” Katz says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The result is an unusually hands-on approach. Barkley keeps his circle small: just Katz, his financial adviser, and the founders he backs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compare that to NBA star Kevin Durant, whose investment firm 35V operates with more institutional rigor and a tilt toward safer asset classes like private equity and real estate. “You’re still getting ownership, but it’s just not as risky as venture,” says co-founder Rich Kleiman.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Durant’s portfolio spans more than 100 companies, Barkley approaches investing with the focus of a rogue founder. He doesn’t have a fund structure, and he doesn’t neatly follow a playbook. He makes direct bets on companies that excite him. The strategy is lean, contrarian, and far more exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That ethos resonates with Russell Okung, the first NFL player to take part of his salary in Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;His advice for Barkley? “You’re not an athlete-investor, you’re an investor who allocates your time playing sports. The old model extracted value from athletes. The new model lets athletes extract value from everything else.” He adds, “Why be talent when you can be management? The cap table is where real wealth lives. It's where upside multiplies.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a mindset Barkley has adopted fully, though it comes with a healthy dose of risk. Where most of us see volatility as a warning sign, he recognizes it as something familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Growing up without a safety net taught him that uncertainty can be an opening. “I’m not going to just jump into a pool of sharks,” he says, “but I do have a little bit of: ‘I don’t give a you-know-what.’”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two days before the NFL draft, Barkley became a father. His daughter, Jada, arrived before the cameras and before the multimillion-dollar contract.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He remembers looking into her eyes and seeing the future flash before his. In that moment, he realized he wasn’t just building for himself anymore. He was building a world she could inherit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I was 21 when she was born,” he says, as Jada chatters in the car beside him. “I have a different dynamic with my kids than my parents had with me because I want to teach them how to be more financially literate. I’m still trying my best to learn, but as I learn, they’ll learn too.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To Barkley, investing is about one thing: control. He is trying to manufacture permanence while playing a game defined by uncertainty. His ultimate driver, he says, is his family: his fiancée, Anna, and his kids. “If you had asked me this question two years ago, then my answer would’ve been, ‘I want to be the best football player,’ but it’s not about just that anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That shift is born out of urgency. Football is the most clock-driven sport, and his position is the most precarious. Does he feel the same countdown in his own career?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s funny you ask me that,” Barkley says. “Because that’s something that was on my mind this morning. I was just thinking about how I can only play for so long, so I really gotta take advantage, keep investing, and create wealth for me and my family.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He knows the day is coming when his body will tell him the game is over. But when his children ask what he built, he doesn’t only want to point to highlight reels or rushing titles. He wants to point to ownership — proof that he wrestled fragility into permanence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is the paradox of Saquon Barkley: a man willing to gamble with risk in his life so that his kids never have to feel the sharp edge of uncertainty in theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There were many programming languages available for 8-bit computers, the most common being BASIC and Assembly Language, but there were also other lesser-used languages such as Logo, Forth, and Pilot. The languages that would go on to dominate 16-bit computing, C and Pascal, were also available but were usually severely limited. An 8-bit computer generally did not have enough horsepower to run those more complex language compilers1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 1983 Optimized Systems Software (OSS) was renown in the Atari world for its great updated versions of DOS (DOS XL), BASIC (BASIC XL/XE) and assembler (MAC/65), so it was no surprise that they were the ones to introduce a new language, Action!, into the Atari market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Created by Clinton Parker, Action! was an all-new compiled language that was designed and optimized for the 8-bit 6502 CPU. It was a 16K cartridge2 and had everything you need integrated into one package: the monitor, compiler, text editor and debugger3. In some ways, Action! was the first IDE (integrated development environment) for an 8-bit computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Back in the 80s I never used Action! and instead mostly used BASIC and OSS BASIC XE for my programming. I did like reading Action! program listings in magazines, though. But I now have the Action! cartridge and just recently acquired an Action! user manual, so I felt it was time to take a closer look at this amazing software development tool.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Packaging&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The version of Action! that I now have is the classic orange cartridge, paired with a small 3-ring yellow binder containing the documentation. Action! was also available in the yellow label cartridge and its manual was also in a larger binder and then later, perfect bound (like the BASIC XL and BASIC XE manuals I have). Having the manual in a binder would have certainly been more useful in the 80s when you had to refer to it frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Action! retailed for $99 in 1983 (about $320 in 2025) and was only available for the Atari 8-bit computers. Early advertisements indicated there would be forthcoming versions for the Apple II and Commodore 64, but those never materialized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Manual&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The manual is just under 220 pages and is concise, but reasonable well-written. There is not a ton of sample code and it doesn’t try to teach too many concepts. To get the most of it, you really already need to know how to program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I had been looking for an actual Action! manual for years, but the ones I’d seen on eBay had always been prohibitively expensive. Luckily I found one last month for just $30 and snagged it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t need a physical manual, of course. An updated manual is available online in several places, and here’s the PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Editor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The editor really was a wonder for its time. It is a full-screen text editor that can scroll to the right as the line of text you type becomes longer than the 40 characters of an Atari screen. That was an unusual feature for the time, but was necessary because it allowed the indentation, encouraged by Action!’s structured programming style, to remain easy to read.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The editor can copy and paste text, another somewhat new feature for Atari text editors in 1983, has the ability to tag lines to jump to them rapidly and it also has a split screen mode that let you show two files (or two parts of the same file) on the screen at once. At first this might seem silly considering the small size of the screen, but this was revolutionary for the time. Normally to look at another file, you’d have to open it, losing the file you were working on, and then reload the original file. It was tedious and was a reason why you would print your programs back then.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even looking at different parts of a file could be a pain because you’d just be scrolling all over the place, which was not always fast or easy in many text editors. This was even worse with something like BASIC, which required you to LIST line ranges to see parts of your program.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To exit the editor, you press Control+Shift+M which takes you to the monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Monitor&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today this would be called the shell, but it is essentially the command line interface for the entire system. From the monitor, you can switch to the editor, compile, trace code, look at memory and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Language&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Action! is a structured, procedural programming language. It is similar to both C and Pascal, although not quite as advanced as either of them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has the usual commands for looping, if-then-else, but it does not have anything like a switch or Case statement. There are also only three data types: BYTE, CARD and INT. Strings were essentially just BYTE arrays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I found it endearing that to end an IF block you used FI (IF spelled backwards) and to end a DO block you used OD. That is some interesting symmetry although I’m not really sure it helps readability.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An Action! “Hello World” program would be this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;PROC hello()
; This is a comment.
  DO
    PrintE("Goto 10")
  OD
RETURN&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Compiler&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Action! language may not have been as advanced as C or Pascal, but because it was designed with the 6502 CPU in mind, compiling the language was astonishingly fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The original Atari Pascal system from APX needed multiple disk drives and could take several minutes to compile a small program. The only C package available in 1983 (Deep Blue C) was at least as limited as Action!, but also not an integrated package and compiled slowly. Draper Pascal only compiled to pseudo-code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Action! compiled your program to machine code in memory and in seconds. Typing C (to compile) and then R (to run) was hardly slower than just typing RUN in BASIC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It really is stupidly fast. Here’s the output from the above program:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there is a compile error, it is shown on the screen and will be highlighted when you switch back to the editor by typing “e”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Limitations&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Action! was not perfect and it had several limitations. In my opinion, the two biggest limitations were that that Action! cartridge was required to run Action! programs (because they depended on the library that was included the cartridge ROM) and that there was no floating point data type.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both of these did get solved, to some extent, with the purchase of an additional add-ons: Action! RunTime and Action! Toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Action! RunTime&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RunTime package provided the ability to create stand-alone Action! programs that you could distribute to others to run without the cartridge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RunTime included the library as source files that you could include at the beginning of your own programs so that everything that was needed to run would get compiled into a single executable program. From what I can tell, Action! had no concept of linking which is how something like C would have handled this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t have an official Action! RunTime disk, but the image is readily available online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Action! ToolKit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ToolKit is essentially an enhanced Library with additional functions and features. Two notable things it adds are player/missile graphics support and some support for floating-point numbers via several “Real” functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this floating point support is somewhat limited and it doesn’t look all that useful to me. For example, I’ve used the Archimedes Spiral program in some articles here on Goto 10 to demonstrate drawing a fun graphic on the screen. It is interesting to see how long it can take to do the drawing on an 8-bit computer. I’d love to port it to Action!, and I was hopeful I’d be able to do so with the Action! ToolKit. Alas, even though it does add some commands to do some floating-point math, it does not add any trigonometry functions. The lack of Sin and Cos make it impractical to port Archimedes Spiral4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don’t have an official Action! ToolKit disk, but the image is readily available online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Usage&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It seems that Action! was mostly use by hobbyists, public domain and magazine software. The only two known commercial product made with Action! were the HomePak5 productivity package by Russ Wetmore and the Games Computers Play online service.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the above screen shots, I was using Action! with my 130XE.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I plan to dig into actually using Action! itself more in the coming months. It really looks like a fun language. Unfortunately, since Action! is a cartridge, I can’t use it directly with my Side3 cart. There are disk-based versions of Action! available at AtariWiki, so I may have to switch to one of those, or see if I can get one of the SuperCart images to work with Side3. Otherwise, I may try it old-school with SpartaDOS, my trusty 1050 disk drive and a RAM disk.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Other References&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AtariWiki has a create page with lots of links to Action!-related materials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Action! Archive is a great reference for Action! programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about how to program in Action!, be sure to check out David Arlington’s YouTube channel, which has a 25-part series on Action! programming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kyan Pascal was released in 1986 and worked pretty well, but really wanted a couple disk drives. LightSpeed C was also a decent version of C that debuted later in the 80s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually an OSS SuperCartridge, which had 16K of ROM but only used 8K of address space in the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Calling it a debugger might be a bit of stretch compared to modern tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sure, I could probably implement my own version of those, but I don’t really want to.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HomePak was an integrated productivity package with a highly regarded terminal program, a slick word processor with not much free RAM for text (perhaps 5 pages) and an usual database. HomePak warrants its own article.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Classic 8Ã8-pixel B&amp;amp;W Mac patterns&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I made a website for the original classic Mac patterns&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was working on something and thought it would be fun to use one of the classic Mac black-and-white patterns in the project. I'm talking about the original 8Ã8-pixel ones that were in the original Control Panel for setting the desktop background and in MacPaint as fill patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Screenshots via to Marcin's awesome interactive history&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I figured there'd must be clean, pixel-perfect GIFs or PNGs of them somewhere on the web. And perhaps there are, but after poking around a bit, I ran out of energy for that, but by then had a head of steam for extracting the patterns en masse from the original source, somehow. Then I could produce whatever format I needed for them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are 38 patterns, introduced in the original System 1.0 in the 1984 debut of the Macintosh. They were unchanged in later versions, so I decided to get them from a System 6 disk, since that's a little easier with access to utility programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Preparation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download Mini vMac.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Acquire "old world" Mac ROMs.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download a System 6 startup disk image.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download ExportFl disk image.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Download sitPack disk image.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install "The Unarchiver" (&lt;code&gt;brew install --cask the-unarchiver&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install the Xcode command-line tools.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Extraction process&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start System 6 (drag the ROM onto the Mini vMac icon, then drag the System 6 disk onto the window when you see the flashing floppy disk). Mount the ExportFl and sitPack disks by dragging their files and dropping on the classic Mac desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;In emulation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Double-click sitPack to launch the program. Command-O to open, then navigate to the startup disk by clicking "Drive". Scroll to find "System Folder" and double-click on it. Scroll to the bottom, select "System" and click "Open". Save the output file as "System.sit" in the top-level of the startup disk. Quit sitPack back to the Finder.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start the ExportFl program. Command-O or pick "Open" from the "File" menu. Find the "System.sit" created in the last step and click "Open". A regular file save dialog will appear on the modern Mac, pick a location and save the file.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;On the modern Mac&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Drag the "System.sit" file onto The Unarchiver, or open the file from within it. This will produce a file called "System" (with no extension).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Run DeRez (part of the Xcode developer command-line tools) on the System file. I first added &lt;code&gt;/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt; to my &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt;, then
ran:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;$ DeRez -only PAT\# System &amp;gt; patterns.r
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This produces a text representation of the &lt;code&gt;PAT#&lt;/code&gt; resource in the System file.
It's a series of bytes that comprise 38 8Ã8 patterns meant for QuickDraw
commands. There's a leading big-endian unsigned 16-bit number (&lt;code&gt;0026&lt;/code&gt;) to indicate the number of 8-byte patterns to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;data 'PAT#' (0, purgeable) {
	$"0026 FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF DDFF 77FF DDFF"
	$"77FF DD77 DD77 DD77 DD77 AA55 AA55 AA55"
	$"AA55 55FF 55FF 55FF 55FF AAAA AAAA AAAA"
	$"AAAA EEDD BB77 EEDD BB77 8888 8888 8888"
	$"8888 B130 031B D8C0 0C8D 8010 0220 0108"

	$"2271 55A0 4040 550A 0404 2050 8888 8888"
	$"0502 BF00 BFBF B0B0 B0B0 0000 0000 0000"
	$"0000 8000 0800 8000 0800 8800 2200 8800"
	$"2200 8822 8822 8822 8822 AA00 AA00 AA00"
	$"AA00 FF00 FF00 FF00 FF00 1122 4488 1122"
	$"4488 FF00 0000 FF00 0000 0102 0408 1020"
	$"4080 AA00 8000 8800 8000 FF80 8080 8080"
	$"8080 081C 22C1 8001 0204 8814 2241 8800"
	$"AA00 40A0 0000 040A 0000 0384 4830 0C02"
	$"0101 8080 413E 0808 14E3 1020 54AA FF02"
	$"0408 7789 8F8F 7798 F8F8 0008 142A 552A"
	$"1408"
};
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would have been simple enough to parse this text, but I had Claude quickly make a Python program to do so and output them in .pbm format, which is part of the Netpbm image format class. This is a simple image format that is text-based, a '1' or a '0' indicating a black or white pixel in a row and column.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, this subway tile pattern is represented like this in .pbm:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;P1
8 8
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From here, I can generate image files for the patterns in any format and resolution I want, using ImageMagick or similar. It's important when scaling the patterns to use &lt;code&gt;-filter point&lt;/code&gt;, so that ImageMagick doesn't try to interpolate
the pixels it needs to fill in, which would lead to blurry results.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why do all this?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's nostalgic, I have a fondness for these old patterns and the original B&amp;amp;W Mac aesthetic, it reminds me of playing games like Dark Castle and Glider, messing around with HyperCard, and using Tex-Edit and hoarding early shareware programs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The whole point of the above is to get a copy of the System file out with the resource fork intact, that's where the desktop patterns live.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to old classic Mac manuals, the patterns were QuickDraw bit-pattern resources, a simple bitmap of 8 bits per row packed into 8 bytes (columns). It was fast for QuickDraw to copy them over an area of the screen. For example the following pattern was used for the default gray desktop pattern on black-and-white Mac screens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I could have extracted all 38 patterns other ways: I could have screenshotted each one, I could have looked at each one and hand-written .pbm files, both of which would have been tedious and error-prone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I wanted to extract the exact original data from the source (or close enough copy thereof) and have the patterns in a format I considered archival for this limited purpose (.pbm files are trivial to parse and manipulate).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Head over to my pattern site to get the patterns for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Suppose the OpenDocument file format, and specifically the "ODP" OpenDocument Presentation format, were built around SQLite. Benefits would include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note that this is only a thought experiment. We are not suggesting that OpenDocument be changed. Nor is this article a criticism of the current OpenDocument design. The point of this essay is to suggest ways to improve future file format designs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OpenDocument file format is used for office applications: word processors, spreadsheets, and presentations. It was originally designed for the OpenOffice suite but has since been incorporated into other desktop application suites. The OpenOffice application has been forked and renamed a few times. This author's primary use for OpenDocument is building slide presentations with either NeoOffice on Mac, or LibreOffice on Linux and Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An OpenDocument Presentation or "ODP" file is a ZIP archive containing XML files describing presentation slides and separate image files for the various images that are included as part of the presentation. (OpenDocument word processor and spreadsheet files are similarly structured but are not considered by this article.) The reader can easily see the content of an ODP file by using the "zip -l" command. For example, the following is the "zip -l" output from a 49-slide presentation about SQLite from the 2014 SouthEast LinuxFest conference:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;Archive: self2014.odp Length Date Time Name --------- ---------- ----- ---- 47 2014-06-21 12:34 mimetype 0 2014-06-21 12:34 Configurations2/statusbar/ 0 2014-06-21 12:34 Configurations2/accelerator/current.xml 0 2014-06-21 12:34 Configurations2/floater/ 0 2014-06-21 12:34 Configurations2/popupmenu/ 0 2014-06-21 12:34 Configurations2/progressbar/ 0 2014-06-21 12:34 Configurations2/menubar/ 0 2014-06-21 12:34 Configurations2/toolbar/ 0 2014-06-21 12:34 Configurations2/images/Bitmaps/ 54702 2014-06-21 12:34 Pictures/10000000000001F40000018C595A5A3D.png 46269 2014-06-21 12:34 Pictures/100000000000012C000000A8ED96BFD9.png ... 58 other pictures omitted... 13013 2014-06-21 12:34 Pictures/10000000000000EE0000004765E03BA8.png 1005059 2014-06-21 12:34 Pictures/10000000000004760000034223EACEFD.png 211831 2014-06-21 12:34 content.xml 46169 2014-06-21 12:34 styles.xml 1001 2014-06-21 12:34 meta.xml 9291 2014-06-21 12:34 Thumbnails/thumbnail.png 38705 2014-06-21 12:34 Thumbnails/thumbnail.pdf 9664 2014-06-21 12:34 settings.xml 9704 2014-06-21 12:34 META-INF/manifest.xml --------- ------- 10961006 78 files&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ODP ZIP archive contains four different XML files: content.xml, styles.xml, meta.xml, and settings.xml. Those four files define the slide layout, text content, and styling. This particular presentation contains 62 images, ranging from full-screen pictures to tiny icons, each stored as a separate file in the Pictures folder. The "mimetype" file contains a single line of text that says:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.presentation&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The purpose of the other files and folders is presently unknown to the author but is probably not difficult to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of a ZIP archive to encapsulate XML files plus resources is an elegant approach to an application file format. It is clearly superior to a custom binary file format. But using an SQLite database as the container, instead of ZIP, would be more elegant still.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A ZIP archive is basically a key/value database, optimized for the case of write-once/read-many and for a relatively small number of distinct keys (a few hundred to a few thousand) each with a large BLOB as its value. A ZIP archive can be viewed as a "pile-of-files" database. This works, but it has some shortcomings relative to an SQLite database, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incremental update is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is difficult to update individual entries in a ZIP archive. It is especially difficult to update individual entries in a ZIP archive in a way that does not destroy the entire document if the computer loses power and/or crashes in the middle of the update. It is not impossible to do this, but it is sufficiently difficult that nobody actually does it. Instead, whenever the user selects "File/Save", the entire ZIP archive is rewritten. Hence, "File/Save" takes longer than it ought, especially on older hardware. Newer machines are faster, but it is still bothersome that changing a single character in a 50 megabyte presentation causes one to burn through 50 megabytes of the finite write life on the SSD.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Startup is slow.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In keeping with the pile-of-files theme, OpenDocument stores all slide content in a single big XML file named "content.xml". LibreOffice reads and parses this entire file just to display the first slide. LibreOffice also seems to read all images into memory as well, which makes sense seeing as when the user does "File/Save" it is going to have to write them all back out again, even though none of them changed. The net effect is that start-up is slow. Double-clicking an OpenDocument file brings up a progress bar rather than the first slide. This results in a bad user experience. The situation grows ever more annoying as the document size increases.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More memory is required.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because ZIP archives are optimized for storing big chunks of content, they encourage a style of programming where the entire document is read into memory at startup, all editing occurs in memory, then the entire document is written to disk during "File/Save". OpenOffice and its descendants embrace that pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One might argue that it is ok, in this era of multi-gigabyte desktops, to read the entire document into memory. But it is not ok. For one, the amount of memory used far exceeds the (compressed) file size on disk. So a 50MB presentation might take 200MB or more RAM. That still is not a problem if one only edits a single document at a time. But when working on a talk, this author will typically have 10 or 15 different presentations up all at the same time (to facilitate copy/paste of slides from past presentations) and so gigabytes of memory are required. Add in an open web browser or two and a few other desktop apps, and suddenly the disk is whirling and the machine is swapping. And even having just a single document is a problem when working on an inexpensive Chromebook retrofitted with Ubuntu. Using less memory is always better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crash recovery is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The descendants of OpenOffice tend to segfault more often than commercial competitors. Perhaps for this reason, the OpenOffice forks make periodic backups of their in-memory documents so that users do not lose all pending edits when the inevitable application crash does occur. This causes frustrating pauses in the application for the few seconds while each backup is being made. After restarting from a crash, the user is presented with a dialog box that walks them through the recovery process. Managing the crash recovery this way involves lots of extra application logic and is generally an annoyance to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Content is inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One cannot easily view, change, or extract the content of an OpenDocument presentation using generic tools. The only reasonable way to view or edit an OpenDocument document is to open it up using an application that is specifically designed to read or write OpenDocument (read: LibreOffice or one of its cousins). The situation could be worse. One can extract and view individual images (say) from a presentation using just the "zip" archiver tool. But it is not reasonable try to extract the text from a slide. Remember that all content is stored in a single "context.xml" file. That file is XML, so it is a text file. But it is not a text file that can be managed with an ordinary text editor. For the example presentation above, the content.xml file consist of exactly two lines. The first line of the file is just:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&amp;gt;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second line of the file contains 211792 characters of impenetrable XML. Yes, 211792 characters all on one line. This file is a good stress-test for a text editor. Thankfully, the file is not some obscure binary format, but in terms of accessibility, it might as well be written in Klingon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let us suppose that instead of using a ZIP archive to store its files, OpenDocument used a very simple SQLite database with the following single-table schema:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;CREATE TABLE OpenDocTree( filename TEXT PRIMARY KEY, -- Name of file filesize BIGINT, -- Size of file after decompression content BLOB -- Compressed file content );&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For this first experiment, nothing else about the file format is changed. The OpenDocument is still a pile-of-files, only now each file is a row in an SQLite database rather than an entry in a ZIP archive. This simple change does not use the power of a relational database. Even so, this simple change shows some improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, using SQLite in place of ZIP makes the presentation file smaller. Really. One would think that a relational database file would be larger than a ZIP archive, but at least in the case of NeoOffice that is not so. The following is an actual screen-scrape showing the sizes of the same NeoOffice presentation, both in its original ZIP archive format as generated by NeoOffice (self2014.odp), and as repacked as an SQLite database using the SQLAR utility:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;-rw-r--r-- 1 drh staff 10514994 Jun 8 14:32 self2014.odp -rw-r--r-- 1 drh staff 10464256 Jun 8 14:37 self2014.sqlar -rw-r--r-- 1 drh staff 10416644 Jun 8 14:40 zip.odp&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The SQLite database file ("self2014.sqlar") is about a half percent smaller than the equivalent ODP file! How can this be? Apparently the ZIP archive generator logic in NeoOffice is not as efficient as it could be, because when the same pile-of-files is recompressed using the command-line "zip" utility, one gets a file ("zip.odp") that is smaller still, by another half percent, as seen in the third line above. So, a well-written ZIP archive can be slightly smaller than the equivalent SQLite database, as one would expect. But the difference is slight. The key take-away is that an SQLite database is size-competitive with a ZIP archive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The other advantage to using SQLite in place of ZIP is that the document can now be updated incrementally, without risk of corrupting the document if a power loss or other crash occurs in the middle of the update. (Remember that writes to SQLite databases are atomic.) True, all the content is still kept in a single big XML file ("content.xml") which must be completely rewritten if so much as a single character changes. But with SQLite, only that one file needs to change. The other 77 files in the repository can remain unaltered. They do not all have to be rewritten, which in turn makes "File/Save" run much faster and saves wear on SSDs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A pile-of-files encourages content to be stored in a few large chunks. In the case of ODP, there are just four XML files that define the layout of all slides in a presentation. An SQLite database allows storing information in a few large chunks, but SQLite is also adept and efficient at storing information in numerous smaller pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So then, instead of storing all content for all slides in a single oversized XML file ("content.xml"), suppose there was a separate table for storing the content of each slide separately. The table schema might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;CREATE TABLE slide( pageNumber INTEGER, -- The slide page number slideContent TEXT -- Slide content as XML or JSON ); CREATE INDEX slide_pgnum ON slide(pageNumber); -- Optional&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The content of each slide could still be stored as compressed XML. But now each page is stored separately. So when opening a new document, the application could simply run:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;SELECT slideContent FROM slide WHERE pageNumber=1;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This query will quickly and efficiently return the content of the first slide, which could then be speedily parsed and displayed to the user. Only one page needs to be read and parsed in order to render the first screen, which means that the first screen appears much faster and there is no longer a need for an annoying progress bar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the application wanted to keep all content in memory, it could continue reading and parsing the other pages using a background thread after drawing the first page. Or, since reading from SQLite is so efficient, the application might instead choose to reduce its memory footprint and only keep a single slide in memory at a time. Or maybe it keeps the current slide and the next slide in memory, to facilitate rapid transitions to the next slide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that dividing up the content into smaller pieces using an SQLite table gives flexibility to the implementation. The application can choose to read all content into memory at startup. Or it can read just a few pages into memory and keep the rest on disk. Or it can read just a single page into memory at a time. And different versions of the application can make different choices without having to make any changes to the file format. Such options are not available when all content is in a single big XML file in a ZIP archive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Splitting content into smaller pieces also helps File/Save operations to go faster. Instead of having to write back the content of all pages when doing a File/Save, the application only has to write back those pages that have actually changed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One minor downside of splitting content into smaller pieces is that compression does not work as well on shorter texts and so the size of the document might increase. But as the bulk of the document space is used to store images, a small reduction in the compression efficiency of the text content will hardly be noticeable, and is a small price to pay for an improved user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once one is comfortable with the concept of storing each slide separately, it is a small step to support versioning of the presentation. Consider the following schema:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;CREATE TABLE slide( slideId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, derivedFrom INTEGER REFERENCES slide, content TEXT -- XML or JSON or whatever ); CREATE TABLE version( versionId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, priorVersion INTEGER REFERENCES version, checkinTime DATETIME, -- When this version was saved comment TEXT, -- Description of this version manifest TEXT -- List of integer slideIds );&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this schema, instead of each slide having a page number that determines its order within the presentation, each slide has a unique integer identifier that is unrelated to where it occurs in sequence. The order of slides in the presentation is determined by a list of slideIds, stored as a text string in the MANIFEST column of the VERSION table. Since multiple entries are allowed in the VERSION table, that means that multiple presentations can be stored in the same document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On startup, the application first decides which version it wants to display. Since the versionId will naturally increase in time and one would normally want to see the latest version, an appropriate query might be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;SELECT manifest, versionId FROM version ORDER BY versionId DESC LIMIT 1;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or perhaps the application would rather use the most recent checkinTime:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;SELECT manifest, versionId, max(checkinTime) FROM version;&lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using a single query such as the above, the application obtains a list of the slideIds for all slides in the presentation. The application then queries for the content of the first slide, and parses and displays that content, as before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Aside: Yes, that second query above that uses "max(checkinTime)" really does work and really does return a well-defined answer in SQLite. Such a query either returns an undefined answer or generates an error in many other SQL database engines, but in SQLite it does what you would expect: it returns the manifest and versionId of the entry that has the maximum checkinTime.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the user does a "File/Save", instead of overwriting the modified slides, the application can now make new entries in the SLIDE table for just those slides that have been added or altered. Then it creates a new entry in the VERSION table containing the revised manifest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The VERSION table shown above has columns to record a check-in comment (presumably supplied by the user) and the time and date at which the File/Save action occurred. It also records the parent version to record the history of changes. Perhaps the manifest could be stored as a delta from the parent version, though typically the manifest will be small enough that storing a delta might be more trouble than it is worth. The SLIDE table also contains a derivedFrom column which could be used for delta encoding if it is determined that saving the slide content as a delta from its previous version is a worthwhile optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So with this simple change, the ODP file now stores not just the most recent edit to the presentation, but a history of all historic edits. The user would normally want to see just the most recent edition of the presentation, but if desired, the user can now go backwards in time to see historical versions of the same presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or, multiple presentations could be stored within the same document.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With such a schema, the application would no longer need to make periodic backups of the unsaved changes to a separate file to avoid lost work in the event of a crash. Instead, a special "pending" version could be allocated and unsaved changes could be written into the pending version. Because only changes would need to be written, not the entire document, saving the pending changes would only involve writing a few kilobytes of content, not multiple megabytes, and would take milliseconds instead of seconds, and so it could be done frequently and silently in the background. Then when a crash occurs and the user reboots, all (or almost all) of their work is retained. If the user decides to discard unsaved changes, they simply go back to the previous version.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are details to fill in here. Perhaps a screen can be provided that displays all historical changes (perhaps with a graph) allowing the user to select which version they want to view or edit. Perhaps some facility can be provided to merge forks that might occur in the version history. And perhaps the application should provide a means to purge old and unwanted versions. The key point is that using an SQLite database to store the content, rather than a ZIP archive, makes all of these features much, much easier to implement, which increases the possibility that they will eventually get implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the previous sections, we have seen how moving from a key/value store implemented as a ZIP archive to a simple SQLite database with just three tables can add significant capabilities to an application file format. We could continue to enhance the schema with new tables, with indexes added for performance, with triggers and views for programming convenience, and constraints to enforce consistency of content even in the face of programming errors. Further enhancement ideas include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An SQLite database has a lot of capability, which this essay has only begun to touch upon. But hopefully this quick glimpse has convinced some readers that using an SQL database as an application file format is worth a second look.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some readers might resist using SQLite as an application file format due to prior exposure to enterprise SQL databases and the caveats and limitations of those other systems. For example, many enterprise database engines advise against storing large strings or BLOBs in the database and instead suggest that large strings and BLOBs be stored as separate files and the filename stored in the database. But SQLite is not like that. Any column of an SQLite database can hold a string or BLOB up to about a gigabyte in size. And for strings and BLOBs of 100 kilobytes or less, I/O performance is better than using separate files.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some readers might be reluctant to consider SQLite as an application file format because they have been inculcated with the idea that all SQL database schemas must be factored into Third Normal Form (3NF) and store only small primitive data types such as strings and integers. Certainly relational theory is important and designers should strive to understand it. But, as demonstrated above, it is often quite acceptable to store complex information as XML or JSON in text fields of a database. Do what works, not what your database professor said you ought to do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In summary, the claim of this essay is that using SQLite as a container for an application file format like OpenDocument and storing lots of smaller objects in that container works out much better than using a ZIP archive holding a few larger objects. To wit:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An SQLite database file is approximately the same size, and in some cases smaller, than a ZIP archive holding the same information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The atomic update capabilities of SQLite allow small incremental changes to be safely written into the document. This reduces total disk I/O and improves File/Save performance, enhancing the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Startup time is reduced by allowing the application to read in only the content shown for the initial screen. This largely eliminates the need to show a progress bar when opening a new document. The document just pops up immediately, further enhancing the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The memory footprint of the application can be dramatically reduced by only loading content that is relevant to the current display and keeping the bulk of the content on disk. The fast query capability of SQLite make this a viable alternative to keeping all content in memory at all times. And when applications use less memory, it makes the entire computer more responsive, further enhancing the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The schema of an SQL database is able to represent information more directly and succinctly than a key/value database such as a ZIP archive. This makes the document content more accessible to third-party applications and scripts and facilitates advanced features such as built-in document versioning, and incremental saving of work in progress for recovery after a crash.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are just a few of the benefits of using SQLite as an application file format — the benefits that seem most likely to improve the user experience for applications like OpenOffice. Other applications might benefit from SQLite in different ways. See the Application File Format document for additional ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, let us reiterate that this essay is a thought experiment. The OpenDocument format is well-established and already well-designed. Nobody really believes that OpenDocument should be changed to use SQLite as its container instead of ZIP. Nor is this article a criticism of OpenDocument for not choosing SQLite as its container since OpenDocument predates SQLite. Rather, the point of this article is to use OpenDocument as a concrete example of how SQLite can be used to build better application file formats for future projects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;TL;DR&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sourcing data directly from disk IS faster than caching in memory. I brought receipts. Because hardware got wider but not faster, the old methods don't get you there. You need new tools to use what is scaling and avoid what isn't.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In part 1 I showed how some computer performance factors are scaling exponentially while others have been stagnant for decades. I then asserted, without proof, that sourcing data from disk can be faster than from memory. What follows is the proof.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Computer Science dogma says that unused memory should be used to cache things from the filesystem because the disk is slow and memory is fast. Given that disk bandwidth is growing exponentially and memory access latency has stagnated this isn't always true anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Experimental set up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We need data and something straight forward to do with the data. I used my free will or the illusion thereof to create a benchmark I cleverly call "counting 10s". I write some pseudo random integers between 0 and 20 to a buffer and then count how many of the integers are 10. I want to make sure we are doing all the counting in a single thread to simulate an Amdahl's Law situation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how fast can we expect this to run? The upper limit would be the memory bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My testing rig is a server with an old AMD EPYC 7551P 32-Core Processor on a Supermicro H11SSL-i and 96GB of DDR4 2133 MHz and a couple of 1.92TB Samsung PM983a PCIe 3.0 SSDs I pieced together from EBay parts. Given the way this server is configured, the upper limit for memory bandwidth can be calculated as 3 channels * 2133MT/s * 8B/T / 4 numa domains = ~13GB/s for a single thread. It's kind of an odd system but that just makes it more fun to optimize for!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The disks are rated at 3.1GB/s read BW each for an upper limit of 6.2GB/s. I made a raid0 volume with 4KB stripe size, formatted the the raid as ext4 with no journaling, and made sure it fully finished initializing the metadata before running the tests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;sudo mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=0 --raid-devices=2 --chunk=4K /dev/nvme1n1 /dev/nvme2n1
sudo mkfs.ext4 -F -L data -O ^has_journal -E lazy_itable_init=0 /dev/md0
sudo mount -o noatime /dev/md0 mnt
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We'll use a 50GB dataset for most benchmarking here, because when I started this I thought the test system only had 64GB and it stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Simple Loop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The simple and cleanest way to do this in C would look like this.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;fcntl.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;sys/mman.h&amp;gt;

// count_10_loop
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    char* filename = argv[1];
    size_t size_bytes = strtoull(argv[2], NULL, 10);
    size_t total_ints = size_bytes / sizeof(int);
    size_t count = 0;

    int fd = open(filename, O_RDONLY);
    int* data = (int*)mmap(NULL, size_bytes, PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
 
    for (size_t i = 0; i &amp;lt; total_ints; ++i) {
        if (data[i] == 10) count++;
    }

    printf("Found %ld 10s\n", count);
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just mmap() the file which will give us a buffer that we can read from. Then we just loop and count the 10s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the point is to benchmark we will integrate some timing mechanisms before we move on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;fcntl.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;sys/mman.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;sys/time.h&amp;gt;

long get_time_us() {
    struct timeval tv;
    gettimeofday(&amp;amp;tv, NULL);
    return tv.tv_sec * 1000000L + tv.tv_usec;
}

// count_10_loop
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    char* filename = argv[1];
    size_t size_bytes = strtoull(argv[2], NULL, 10);
    size_t total_ints = size_bytes / sizeof(int);
    size_t count = 0;

    int fd = open(filename, O_RDONLY);
    int* data = (int*)mmap(NULL, size_bytes, PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
 
    long start = get_time_us();
    for (size_t i = 0; i &amp;lt; total_ints; ++i) {
        if (data[i] == 10) count++;
    }
    long elapsed = get_time_us() - start;

    printf("simple loop found %ld 10s processed at %0.2f GB/s\n", count, (double)(size_bytes/1073741824)/((double)elapsed/1.0e6));
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the first run we're going to be reading from the disk. The disk/filesystem read is going to limit the performance before the memory bandwidth can.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;â¯ sudo  ./count_10_loop ./mnt/datafile.bin 53687091200
simple loop found 167802249 10s processed at 0.61 GB/s
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As expected, it's not anywhere near memory speeds because as everyone knows, disk is slow. We can look at the system and confirm that the first run cached the data to memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our expectation is that the second run will be faster because the data is already in memory and as everyone knows, memory is fast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;â¯ sudo  ./count_10_loop ./mnt/datafile.bin 53687091200
simple loop found 167802249 10s processed at 3.71 GB/s
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is faster, but clearly thatâs slower than the memory can feed it to the processor. What bottleneck might we be hitting? This speed does look possibly correlated to the instructions per second limit for this generation of CPU (between 2GHz * 1.5 IPC = 3G and 3GHz boost * 1.5 IPC = 4.5G instructions per second).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can use perf to see if the CPU is using vector instructions, if not then the actual compute is the bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Confirmed. We're running non-vectorized instructions, with a single thread counting that's as fast as it can go with a 2GHz CPU. Well crap. Weâve hit our first non-exponential limit. Even a brand new CPU running this machine code would probably struggle to do much better than a 50% improvement, still well below the memory bandwidth limit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Unrolling the loop&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good news is this code can definitely be vectorized if we help the compiler. Unroll the loop!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're gonna make it very obvious to the compiler that it's safe to use vector instructions which could process our integers up to 8x faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confirmed. We're using 128bit vector instructions, this should be up to 4x faster than the original.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;NOTE: These are 128-bit vector instructions, but I expected 256-bit. I dug deeper here and found claims that Gen1 EPYC had unoptimized 256-bit instructions. I forced the compiler to use 256-bit instructions and found it was actually slower. Looks like the compiler was smart enough to know that here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's benchmark this unrolled version with the data as page cache in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;â¯ sudo  ./count_10_unrolled ./mnt/datafile.bin 53687091200
unrolled loop found 167802249 10s processed at 5.51 GB/s
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We're still nowhere close to hitting the memory bus speed limit of 13GB/s but 50% faster than the original is a win. There must be some other bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Can the SSDs beat that?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;5.51GB/s? On paper the SSDs can read at 6.2GB/s, but the first run from disk only did 0.61GB/s. How can I meet or beat this performance sourcing the data directly from disk?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider how the default mmap() mechanism works, it is a background IO pipeline to transparently fetch the data from disk. When you read the empty buffer from userspace it triggers a fault, the kernel handles the fault by reading the data from the filesystem, which then queues up IO from disk. Unfortunately these legacy mechanisms just aren't set up for serious high performance IO. Note that at 610MB/s it's faster than what a disk SATA can do. On the other hand, it only managed 10% of our disk's potential. Clearly we're going to have to do something else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SSDs don't just automatically read data at multigigabyte speeds. You need to put some real effort into an IO pipeline to get serious performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I made a io_uring based IO engine, a kind of userspace driver, that can hit these speeds. The main thread will request data, the IO engine will handle the IO, then the main thread will do the counting when the data is in a buffer. We will use a set of queues to manage the IO requests, responses, and buffers. The IO engine will start 6 workers, target a queue depth of 8192, and have a buffer size of 16KB.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I wish I had tighter code here, but A) I didnât have time to clean it up B) some of the complexity is intractable. The IO engine code was a lot to scroll through so I moved it to github link&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Of course my 6GB/s disk stripe isnât actually faster than the memory bus, even on this weird hack of a system. So what is happening? Where is the bottleneck? It's got to be the way the data is being read from the page cache in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What if we replace the mmap() with a read() from disk into a preallocated buffer. That way we can measure the counting with the data in-memory without any page cache related overhead mmap() can introduce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we keep the dataset smaller than a numa domain and we bind this to a single numa node to prevent numa overheads we see that the theoretical memory bandwidth we projected seems to be the primary bottleneck for the unrolled loop as we hoped to see at the outset.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;â¯  sudo numactl --cpunodebind=0   ./in_ram mnt/datafile.bin 2147483648
simple loop 6709835 10s processed at 4.76 GB/s
unrolled loop 6709835 10s processed at 13.04 GB/s
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But this isn't useful to compare the with the other runs with the 50GB dataset. However if we do the full 50GB dataset the performance suffers. We have to get much of the data across numa domains which is going to be higher cost.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;â¯ sudo ./in_ram ./mnt/datafile.bin 53687091200
simple loop 167802249 10s processed at 3.76 GB/s
unrolled loop 167802249 10s processed at 7.90 GB/s
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comparing the results of "fully in-memory (50GB)" which is pre-loaded in memory before measuring against the "unrolled loop" that is only cached in memory we see 40% overhead. That's 2.75 seconds out of 9 seconds that was spent waiting on the caching system instead of counting. Why so much?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;mmap()&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The mmap() call presents the process with a buffer that is a blank slate even when the data is already in memory. The buffer is populated page by page as it's accessed from the page cache. This isn't a copy, it's just the operating system mapping the cached memory into the process. This costs more than it might seem. The worst case with mmap() the counting has to pause at every 4KB page boundary while the kernel processes a fault, tracks down the page of data in the page cache, then updates the page table of the process to insert the memory into the process. Fundamentally this is a process that is limited by the memory latency, not the CPU speed or memory bandwidth. With the potential for TLB walks and searching lists that track the page cache, weâre taking potentially dozens of CPU cache misses and several microseconds of waiting on memory for every 4KB page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;direct IO&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using our direct from disk approach uses pipelines and streams which avoids the kind of memory latency dominated bottleneck that mmap() has. In our case we're limited by the bandwidth of our disks yet because of the pipelining, the larger latency of the IOs doesn't get in the critical path of the counting very much. Allowing for higher throughput.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Scaling&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider the implications of these experiments as we scale. The well vetted solution to get data from memory to a process is slower than using the disk directly. This isn't because the memory is slower than the disk. The memory has higher bandwidth than the disk, not by an order of magnitude, but a decent margin. But the latency of the memory is orders of magnitude lower than the disk. Nevertheless the way the data in memory is accessed is the culprit. Its a synchronous approach that assumes memory operations are cheap and low latency. These accesses add up and it ends up waiting on memory latencies. The disk method on the other hand is as a streaming approach built to leverage bandwidth and hide latencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;extending the existing rig&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If I got a few more of these disks I could push the IO bandwidth to be greater than the 13GB/s per thread memory bandwidth limit. IO is DMA'ed to buffers that are pretty small compared to the total dataset. These buffers scale with the throughput capabilities of the CPU and the disks, not the dataset size. The buffers can be located in a single numa domain allowing us to avoid the overhead of accessing the buffers between NUMA domains. Add more disks to this system I might be able to create a disk based solution to count at the full 13GB/s rather than be limited to the 7.90GB/s we see with the in memory example at the full 50GB dataset. With such a system our throughput would not be affected by the dataset size, unlike the in-memory case, which has numa overhead and eventually runs out of memory to scale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;faster than memory is possible&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On a proper modern server the CPUs will let you do IO directly to the L3 cache, bypassing memory altogether. Because PCIe bandwidth is higher than memory bandwidth, on paper we could even get more max bandwidth than we can get from memory if we carefully pin the buffers into the CPU cache. I haven't confirm this works in practice, however, it could be made to work and is the sort of thing that CPU designs will be forced to lean into to push performance forward.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;memory is changing too&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This isn't just about disks vs memory. Similar techniques and principles apply to memory. Memory bandwidth is still scaling even if the latency is not. This means to take advantage of memory performance you have to actually treat it more like a disk and less like Random Access Memory. To scale performance with generational updates you have to make sure to stream data from memory into the CPU caches in blocks, similar to how data is streamed from disk to memory. If not you end up with 90s level memory throughput. A custom mechanism to cache data in memory could easily avoid the memory latency problems seen with the default mmap() solution with much less code than the io_uring solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Is this worth it?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm not going to say that going to the effort of implementing something like this is always worth it. The mmap() method is sure elegant from a coding perspective, especially when compared to all the code I had to write to get the io_uring setup working. Sometimes the simple way is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is using 6 cores of IO for 1 core of compute is always the right answer? Probably not. This was an extreme situation to prove a point. In realworld situations you'll need to look at the tradeoffs and decide what's best for your use case. Correctly understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the hardware can open up a number of possibilities where you can get a lot more performance for a lot less money.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The kind of overhead demonstrated with mmap() isnât going to go away, new hardware isn't going to fix it. At the same time disk bandwidth and the number of cores are scaling each generation. But doing things that scale performance with new technology is going to take extra code and effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But don't just blow this stuff off. Sure you can dedicate a server with 3TB of memory to serve 10K client connections. Memory in the cloud is like ~$5/GB/month, if you can afford it, then you do you. However it is worth considering that humanity doesn't have the silicon fabs or the power plants to support this for every moron vibe coder out there making an app. I figure either the karmic debt to the planet, or a vengeful AI demigod hungry for silicon and electricity will come for those that don't heed this warning, eventually. Either way my conscience is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Recap&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Memory is slow - when you use it oldschool.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Disk is fast - when you are clever with it.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Test the dogma - compounded exponentials are flipping somethings from true to false.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bad news is that this cleverness requires extra code and effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Good news is we now have AI to write and test the extra code this cleverness requires.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better news is that, for those that are willing to learn, AI's don't do this unless you know how to ask them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lean into things that scale, avoid things that donât.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Next Time&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What will be revealed in the next episode?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is O(ân) actually faster than O(log n)? Will the foundations of Computer Science survive this unveiling?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Will traditional code be consumed into the latent space of our AI overlords?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Is AI hiding these performance gains from me? Is AI even capable of writing optimized code?&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A few notes for the "um actually" haters commenting on Hacker News:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;This is not and does not claim to be an academic paper.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I do not intend to prove that NAND is a drop in replacement for DRAM.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Tis but a humble and hopefully fun exercise in exploring the limits and trends of modern hardware and the tradeoffs needed to maximize performance.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;As I stated before I have no problem with your choice to ignore this and write lazy code that will perform just as fast on new hardware in 15 years as it does on todays hardware. In fact I applaud your choice. Jeff Bezos has an orbital yacht to build, someone has to pay for it, why not you?&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;I am not an AI. I am a human with a computer that don't write perfect.&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;What Is the Fourier Transform?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Introduction&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As we listen to a piece of music, our ears perform a calculation. The high-pitched flutter of the flute, the middle tones of the violin, and the low hum of the double bass fill the air with pressure waves of many different frequencies. When the combined sound wave descends through the ear canal and into the spiral-shaped cochlea, hairs of different lengths resonate to the different pitches, separating the messy signal into buckets of elemental sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It took mathematicians until the 19th century to master this same calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the early 1800s, the French mathematician Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier discovered a way to take any function and decompose it into a set of fundamental waves, or frequencies. Add these constituent frequencies back together, and you’ll get your original function. The technique, today called the Fourier transform, allowed the mathematician — previously an ardent proponent of the French revolution — to spur a mathematical revolution as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Out of the Fourier transform grew an entire field of mathematics, called harmonic analysis, which studies the components of functions. Soon enough, mathematicians began to discover deep connections between harmonic analysis and other areas of math and physics, from number theory to differential equations to quantum mechanics. You can also find the Fourier transform at work in your computer, allowing you to compress files, enhance audio signals and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to overestimate the influence of Fourier analysis in math,” said Leslie Greengard of New York University and the Flatiron Institute. “It touches almost every field of math and physics and chemistry and everything else.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Flames of Passion&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourier was born in 1768 amid the chaos of prerevolutionary France. Orphaned at 10 years old, he was educated at a convent in his hometown of Auxerre. He spent the next decade conflicted about whether to dedicate his life to religion or to math, eventually abandoning his religious training and becoming a teacher. He also promoted revolutionary efforts in France until, during the Reign of Terror in 1794, the 26-year-old was arrested and imprisoned for expressing beliefs that were considered anti-revolutionary. He was slated for the guillotine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before he could be executed, the Terror came to an end. And so, in 1795, he returned to teaching mathematics. A few years later, he was appointed as a scientific adviser to Napoleon Bonaparte and joined his army during the invasion of Egypt. It was there that Fourier, while also pursuing research into Egyptian antiquities, began the work that would lead him to develop his transform: He wanted to understand the mathematics of heat conduction. By the time he returned to France in 1801 — shortly before the French army was driven out of Egypt, the stolen Rosetta stone surrendered to the British — Fourier could think of nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you heat one side of a metal rod, the heat will spread until the whole rod has the same temperature. Fourier argued that the distribution of heat through the rod could be written as a sum of simple waves. As the metal cools, these waves lose energy, causing them to smooth out and eventually disappear. The waves that oscillate more quickly — meaning they have more energy — decay first, followed eventually by the lower frequencies. It’s like a symphony that ends with each instrument fading to silence, from piccolos to tubas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The proposal was radical. When Fourier presented it at a meeting of the Paris Institute in 1807, the renowned mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange reportedly declared the work “nothing short of impossible.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What troubled his peers most were strange cases where the heat distribution might be sharply irregular — like a rod that is exactly half cold and half hot. Fourier maintained that the sudden jump in temperature could still be described mathematically: It would just require adding infinitely many simpler curves instead of a finite number. But most mathematicians at the time believed that no number of smooth curves could ever add up to a sharp corner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we know that Fourier was broadly right.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You can represent anything as a sum of these very, very simple oscillations,” said Charles Fefferman, a mathematician at Princeton University. “It’s known that if you have a whole lot of tuning forks, and you set them perfectly, they can produce Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony.” The process only fails for the most bizarre functions, like those that oscillate wildly no matter how much you zoom in on them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So how does the Fourier transform work?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Well-Trained Ear&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Performing a Fourier transform is akin to sniffing a perfume and distinguishing its list of ingredients, or hearing a complex jazzy chord and distinguishing its constituent notes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mathematically, the Fourier transform is a function. It takes a given function — which can look complicated — as its input. It then produces as its output a set of frequencies. If you write down the simple sine and cosine waves that have these frequencies, and then add them together, you’ll get the original function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the Fourier transform essentially scans all possible frequencies and determines how much each contributes to the original function. Let’s look at a simple example.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider the following function:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fourier transform checks how much each frequency contributes to this original function. It does so by multiplying waves together. Here’s what happens if we multiply the original by a sine wave with a frequency of 3:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are lots of large peaks, which means the frequency 3 contributes to the original function. The average height of the peaks reveals how large the contribution is.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s test if the frequency 5 is present. Here’s what you get when you multiply the original function by a sine wave with the frequency 5:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are some large peaks but also large valleys. The new graph averages out to around zero. This indicates that the frequency 5 does not contribute to the original function.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fourier transform does this for all possible frequencies, multiplying the original function by both sine and cosine waves. (In practice, it runs this comparison on the complex plane, using a combination of real and imaginary numbers.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this way, the Fourier transform can decompose a complicated-looking function into just a few numbers. This has made it a crucial tool for mathematicians: If they are stumped by a problem, they can try transforming it. Often, the problem becomes much simpler when translated into the language of frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the original function has a sharp edge, like the square wave below (which is often found in digital signals), the Fourier transform will produce an infinite set of frequencies that, when added together, approximate the edge as closely as possible. This infinite set is called the Fourier series, and — despite mathematicians’ early hesitation to accept such a thing — it is now an essential tool in the analysis of functions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Encore&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fourier transform also works on higher-dimensional objects such as images. You can think of a grayscale image as a two-dimensional function that tells you how bright each pixel is. The Fourier transform decomposes this function into a set of 2D frequencies. The sine and cosine waves defined by these frequencies form striped patterns oriented in different directions. These patterns — and simple combinations of them that resemble checkerboards — can be added together to re-create any image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any 8-by-8 image, for example, can be built from some combination of the 64 building blocks below. A compression algorithm can then remove high-frequency information, which corresponds to small details, without drastically changing how the image looks to the human eye. This is how JPEGs compress complex images into much smaller amounts of data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the 1960s, the mathematicians James Cooley and John Tukey came up with an algorithm that could perform a Fourier transform much more quickly — aptly called the fast Fourier transform. Since then, the Fourier transform has been implemented practically every time there is a signal to process. “It’s now a part of everyday life,” Greengard said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It has been used to study the tides, to detect gravitational waves, and to develop radar and magnetic resonance imaging. It allows us to reduce noise in busy audio files, and to compress and store all sorts of data. In quantum mechanics — the physics of the very small — it even provides the mathematical foundation for the uncertainty principle, which says that it’s impossible to know the precise position and momentum of a particle at the same time. You can write down a function that describes a particle’s possible positions; the Fourier transform of that function will describe the particle’s possible momenta. When your function can tell you where a particle will be located with high probability — represented by a sharp peak in the graph of the function — the Fourier transform will be very spread out. It will be impossible to determine what the particle’s momentum should be. The opposite is also true.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Fourier transform has spread its roots throughout pure mathematics research, too. Harmonic analysis — which studies the Fourier transform, as well as how to reverse it to rebuild the original function — is a powerful framework for studying waves. Mathematicians have also found that harmonic analysis has deep and unexpected connections to number theory. They’ve used these connections to explore relationships among the integers, including the distribution of prime numbers, one of the greatest mysteries in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“If people didn’t know about the Fourier transform, I don’t know what percent of math would then disappear,” Fefferman said. “But it would be a big percent.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Why I Ditched Spotify, and How I Set Up My Own Music Stack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Why I Ditched Spotify, and How I Set Up My Own Music Stack&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For years, I relied on Spotify like millions of others. The convenience was undeniable stream anything, anywhere, discover new music through algorithms, and share playlists with friends. But over time, several issues became impossible to ignore: artists getting paid fractions of pennies per stream, fake Artists and ghost Tracks, AI music and impersonation, creepy age verification complicity and the fact that despite paying monthly, I never actually owned anything. So I decided to take back control of my music experience. Here's how I built my own self-hosted music streaming setup that gives me everything Spotify offered and more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are components of this post which may be improved if you zoom in with your device. The mermaid diagram and code blocks in particular may be hard to read on smaller screens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;High Level Overview&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Components&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Music Player: Navidrome&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the core of my setup is Navidrome, an open-source music server that handles streaming your personal music collection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To access my music from anywhere, I expose Navidrome via a CloudFlare Tunnel, which provides secure access without exposing my home IP address or dealing with port forwarding.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For client apps, I use:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Browser: Navidrome's built-in web player works perfectly&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;iOS: Play:Sub connects seamlessly&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Android: Symfonium offers excellent playback quality and features&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Desktop: Feishin provides a native app experience with synced lyrics&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scrobbling: (Internet slang) To publish one's music-listening habits to the Internet via software, in order to track when and how often certain songs are played.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every track I play through this setup automatically scrobbles to my Last.fm account, which becomes important for music discovery later.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Music Collection Management: Lidarr&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lidarr helps manage my music collection by tracking artists and albums I own or purchase. It can monitor for new releases from favorite artists and helps organize my library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lidarr is just a tool. Like any tool, it can be misused. Yes, people could point it at less-than-legal sources. No, I'm not telling you to do that. If you want to support artists, buy their work. If you don't, don't pretend Spotify streams are "support."&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important Note: Always ensure you're obtaining music through legal channels such as:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Digital purchases (Bandcamp, iTunes, Amazon, etc.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Ripping CDs you've purchased&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Free legal downloads offered by artists&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Music available under Creative Commons licenses&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My setup uses sabnzbd integrated with Lidarr for handling downloads of content I've purchased. Both services run in Docker containers and are NOT exposed to the internet for security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Synced Lyrics: lrcget-kasm&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A feature I missed from Spotify was synced lyrics. lrcget-kasm fills this gap by mass-downloading LRC synced lyrics files for my music library.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since lrcget is GUI-only (no CLI version yet), I'm using a containerized version of it via Kasm and access it through my browser. It's a bit resource-intensive, so I only run it when adding new music or updating lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've opened a feature request for a CLI version, which would make this process more automation-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Music Discovery: Lidify&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One of Spotify's strongest features was music discovery. For this, I use Lidify, which connects to my Lidarr library and Last.fm account to generate recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I've also connected my Last.fm scrobbles to ListenBrainz, which promises to build weekly discovery playlists similar to Spotify's in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Results&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After several months with this setup, I'm extremely satisfied with the results:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How My Solution Compares to Spotify&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Feature&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;Spotify&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell role="head"&gt;My Self-Hosted Stack&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Music Quality&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Up to 320kbps&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Unlimited (FLAC/lossless)&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Monthly Cost&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;$9.99-$14.99&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;One-time server setup + storage&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Artist Payment&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;~$0.003-0.005 per stream&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Direct support via purchases&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Music Ownership&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Rental only&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Full ownership forever&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Offline Access&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Limited downloads&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Complete library available&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row span="3"&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Privacy&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Data collection &amp;amp; tracking&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Complete privacy&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Content Permanence&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Can disappear anytime&lt;/cell&gt;
        &lt;cell&gt;Never removed unless I choose&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The initial setup took a weekend, but maintenance is minimal. When I want new music, Lidarr handles it automatically. If I need to manually add something, I just drop the files in the right folder and Navidrome indexes them immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it for everyone? No. But if you care about music, value ownership, and have basic technical skills, building your own music streaming solution is both achievable and rewarding. The freedom from corporate streaming platforms is worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Supporting Artists&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moving away from Spotify doesn't mean abandoning artists. In fact, I now support musicians more directly by:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Purchasing music directly from platforms like Bandcamp where artists receive 82-90% of sales&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Buying physical media from official stores&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Supporting Patreon/subscription services for favorite artists&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Attending concerts and buying merchandise&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Buying a $10 album on Bandcamp puts about $8.20-$9.00 in the artist's pocket. To match that on Spotify, you're talking roughly 1.6k-3k streams of that album per listener. If the artist has a label taking a cut on Spotify, the stream counts needed go up further.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My self-hosted setup is about controlling my listening experience and owning what I pay for, not avoiding fair compensation to artists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;What's Next?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I'm continually refining this setup. Future improvements include automating the lyrics process and exploring more discovery tools. The beauty of a self-hosted solution is that it can evolve with my needs, rather than changing at the whim of a company's business model.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;
