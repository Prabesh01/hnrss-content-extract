Given a set of text detection boxes that roughly correspond to words, a text line is a cluster of boxes and a paragraph is a cluster of lines. These clusters form a two-level tree that represents a major part of the layout of a document. We use a graph convolutional network to predict the relations between text detection boxes and then build both levels of clusters from these predictions. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the unified approach can be highly efficient while still achieving state-of-the-art quality for detecting paragraphs in public benchmarks and real-world images.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    &lt;p&gt;Mark Belan/Quanta Magazine&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Venus is arguably the worst place in the solar system. A cloak of carbon dioxide suffocates the planet, subjecting its surface to skull-crushing pressure. Sulfuric acid rains down through the sickly yellow sky but never reaches the lava-licked ground. Venus is so hot — hot enough to melt lead — that the acid rain evaporates as it’s falling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The planet’s extreme inhospitality is at the heart of one of the most beguiling mysteries in planetary science. Venus and Earth formed at the same time, from the same geologic building blocks, in pretty much the same part of the solar system. They’re even the same size. So why is Venus a hellscape, and Earth a garden?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common refrain in the scientific community is that Venus is just several steps ahead — that it represents the end state of all large rocky planets, including Earth. The hypothesis is that these planets eventually lose the ability to sequester planet-warming greenhouse gases in their geologic underbelly. When those gases then accumulate in the atmosphere, the world enters a runaway greenhouse state — like the boiling hot Venusian climate. “Over the years, we’d always heard about Venus being a preview into Earth’s future,” said Stephen Kane, a planetary astrophysicist at the University of California, Riverside.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But is that long-held assumption true? In hundreds of millions or billions of years, will Earth’s climate go the way of Venus’, transitioning from a temperate world into a catastrophic hothouse? Kane and his colleagues have been trying to find out. Venus and Earth are often referred to as twins, with Venus being the evil one of the pair. In their Reuniting Twins project, the scientists have developed a digital model of Earth that combines solar physics, volcanology, plate tectonics and climate science. They’ve been pushing their model Earth to its extremes, trying every plausible way to break it and make it into Venus.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As well as exploring what went so wrong on the second rock from the sun, this work speaks to a query closer to home, said Paul Byrne, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not directly involved with the project: “How long is Earth habitable for?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NASA&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A Planetary Whodunit&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Forecasting Earth’s future requires an understanding of Venus’ past. Long ago, Venus might not have been too different from how Earth is now. Spacecraft surveys and telescope observations have revealed the existence of a rare, heavy form of water in the Venusian atmosphere — a telltale sign that regular water used to be abundant on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Researchers debate how that water resided there. One possibility is that the water on young Venus formed steam that wafted above the magma sea covering the newborn planet’s surface. That water vapor, a potent greenhouse gas, would have pushed the world into a scorching-hot greenhouse state not long after its birth. Alternatively, Venus’ initial, planetwide magma sea might have cooled and hardened into a crust quickly enough for liquid water — maybe even an ocean’s worth of water — to flow across it. If that is true, then what happened to all that water?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2020, Michael Way, a planetary scientist and climate modeler at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, looked at two possibilities for how a Venusian ocean could have boiled away.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first hypothesis points to the sun, which, as it ages and burns through its hydrogen fuel, blasts out ever more sunlight, subjecting nearby planets — including Venus, which sits closer to the sun than we do — to an increasingly intense blaze. Planetary scientists estimate that by about a billion years after the solar system’s birth, the gradually brightening sun would have been able to efficiently vaporize any liquid water on Venus. Water vapor would then have flooded the Venusian atmosphere, potentially causing intensive global warming; this warming might have been exacerbated further by volcanoes off-gassing carbon dioxide. The combination might have pushed Venus into a runaway greenhouse state.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s a nice story. But according to Way’s models, the theory that the sun broke Venus by evaporating its oceans has problems. Venus spins very slowly on its axis, and one day there is equivalent to 116 Earth days, or nearly four months. If the planet’s dayside initially held liquid oceans, that water’s evaporation would have formed thick clouds. Those prodigious, persistent dayside clouds would have reflected sunlight, keeping Venus cooler than it otherwise might have been and actually preventing a runaway greenhouse effect and unrestrained global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Way thinks that a more plausible suspect in Venus’ demise is a form of ruinous volcanism. In its own storied past, Earth experienced prolonged eruptions of lava in single regions, known as large igneous provinces (LIPs), that lasted for hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions of years. Each of these events injected copious carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and made the world, for a time, extremely hot. One LIP 252 million years ago triggered the worst recorded mass extinction in Earth’s history, almost sterilizing the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NASA&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fortunately for life, after each of these LIP events, Earth gradually drew that excess carbon dioxide deep into its rocky bowels, and the planet cooled back down. It accomplished this through a process called subduction: When tectonic plates collide, one plate can descend below the other, drawing seawater rich in dissolved carbon dioxide into the abyssal depths. That carbon remains sequestered in the lower mantle for epochal lengths of time; some of it eventually erupts back into the atmosphere via volcanism. That, in a nutshell, is how Earth’s global thermostat is regulated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s possible that back when there was water on Venus, it also had Earth-like plate tectonics with major subduction zones. But the system wasn’t widespread or large-scale enough to save it from a planetary immolation — especially if several LIP events occurred at roughly the same time. Way’s models show that several concurrent LIPs could have thrown vast quantities of carbon dioxide into Venus’ atmosphere, warming the world so severely that much of its liquid water boiled away into the sky, accelerating the warming further. With no oceans to speak of, all that carbon dioxide could not be reabsorbed. Moreover, water is an enabler of subduction: It lowers the melting point of rocks, allowing tectonic plates to more easily bend and break. And so, with no water left at the surface, major subduction zones would grind to a halt, preventing the entombment of carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other scientists tend to agree with Way’s assessment: The sun alone cannot be responsible for making Venus the awful place it is today. “I really do think you need multiple extreme volcanic episodes … to get there,” said Anna Gülcher, a planetary scientist at the University of Bern in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How to Break the World&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While studying Venus and its runaway greenhouse wasteland, Kane became morbidly curious: Could the same fate befall Earth? “What if we shut down the carbon cycle on Earth?” he said. “Could you produce a Venus?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To find out, he and his team built a virtual world-destroying machine. “Everybody loves a post-apocalyptic or doomsday scenario, provided it’s 5 billion years in our future,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Stephen Kane&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The first step was to fast-forward their model of Earth about 3.5 billion years, to when the sun and planets will be 8 billion years old. At that point, the sun will shine brighter than it does today, and Earth’s atmosphere will receive the same level of roasting-hot starlight that Venus did when it was just 1 billion years old. Back then, it’s thought, Venus would have been at a tipping point: either temperate and waterlogged, or burnt to a crisp. The 8 billion-year-old sun will push Earth to a similar, climatic knife-edge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The team’s model suggests that in 3.5 billion years, Earth’s oceans could begin evaporating and become heat-trapping water vapor in the atmosphere. That could be sufficient to kill off Earth’s major subduction zones, since without water, there might be no subduction (plus, there would be less water for carbon dioxide to dissolve into in the first place). “We’re losing the ability to draw back that CO2 into the Earth’s mantle. So it just builds up,” said Michelle Hill of Stanford University, a member of the Reuniting Twins project.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The shutdown of major subduction zones would mean that the Earth’s tectonic plates stop clashing and jostling about. Instead, they would form a near-united rocky shell around the hot mantle. For a time, the mantle would get hotter, since the shell around it would trap heat generated by radioactively decaying compounds inside it. As heat accumulates in the interior, the Earth in Kane’s simulations would experience an uptick in volcanism lasting for about 15 million years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This period, known as a “stagnant lid regime,” adds even more carbon dioxide to the sky. But the eruptive spike is short-lived. The mantle cools down and the crust thickens until it becomes nearly impermeable to any major carbon-erupting volcanism.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So 15 million years after its stagnant lid forms, Earth will have reached a new equilibrium. Occasional spurts of volcanism would still happen. (Likewise, scientists have found compelling evidence that Venus is volcanically active today.) But Kane explained that these sporadic eruptions aren’t expected to add much carbon to the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At that point, the team’s simulations stop. How Venus-like is their model of the future Earth?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;USGS&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;There’s No Place Like Venus&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If or when Earth’s large-scale subduction shuts off in about 3.5 billion years, kneecapping the planet’s ability to bury carbon, Kane and his team’s simulations indicate that the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere will rise anywhere from 0.1 bars to 0.8 bars. (For reference, the total atmospheric pressure at sea level today is 1 bar, and roughly 0.04% of that, or 0.042 bars, comes from carbon dioxide.) Even in their best-case scenario of a 0.1-bar rise in carbon dioxide, Earth’s surface temperature surpasses 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit). The same happens at 0.8 bars, but far more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Either way, the surface of the world becomes literally boiling hot. Earth will “turn into a post-runaway greenhouse state,” Kane said. “The surface temperature will be too hot for any water. It’ll all boil away.” Nothing sitting on the world’s skin would survive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still, Earth won’t get close to the state that Venus is in today. “It’d be Venus lite,” Kane said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Venus has a 93-bar atmosphere consisting of 96.5% carbon dioxide. Kane and his colleagues’ doomsday machine, no matter how hard they push it, cannot take Earth to those levels. “I was surprised by that,” he said. Because the mantle is sealed off by a stagnant lid, volcanism drops, protecting Earth from a Venus-style roasting better than he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Independent scientists have praised the Reuniting Twins project for challenging prior assumptions and adding significantly to the discussion about the terminal state of rocky planets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I like their idea,” Way said, adding that the team’s version of a future Earth “doesn’t sound unreasonable.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“You end up with a world that’s stinkingly hot,” said Byrne, the Washington University planetary scientist. But, he said, the possibility that it may not be Venusian levels of hot is intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kane’s team acknowledged that their model hasn’t considered LIP-style mega-eruptions, and that these events could feasibly add a bounty of trapped carbon to the atmosphere at any point in the future. Maybe Earth gets unlucky and experiences multiple, simultaneous LIP events (though this grows less likely over time, Kane said, as the mantle cools and its churning slows). If so, that scenario could push Earth to be more like Venus than the team’s model suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uncertainties abound. But if Kane’s team is even broadly correct, it suggests that Venus has a uniquely grim history. Something — perhaps an inundation of lava — burned that planet to the bone. Earth, meanwhile, has so far been unable to bring about its own destruction. Let’s hope that remains the case long into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Biconnected Components&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are many articles online about graphs and (1-)connected components, but not many about biconnected components (BCCs), even though these are way more interesting and can be used to solve many problems! Especially in competitive programming it is vital to know about this concept.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will outline what biconnected components are, how they work similar to/different from connected components, and how to find them algorithmically (with C++ code included). Presumed knowledge is knowing what a graph is. Sections:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Biconnectedness in a Problem&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let's introduce the concept by looking at a problem that BCCs could help solve.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Charlotte is a secret agent for Enforcement of Metro Integrity (EMI), and she is tasked with transporting a top-secret package from one of her informants, Alice, to an undercover agent, Bob. Alice and Bob must not meet each other, because that would ruin the safety of the mission, so they must be at different metro stations, and Charlotte can naturally only use the metro network for transport. The matter is further complicated by the fact that Eve, Charlotte's adversary, is trying to sabotage the mission by disabling one unknown metro connection! For the sets of meeting locations \( A \) where Alice can meet and \( B \) where Bob can meet, how many possible pairs \( (a, b) \) are there such that Charlotte can safely transport the package from \( a \) to \( b \) no matter which line Eve disables?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example metro network 1: nodes in the \( A \) set are marked with an A, nodes in the \( B \) set are marked with a B; an example valid pair of locations would be \( (3, 1) \), because no matter which metro line Eve chooses to sabogate, there is still a path from \( 3 \) to \( 1 \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The metro network is a graph \( G \) with \( n \) nodes (metro stations) and \( m \) edges (metro lines). \( A \) and \( B \) are then subsets of the set of nodes \( V(G) \). We are trying to find an algorithm with the best possible running time. We can use the following definition to make the objective a bit more precise:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Definition: two nodes \( a, b \) are edge-biconnected if for any edge \( e \), there exists a path from \( a \) to \( b \) that does not go through \( e \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then in this problem we are trying to count the number of pairs \( (a, b) \) with \( a \in A \) and \( b \in B \) that are edge-biconnected. After all, no matter what edge Eve sabotages, we always still have a path between the two nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most naive algorithm would be to consider each \( a \in A \) and \( b \in B \). We would then go over each edge, remove it, and check if there is still a path from \( a \) to \( b \) using a simple graph traversal. This approach would have a time complexity of \( O(|A| \cdot |B| \cdot m \cdot (n + m)) \), which is very bad.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We could try to speed up this approach by precomputing for each edge the connected components (CCs) of the graph without that edge, making the path checking constant time. First we would start with the set of all \( (a, b) \) pairs, and iteratively remove pairs that we find can be blocked off by Eve's sabotage. Then we would iterate over each of the \( m \) edges, and: (1) remove it and compute for each node in which connected component it lies (\( O(m + n) \) time using a simple graph traversal), and (2) for each \( (a, b) \) pair, remove it if they do not both lie in the same connected component (now a constant time operation, so \( O(|A| \cdot |B|) \) overall). This leads to to a complexity of \( O(m \cdot ((n + m) + |A| \cdot |B|)) \), which is definitely an improvement, and we considered how to leverage connected components. Click through the animation below to see how this algorithm would work (the dashed circles indicate connected components with the edge removed). However, the running time is still quite miserable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Eve sabotages this edge: all nodes can reach all nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Eve sabotages this edge: all nodes can reach all nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Eve sabotages this edge: remove pairs starting with 5 ending with 1/6/7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Eve sabotages this edge: all nodes can reach all nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Eve sabotages this edge: all nodes can reach all nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Eve sabotages this edge: all nodes can reach all nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Eve sabotages this edge: remove pairs starting with 2/4/5 ending with 6/7, and pairs starting with 6/8 ending with 1/5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Eve sabotages this edge: all nodes can reach all nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Eve sabotages this edge: all nodes can reach all nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If Eve sabotages this edge: all nodes can reach all nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The final set of pairs is \( \{ (2, 1), (4, 1), ~~ (5, 5), ~~ (6, 6), (6, 7), (8, 6), (8, 7) \} \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this example, we are definitely doing a lot of unnecessary work, and you might also notice that the final set of pairs has a specific pattern to it (whitespace to make this a bit more obvious). We can (suggestively) draw the pairs in the graph as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notice that we just have a few clusters of nodes, and within each cluster every possible pair is interconnected (a clustering like this is called a partition of the nodes). Can we prove that we can always find such a clustering/partition? Or could it be that in some graph, there is an edge-biconnected pair \( x, y \), an edge-biconnected pair \( y, z \), but not an edge-biconnected pair \( x, z \)? (Think about counterexamples, or convince yourself this should always hold.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Edge-Biconnected Components&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Okay, I am kind of giving it away by naming this section like this. But it is a very doable exercise to prove that such a partition is always possible, where within each cluster all the pairs are connected through a pair of edge-disjoint paths, and between two distinct clusters, there are no pairs connected in that way. When thinking about partitions, you should always think about the mathematical concept of an equivalence relation. If edge-biconnectedness were an equivalence relation, we would need to prove the following three properties:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reflexivity: any node \( u \) is edge-biconnected to itself.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Symmetry: if \( u \) is edge-biconnected to \( v \), then \( v \) must be edge-biconnected to \( u \).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transitivity: if \( u \) is edge-biconnected to \( v \) and \( v \) is edge-biconnected to \( w \), then \( u \) must be edge-biconnected to \( w \).&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that edge-biconnectedness is in fact an equivalence relation. The proofs for these properties are definitely doable to do for yourself! (Try this! Or look at the proof for the first property and then try the other two yourself. For transitivity, you have to consider that the two assumed paths can be overlapping.) Regardless, I will give the proof here, together with a "proof by picture":&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Reflexivity: let \( u \) be any node. Obviously no matter what edge we remove, we still have a path from \( u \) going to itself, namely the empty path. Therefore, \( u \) is edge-biconnected to \( u \).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Symmetry: let \( u \) and \( v \) be any nodes, assume that \( u \) is edge-biconnected to \( v \), and let \( e \) be any edge that we must not use. Because \( u \) was edge-biconnected to \( v \), we can choose \( p \) to be the path from \( u \) to \( v \) that does not use \( e \). Because this path lives in an undirected graph, we can reverse the path to get a path from \( v \) to \( u \) that still does not use \( e \). Therefore, \( v \) is edge-biconnected to \( u \).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Transitivity: let \( u \), \( v \) and \( w \) be any nodes, assume that \( u \) is edge-biconnected to \( v \) and that \( v \) is edge-biconnected to \( w \), and let \( e \) be any edge that we must not use. Because \( u \) was edge-biconnected to \( v \), we can choose \( p \) to be the path from \( u \) to \( v \) that does not use \( e \). Because \( v \) was edge-biconnected to \( w \), we can choose \( q \) to be the path from \( v \) to \( w \). If \( p \) and \( q \) do not overlap in any edges, simply concatenate to get a path \( p q \) from \( u \) to \( w \). If they do however overlap at some point, take the subpath \( p' \) of \( p \) from \( u \) to the earliest point where the overlap, take the subpath \( q' \) of \( q \) from that point to \( w \), and concatenate to get a path \( p' q' \) from \( u \) to \( w \) that does not use \( e \) and does not overlap with itself. Therefore in either case, \( v \) is edge-biconnected to \( w \). (See figure.)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example for transitivity proof: \( e \) marks the sabotaged edge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example for transitivity proof: path from \( u \) to \( v \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example for transitivity proof: path from \( v \) to \( w \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example for transitivity proof: red marks the first overlapping node of the two paths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Example for transitivity proof: concatenated path from \( u \) to \( w \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gives us a new algorithm for our problem. First compute the edge-biconnected components for the entire graph. Then within each component count how many \( A \) nodes and how many \( B \) nodes there are. Because within a component each pair of nodes is edge-biconnected, we can simply multiply the A count by the B count and add this value to the result. Between any two different components there are no edge-biconnected pairs, we are not missing any pairs. Now all we need is an algorithm for computing edge-biconnected components!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Tarjan's Algorithm&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As could be seen in the example of our connected-component-based algorithm, there are certain edges that, when removed, will split up the graph into more connected components. These edges are called bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Definition: an edge \( \{ u, v \} \) is a bridge if there is no path between \( u \) and \( v \) in \( G - \{ u, v \} \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we can find the bridges of the graph, then finding the edge-biconnected components will be very easy, because they are simply the connected components of the graph with all bridges removed. This follows from the following lemma.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lemma 1: two nodes are edge-biconnected if and only if they are in the same connected component of the graph with all bridges removed. (See the appendix for the proof, which is safe to skip.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The algorithm for finding bridges was invented by famous computer scientist Robert Tarjan and only uses depth-first search. (Fun fact: Tarjan's brother James is a chess grandmaster.) Let's look at the first observation that makes this algorithm works:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lemma 2: an edge \( e \) is a bridge if and only if there does not exist a simple cycle that goes through \( e \). (See the appendix for the proof, which is safe to skip.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can check this condition for all edges by performing a DFS and looking at the back-edges of the DFS tree. For instance, this is what a DFS tree looks like for the example if we start at node 1:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A possible DFS tree. Filled arrows are tree-edges and dotted arrows are back-edges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We know that back edges are always part of a cycle. Thus, we can make the following two observations about the connection between bridges, by using lemma 2.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observation: a back edge is never a bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Observation: a tree edge \( (u, v) \) is a bridge if and only if none of the descendants of \( v \) has a back edge to an ancestor of \( u \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tarjan's algorithm maintains for every node a \( \mathit{low} \) value, which is the minimum between (1) the DFS entry time of the node itself, (2) the entry times of all back-edge neighbors, and (3) the \( \mathit{low} \) values of the children. Then a tree edge \( (u, v) \) is a bridge if and only if \( low[v] \) is strictly greater than the entry time of \( u \). Essentially, this means that when the algorithm visits a back edge \( (u, v) \), all of the tree edges between \( v \) and \( u \) are marked as not being a bridge as soon as we go back up the DFS tree.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step through the example below. I have made the graph such that the DFS entry time matches the node labels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All nodes start with \( \mathit{low} \) equal to the DFS entry time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit tree edge \( (1, 2) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit tree edge \( (2, 3) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit back edge \( (3, 1) \): update \( \mathit{low}[3] := \min(\mathit{low}[3], 1) \). All tree edges shown in red thus cannot be bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit tree edge \( (3, 4) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit back edge \( (4, 1) \): update \( \mathit{low}[4] := \min(\mathit{low}[4], 1) \). All tree edges shown in red thus cannot be bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit tree edge \( (4, 5) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Node 5 has no children, so \( \mathit{low}[5] = 5 \). Since \( \mathit{low}[5] &amp;gt; 4 \), the edge is a bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit tree edge \( (4, 6) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit tree edge \( (6, 7) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit tree edge \( (7, 8) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visit back edge \( (8, 6) \): update \( \mathit{low}[8] := \min(\mathit{low}[8], 6) \). All tree edges shown in red thus cannot be bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So \( \mathit{low}[8] = 6 \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update \( \mathit{low}[7] := \min(\mathit{low}[7], \mathit{low}[8]) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update \( \mathit{low}[6] := \min(\mathit{low}[6], \mathit{low}[7]) \). Since \( \mathit{low}[6] &amp;gt; 4 \), the edge is a bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update \( \mathit{low}[4] := \min(\mathit{low}[4], \mathit{low}[6]) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update \( \mathit{low}[3] := \min(\mathit{low}[3], \mathit{low}[4]) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update \( \mathit{low}[2] := \min(\mathit{low}[2], \mathit{low}[3]) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Update \( \mathit{low}[1] := \min(\mathit{low}[1], \mathit{low}[2]) \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you can see, the algorithm finds the bridges, and even appears to identify edge-biconnected components. It can be modified to find the edge-biconnected components and even articulation points (which is a concept related to vertex-biconnectedness) in a single pass, but understanding and proving why this works is quite difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the algorithm only performs a DFS and maintains some integers associated with the nodes, it has a time complexity of \( O(|V| + |E|) \) and a space complexity of \( O(|V|) \) (assuming the graph space usage itself is not counted).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;C++ Implementation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now we can solve the original metro problem. The full code is available on this website. I also have code that computes the edge-biconnected components without the metro stuff and that also works for non-simple graphs (with self loops or multi-edges), which I tested on judge.yosupo.jp. All code is licensed under GPL3 (see the COPYING file).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; First we set up the graph data structure and implement the bridge-finding algorithm. The nodes keep track of the \( \mathit{low} \) value and whether they are in the A and/or B set. Tarjan's algorithm performs a standard DFS and computes the \( \mathit{low} \) value for each node, and puts an edge in the &lt;code&gt;bridges&lt;/code&gt; set if it meets
                the condition given in the previous section.
            &lt;/p&gt;

) {
    graph[i].dfsEntryTime = time++;

    int low = graph[i].dfsEntryTime;
    for (int j : graph[i].adj) {
        if (j == parent) { // edge back to parent
            continue;
        } else if (graph[j].visited) { // back edge
            low = std::min(low, graph[j].dfsEntryTime);
        } else { // tree edge

            dfs(graph, j, i, time, bridges);
            low = std::min(low, graph[j].low);

            if (graph[j].low &amp;gt; graph[i].dfsEntryTime) {
                bridges.insert({i, j});
                bridges.insert({j, i});
            }
        }
    }
    graph[i].low = low;
}

std::set&amp;lt;std::pair&amp;lt;int, int&amp;gt;&amp;gt; getBridges(std::vector&amp;lt;Node&amp;gt;&amp;amp; graph) {

        dfs(graph, i, -1, time, bridges);
    }
    return bridges;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then we have another DFS procedure which, given a node \( i \), computes the number of A nodes and B nodes within the edge-biconnected component that it lies in. It does this by never passing through bridges, meaning it will not go to another edge-biconnected component.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
std::pair&amp;lt;int, int&amp;gt; countAB(
    std::vector&amp;lt;Node&amp;gt;&amp;amp; graph,
    int i,
    const std::set&amp;lt;std::pair&amp;lt;int, int&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;amp; bridges
) {
    if (graph[i].visited) return {0, 0};
    graph[i].visited = true;
    std::pair&amp;lt;int, int&amp;gt; result {0, 0};
    if (graph[i].isA) result.first++;
    if (graph[i].isB) result.second++;
    for (int j : graph[i].adj) {
        // don't traverse bridges (act like they are removed from the graph)
        if (bridges.count({i, j})) continue;
        auto abCount = countAB(graph, j, bridges);
        result.first += abCount.first;
        result.second += abCount.second;
    }
    return result;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, we have some code that reads the graph and the set of A and B nodes. It runs the two DFS passes above for the whole graph. For each edge-biconnected component, it adds the product of the number of A nodes and B nodes, because that is how many \( (a, b ) \) pairs you can find within an edge-biconnected component that Eve cannot sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;
int main() {
    int n, m, a, b;
    std::cin &amp;gt;&amp;gt; n &amp;gt;&amp;gt; m &amp;gt;&amp;gt; a &amp;gt;&amp;gt; b;

    std::vector&amp;lt;Node&amp;gt; graph(n);
    for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; m; i++) {
        int v, w;
        std::cin &amp;gt;&amp;gt; v &amp;gt;&amp;gt; w;
        graph[v - 1].adj.push_back(w - 1);
        graph[w - 1].adj.push_back(v - 1);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; a; i++) {
        int v;
        std::cin &amp;gt;&amp;gt; v;
        graph[v - 1].isA = true;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; b; i++) {
        int v;
        std::cin &amp;gt;&amp;gt; v;
        graph[v - 1].isB = true;
    }

    auto bridges = getBridges(graph);

    for (auto&amp;amp; node : graph) node.visited = false;

    // go over each edge-biconnected component and count A and B nodes
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; n; i++) {
        if (graph[i].visited) continue;
        auto abCount = countAB(graph, i, bridges);
        result += abCount.first * abCount.second;
    }
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; result &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "\n";

    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The input format is as follows. The first line is \( n, m, a, b \), which are the number of nodes, the number of edges, the number of A nodes, and the number of B nodes respectively. Then follow \( m \) lines of pairs \( v~w \), which are the edges. It is assumed that the graph is simple. Then follow \( a \) lines of integers, which are the A nodes, and then \( b \) lines of integers, which are the B nodes. All nodes in the input are 1-based. There is an example input available that encodes the graph we've been using as an example, for which the code gives the correct answer 7.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bonus 1: Edge-Disjoint Paths&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another way to state the edge-biconnectedness property is that there exist two edge-disjoint paths from \( a \) to \( b \), i.e., paths that do not have any of the same edges. For instance, in the example there are two edge-disjoint paths from node 2 to 1: one that goes from 2 directly to 1, and one that goes from 2 through 3 to 1. However, there are no two edge-disjoint paths from node 5 to 7: any path must go through the same edge \( \{ 4, 6 \} \), so we cannot choose two paths to be fully edge-disjoint. The proof that this is a property that holds if and only if the nodes are edge-biconnected is not trivial. You can see the picture for an example that we have two edge-disjoint paths for each edge-biconnected pair, but not for any other pairs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pair: \( (2, 1) \)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pair: \( (4, 1) \)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pair: \( (5, 5) \)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pair: \( (6, 6) \)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pair: \( (6, 7) \)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pair: \( (8, 6) \)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pair: \( (8, 7) \)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also note that in an undirected graph, we can see two edge-disjoint paths from \( a \) to \( b \) as an edge walk that goes from \( a \) to \( b \) and then back to \( a \) again, without repeating any edges. This is kind of like a cycle going through \( a \) and \( b \), except we may go over the same node several times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Bonus 2: Vertex-Biconnected Components&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can repeat the problem that we stated before but change one thing: what if after you pick a station for Alice and one for Bob, Eve sabotages a metro station instead of a metro line? (She would not be able to sabotage the metro station that Alice or Bob was in.) Do we still have an equivalence relation on the nodes like with edge-biconnectedness? I will not discuss it in this article, but consider the following example and think about if the transitivity property holds for vertex-biconnectedness:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will also leave you with a hint: a node can be part of multiple vertex-biconnected components. Consider instead an equivalence relation on the edges (it's a cute little symmetry that edge-biconnectedness gives an equivalence relation on the vertices, and vertex-biconnectedness gives an equivalence relation on the edges).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Appendix: List of Relevant Terms&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here is a list of terms used in the theory for edge-biconnectedness and vertex-biconnectedness:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Edge-biconnectedness (for pairs of nodes): a node \( u \) is edge-biconnected to a node \( v \) if for any edge \( e \), we can find a path from \( u \) to \( v \) that does not go through \( e \).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Edge-biconnectedness (for whole undirected graphs): a graph is edge-biconnected if the graph is connected even if any one edge is removed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Edge-biconnected components: a subset of nodes forms an edge-biconnected component if each pair of nodes within it is edge-biconnected, and it cannot have any additional nodes added to it and still have this property. (The edge-biconnected components of any graph are the equivalence classes of the edge-biconnectedness equivalence relation.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Bridge: an edge is a bridge if, when removed, the number of connected components is increased (in the example graph there are two such edges, which you can see by stepping through the second figure).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vertex-biconnectedness (for pairs of nodes): a node \( u \) is vertex-biconnected to a node \( v \) if there exist two vertex-disjoint paths from \( u \) to \( v \), or \( u = v \). (Note that this is not an equivalence relation.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vertex-biconnectedness (for whole undirected graphs): a graph is vertex-biconnected if the graph is connected even if any one node is removed.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Vertex-biconnected component: a subset of nodes forms a vertex-biconnected component if each pair of nodes within it is vertex-biconnected, and it cannot have any additional nodes added to it and still have this property. (Note that the vertex-biconnected components of a graph are not necessarily a partition of the nodes.)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Articulation point: a node is an articulation point if it is part of more than one vertex-biconnected component.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Appendix: Proof of Connection Between Edge-Biconnectedness and Bridges&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lemma 1: for any undirected graph \( G \), for any two nodes \( u, v \in V(G) \), \( u \) and \( v \) are edge-biconnected if and only if \( u \) and \( v \) are in the same connected component of \( G \) with all bridges removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proof. For convenience, define \( G' \) to be \( G \) with all bridges removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\( (\Rightarrow) \) Assume \( u \) and \( v \) are edge-biconnected. For a contradiction, suppose \( u \) and \( v \) are not in the same connected component of \( G' \), i.e., all paths from \( u \) to \( v \) go through some bridge in \( G \). Since edge-biconnectedness implies connectedness, there must exist at least one path \( p \) between them in \( G \), and choose \( e \) to be a bridge that this path goes through. From edge-biconnectedness, we can instead choose a path \( q \) that does not go through \( e \). Choose \( C \) to be the first connected component of \( G' \) that \( q \) passes through and that \( p \) also goes through, and that is not just the connected component that \( u \) lies in (we know such a connected component must exist, because \( p \) and \( q \) at least meet in the component of \( v \) in \( G' \), and that component is separate from the component of \( u \) because we passed through the bridge \( e \)). We can join up these paths \( p \) and \( q \) in that connected component through edges that are not bridges. Now we have a cycle passing through a bridge, which is a contradiction because it implies that both endpoints of the bridge are in the same connected component even if \( e \) was removed (see also lemma 2).&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\( (\Leftarrow) \) Assume \( u \) and \( v \) are in the same connected component of \( G' \). To prove their edge-biconnectedness, let \( e \) be any edge. If \( e \) is a bridge or lies outside of the connected component of \( u \) and \( v \), then trivially there exists a path from \( u \) to \( v \) that does not use \( e \). Otherwise, \( e \) must not be a bridge and that means that removing it from \( G \) does not change what vertices are connected to each other, i.e., \( u \) and \( v \) would still lie in the same connected component in \( G - e \). This means there exists a path from \( u \) to \( v \) in \( G - e \) and thus there exists a path in \( G \) that does not use \( e \) going from \( u \) to \( v \). Either way, we have a path from \( u \) to \( v \), proving that \( u \) is edge-biconnected to \( v \).&lt;/item&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Appendix: Proof of Connection Between Bridges and Simple Cycles&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lemma 2: an edge \( \{ u, v \} \) is a bridge if and only if all simple cycles do not go through \( \{ u, v \} \).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proof. For convenience, define \( G' := G - \{ u, v \} \) to be the graph with the edge removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\( (\Rightarrow) \) Let \( \{ u, v \} \) be a bridge and let \( c \) be a simple cycle in \( G \), and assume for a contradiction that \( c \) goes through \( \{ u, v \} \). Then we can remove the edge \( \{ u, v \} \) from the cycle and still have a path between \( u \) and \( v \) in \( G' \). This directly contradicts the assumption that \( \{ u, v \} \) was a bridge.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;\( (\Leftarrow) \) Let \( \{ u, v \} \) be an edge through which all simple cycles do not pass. For a contradiction, suppose that \( \{ u, v \} \) was not a bridge and thus \( u \) and \( v \) are still connected in \( G' \) and thus there exists a path \( \{ v, v_1 \}, ..., \{ v_n, u \} \) in \( G' \). Since \( \{ u, v \} \) is an edge in \( G \), we can connect the two ends of the path and get a simple cycle in \( G \) that passes through \( \{ u, v \} \). This contradicts the assumption.&lt;/item&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go has a feature called struct embedding that allows you to compose types. It looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;type Position struct {
	X int
	Y int
}

type Colour struct {
	R byte
	G byte
	B byte
}

type Rectangle struct {
	Position
	Colour
	
	Width  int
	Height int
}

r := Rectangle{/* ... */}

// This works:
fmt.Printf("%d,%d\n", r.Position.X, r.Position.Y)

// but so does this:
fmt.Printf("%d,%d\n", r.X, r.Y)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But what do you think this code does?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;type FooService struct {
	URL string
}

type BarConnectionOptions struct {
	URL string
}

type BarService struct {
	BarConnectionOptions
}

type Options struct {
	FooService
	BarService
}

opts := Options{
	FooService: FooService{URL: "abc.com"},
	BarService: BarService{
		BarConnectionOptions: BarConnectionOptions{
			URL: "xyz.com",
		},
	},
}

fmt.Println(opts.URL)
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would expect this to fail to compile as &lt;code&gt;URL&lt;/code&gt; is ambiguous. It actually prints &lt;code&gt;abc.com&lt;/code&gt;, presumably as it is the least nested version of that field. This happened at the day job, although it was caught in a test. Be careful when embedding structs!&lt;/p&gt;

We focus on Persian taarof, a social norm in Iranian interactions, which is a sophisticated system of ritual politeness that emphasizes deference, modesty, and indirectness, yet remains absent from existing cultural benchmarks. We introduce TaarofBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM understanding of taarof, comprising 450 role-play scenarios covering 12 common social interaction topics, validated by native speakers. Our evaluation of five frontier LLMs reveals substantial gaps in cultural competence, with accuracy rates 40-48% below native speakers when taarof is culturally appropriate. Performance varies between interaction topics, improves with Persian-language prompts, and exhibits gender-based asymmetries. We also show that responses rated "polite" by standard metrics often violate taarof norms, indicating the limitations of Western politeness frameworks. Through supervised fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization, we achieve 21.8% and 42.3% improvement in model alignment with cultural expectations. Our human study with 33 participants (11 native Persian, 11 heritage, and 11 non-Iranian speakers) forms baselines in varying degrees of familiarity with Persian norms. This work lays the foundation for developing diverse and culturally aware LLMs, enabling applications that better navigate complex social interactions.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;How I, a non-developer, read the tutorial you, a developer, wrote for me, a beginner&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Hello! I am a developer. Here is my relevant experience: I code in Hoobijag and sometimes jabbernocks and of course ABCDE++++ (but never ABCDE+/^+ are you kidding? ha!) and I like working with Shoobababoo and occasionally kleptomitrons. I’ve gotten to work for Company1 doing Shoobaboo-ing code things and that’s what led me to the Snarfus. So, let’s dive in!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About this tutorial&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I first started doing Very Simple Thing2 with Snarfus, but the more I used it the more I saw the potential! Despite the jaggle of the chromus, it’s really multi-purpose. And that’s what led me to argyling the pintafore with the quagmire instead of the hoobastank! I know, crazy. But it was kind of working, and actually a lot of fun… Until I hit a big roadblock: the fisterfunk will NOT talk to the shamrock portal or even send beep-boops back to the Snarfus! Of course, you know what that means3 — Now the entire hoob-tunnel is clogged with gramelions. Unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I almost gave up but then I realized: If I connect the backside Snarfus stagnator to the backside shamrock Klingon troglodyte emulater, it’s good! Everything beep-boops and ding-dongs and I get the Actual Topic of the Tutorial, which lets me do the Very Simple Thing the way I want after all! Pretty cool4.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So here’s how to set it up:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the terminal, ajkl;gawgor;iqeg;iJLkqen. wl;R aw;oeiga 4648664 arjarwgj;llj;ja fadgfgajkljl; wlj;sdjk;lfas&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Next go to folder/hidden/deep/in/the/file/system/surprise!.file and copy the contents of the file. If it’s not there, it might be in library/library/library/llibrary/liiiiiibrarrrary/llllliiiiibrary/hidden/hidden/hiding/you can’t find me/hidden/nope/never/hahahahereiam.file.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now go back to the terminal and paste in the file contents, then type in 64A786AGR45JAR; rdja;jg [[]][[]][[]][[]]][[]()()()()()()()()(){{}{}{}|{}{|}{}{|}{ ////////////////!! !!!! !! //// !!! agjlkargji;lwej;OI [ASRGASG[]ASGDASG[]EAEadgasg[]EAGE[edaga][]ahgr-0-0=-0-=0-=0=0-0=-0-=0=-0-=0=-0=-0!!!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Boop!5&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Open Snarfus and upload the file you just made.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just for shits and giggles, you can de-sham the chronostatiomatrix by running —()()(]]asdg a=-do —cd go cd stay —sususudododo baby shark—][] but that’s optional.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That’s it!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let me know how it goes for you. I’d love to hear if anybody uses this approach with GewGawGamma or ometer2.7.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I probably should recognize Company because it seems illustrious but I do not recognize Company or know what they do. ↵&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It is not simple. ↵&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I do not know what that means. ↵&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It is cool. I don’t really understand how, but I believe it. I’m glad you know how to do it. ↵&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The first 3 steps will take me approximately 7 hours and 193 internet searches to complete. When I finally get to Boop! it will be really satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is meant in good fun. I really appreciate the folks who take time to share their knowledge and write up tutorials and give tips and so on. ↵&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;10.09.2025 | Frederik Ramm&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This month we’ve ramped up the infrastructure behind the download server, and downloads should now be available earlier&lt;lb/&gt; and faster. There’s also a small technical change in that requests for a “…latest” file will now be answered with a&lt;lb/&gt; HTTP redirect to the specific latest version (see previous blog post).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I would like to use this opportunity to appeal to users of the download server to “download responsibly”. We want&lt;lb/&gt; to continue offering this service as powerful and as convenient as possible within our means. We want everyone&lt;lb/&gt; to have easy access to the latest OSM data in a form that is useful to them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every now and then, people break things for others. There have been individual clients downloading the exact same&lt;lb/&gt; 20-GB file 100s of times per day, for several days in a row. (Just the other day, one user has managed to download almost 10,000 copies of the italy-latest.osm.pbf file in 24 hours!) Others download every single file we have on the&lt;lb/&gt; server, every day. There’s a limit to the outgoing network bandwidth, and behaviour like this means that&lt;lb/&gt; things are slowing down for everyone. Also, when we block an IP range for abuse, innocent third parties can be affected. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s three concrete appeals to users of the download server:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1. If you want data for the whole planet, don’t download it piecemeal from us – simply get the planet file from planet.openstreetmap.org and you’re done!&lt;lb/&gt; 2. If you want a large region (like Europe or North America) updated daily, use the excellent pyosmium-up-to-date program which will automatically determine the age of your local file and update it by downloading the latest changes; this saves something like 98% of network traffic compared to a fresh download, and is faster.&lt;lb/&gt; 3. If you automate anything with regard to our download server, monitor what your script is doing or build in appropriate catches so that you don’t end up downloading the same file 1000 times just because your disk is full or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happy downloading!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;SGI demos from long ago, running in your browser today.&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Old problems require modern solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the original SGI demo source code, compiled for the web using Emscripten and SDL2. Rendering is done using an IRIS GL software rasterizer from the Alice 4 project. Event handling is done by SDL2, with events translated into GL's event system. Each demo is a separate web page, with its own Javascript + WASM compiled by Emscripten from the original C/C++ source. Minimal modifications have been made to the original source, in order to run in the browser and to work with compilers 35 years newer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;

      &lt;item&gt;Arena (no network play)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install Homebrew if you don't have it, then get SDL2 and Emscripten:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;brew install SDL2
brew install emscripten&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Build:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/sgi-demos/sgi-demos.git
cd sgi-demos
make&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Install Winget if you don't have it.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Install MSYS2 from cmd.exe, in order to get the clang compiler:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;winget install MSYS2.MSYS2
setx PATH "%PATH%C:\msys64\clang64\bin"&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Install clang toolchain and SDL2 in MSYS2 CLANG64 shell:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;pacman -Syu
pacman -S base-devel mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-toolchain

    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Clone emscripten from Github. Cloning seems to work best with MSYS2 rather than using pacman. Follow the default install directions, not the Windows directions!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add this line to the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;file in MSYS2 CLANG64 shell:&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;LinkedIn is preparing to switch on generative-AI training that draws from European members’ data, setting November 3, 2025 as the go-live date. The company says it will rely on “legitimate interests” as its legal basis and will offer an opt-out so members can refuse use of their data for training—promising that private messages are excluded. The change applies across the EU/EEA, United Kingdom, and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a pivot from last year’s pause. In September 2024, after criticism and scrutiny, LinkedIn suspended plans to train models on data from EU &amp;amp; U.K. users.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What exactly will be used? LinkedIn’s help center explains that profile details and public content (posts, articles, comments) can feed content-generating models. The company also points to saved résumés and job-application answers as potential inputs to features that help members get discovered by recruiters, and it says it screens out minors it believes are in secondary school. It stresses that private messages are not part of the training set. The togglable setting appears as “Data for Generative AI Improvement,” and turning it off stops future use of your data for training, though it doesn’t unwind models already trained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a parallel—but separate—data-sharing change with Microsoft, LinkedIn’s parent. Beginning November 3, LinkedIn will expand, in some regions, the types of LinkedIn data shared with Microsoft so Microsoft can personalize ads. LinkedIn frames this as an “Affiliates” update; it says it will provide an additional opt-out where relevant. The two changes arrive together in the same terms refresh but follow different regional rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;quote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Outside EU/EEA/Switzerland and the UK, LinkedIn shares your information with our affiliate, Microsoft, for advertising purposes and with select partners for purposes of marketing LinkedIn’s products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/quote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For European members, the legal hinge is GDPR’s “legitimate interests.” That route allows processing without consent if a company can show necessity, transparency, and an effective right to object. LinkedIn’s European Regional Privacy Notice update states that legitimate interests will be the basis for training content-generating models starting November 3, and that an objection (opt-out) will be honored via account settings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why now? LinkedIn has steadily added AI-assisted features—writing suggestions, profile summaries, recruiter tools—that benefit from domain-specific training. After the 2024 backlash (and a short-lived lawsuit in the U.S. that centered on fears about private messages—claims LinkedIn denied and that were later withdrawn), the company has come back with region-specific notices, a single, named training setting, and clearer language that private messages aren’t in scope.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Practically, here’s what changes on (or around) November 3 in Europe: if you do nothing, LinkedIn may use parts of your profile and public activity to refine the models behind its content-generation features. If you object in settings, that use should stop for future training. Your ability to use AI features doesn’t depend on opting in. In parallel, some—but not all—regions will see broader ad-personalization data sharing with Microsoft, governed by a separate control. Expect some differences in labels and availability by market; LinkedIn says not all features and settings roll out worldwide at once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want out, the setting to look for is “Data for Generative AI Improvement” in Settings → Data privacy. The key is that the toggle affects future training, not models already built. Keep an eye out for any region-specific notices in your account banner over the next few weeks as the company aligns the U.K. with the EU schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The European Union is pushing a dangerous surveillance law called “Chat Control” that would force tech companies to scan everyone’s private messages — even those protected by end-to-end encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This proposal would force tech companies to use “client-side scanning” — so your private messages, photos, and files could be read before you send them, opening the door for hackers, corporations, and governments to spy on your data.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If passed, Chat Control won’t just weaken privacy — it will change the way we live online. Private conversations would no longer be private. Trust, security, and freedom on the internet would vanish.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Mozilla community is urgently calling on EU policymakers to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Protect encryption: Ensure that end-to-end encrypted services are fully excluded from any broad detection requirements.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Defend online security: Reject all measures that weaken encryption, violate the integrity of our devices or create new vulnerabilities in digital services.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Rely on expertise: Consult independent experts — cryptographers, child protection specialists, and fundamental rights advocates — to design solutions that are both technically sound and proportionate.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sign Mozilla Foundation’s petition today to tell the EU: Drop Chat Control. Defend encryption. Protect our digital future.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head class="tw-list-none [&amp;amp;::-webkit-details-marker]:tw-hidden tw-w-full tw-text-lg tw-leading-7 tw-min-h-40 py-3 d-flex align-items-center tw-border-t-gray-20 tw-border-t"&gt;Where does my country stand on the EU “Chat Control” proposal?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check this map to see where your country stands: fightchatcontrol.eu&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each EU country has taken a different stance — and the debate is shifting fast. Some governments oppose it, some are undecided, and others are pushing hard to pass it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No matter your government’s position right now, adding your voice will help protect our right to private communications. Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) and national ministers will decide this law. Contact your representatives today and tell them: protect encryption, reject client-side scanning, and defend our rights online.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head class="tw-list-none [&amp;amp;::-webkit-details-marker]:tw-hidden tw-w-full tw-text-lg tw-leading-7 tw-min-h-40 py-3 d-flex align-items-center tw-border-t-gray-20 tw-border-t"&gt;What is “client-side scanning” (CSS)?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Client-side scanning means your messages, photos, or files are scanned on your device before they’re encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Client-side scanning (CSS) is often promoted as a child safety measure — but in reality, it undermines the very promise of encryption. Detection tools, especially those meant to identify “unknown” content, are error-prone and create new security vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even if scanning starts with one type of content (like CSAM), it sets a dangerous precedent: the scope can easily be expanded to monitor other kinds of conversations. And once encryption is weakened, the risks multiply — hackers can steal sensitive data, abusers can track vulnerable people, and authoritarian regimes can spy on journalists, activists, and citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CSS doesn’t make people safer. It makes everyone less secure.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head class="tw-list-none [&amp;amp;::-webkit-details-marker]:tw-hidden tw-w-full tw-text-lg tw-leading-7 tw-min-h-40 py-3 d-flex align-items-center tw-border-t-gray-20 tw-border-t"&gt;Which encrypted apps and products would be impacted?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If passed, Chat Control would apply to messaging and storage services operating in the EU — even those using end-to-end encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apps like WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, iMessage, and Messenger, plus cloud services like iCloud, Google Drive, and Microsoft OneDrive, could all be forced to scan your private messages, photos, and files before they’re sent or stored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That means no matter which service you use, your conversations and data could be opened up to surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Privacy Commissioner Carly Kind has found that Kmart Australia Limited (Kmart) breached Australians’ privacy by collecting their personal and sensitive information through a facial recognition technology (FRT) system designed to tackle refund fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between June 2020 and July 2022, Kmart deployed FRT to capture the faces of every person who entered 28 of its retail stores, and all individuals who presented at a returns counter, in an attempt to identify people committing refund fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a determination published today, the Privacy Commissioner found that Kmart did not notify shoppers or seek their consent to use FRT to collect their biometric information, which is sensitive personal information and enjoys higher protections under the Privacy Act.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The retailer argued that it was not required to obtain consent because of an exemption in the Privacy Act that applies when organisations reasonably believe that they need to collect personal information to tackle unlawful activity or serious misconduct. The Privacy Commissioner’s determination focused on assessing whether Kmart met the conditions for relying on the exemption, and concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The sensitive biometric information of every individual who entered a store was indiscriminately collected by the FRT system.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;There were other less privacy intrusive methods available to Kmart to address refund fraud.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Deploying the FRT system to prevent fraud was of limited utility.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Considering that the FRT system impacted on the privacy of many thousands of individuals not suspected of refund fraud, the collection of biometric information on Kmart customers was a disproportionate interference with privacy.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Understanding how FRT accords with the protections contained in Privacy Act requires me to balance the interests of individuals in having their privacy protected, on the one hand, and the interests of entities in carrying out their functions or activities, on the other. Relevant to a technology like facial recognition, is also the public interest in protecting privacy,” the Privacy Commissioner said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Relevant factors considered by the Commissioner included the estimated value of fraudulent returns against the respondent’s total operations and profits, the limited effectiveness of the FRT system, and the extent of the privacy impacts in collecting the sensitive information of every individual who entered the relevant stores.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“I do not consider that the respondent (Kmart) could have reasonably believed that the benefits of the FRT system in addressing refund fraud proportionately outweighed the impact on individuals’ privacy,” the Commissioner stated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The determination is the second issued by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) on the use of FRT in retail settings. In October 2024, the Privacy Commissioner found that Bunnings Group Limited had contravened Australians’ privacy through their use of FRT in 62 of its retail stores across Australia. That decision is currently under review by the Administrative Review Tribunal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“These two decisions do not impose a ban on the use of FRT. The human rights to safety and privacy are not mutually exclusive; rather, both must be preserved, upheld and promoted. Customer and staff safety, and fraud prevention and detection, are legitimate reasons businesses might have regard to when considering the deployment of new technologies. However, these reasons are not, in and of themselves, a free pass to avoid compliance with the Privacy Act,” she stated.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Commissioner’s determination is instructive for entities that are considering new technologies such as FRT. Privacy considerations should be a key feature. The OAIC has also published guidance on its website: Facial recognition technology: a guide to assessing the privacy risks&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kmart has been under investigation by the OAIC since July 2022, at which time it ceased operating the FRT system. It has cooperated with the OAIC throughout the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although the Privacy Commissioner reached a similar conclusion in the Kmart and Bunnings decisions, the cases differ considerably and focus on different uses of FRT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Privacy Act is technology-neutral and does not proscribe the use of any particular technology. When considering the roll-out and use of new technologies such as FRT, the OAIC’s guidance encourages entities to consider factors such as proportionality, transparency, the risk of bias and discrimination, and governance for the collection, use and retention of sensitive personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Commissioner Kind has published a blog post with further takeaways for other retailers considering using FRT.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A duo of Tesla shareholder-influencers tried to complete Elon Musk’s coast-to-coast self-driving ride that he claimed Tesla would be able to do in 2017 and they crashed before making it about 60 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2016, Elon Musk infamously said that Tesla would complete a fully self-driving coast-to-coast drive between Los Angeles and New York by the end of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The idea was to livestream or film a full unedited drive coast-to-coast with the vehicle driving itself at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are in 2025 and Tesla never made that drive.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the many missed autonomous driving goals, many Tesla shareholders believe that the company is on the verge of delivering unsupervised self-driving following the rollout of its ‘Robotaxi’ fleet in Austin, which requires supervision from Tesla employees inside the vehicles, and improvements to its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) systems inside consumer vehicles, which is still only a level 2 driver assist system that requires driver attention at all times as per Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two of these Tesla shareholders and online influencers attempted to undertake a coast-to-coast drive between San Diego, CA, and Jacksonville, FL, in a Tesla Model Y equipped with the latest FSD software update.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They didn’t make it out of California without crashing into easily avoidable road debris that badly damaged the Tesla Model Y:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the video, you can see that the driver doesn’t have his hands on the steering wheel. The passenger spots the debris way ahead of time. There was plenty of time to react, but the driver didn’t get his hands on the steering wheel until the last second.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a follow-up video, the two Tesla influencers confirmed that the Model Y had a broken sway bar bracket and damaged suspension components. The vehicle is also throwing out a lot of warnings.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They made it about 2.5% of the planned trip on Tesla FSD v13.9 before crashing the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Electrek’s Take&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tesla shareholders used to discuss this somewhat rationally back in the day, but now that Tesla’s EV business is in decline and the stock price depends entirely on the self-driving and robot promises, they no longer do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I recall when Musk himself used to say that when you reach 99% self-driving, it is when the “march of the 9s” begins, and you must achieve 99.999999999% autonomy to have a truly useful self-driving system. He admitted that this is the most challenging part as the real-world is unpredictable and hard to simulate – throwing a lot of challenging scenario at you, such as debris on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s where Tesla is right now. The hard part has just started. And there’s no telling how long it will take to get there. If someone is telling you that they know, they are lying. I don’t know. My best estimate is approximately 2-3 years and a new hardware suite.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, competition, mainly Waymo, began its own “march of the 9s” about five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tesla is still years behind, and something like this drive by these two Tesla influencers proves it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Top comment by HBrown&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I don't get why there is so much criticism of the youtubers in these comments. Instead of blindly believing Elon's claims that FSD is right around the corner, they actually took the time and effort to conduct a significant real world test. And then when things did not turn out well for the Tesla, they were still honest enough to put the video on youtube. The showed both the full incident and the aftermath. It seemed rather rational and evenhanded to me. I wish all Tesla and Elon fans acted in such a manner.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was actually in a similar accident in a Tesla Model 3 back in 2020. I rented a Model 3 on Turo for a trip to Las Vegas from Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I ended up driving over a blown-out truck tire in the middle of the road like this. I was Autopilot, but I don’t know if the car saw it. I definitely saw it, but it was a bit late as I was following a truck that just drove over it. I had probably less than 2 seconds to react. I applied the brakes, but my choices were driving into a ditch on the right or into a car in the left lane.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I managed to reduce the force of the impact with the braking, but the vehicle jumped a bit like in this video. There wasn’t really any damage to the front, but the bottom cover was flapping down. I taped it together at the next gas station and I was able to continue the trip without much issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, after returning it to the Turo owner and having the suspension damage evaluated by Tesla, the repair job was estimated to be roughly $10,000. I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a similar situation with this accident.&lt;/p&gt;
