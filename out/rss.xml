    &lt;p&gt;Learn Prolog Now! is an introductory course to programming in Prolog. The online version has been available since 2001, and now there is also a throughly revised version available in book form.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We wanted to do two things with this course. First, we wanted to provide a text that was relatively self contained, a text that would permit someone with little or no knowledge of computing to pick up the basics of Prolog with the minimum of fuss. We also wanted the text to be clear enough to make it useful for self study. We believe that if you read the text, and do the associated exercises, you will gain a useful partial entry to the world of Prolog.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But only a partial entry, and this brings us to our second point. We want to emphasize the practical aspects of Prolog. Prolog is something you do. You can't learn a programming language simply by reading about it, and if you really want to get the most out of this course, we strongly advise you to get hold of a Prolog interpreter (you'll find pointers to some nice ones on this website) and work through all the Practical Sessions that we provide. And of course, don't stop with what we provide. The more you program, the better you'll get....&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy the course. And whether you're using this book to teach yourself Prolog, or you're using it as the basis for teaching others, we would like to hear from you. Please send us any comments/corrections you have so that we can take them into account in later versions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The American penny passed away today after a prolonged illness. It was 238 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last penny was minted Wednesday afternoon at the US Mint in Philadelphia, overseen by US Treasurer Brandon Beach. President Donald Trump announced via social media in February that he instructed the Mint to stop making the once-popular coin, citing the cost of production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The penny costs nearly four cents to mint, more than the coin’s worth. Once valuable enough to buy “penny candy” like gumballs and feed parking meters or toll booths, today the penny lives mostly in coin jars, junk drawers or “leave a penny/take a penny” trays.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Beach said Wednesday that the final coins pressed will be auctioned off and that the actual last pennies put into circulation from the US Mint were struck in June.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The penny outlived its sibling, the half-penny, by 168 years. It’s survived by the nickel, dime, quarter, and rarely seen half-dollar and dollar coins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite its demise, the penny will remain legal tender.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Problems despite long planned end&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For a coin that seems obsolete, its removal from circulation is causing more problems than expected, especially for retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some merchants plan to round prices to the nearest nickel, often a penny or two more. Others are asking customers to pay with pennies to help supply. But in some states, merchants could face legal trouble for rounding up or down.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, any savings from discontinuing the one-cent coin could be offset by the need to press more nickels, which costs the US Mint more money than the penny.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The government’s phasing out of the penny has been “a bit chaotic,” said Mark Weller, executive director of Americans for Common Cents. The pro-penny group is funded primarily by Artazn, the company that provides the blanks used to make pennies. “By the time we reach Christmas, the problems will be more pronounced with retailers not having pennies.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Weller said other countries that removed low denomination coins, like Canada, Australia and Switzerland, had guidance for afterwards. Not so in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We had a social media post (by Trump) during Super Bowl Sunday, but no real plan for what retailers would have to do,” he said, referring to the president’s February announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Different rounding plans&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kwik Trip, a family-owned convenience store chain that operates in the Midwest, decided to round down cash purchases in stores where it hasn’t been able to find pennies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“There’s no way that we wanted to charge (customers) an extra 2 cents because we just didn’t think that was fair,” said John McHugh, spokesperson for the company. “I mean, it’s not their fault that there there’s a penny shortage.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But with 20 million customers a year, and 17% of them paying with cash, the policy will eventually cost Kwik Trip a couple of million dollars a year, McHugh said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s not just businesses that face increased costs. Rounding to the closest nickel will cost consumers about $6 million a year, according to a July study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. That is fairly modest, coming to about five cents each across 133 million American households.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And rounding is not a national solution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Four states - Delaware, Connecticut, Michigan and Oregon - as well as numerous cities, including New York, Philadelphia, Miami and Washington, DC, require merchants to provide exact change, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition, the law covering the federal food assistance program known as SNAP requires that recipients not be charged more than other customers. Since SNAP recipients use a debit card that’s charged the precise amount, if merchants round down prices for cash purchases, they could be opening themselves to legal problems and fines, said Jeff Lenard, spokesperson for NACS.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Rounding down on all transactions presents several challenges beyond the loss of an average of 2 cents per transaction,” Lenard said. “We desperately need legislation that allows rounding so retailers can make change for these customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For that reason, NACS and other retail groups recently wrote to Congress asking for legislation to deal with the questions raised by the end of penny production.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;End of a ‘wonderful life’&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The penny was one of the nation’s first coins, first minted in 1787, six years before the Mint itself was established.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Benjamin Franklin is widely credited with designing the first penny known as the Fugio cent. Its current form arrived in 1909 on the centennial of Abraham Lincoln’s birth, when it became the first American coin to feature a president.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But it has declined in both use and popularity ever since. The Treasury Department now says there are an estimated 300 billion pennies in circulation. That comes to a bit less than $9 for every American. But most of those coins are “severely underutilized.” So, outcry from the public over its demise has been muted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Joe Ditler, a 74-year old writer and historian from Colorado, said he still has an old cigar box filled with mostly pennies given to him by his grandfather. He remembers flattening pennies on railroad tracks or souvenir machines in amusement parks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, he only occasionally uses pennies to make a cash purchase. And he often tosses the one-cent coin in the tip jar.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“They bring back memories that have stayed with me all my life,” he said. “The penny has had a wonderful life. But it’s probably time for it to go away.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;About Project Euler&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What is Project Euler?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.&lt;lb/&gt; The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Who are the problems aimed at?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The intended audience include students for whom the basic curriculum is not feeding their hunger to learn, adults whose background was not primarily mathematics but had an interest in things mathematical, and professionals who want to keep their problem solving and mathematics on the cutting edge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Currently we have 1364972 registered members who have solved at least one problem, representing 220 locations throughout the world, and collectively using 113 different programming languages to solve the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Can anyone solve the problems?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The problems range in difficulty and for many the experience is inductive chain learning. That is, by solving one problem it will expose you to a new concept that may allow you to undertake a previously inaccessible problem. So determined participants will be able to slowly but surely work their way through the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What next?&lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi HN, We’re Jamie &amp;amp; Dan, building JSX Tool (&lt;/p&gt;https://jsxtool.com&lt;p&gt;) a new inspector/dev panel IDE that allows you to navigate to any line of your React project’s JSX with just a click and a command click to explore your render stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIIXvN7vhrs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been writing React code for nearly a decade. Since I first saw source maps in the days of Babel and Redux, I’ve always wanted to be able to edit my code from the source maps. I’ve also always wanted to be able to inspect my JSX like it was HTML.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, I found my first real use of AI was taking ad-hoc CSS changes in the Chrome element inspector, pasting them into ChatGPT, and asking for the equivalent in Tailwind. I’d then paste those changes into my React TSX files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to streamline this process but came to the conclusion that to do so I needed to build a JSX inspector. I had to write a custom AST parser to create a mapping between the JSX and HTML. So I hacked on an inspector for a couple of months that connected JSX to the DOM in both directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next feature was adding a CSS editor, like the one in the browser inspectors but for JSX. Unlike styling a piece of HTML I decided that any in memory style edits to a React fiber should be globally applied, as if you had tweaked that line of code in your codebase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I was able to add the two AI features I really wanted: (1) prompt for in-memory styles for when I was pixel tweaking, and (2) save those temporary changes back to my codebase in the convention of the codebase I was working in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accomplish talking to the filesystem from the Chrome extension I built a little local server that mounts from the root of your project and allows the extension to send file-system commands back to your project root. We named this the “Dev Server”. (Note: You can fully use us as a JSX inspector without this server installed.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all that, I found that to convert myself as a user I needed it to be a pretty fully functional IDE. I needed vim bindings, I needed a typechecker, I needed auto-complete, I needed a linter, I needed code search and I needed a proper file explorer. Fortunately we were able to take advantage of the dev-server architecture we had stumbled onto in order to add an LSP server and Rip Grep. At this point, after months of dog fooding, I use JSX Tool for almost all of my website edits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re still rough around the edges for mobile but we’re working on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the IDE stuff not involving AI is free and works fine without AI. We let you get a taste of the prompting stuff for free but apply some rate limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extension itself is not open source but the dev server with the LSP is. It’s a great foundation if you want to build any sort of in-browser IDE and it's nearly React agnostic. Building the dev server was a big undertaking so I’d love to see someone fork it and find value in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future we want to start adding things that we are in a position to take advantage of over something like Cursor, such as letting AI give you code suggestions for runtime exceptions or work with the network logs. We think that the convenience of having your IDE in the dev panel gives us a leg up in convenience and workflow context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, regardless of how you feel about AI coding, I wanted to make something that was useful with or without AI. We’d love it if you gave it a spin and we want to share anything we can about the technical side of the product that you might find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It will double as a conventional (Linux-based) PC. The Steam Machine uses a semi-custom AMD Zen 4 based SoC with RDNA3 graphics and 16GB of RAM and 8GB of GDDR6 vRAM.&lt;lb/&gt;The Steam Frame is their lightweight VR headset that is wireless and said to be comfortable. The Steam Frame is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 ARM64 SoC with 16GB of LPDDR5x RAM and running SteamOS.&lt;lb/&gt;These new Steam devices will be coming out in "early 2026". Exact launch timing and pricing will be shared in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Making the Clang AST Leaner and Faster&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modern C++ codebases — from browsers to GPU frameworks — rely heavily on templates, and that often means massive abstract syntax trees. Even small inefficiencies in Clang’s AST representation can add up to noticeable compile-time overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post walks through a set of structural improvements I recently made to Clang’s AST that make type representation smaller, simpler, and faster to create — leading to measurable build-time gains in real-world projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago, I landed a large patch in Clang that brought substantial compile-time improvements for heavily templated C++ code.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, in stdexec — the reference implementation of the &lt;code&gt;std::execution&lt;/code&gt; feature slated for C++26 — the slowest test (&lt;code&gt;test_on2.cpp&lt;/code&gt;) saw a 7% reduction in build time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also the Chromium build showed a 5% improvement (source).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At a high level, the patch makes the Clang AST leaner: it reduces the memory footprint of type representations and lowers the cost of creating and uniquing them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These improvements will ship with Clang 22, expected in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;How elaboration and qualified names used to work&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider this simple snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;namespace NS {
  struct A {};
}
using T = struct NS::A;
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The type of &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;struct NS::A&lt;/code&gt;) carries two pieces of information:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It’s elaborated — the &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;keyword appears.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;It’s qualified — &lt;code&gt;NS::&lt;/code&gt;acts as a nested-name-specifier.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Here’s how the AST dump looked before this patch:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;ElaboratedType 'struct NS::A' sugar
`-RecordType 'test::NS::A'
  `-CXXRecord 'A'
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;RecordType&lt;/code&gt; represents a direct reference to the previously declared &lt;code&gt;struct A&lt;/code&gt; — a kind of canonical view of the type, stripped of syntactic details like &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; or namespace qualifiers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Those syntactic details were stored separately in an &lt;code&gt;ElaboratedType&lt;/code&gt; node that wrapped the &lt;code&gt;RecordType&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, an &lt;code&gt;ElaboratedType&lt;/code&gt; node existed even when no elaboration or qualification appeared in the source (example). This was needed to distinguish between an explicitly unqualified type and one that lost its qualifiers through template substitution.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, this design was expensive: every &lt;code&gt;ElaboratedType&lt;/code&gt; node consumed 48 bytes, and creating one required extra work to uniquify it — an important step for Clang’s fast type comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A more compact representation&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new approach removes &lt;code&gt;ElaboratedType&lt;/code&gt; entirely. Instead, elaboration and qualifiers are now stored directly inside &lt;code&gt;RecordType&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The new AST dump for the same example looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;RecordType 'struct NS::A' struct
|-NestedNameSpecifier Namespace 'NS'
`-CXXRecord 'A'
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; elaboration now fits into previously unused bits within &lt;code&gt;RecordType&lt;/code&gt;, while the qualifier is tail-allocated when present — making the node variably sized.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This change both shrinks the memory footprint and eliminates one level of indirection when traversing the AST.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Representing &lt;code&gt;NestedNameSpecifier&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;NestedNameSpecifier&lt;/code&gt; is Clang’s internal representation for name qualifiers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before this patch, it was represented by a pointer (&lt;code&gt;NestedNameSpecifier*&lt;/code&gt;) to a uniqued structure that could describe:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The global namespace (&lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A named namespace (including aliases)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A type&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An identifier naming an unknown entity&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A &lt;code&gt;__super&lt;/code&gt;reference (Microsoft extension)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For all but cases (1) and (5), each &lt;code&gt;NestedNameSpecifier&lt;/code&gt; also held a prefix — the qualifier to its left.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;Namespace::Class::NestedClassTemplate&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;::XX
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This would be stored as a linked list:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;[id: XX] -&amp;gt; [type: NestedClassTemplate&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;] -&amp;gt; [type: Class] -&amp;gt; [namespace: Namespace]
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Internally, that meant seven allocations totaling around 160 bytes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;NestedNameSpecifier&lt;/code&gt;(identifier) – 16 bytes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;NestedNameSpecifier&lt;/code&gt;(type) – 16 bytes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;TemplateSpecializationType&lt;/code&gt;– 48 bytes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;QualifiedTemplateName&lt;/code&gt;– 16 bytes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;NestedNameSpecifier&lt;/code&gt;(type) – 16 bytes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;RecordType&lt;/code&gt;– 32 bytes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;NestedNameSpecifier&lt;/code&gt;(namespace) – 16 bytes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The real problem wasn’t just size — it was the uniquing cost. Every prospective node has to be looked up in a hash table for a pre-existing instance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, &lt;code&gt;ElaboratedType&lt;/code&gt; nodes sometimes leaked into these chains, which wasn’t supposed to happen and led to several long-standing bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;A new, smarter &lt;code&gt;NestedNameSpecifier&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After this patch, &lt;code&gt;NestedNameSpecifier&lt;/code&gt; becomes a compact, tagged pointer — just one machine word wide.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pointer uses 8-byte alignment, leaving three spare bits. Two bits are used for kind discrimination, and one remains available for arbitrary use.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When non-null, the tag bits encode:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A type&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A declaration (either a &lt;code&gt;__super&lt;/code&gt;class or a namespace)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A namespace prefixed by the global scope (&lt;code&gt;::Namespace&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;A special object combining a namespace with its prefix&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When null, the tag bits instead encode:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An empty nested name (the terminator)&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The global name&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;An invalid/tombstone entry (for hash tables)&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other changes include:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The “unknown identifier” case is now represented by a &lt;code&gt;DependentNameType&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;Type prefixes are handled directly in the type hierarchy.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Revisiting the earlier example, after the patch its AST dump becomes:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;DependentNameType 'Namespace::Class::NestedClassTemplate&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;::XX' dependent
`-NestedNameSpecifier TemplateSpecializationType 'Namespace::Class::NestedClassTemplate&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;' dependent
  `-name: 'Namespace::Class::NestedClassTemplate' qualified
    |-NestedNameSpecifier RecordType 'Namespace::Class'
    | |-NestedNameSpecifier Namespace 'Namespace'
    | `-CXXRecord 'Class'
    `-ClassTemplate NestedClassTemplate
&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This representation now requires only four allocations (156 bytes total):&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ol"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;DependentNameType&lt;/code&gt;– 48 bytes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;TemplateSpecializationType&lt;/code&gt;– 48 bytes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;QualifiedTemplateName&lt;/code&gt;– 16 bytes&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;RecordType&lt;/code&gt;– 40 bytes&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That’s almost half the number of nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While &lt;code&gt;DependentNameType&lt;/code&gt; is larger than the previous 16-byte “identifier” node, the additional space isn’t wasted — it holds cached answers to common queries such as “does this type reference a template parameter?” or “what is its canonical form?”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These caches make those operations significantly cheaper, further improving performance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s more in the patch than what I’ve covered here, including:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;RecordType&lt;/code&gt;now points directly to the declaration found at creation, enriching the AST without measurable overhead.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;&lt;code&gt;RecordType&lt;/code&gt;nodes are now created lazily.&lt;/item&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;The redesigned &lt;code&gt;NestedNameSpecifier&lt;/code&gt;simplified several template instantiation transforms.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each of these could warrant its own write-up, but even this high-level overview shows how careful structural changes in the AST can lead to tangible compile-time wins.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope you found this deep dive into Clang’s internals interesting — and that it gives a glimpse of the kind of small, structural optimizations that add up to real performance improvements in large C++ builds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create debates with your favorite thinkers. Shape what gets discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tomorrow at 7PM • Hosted by Sarah Chen&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Join our debate as nutrition experts discuss the controversial topic of seed oils and their impact on human health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Three ways to participate&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every ticket directly funds the debates you want to see&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your support helps your favorite thinkers earn from sharing their knowledge&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be part of making important debates happen on topics you care about&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;$5&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make this debate happen&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;$25&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make this debate happen&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;$99&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make this debate happen&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use X Spaces, YouTube, or any other platform&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Logosive handles all ticketing and payments&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Earn from every ticket sold&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zero upfront cost&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Audiences are waiting&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You purchase tickets in advance but will not be charged until after the debate is completed. If a debate is cancelled, you pay nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Debaters earn a significant share of ticket revenue based on the agreement with organizers. For popular debates, this can mean $10,000-$100,000+. You also grow your audience and establish thought leadership in your field.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes! Creating debates is completely free. Logosive only takes a platform fee when tickets are sold and the debate completes successfully. This aligns our incentives - we only make money when you do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Debates happen on platforms you already use: X Spaces, YouTube Live, Zoom, etc. Logosive handles ticketing and payments while you use familiar tools. Before each debate, you'll receive the link to join.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes! Debates can be created by debaters or hosts. You can create a debate, participate in it, and earn from ticket sales. Of course, you can also create debates without being a debater or host - Logosive supports both options.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;VIP ticket holders can submit questions for the debaters. Premier and VIP holders vote on which questions should be asked. Questions with the most votes get asked during the debate, so the audience directly shapes the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every ticket helps make debates happen. Higher tiers let you shape the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI Agents for Commercial Lending&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engineering at Omni&lt;lb/&gt; We’re building the AI-powered infrastructure layer for small business lending. Helping banks and fintechs automate the messy work of collecting documents, filling out financial models, and doing public research on millions of SMBs across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are 34 million small businesses in the U.S., and every one of them needs capital. We’re making it radically easier for lenders to serve them. At Omni we run everything from initial application, third party data aggregation, OCR and financial data extraction, and continuous borrower communication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can see a demo of the product here: https://finovate.com/videos/finovatefall-2025-omniai/&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This role is on site in San Francisco. No exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE), you’ll work directly with our customers — banks, fintechs, and lenders — to bring Omni’s platform to life inside their organizations. You’ll sit alongside their teams, design integrations, and help transform how they operate day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expect to:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a deeply technical and highly visible role. You’ll be both an engineer and an ambassador, shaping how banks adopt AI-first infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s a lot that goes into commercial lending, and we’re tackling every step of the process. Some of the core concepts will be:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll also help bridge the gap between our engineering roadmap and the real-world challenges lenders face.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We primarily use **Node, TypeScript, React/Next.js, Postgres, Docker, and K8.**&lt;lb/&gt; We integrate with external systems like Salesforce, Hubspot, nCino, and several bank specific core systems (Jack Henry, Fiserv, etc.). This role also requires willingness to occasionally get your hands dirty with some esoteric banking tech. We’re talking SOAP APIs, SFTP servers, and the occasional fax machine API.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the AI side, we mainly interface with OpenAI and Gemini models. Customers can deploy Omni either via cloud or VPC, so familiarity with containerization and DevOps is valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Competitive Pay &amp;amp; Equity: Attractive salary and meaningful equity packages&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Health &amp;amp; Wellness: Medical, dental, and vision coverage for you and your family&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flexible Time Off: Unlimited PTO and paid holidays&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Daily Lunch: Team meals provided&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Real Impact: Own and ship features you believe in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Phone Screen&lt;lb/&gt; Take 30 minutes to chat with one of the founders. Learn a bit about your interests, and share what we’re working on at Omni. We are looking for people with a strong interest in startups, and would love to hear about prior startup experience. Also really interested in seeing any open source work.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Architecture Interview&lt;lb/&gt; A 1 hour call with both founders where we design a hypothetical feature. There’s no coding involved. Instead we’ll discuss a new feature, and do a collaborative walk though of the architecture required. We want to think about everything from database design to UI.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Onsite&lt;lb/&gt; You’ll spend the day working with us at our SF office. Meals will be covered, as well as any travel and accommodation. We’ll spend the day building out an MVP of the feature we planned out during the architecture interview. You'll be using your own computer, and using whatever language/environment you are most comfortable with. By the end of the day we are expecting two things:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At Omni, we’re rebuilding how banks and fintechs lend to small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are 34 million small businesses in the U.S., yet getting a loan still means weeks of emails, PDFs, and paperwork. Every deal starts with a pile of documents — tax returns, bank statements, corporate filings, and contracts that no one wants to read but everyone depends on.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Omni is changing that. We work directly with lenders to modernize the entire stack, from document intake to underwriting, and we’re doing it with a small, fast-moving team that ships real systems used in production every day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Verification&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;list rend="ul"&gt;
      &lt;item&gt; This issue's title and/or description do not reference a single formula e.g. &lt;code&gt;brew install wget&lt;/code&gt;. If they do, open an issue at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/new/choose instead.&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;--no-quarantine&lt;/code&gt; is used to forcibly bypass Gatekeeper, which is a built-in macOS security mechanism. This is used to run unsigned/unnotarized applications.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;macOS Tahoe is the final release to support Intel systems, and last year Apple updated macOS runtime protection to make it harder to override Gatekeeper. Macs with Apple silicon also don't "permit native arm64 code to execute unless a valid signature is attached". Finally, we are ending support for all casks that fail Gatekeeper checks on September 1st, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With the above in mind, it's time to deprecate the &lt;code&gt;--no-quarantine&lt;/code&gt; flag from &lt;code&gt;brew&lt;/code&gt;. It intentionally bypasses macOS security mechanisms, which we already actively discourage. Deprecating now will give a decent lead time for users using it to come up with another solution or adjust their workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What is the motivation for the feature?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel support is coming to an end from both Apple and Homebrew. This flag is primarily used to override a macOS security mechanism, which we do not want to encourage. Since we are requiring casks fulfill Gatekeeper checks next year, there is no reason to keep this flag.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;How will the feature be relevant to at least 90% of Homebrew users?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will provide a safer experience for our users, and stop making it easier to bypass OS-level security.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h3"&gt;What alternatives to the feature have been considered?&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;None. Macs with Apple silicon are the platform that will be supported in the future, and Apple is making it harder to bypass Gatekeeper as is.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;November 12, 2025Marble, our frontier multimodal world model, is available to everyone starting today&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Marble: A Multimodal World Model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spatial intelligence is the next frontier in AI, demanding powerful world models to realize its full potential. World models should reconstruct, generate, and simulate 3D worlds; and allow both humans and agents to interact with them. Spatially intelligent world models will transform a wide variety of industries over the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two months ago we shared a preview of Marble, our World Model that creates 3D worlds from image or text prompts. Since then, Marble has been available to an early set of beta users to create 3D worlds for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today we are making Marble, a first-in-class generative multimodal world model, generally available for anyone to use. We have also drastically expanded Marble's capabilities, and are excited to highlight them here:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multimodal Marble: Marble is now massively multimodal. Marble can create 3D worlds from text, images, video, or coarse 3D layouts; Marble also lets you interactively edit, expand, and combine worlds. Once generated, 3D worlds can be exported as Gaussian splats, meshes, or videos. These new capabilities let users create and edit worlds with fine-grained control; and makes those worlds more useful than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marble Labs: We are launching Marble Labs, a creative hub where imagination meets experimentation. It is where artists, engineers, and designers push the boundaries of world models, showcasing bold ideas, real-world workflows, and new possibilities across gaming, VFX, design, robotics, and beyond. Marble Labs is also home to in-depth case studies, tutorials, and documentation that give anyone the tools to learn, build, and share their own 3D worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sign up at marble.worldlabs.ai and start creating worlds for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;The Marble World Model&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Our human experience of the world is inherently multimodal: we use all of our senses to make sense of the world around us. We integrate sight, sound, touch, and language to build up a mental model of the outside world; these different representations work together, enriching and reinforcing each other to let us reason about the world and act within it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;World models should work similarly. They should be massively multimodal, able to lift whatever input signals are available into a full 3D world, and they should be able to iteratively update their understanding of the world as new information becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marble is the first of its kind - a next-generation world model making strides toward this vision. It can now create 3D worlds from a wide variety of input types, and lets users iteratively edit or expand worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marble's new capabilities let you dive as deep as you want in controlling your generated worlds. You can quickly create full 3D worlds from a simple image or text prompt or interactively edit worlds in both 2D and 3D, bringing to life a precise vision of a world in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Text and Image to World&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To start, Marble can create a full 3D world from a single image or a short text prompt. This is the simplest and easiest way to create worlds. Marble can generate worlds with a wide variety of scene types and artistic styles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Image prompts make it easy to combine Marble with other AI tools. You can generate images with your favorite image generation model, then bring it to Marble to lift it to a full 3D world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Text and image prompts are intuitive and powerful, but limited in creative control: Marble must invent all the details of the world that are not present in the input text or image prompt. This is often magical; but sometimes you may want to steer Marble more directly toward a desired world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Multi-Image and Video to World&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An easy way to create worlds with more creative control is multi-image prompting. Marble can accept different prompt images for different parts of the world, stitching them together into a unified 3D world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multi-image prompts let you create worlds with more precision. Unlike text or single-image prompts where Marble must invent all parts of the world not present in the prompt, with multi-image prompts you can control what the generated world will look like from different angles.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This leads to a brand-new workflow for generating worlds. You can use your favorite image generation tool to iterate separately on the input views, and Marble will lift them into full 3D worlds while also adding seamless transitions between the input views.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multi-image prompts can also be used to create worlds inspired by real-world spaces. Marble can input a few photos or a short video depicting a real-world location from different angles, and it will combine them to generate a 3D world with elements of the real-world space.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;World Editing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The creative process is highly iterative for many users. Often, generating a world is only the start of a creative journey. Seeing a generated 3D world often kicks off a dozen more ideas for changing it or improving it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marble includes AI-native world editing tools. Edits can be small and local: remove an object, touch up an area. They can also be more drastic: swap objects, change the visual style, or re-structure large parts of the world. This gives a new level of fine-grained control to the world creation process.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edited&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edited&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edited&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;World editing lets you re-imagine the same space in endless different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edited&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edited&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edited&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edited&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edited&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Chisel: Sculpting Worlds in 3D&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marble's multimodal inputs and editing features give a lot of control over your generated 3D worlds. But sometimes, creating the world exactly as you see it in your mind's eye requires finer-grained control over the scene layout or exact sizes and positions of objects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For these situations we are introducing Chisel, an AI-native tool to sculpt Marble worlds directly in 3D.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chisel is a new experimental editing mode for advanced users to create 3D worlds. It lets you lay out the coarse structure of your world in 3D using coarse 3D shapes like boxes or planes, or importing existing 3D assets into the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After laying out the coarse 3D scene, you can add a text prompt to describe the visual style of the scene, or additional elements not present in the coarse layout. Marble will combine these inputs to give you a fully detailed 3D world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chisel decouples structure from style. The coarse 3D scene determines the world's structure, while the text prompt controls its overall style. The two can be mixed in any combination, adding a whole new dimension of control to world generation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generated World&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coarse 3D&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coarse 3D After&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coarse 3D Before&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generated World After&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generated World Before&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The coarse 3D scene can be as simple or complex as you want. In addition to building the coarse 3D scene out of basic blocks and walls, you can import existing 3D assets of objects. Objects will be restyled based on the text prompt to give a cohesive 3D world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Varying the text prompt can give rise to 3D worlds with drastically different visual styles and appearances that all share a common structure determined by the coarse 3D scene.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Generated World&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coarse 3D&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Building Large Worlds by Expanding and Composing&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes bigger really is better. Larger worlds give more possibilities, more space, more room for your creativity to shine. Marble offers two ways to make bigger worlds than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After a world has been generated, Marble allows one-step expansion to make it larger. You are in control of this process: you can select a region of the world to be expanded, and Marble will create more content to fill the selected region.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expansion can make worlds larger. Regions of the world that previously broke down into artifacts can become crisp and clean after expansion. Expansion can also be used to add detail to targeted regions of a world. Sometimes the back of a table or the far corner of a room is not a crisp as the room's center; expanding the world in that region can improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expanded World&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initial World&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expanded World&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initial World&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expanded World&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initial World&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expanded World&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Initial World&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to generating individual worlds, you can compose any number of worlds to build out extremely large spaces with Marble's composer mode. This composition is entirely under your control: you can choose exactly which worlds to compose, and exactly how to lay them out relative to each other. Composing is yet another way to build worlds that follow your creative vision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;Exporting Worlds to 3D and Video&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After creating a world with Marble you have many options to export it for incorporation into downstream projects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gaussian splats are the highest-fidelity representation for Marble worlds. They represent 3D scenes as a large set of semitransparent particles. You can render Gaussian splats in the browser using Spark, our open-source cross-platform renderer integrated with THREE.js.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marble worlds can also be exported as triangle meshes. Marble can generate both collider meshes, which are low-fidelity meshes intended for coarse physics simulation; and high-quality meshes which are intended to match the visual fidelity of Gaussian splats as closely as possible. Exporting worlds as meshes lets them interoperate with many industry-standard tools.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mesh&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Splats&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mesh with lighting&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mesh with lighting&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marble worlds exist in full 3D, but sometimes a video is the best way to share a world. You can use Marble to render generated worlds to videos with pixel-accurate camera control, letting you frame every shot just as you imagine it. In fact, nearly all the videos in this post were generated directly from Marble.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Marble can also enhance exported videos. Enhanced videos can add detail, remove artifacts, and add dynamic elements to the scene, while maintaining pixel-perfect camera control and adhering to the structure of the generated 3D world.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhanced Video&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original Video&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhanced Video&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original Video&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhanced Video&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Original Video&lt;/p&gt;

We introduce Jasmine, a performant JAX-based world modeling codebase that scales from single hosts to hundreds of accelerators with minimal code changes. Jasmine achieves an order-of-magnitude faster reproduction of the CoinRun case study compared to prior open implementations, enabled by performance optimizations across data loading, training and checkpointing. The codebase guarantees fully reproducible training and supports diverse sharding configurations. By pairing Jasmine with curated large-scale datasets, we establish infrastructure for rigorous benchmarking pipelines across model families and architectural ablations.&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;head rend="h3"&gt;References &amp;amp; Citations&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; export BibTeX citation Loading... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Bibliographic and Citation Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litmaps (What is Litmaps?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; alphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DagsHub (What is DagsHub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gotit.pub (What is GotitPub?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hugging Face (What is Huggingface?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Demos&lt;/head&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Recommenders and Search Tools&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt; Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CORE Recommender (What is CORE?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IArxiv Recommender (What is IArxiv?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;head rend="h1"&gt;arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators&lt;/head&gt;&lt;p&gt;arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

  &lt;main&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time in humanity's long history, a human-made object will soon be a full light-day away from our home planet.&lt;/p&gt;The rest of this article is behind a paywall. Please sign in or subscribe to access the full content.&lt;p&gt;Space, as they say, is pretty big, and human-made objects are slow. The record speed any human has ever traveled was set by Apollo 10 back in 1969, and has not been broken since. The fastest human spaceflight remains 39,937.7 kilometers per hour (24,816.1 miles per hour), and at those speeds, it would take 3,730 hours to travel just 1 astronomical unit (AU), the distance between the Earth and the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At around 155 days, that's an unacceptable travel time to (for example) slam into the Sun. And while it takes you 155 days to get wherever it is you went, light and communications from Earth would reach you in about 8 minutes and 20 seconds, really rubbing it in how great it is to be massless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we will get a real reminder of the vast distance and incredible speed of light in late 2026, when Voyager 1 becomes the first human-made object to reach one light-day away from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spacecraft was launched in 1977 and has been traveling ever since. At the time of writing, it is around 169.5 AU from the Earth, having become the first spacecraft to go beyond the heliosphere, cross the heliopause, and enter interstellar space. At its current position, it takes 23 hours, 29 minutes, and 27 seconds for signals from Earth to reach the spacecraft. At its current speed of about 61,198 kilometers per hour (38,027 miles per hour), it will still take over a year to widen that light-distance to a full 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it does reach 25.9 billion kilometers (16 billion miles) from Earth, a journey that took nearly 50 years, it will finally be the distance that light can travel in a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to calculations from IFLScience's resident astronomer, Dr Alfredo Carpineti, using data from NASA's Eyes on the Solar System, this will occur on November 13, 2026. After this date, the probe will not fall within 24 light-hours from Earth again, despite the Earth-to-Voyager distance changing as we orbit the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, it will continue on its course, guided by NASA until it runs out of power, likely in the early 2030s. But its journey will be far from over. First, it will leave the Solar System, passing through the Oort cloud, before having at least one close encounter with another star, Gliese 445, in the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The distant Oort cloud marks the gravitational edge of the Solar System, in a vast region of undiscovered objects," NASA explains of the Oort cloud, first hypothesized by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1950. "Short-period comets may originate in the scattered disk, inner, part of the Oort cloud, while long-period comets likely come from the spherical, outer portion of the Oort cloud. These comets only pass the Sun on rare occasions, possibly when disturbed by distant passing stars or galactic tides. There is speculation of other large planets in this region that may disturb comets in their vicinity, but none have yet been discovered."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the lower range of estimates, the Oort cloud could begin around 1,000 AU from the Sun. If the Oort cloud does begin here, Voyager could reach it in just a few centuries. However, given the sheer scale of the cloud, it will be there for tens of thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Much of interstellar space is actually inside our Solar System," NASA explains. "It will take about 300 years for Voyager 1 to reach the inner edge of the Oort Cloud and possibly about 30,000 years to fly beyond it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the Voyager probes make it through the cloud undamaged (a likely outcome, given that space is not the asteroid-dodging exercise sci-fi would have us believe), they could go on relatively unscathed for many, many years beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, Voyager will not be near any astronomical objects, drifting on its own through the cosmos, far from sources of heat and light. But in 40,000 years, it will get a brief close encounter with another star, coming closer to it than home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It took 35 years to reach interstellar space, but it will take 40,000 years for Voyager 1 to be closer to the star AC +79 3888 than our sun," NASA explains. "Alpha Centauri is the closest star to our own right now, but because stars are moving, Voyager 1 will actually get within 1.7 light years of AC +79 3888 (aka Gliese 445) in 40,000 years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A paper examining the future stellar flybys of probes on an escape velocity from the Solar System puts the figure at more like 44,000 years. Gliese 445 is an M-type main-sequence star with around a third of the mass of our Sun. At the moment, it is around 17,000 light-years from Earth, but by the time the encounter with Voyager happens, it will be around 3.5 light-years away from us. It will not be the spacecraft's final encounter with another star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Statistically, a spacecraft will encounter stars within a given distance at approximately the same rate as the Sun does, which Bailer-Jones et al. [...] inferred to be one star within 1 pc every 50 kyr," the study explains, adding that more-distant encounters are difficult to predict due to uncertainty in the data. "This rate scales quadratically with encounter distance (i.e. one star within 0.1 pc every 5 Myr [million years]). As the spacecraft are not leaving the Galaxy, it is inevitable that the spacecraft will pass much closer to some stars on longer timescales."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the team was able to predict the closest approach that Voyager will have in the not-too-distant future, astronomically speaking. They found that the spacecraft will encounter TYC 3135-52-1, a main-sequence star, in around 303,000 years. At this point, it will be around 0.965 light-years from the star, so still quite wide of it. Looking at the data, it is unlikely Voyager 1 will be captured by a star any time soon, and will continue to drift through the cosmos with only the Golden Records for company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The timescale for the collision of a spacecraft with a star is of order 1020 years," the team concludes, "so the spacecraft have a long future ahead of them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;Louisiana Took Months To Sound Alarm Amid Whooping Cough Outbreak&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When there’s an outbreak of a vaccine-preventable disease, state health officials typically take certain steps to alert residents and issue public updates about the growing threat. That’s standard practice, public health and infectious disease experts told KFF Health News and NPR. The goal is to keep as many other vulnerable people as possible from getting sick and to remind the public about the benefits of vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But in Louisiana this year, public health officials appeared to have not followed that playbook during the state’s worst whooping cough outbreak in 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whooping cough, also called pertussis, is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable disease that’s particularly dangerous for the youngest infants. It can cause vomiting and trouble breathing, and serious infections can lead to pneumonia, seizures, and, rarely, death.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Madison Flake, a pediatric resident in Baton Rouge, cared for a baby who was hospitalized during this year’s outbreak. Less than 2 months old, he was sent to the intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“He would have these bouts of very dramatic coughing spells,” Flake said. “He would stop breathing for several seconds to almost a minute.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infants are not eligible for their first pertussis vaccine until they are 2 months old, but they can acquire immunity if the mother is immunized while pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By late January, two babies had died in Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But the Louisiana Department of Health waited two months to send out a social media post suggesting people talk to their doctors about getting vaccinated. The department took even longer to issue a statewide health alert to physicians, send out a press release, or hold a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That lag is not typical, according to Georges Benjamin, the executive director of the American Public Health Association.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Particularly for these childhood diseases, we usually jump all over these,” said Benjamin, a physician who has led health departments in Maryland and Washington, D.C. “These are preventable diseases and preventable deaths.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because infectious diseases spread exponentially, if officials don’t alert the public quickly, they lose a key chance to prevent further infections, said Abraar Karan, an instructor at Stanford University who has worked on covid and mpox outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Time is perhaps one of the most important currencies that you have,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because pertussis vaccine immunity wanes over time, cases can ebb and flow. But in September 2024, Louisiana health officials started seeing a “substantial” increase in whooping cough cases, part of a national trend.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In late January, physicians at one Louisiana hospital warned their colleagues that two infants had died in the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On Feb. 13, the state’s surgeon general, Ralph Abraham, sent a memo to staff ending the general promotion of vaccines and community vaccine events.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;He sent that email a few hours after Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist, won Senate confirmation as the new secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also that day, Abraham posted a public memo on the state health department’s website. In it, he said public health has overstepped with vaccine recommendations, driven by “a one-size-fits-all, collectivist mentality.” Abraham has called Covid vaccines “dangerous” and been a vocal supporter of Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Four days later, in response to a request from WVUE Fox 8 News in New Orleans, the Louisiana Department of Health in an email confirmed the deaths of two infants from whooping cough for the first time. WVUE published the news on Feb. 20.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But Louisiana’s health department sent out no alerts, according to a review of external and internal communications by NPR and KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the next month, two more infants were hospitalized for whooping cough, according to internal health department emails obtained through a public records request.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In March, after inquiries from NPR and KFF Health News about the growing number of pertussis cases, the department put out its first social media communications about the outbreak and offered interviews to other journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then on May 1 — at least three months after the second infant death — the health department issued what appears to be its first and so far only official alert to physicians. It put out its first press release the next day and then held a news conference about pertussis on May 14.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By then, 42 people had been hospitalized for whooping cough since the outbreak began, three-quarters of whom were not up to date on their whooping cough immunizations, according to the Louisiana Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than two-thirds of those hospitalized were babies under the age of 1.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout the summer, pertussis cases continued to climb in Louisiana. But there were no further public communications from the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NPR and KFF Health News contacted the department for comment on Sept. 25. Emma Herrock, a spokesperson, did not answer specific questions about the lack of communications but referred to a Sept. 30 post on X by the state surgeon general.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the post, Abraham said the department “consistently reported cases of pertussis and provided guidance to help residents stay protected” in 2025. He called the pertussis vaccine “one of the least controversial” and said he recommends it to his patients.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The X post included a year-by-year graphic of pertussis cases that omitted 2024 and 2025. The post also provided a more specific timeframe for when the infant deaths occurred — one in late 2024 and the other in early 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Louisiana should have started warning the public within days of the first infant’s death instead of waiting months, said Stanford’s Karan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“At minimum,” he said, “it should be like heavy promotion of: ‘Hey, infants are at high risk. They get infected by people who have waning immunity. If you haven’t gotten vaccinated, get vaccinated. If you have these symptoms, get tested.’”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deaths from a vaccine-preventable illness are tragic, but they can also serve as an opportunity to educate the public about the benefits of vaccines and try to save lives, said Joshua Sharfstein, a former Maryland health secretary and now a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The risk of pertussis is always there, but when you have two infant deaths it’s a really good opportunity to communicate that this is a real threat to the health of children,” Sharfstein said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Karan said that by not acting more quickly, the Louisiana Department of Health may have set itself up for a worse outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Because then what we see is this train wreck thereafter, of like an insanely large outbreak, a lot of hospitalizations,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As of Sept. 20, the most recent date for which data is available, Louisiana had counted 387 cases of whooping cough in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In data going back to 1990, the previous high was 214 cases, in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Until the Sept. 30 post on X, the Louisiana Department of Health did not appear to put out any public communications about pertussis over the preceding four months, though hospitalizations continued and case levels surpassed the 2013 levels.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The health department should be responding aggressively and consistently, said Joseph Bocchini, the president of the Louisiana Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Health officials should make sure “people are updated on a regular basis and reminded of what needs to be done,” he said. “Get your vaccines. Moms, if you’re pregnant, get vaccinated. And if you have a cough illness, see your doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Benjamin, with the American Public Health Association, said the ongoing goal of public health communication is to prevent the next hospitalization or death.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The bottom line is, it’s not too late,” he said. “It’s not too late to be much more aggressive and proactive about dealing with pertussis.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;12 November 2025&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Posted by Matthew Forsythe Director - Product Management, Android App Safety&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We recently announced new developer verification requirements, which serve as an additional layer of defense in our ongoing effort to keep Android users safe. We know that security works best when it accounts for the diverse ways people use our tools. This is why we announced this change early: to gather input and ensure our solutions are balanced. We appreciate the community's engagement and have heard the early feedback – specifically from students and hobbyists who need an accessible path to learn, and from power users who are more comfortable with security risks. We are making changes to address the needs of both groups.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To understand how these updates fit into our broader mission, it is important to first look at the specific threats we are tackling.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why verification is important&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keeping users safe on Android is our top priority. Combating scams and digital fraud is not new for us — it has been a central focus of our work for years. From Scam Detection in Google Messages to Google Play Protect and real-time alerts for scam calls, we have consistently acted to keep our ecosystem safe.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, online scams and malware campaigns are becoming more aggressive. At the global scale of Android, this translates to real harm for people around the world – especially in rapidly digitizing regions where many are coming online for the first time. Technical safeguards are critical, but they cannot solve for every scenario where a user is manipulated. Scammers use high-pressure social engineering tactics to trick users into bypassing the very warnings designed to protect them.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, a common attack we track in Southeast Asia illustrates this threat clearly. A scammer calls a victim claiming their bank account is compromised and uses fear and urgency to direct them to sideload a "verification app" to secure their funds, often coaching them to ignore standard security warnings. Once installed, this app — actually malware — intercepts the victim's notifications. When the user logs into their real banking app, the malware captures their two-factor authentication codes, giving the scammer everything they need to drain the account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While we have advanced safeguards and protections to detect and take down bad apps, without verification, bad actors can spin up new harmful apps instantly. It becomes an endless game of whack-a-mole. Verification changes the math by forcing them to use a real identity to distribute malware, making attacks significantly harder and more costly to scale. We have already seen how effective this is on Google Play, and we are now applying those lessons to the broader Android ecosystem to ensure there is a real, accountable identity behind the software you install.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supporting students and hobbyists&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We heard from developers who were concerned about the barrier to entry when building apps intended only for a small group, like family or friends. We are using your input to shape a dedicated account type for students and hobbyists. This will allow you to distribute your creations to a limited number of devices without going through the full verification requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Empowering experienced users&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While security is crucial, we’ve also heard from developers and power users who have a higher risk tolerance and want the ability to download unverified apps.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Based on this feedback and our ongoing conversations with the community, we are building a new advanced flow that allows experienced users to accept the risks of installing software that isn't verified. We are designing this flow specifically to resist coercion, ensuring that users aren't tricked into bypassing these safety checks while under pressure from a scammer. It will also include clear warnings to ensure users fully understand the risks involved, but ultimately, it puts the choice in their hands. We are gathering early feedback on the design of this feature now and will share more details in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting started with early access&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re excited to start inviting developers to the early access for developer verification in Android Developer Console for developers that distribute exclusively outside of Play, and will share invites to the Play Console experience soon for Play developers. We are looking forward to your questions and feedback on streamlining the experience for all developers.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Watch our video below for a walkthrough of the new Android Developer Console experience and see our guides for more details and FAQs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are committed to working with you to keep the ecosystem safe while getting this right.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h1"&gt;£220 ‘for a cut-up sock' - Apple's new iPhone Pocket ridiculed online&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple has faced a wave of online mockery following its announcement of a new carrying case for its iPhone range.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US tech giant was ridiculed after it revealed the iPhone Pocket on Tuesday would retail for £219.95, despite it being little more than a novel way to carry a mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many took aim at the high price online, while others made fun of its striking likeness to a piece of everyday knitted footwear - with one X user calling it "$230 for a cut up sock".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And the popular tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee said it was a "litmus test" for fans who "buy or defend anything Apple releases".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a press release, Apple said the brightly-coloured accessory was part of a limited edition range created in collaboration with the Japanese fashion label Issey Miyake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The late fashion designer previously worked with the tech firm to create the black turtleneck jumpers famously worn by the company's co-founder Steve Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apple said the product had been inspired by "a piece of cloth", and its concept came from "the idea of creating an additional pocket".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bag's short strap design will be available in eight colours, and the long strap in three colours.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;head rend="h2"&gt;'Limits of loyalty'&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The announcement drew criticism on social media, with many suggesting it showed Apple fans would "pay for anything".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bag's open top and sock-like structure also caught flak, with one X user saying: "no zip, no structure and considering how many thefts of iPhones there are these days... no security?"&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And some even posted tongue-in-cheek pictures of the actor Sasha Baron Cohen as the fictional character Borat, suggesting the product bore similarity to his bright green mankini.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But others came to its defence, pointing out the price could be because of the collaboration with Issey Miyake, calling it "a nod to the history of Apple".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Social media consultant and analyst Matt Navara told the BBC the price tag looked to be less about "function" but more about "form, branding and exclusivity".&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"This kind of pricing is not new in the world of luxury fashion or designer collabs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"But for most consumers, it feels like Apple is testing the limits of brand loyalty."&lt;/p&gt;
